Screen: Discretion at 39 in Sautet's 'Simple Story':The Cast,https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/10/archives/screen-discretion-at-39-in-sautets-simple-storythe-cast.html,"Largely because of the late, great, immortal Jack Benny, I can't hear someone say he's 39 without grinning in comic anticipation. No one, as Mr. Benny taught us, is ever seriously, certifiably 39. Being 39 is a joke, a vain attempt to stop time.This may explain part (though not all) of my skepticism about ""A Simple Story"" (""Une Histoire Simple""), a serious new film by Claude Sautet, the writer-director of, among other films, ""The Things of Life,"" ""Cesar and Rosalie"" and ""Vincent, François, Paul and the Others.""""A Simple Story"" is not a simple story, but there all irony ends. It is, instead, the discreetly poignant, mixed-up story of Marie who, at 39, must reexamine her life, the choices already made and those still to be faced. Marie is said to be a successful industrial designer, and though we see her looking very serious behind an easel, we never know what she is designing, as if that would be in some way indiscreet.We learn that Marie is 39 in discreet fashion — in the course of an interview with the doctor who's going to perform an abortion for Marie. This is a discreetly sad scene, and also a little unreal because Marie is played by Romy Schneider, a stunningly beautiful woman who is in her 40's but whose face suggests neither youth nor age but supernatural agelessness.Marie is vaguely discontented. Her 16-year-old son is growing up and away from her, as she knows he should, and she's in the process of splitting up with her lover Serge (Claude Brasseur), a foolish, weak man who doesn't measure up to Marie's ankles.Though we don't really believe it for a minute, Marie will grow old one day, and this has begun to haunt her. She knows there must be more to life than this, which is mainly what ""A Simple Story"" is all about. Because Mr. Sautet makes movies that are nothing if not discreetly realistic, we know that not much will have changed by the time Marie has weathered this particular crisis, except that she'll have grown up in some way that is photogenic but discreetly vague.Discretion, as you may have gathered by this time, is the operative word in Sautet films, which are hugely successful in France but which, with the exception of ""Vincent, François, Paul and the Others,"" tend to leave me unmoved and unconvinced. When I'm feeling depressed, I'm perfectly willing to admit that I've become too jaded by the rough-and-tumble of American films to respond to the subtleties of the Sautet work. When all is well, as right this minute, I'm convinced that Mr. Sautet's films are as empty, as I suspect, though they are attractively acted and mounted and sometimes unexpectedly cinematic in style.In the course of ""A Simple Story,"" there are lots of jolly get-togethers among Marie and her female friends, and among Marie and her female friends with their lovers and husbands. There are good times and bad on weekends in lovely country houses, happy-sad after-work drinks in favorite cafes, lovers' quarrels, discreet love scenes and one suicide. Marie and her ex-husband Georges (Bruno Cremer) have a brief affair, but the affair is an after-dinner brandy, not the introduction to a new meal. Food, its preparation and consumption, plays an important part in Sautet films.""A Simple Story,"" which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse, is a pretty movie, extremely well acted but anesthetizing. Mr. Sautet treats his characters as if they were gods, not (heaven knows) because they are powerful but because they are without connections to anything else. The world of his films is exactly the world seen by these people. There is nothing outside the movie frame.In serious movies, even if the scale is small and the method comic, we are aware of some larger scheme of things into which the characters fit. The people in ""A Simple Story,"" for all of the film's middle-class realism, are like the people in television commercials. They are contemporary myths. The Cast A SIMPLE STORY, directed by Claude Sautet; screenplay (French with English subtitles) by Mr. Sautet and Jean-Loup Dabadie; dialogue by Mr. Dabadie; director of photography, Jean Boflety; film editor, Jacqueline Thiedot; music by Philippe Sarde; produced by Alain Sarde; distributed by Quarlet Films.

Screen: 'Blood Feud' By Lina Wertmuller:Three Attitudes,https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/22/archives/screen-blood-feud-by-lina-wertmullerthree-attitudes.html,"IT is high time to wonder why any actress in a Lina Wertmuller film spends so much time spitting, clawing and shrieking at the camera. How can a director arouse such strong passions in her performers and still make her audiences drowsy? Pure exasperation seems to be the key. ""Blood Feud"" is Miss Wertmuller at her worst, which is just a hop, skip and a jump from her best, as far as I can see. Harsh words, perhaps, but then Miss Wertmuller makes hysterical movies. It's hard to respond generously to a harangue.""Blood Feud,"" which opens today at the Plaza, turns Sophia Loren into a harpy. That cannot have been easy. Otherwise, the film's accomplishments are muddled and minimal. Miss Loren plays a shrill Sicilian widow whose husband has been murdered by the town's richest man, soon to become the town's most influential Fascist (the story begins in 1920 and spans several years). Then she becomes involved with two other men, a socialist lawyer (Marcello Mastroianni) and a gangster who has gone to America and come back with a few phrases of English and a Victrola (Giancarlo Giannini). She winds up loving them both, but it takes quite a while for her to discover this, and meanwhile there is a lot of screaming.Miss Wertmuller, who fills the screen with messy camerawork and gorgeous scenery, presents three attitudes instead of three characters. This is by no means as simple as it sounds, because the attitudes aren't clearly rendered and they shift like the sands. But the gangster tends to be bad, although he is brave, which is useful. And the socialist tends to be good, although his helplessness doesn't help. The woman is clearly a heroine, because she defies the law to perform abortions. The men are terribly sexist about sex, which is a great big suprise for us all.""Blood Feud"" stays talky for a while, then builds to a number of action scenes that are staged almost comically, as if they were slapstick. The most remarkable thing in the film is a Greek temple in the Sicilian countryside, where sheep are seen grazing. The temple is also seen in a painting on someone's wall, and the sheep reappear periodically. So many characters turn up in black shirts by the story's doctrinaire ending that the sheep might well have been expected to saunter by in similar outfits. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Three Attitudes BLOOD FEUD, written and directed by Lina Wertmuller; director of photography, Tonino Delli Colli; film editor, Franco Fraticelli; music by Dangio and Nando De Luca; produced by Harry Colombo; released by Associated Film Distribution; Italian with English subtitles.

Agencies Unprepared for Soaring Number of Adolescents in Need,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/03/archives/agencies-unprepared-for-soaring-number-of-adolescents-in-need.html,"Adolescents, some of them with criminal records, many of them with severe behavioral problems, and educationally handicapped, are “wandering the streets” because, over the years, little or no notice was taken of the changing youth population pattern, and its concomitant needs, in the foster care program. “The system failed to recognize some new realities,” said Henry Saltzman, executive director of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York. “Adolescents are a larger share of the total population of children today than they have been in some time,” he said. “Historically, large numbers of adolescents means problems—more delinquency, more crime, more exploratory behavior in drugs and gang activities.” Mr. Saltzman, and other men and women engaged in the child welfare and foster care field, attribute many of the current problems to an almost inflexible funding system, based primarily on the needs of younger children who require 24‐hour care. As of June, 1974, 40.6 per cent of the children in foster care in New York City, were 12 years old and over. This compared with 36 per cent in June, 1972. Last month, 46.7 per. cent of the applicants awaiting care were over 12 years of age. Those in the field also believe that the shortage of facilities and adequate programs for adolescents can be traced to a lack of planning on all sides. “Planning is a bad word,” Mr. Saltzman commented. “We react to crisis.” ‘Little Analysis’ “We should predict better,” said Barbara Blum, director of‐the metropolitan office of the New York State Board of Social Welfare. “We end up browbeating ourselves over issues that could have been handled more sensibly … very little analysis was done on the very high birth rate of the nineteen‐fifties, and on the changing population in foster care.” She noted that in slightly more than two decades, the number of black youngsters in New York under 18 years of age, had tripled. The number of Puerto Rican youngsters, in the same age category, had quadrupled. “These children tend to be the poorest, and the most likely to come into care,” she said. The need to check out “what's happening in society,” was stressed by Carol Parry, assistant commissioner, of the Department of Social Services of the City of Now York. Disturbed Children “Why are all these older children coming to us now for the first time?” she asked. “Why are more parents bringing PINS (Persons in Need of Supervision) petitions? Something very wrong is going on. Children seem more disturbed to us. It's very wonrisome because in the last three or four years, there's been a definite trend in this direction. The number of homicides by children is increasing. We have a group of much more disturbed and difficult children on our hands that somehow we are not coping with early enough.” Need Group Homes Miss Parry stated that many adolescents entering care for the first time could not go into foster homes. “It's a different ballgarne,” she said. “It won't work … their emotional problems with their own parents would just be repeated with another set of parents.” The requirements of older children are, according to many experts, an increasing number of group homes, where youngsters would be confronted with group living, group standards and group peer pressure, development of day programs to help youngsters who might still be able to live in their own homes, and retraining of staffs now equipped to handle only the problems of younger children. “Many of the present staffs are not ready to grapple with the behavior of these adolescents, a number of whom are angry and street‐wise and much more difficult,” Mr. Saltzman said. “The bulk of adolescents who are disturbed, and a serious jeopardy to themselves and the community, are wandering the streets. There aren't enough facilities to cope with them.” Although the city now has more than 28,000 children in care, a 53.4 per cent increase since 1960, there has, for some years, been a declining rate in the number of young children. “It's like the public schools getting caught by surprise,” said Joseph Gavrin, executive director of the New York State Council of Voluntary Child Care Agencies, a membership group of 115 voluntary agencies. Flexibility Needed “I don't think anyone foresaw four things,” he added. “Few realized the impact of contraception, of the ready availability of abortion, of the change in standards, so that girls now keep babies born out of wedlock, rather than giving them up, and the impact of community action programs that enabled a number of people to continue to care for their children in their own homes.” The proportionate increase in the adolescent care population and the resulting need for more flexibility constitute one of the areas now under serious consideration by the New York State Department of Social Services. “There is general recognition of this as a problem area that ought to be dealt with,” said Abe Lavine, the commissioner. “Children's services have a high priority, and we will be looking toward legislative and/or administrative ways of providing greater flexibility … we would like to give caseworkers a full range of options in treating children and their problems.” Child care programs are paid for by Federal, state and city funds, but there is no constant in the percentage contributed by each. The amount varies according to the program. It is estimated that over‐all, the Federal Government pays 40 per cent of child care costs, and the city and state divide the remaining 60 per cent. Funding Problems A big part of the problem, according to Mr. Gavrin of the Council of Voluntary Child Care Agencies, is the multiplicity of financial routes. “Even the bureaucrats can't manipulate funding the way it should be done,” he said. Douglas Besharov, executive director of a State Assembly Committee on Child Abuse, believes that almost any deficiency is likely to get lost in the system, as it now exists. “There's a mish‐mash of agencies, there's no clear authority or responsibility of services in the state,” he said. “Kids don't fit into little categories but, in the state, the mental health system doesn't relate to the court system which doesn't relate to the child welfare system which doesn't relate to the foster care system. Systems Don't Mesh “Our systems were designed as if kids had one problem,” he added. “The systems don't mesh. When you combine anything in an agency, you get a lot of bureaus that still don't talk to one another.” Mr. Besharov has drafted legislation that would provide for an inspector general to advocate for children caught within the various separate systems, and an advisory board. “There should be someone with jurisdiction over all services, public and private, that relate to children and families,” he said. “Problems may arise because of what parents are doing or not doing … but they also arise after we get our claws on children … many of these kids spend their lives going from one unfortunate situation to another.” Mr. Gavrin also believes in the desirability of an over‐all authority in planning for all children. “I think the State Board of Social Welfare should have body within it that would have the task of assessing the total needs of children … and do statewide projections,” he said. “The entire system now encourage groups to go out for themselves and to think only of the children they are interested in.” “There are lots of children who fall between the cracks,” noted Miss Parry of the city's Social Services Department. She and others commented particularly on the policy of the State Department of Mental Hygiene which, she said, “will not take care of any child they think can function on any level in the community.” Alternate Services “We don't feel a child should be institutionalized if it can be helped,” Miss Parry said. “But if the child is released, there should be alternate services and facilities … the child shouldn't be pushed into no‐care. These children are being pushed into a child welfare system which can't adequately care for them.” While admitting that the system “leaves much to be desired” and that mistakes are made, Harold Wolfe of the State Department of Mental Hygiene said he thought the department had been made a scapegoat by other elements in the child welfare system. “I doubt whether our policies, our plans, our practice play as big a role as some critics claim … because many of these children share something that this department can't do anything about by itself … they not only happen to be in state facilities but they also happen to be poor, and poor people usually get poor service of all kinds.” “We need a crossover of systems,” said James O'Neill, executive director of the Catholic Guardians Society of New York. “If I were king, I'd attempt to bring everything under one roof. We need more flexibility, as well as accountability. We should be able to give a child the program that is best for him, without someone saying that it isn't in the rules. I may be too dramatic, but if anyone followed the rules really strictly, we couldn't operate at all.”"
PARENTS/CHILDREN,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/03/archives/parentschildren-rocky-road-from-foster-care-to-adoption.html,"At this very instant, Mr. and Mrs. P. are frightened, as they have been for years. They are afraid that, if they make one mistake, utter a single complaint, the agency that 10 years ago entrusted them with an infant girl named L. will find a pretext to take her from them before they get the chance to adopt her. “There is always that fear in the back of your mind,” Mr. P. said the other day as he sat in the den of his suburban split‐level. “We get sick about it.” Mr. and Mrs. P. are at once the beneficiaries and the victims of changes that are sweeping through the foster care system. They agreed to care for L. a decade ago, because they thought it would be a nice thing to do, and they won't deny that the $120 they received each month from the agency was welcome—Mr. P. was not yet near the $20,000 a year he now earns. They understood back then” that foster parents were not supposed to get too attached to their child—certainly they were not to entertain thoughts of adopting her—because the essence of fostering was its temporary nature. They had a job to do: They were supposed to give L. the benefits of home life and be prepared to relinquish her to her real mother whenever that became practicable. As is often true in foster care, it never did become practicable. L.'s mother, ill and unmarried, has seen her child only eight or nine times, and not at all in the last two and a half years. And Mr. and Mrs. P. had learned early that as foster parents they were failures: L. hadn't been in their home three weeks before they found themselves falling in love with her. “How can you take a child into your home and not give love? It isn't normal. It isn't right,” Mrs. P. said, recalling those early years. L. was 3 when Mr. and Mrs. P. learned that the agency's policy was changing, to permit foster parents to adopt. But their social worker—they have had many over the years, some of whom they've liked, others they've disliked and feared—said that the mother was not yet ready to surrender rights to her child. Years passed and the P.'s were more hopeful and more nervous. In 1970, a state law was enacted that required the family court to study the cases of children whose parents had voluntarily placed them in foster care. The review, intended to determine whether a child should remain in the system, be freed for adoption or returned to the parents, was to take place every 24 months. The reviews—15,000 of them in the city involving more than half of the children in foster care—did not begin until 1972. And L.'s case came up a year ago December. At the review both the court and the agency agreed that L.'s mother had demonstrated no likelihood of responsibly reclaiming her child. The judge told the agency to formally petition the court to sever the biological mother's ties to the child by midsummer. Mr. and Mrs. P. were jubilant, and L. recalls now that the decision made her “happy, very happy.” L., like many others, has been confused about her parents. In a letter to her mother she wrote: “How is Daddy? … will you tell him I love him? Well, the reason I asked you is because I haven't seen him since I was born.” But she seems eager to be adopted, partly because it would reduce the uncertainty of who she is. Despite the eagerness of the foster family, the agency has not complied with the court's timetable. It has not yet filed the petition for adoption. When the P.'s asked their latest social worker for an explanation, he told them, “There's a lot of paper work, a backlog of cases, you're not the only ones waiting.” He said it would be another three months before the paper work was cleared up. But Mr. and Mrs. P. don't believe it. They see the court action as a hoax that raised their hopes falsely and left them in more despair than ever. “It hasn't done anything for us,” Mr. P. said, shaking his head. But maybe it will. The problem is that Mr. and Mrs. P. are caught up in a tumultuous time for the foster care system. There has been increasing concern over the number of children permanently relegated to this “temporary” system —the average stay in “long‐term” care is four years, but many stay much longer. There is also concern over what some see as the inadequate monitoring of the system. (Eight‐five per cent of the city's foster care children are in programs run by 80 or so private agencies; the remaining youngsters are in the “boarding home program” of the city or in public shelters.) An early indication of changing attitudes was the state's adoption subsidy program, which gave foster families who relied on the monthly check the chance to continue receiving one after adoption, if their income fell within certain limits or if the child was handicapped. Critics of the program say it was kept a secret at first, with only 205 such adoptions in the first two years, 1969 and 1970, but by the end of 1973 it involved 1,484 children. Then came the 24‐month review law, which completed its first two years of operation last summer. Under it, the New York City Family Court told child care agencies to initiate proceedings to free 2,250 children for adoption. It said that foster care should be continued for another 3,749 childdren and called for follow‐up information on 4,731, while it ordered 552 children discharged to their biological mothers. Adoption was urged in 824 cases in which the children had already been freed. Other elements of change are not so tangible. For instance, the time is ripe for what could prove to be a productive avenue of approach for prospective adoptive parents. Healthy young children are virtually unavailable for adoption through the city's agencies, in the wake of abortion reform and advanced contraception. (The average age of children referred—that is, available—for adoption has soared from 1 year 8 months in 1970 to 5 years 9 months in 1973). Now some agencies are on the lookout for “pre‐adoptive families” who will take a child into foster care with the understanding that the particular child will likely be freed for adoption. And nearly 7 per cent of the children who enter foster care are under 2; nearly 25 per cent are under 6—although only some of these would fit into the likely‐to‐be‐freed category. The result of all this is that a great many children should no longer be relegated to the limbo of permanent temporariness. But there has been widely expressed dissatisfaction with the course of events. The agencies are proud organizations and some of their members believe that the training of their people makes them the most qualified to judge what is in the best interests of the child—not foster parents or the crowded court. The agencies see undue pressure being put on some foster parents to adopt. They are not necessarily against having cases reviewed— but why in court? They see their staffs bogged down in paper work and hearings instead of, as one agency head put it, “spending time out in the field serving the children.” Many agency people assert that the court it only doing what the agencies would do on their own, but some conceded that the crowded court is speeding up the process. Parents' groups such as the Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform (O.F.F.E.R.) and the Council on Adoptable Children complain that the agencies have been dragging their heels. They point to a funding system that pays agencies largely to operate foster care, less to undertake adoptions and virtually nothing to try to keep the original families together. Some foster parents deeply resent being treated as “second class citizens” subject to what they see as the agencies' arbitrary decisions. Procedures that have been set up to protect them against the caprices of agencies have not made these parents confident, since in their view abuses seem rife. As for the view from the court, Judge Nanette Dembitz said the other day that she felt the 24‐month review had proved valuable. Before it was enacted, she said, “the agencies just weren't moving in the direction of freeing children for adoption.” But she doesn't see any evil intent on the agencies' part in the current widespread delays—simply that “all of a sudden there was a great amount of work in this area.” ‘How is Daddy? Will you tell him I love him? Well, the reason I asked you is because I haven't seen him since I was born.’"
Oregon: a Testing Ground,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/05/archives/oregon-a-testing-ground-mr-mccall-did-well-for-the-state-around-him.html,"SALEM, Ore.,—Tom McCall has wound up the two consecutive terms as Republican Governor of Oregon, that green and rainy corner of the great Northwest. On Jan. 1 he bequeathed to a Democratic successor a state that—environmentally speaking, at least—is in far better shape than he found it. Oregon, in the eight years of Mr. McCall's leadership, has become something of a testing ground for environmental concepts of reduced, rechanneled growth. It has challenged the doctrine of the infinite good of infinite expansion, the spiral of more people, more industry, more pollution. Now Mr. McCall spreading his less‐is‐more message, trying to persuade us that the successes achieved in Oregon, a socially homogeneous, politically middle‐of‐the‐road state, are exportable to the rest of the nation. “I promise everyone, ‘You can do this in your state,’” he told a recent visitor. “The Oregon story is innovative, regenerative. We've reversed the tide of pollution here. We've shown that the future can be made to work. The question isn't ‘Can it be done elsewhere?’ It's ‘Do we have the commitment?’” In one sense, Mr. McCall has been all too successful. Tens of thousands hear the word each year and swarm to the new Promised Land, to the distress of native Oregonians, who think that the present 21 persons per square mile (New York State has 378 per square mile) is just fine, thanks. The influx has given Oregon a growth rate twice that of California. In another sense, the McCall drive against the throwaway society has faltered, if not failed: America on the whole hasn't yet shown much commitment. Take, for instance, Oregon's famous bottle law. In 1972 the state gave the United States a lead in banning those roadside eyesores, the pull‐tab can and the nonreturnable bottle. Henceforth, return deposits were required on all beer and soft‐drink containers. University of Oregon experts say the law has reduced can and bottle litter by nearly 90 per cent, thus saving an annual 385 million throwaways. Oregon's streets and highways are now idyllically clean compared with roads elsewhere. A Matter of ‘Consciousness’ If all Americans followed suit, re‐using or recycling the more than 60 billion cans and bottles they throw away each year, it is estimated that the nation would save enough energy to generate a year's electricity for half a dozen major cities. The fact, however, is that McCall‐style bottle bills have already been defeated or stalled in 40 states, including the two most populous, New York and California, while a Federal measure, sponsored by Oregon Senators Mark Hatfield and Robert Packwood, expired in Congressional committees. Some blame the defeats on strong opposition from industry, but public apathy is also a factor. Mr. McCall shrugs. “It's a matter of raising the national consciousness.” He used to do just that as a television commentator—complaining on the TV screen about environmental damage. Then, in 1966, he was given the opportunity to do something about it, as Governor. “Damn it,” he says, “when I was elected not many people, even in Oregon, believed we'd be able to pull off what we have. In fact, we've passed more ecological bills here in eight years than all the other states have done in 50.” The most striking advance in this crusade was the cleansing of the Willamette River, which had become an open sewer, swirling great rafts of trash through the verdant valley where nearly 70 per cent of the state's 2.2 million people live, It's the heartland of Oregon, a name taken from an Algonquin word meaning “beautiful water.” The state fought a battle with both industry and the unions on this issue, even forcing the Boise Cascade mill in the middle of Salem to close down when it failed to mend its polluting ways. Today, says Mr. McCall. “you can swim the whole length of the Willamette. Why, 30‐pound salmon are breeding there again.” Yet all but one of the old paper mills along the river banks are still operating under the new stringent rules. Other pioneering moves by the Oregon legislature in the McCall years include rechanneling millions of dollars from highway funds into conservation projects such as bicycle trails, banning real estate developers from the magnificent 361‐mile Pacific coast line, clearing away thousands of billboards and liberalizing laws on abortion, homosexuality and marijuana. Of all Oregan's reforms, the one that sticks hardest in industry's craw Is the bottle law. Opponents charge that officials have been “improving” litter statistics by employing more collectors, and that heavy losses have been inflicted on makers of aluminum and steel cans, as well as on retail stores that must cope with an avalanche of returned bottles. Although one Oregon can‐maker did close down, most of its workers found jobs in other fields, and recently the Federal Environmental Protection Agency cheered McCallites with a study naming the returnable bottle as an all‐round winner: It's an energy saver that causes less factory pollution of air and water, consumes less raw material and creates less trash. Governor McCall calls it “a proven antidote to the national disease of overconsumption,” and puts the bottle law at the head of an 82‐item summary of the state's environmental accomplishments."
END OF I.U.D. BAN VIEWED AS PERIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/07/archives/end-of-iud-ban-viewed-as-peril-adviser-scores-fda-over-action-on.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 6—A member of the advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration on intrauterine contraceptive devices has protested the agency's action in ending a moratorium on commercial distribution of one such product, the Dalkon Shield. The committee member said the F.D.A. action circumvented the recommendations of the committee and might needlessly endanger many women. The comments were made in a letter to Dr. Alexander M. Schmidt, commissioner of food and drugs, by Dr. Richard P. Dickey of the Louisiana State University Medical Center. The Dalkon Shield has been one of the most widely used intrauterine contraceptive devices, known generally as I.U.D.'s. A moratorium on commercial distribution of the Dalkon Shield was put into effect last spring because of safety questions that had arisen. The F.D.A. lifted the ban last month after the manufacturer, the A. H. Robins Company, agreed to maintain a registry of all women using the device so that definitive safety data could be obtained. At a news conference here Dec. 20, Dr. Schmidt said he did not believe the agency's action was in conflict with the expert advisory committee recommendations. He said that existence of the registry would allow the agency to collect the data needed to prove whether the shield was safe. In his letter to Dr. Schmidt, Dr. Dickey said the agency's action was contrary to the recommendations of the committee that the moratorium remain in effect until more definitive data on the safety question could be obtained. A total of 14 deaths and 219 septic abortions—those involving infection—have been associated with use of the shield. A copy of Dr. Dickey's letter, which is dated Dec. 31, was obtained by the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington‐based public interest group. Dr. Dickey also sent a letter to each of the six other members of the advisory committee on contraceptive devices, asking those who agreed with his position to write letters to Dr. Schmidt. In answer to a query by telephone today, Dr. Dickey said there had not yet been time for replies to reach him, but that he believed a majority of the panel agreed with him on the issue."

BOSTON JUDGE BACKS ABORTION CASE JURY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/08/archives/boston-judge-backs-abortion-case-jury.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 7 (UPI)—An’ objection that women had not been equally considered for the grand jury that indicted a doctor for manslaughter in the death of an aborted fetus was overruled today. The case could produce a potential landmark decision on the viability of a fetus and when it becomes entitled to legal protection, a key issue that was unresolved in the United States Supreme Court's 1973 decision on the constitutionality of abortion statutes. Suffolk Superior Court Judge James P. Mc Guire, in a closed session, dismissed defense objections that the grand jury that had indicted Dr. Kenneth Edelin, 36 years old, was Inv constitutional because women were not equally included in the selection process. Dr. Edelin, chief resident in obstetrics at Boston City Hospital in October, 1973, the time of the alleged crime, is charged with manslaughter for allegedly killing a fetus 24 to 28 weeks old, the period undefined by the Supreme Court.

JURY IS EP4PANELED IN ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/10/archives/jury-is-empaneled-in-abortion-case.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 9 (UPI) — A jury of 13 men and three women was empaneled today to hear evidence in the trial of a physician charged with manslaughter in connection with an abortion he performed at the Boston City Hospital. Final pretrial arguments were scheduled to be heard before opening arguments tomorrow. Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, 36 years old and the chief resident obstetrician at the hospital, is charged with the manslaughter of a “baby boy” as the result of an abortion in 1973. The prosecution alleges that the fetus was 24‐28 weeks old and could have lived outside the mother's womb. The trial is expected to take at least a month and to involve questions including when a fetus is “viable”—capable of independent life—and what responsibility a physician has to the fetus in an abortion. These questions and others in the Edelin case were not covered by the 1973 United States supreme court decision on abortions."

Wiiiiam P. Homans, the delense attorney, said that the “baby” never was born, and there could be no manslaughter inVolving a fetus.

After I had delivered a lecture in a West Coast city, the asked to speak to me about her nine‐year‐old son. “He's been afraid of grown men, even his teacher,” she said, “ever since he saw a man rape a boy on the ‘Marcus Welby’ show.” She added, “I'm very careful of what I let him watch on TV. Nothing on `Mazcus Welby’ has ever upset him before.” Rape has been a popular prime‐time subject this past year. “Kojak” fashioned its first episode of the season around the theme. “Police Woman” devoted two programs to the topic. “Adam‐12” focused on a 13‐year‐old rape victim in one of its episodes. And then there was the world premiere of the two‐hour made‐for‐TV movie “Born Innocent,” featuring the rape of a 14‐year‐old virgin in a juvenile detention home by a gang of girls using a broomstick. After “Born Innocent,” local stations were inundated by thousands of protesting phone calls and letters. Some objected to the subject matter, others to the fact that the film was shown at a time when youngsters are watching (8 P.M. here on the East Coast; 7 P.M. in the centre. time zone). If the complaints were. greater than usual, so was the audience. Forty million people watched the movie for the full two hours. Some of them, at least, were hungry for adult fare that dealt with real social problems. “Born Innocent” realistically portrayed conditions in a girls juvenile detention home. Sex too has been moving into prime time. Viewers have been exposed to pimps and prostitutes on “The Streets of San Francisco,” to impotence on “All in the Family,” to an abortion on “Maude.” Talk shows have candidly discussed venereal disease, adultery and unwed motherhood. And, of course, violence still fills TV's prime‐time offerings. After dinner, children have only to sit and watch to see life as expendable, on such programs as “Mod Squad,” “Hogan's Heroes,” “Hawaii Five‐0,” “Get Christie Love” and “The Rookies.” On a recent “Mod Squad” program a man was dynamited out of a car even before the credits were shown. Not long ago a psychopathic killer and the heroes of “The Rookies” turned a football field into a mass‐murder and maiming area. The producers of “The Rookies” know very well who's watching; they capitalize on their juvenile audience by selling “Rookie” dolls. Here is the dilemma television faces. Its audience is the family. Can it provide programs to please all, from Junior to Dad to Grandma, without offending any? Is this technological giant, with its great potential for art, entertainment, education and social comment, to be relegated to the role of an inoffensive babysitter just because there are babies in the living room? Richard Wiley, head of the Federal Communications Commission, recently suggested that programs for adults should be aired after 9 o'clock in the evening. I agree that this would solve a good many problems. But not all. What about a series that is locked into an earlier time slot? Is it to be denied the right to deal with real‐life subjects? Arthur Taylor, president of CBS, has proposed that the first hour of prime time each evening should be devoted to programs suitable for family viewing, and that when programs that might offend are shown at this time, prior notice should be given on the air. (Just this week NBC announced that beginning next September the first hour of its prime‐time programing would be geared to a general family audience.) I applaud both these proposals, but I feel that they don't go far enough. And I think I have a solution a way that we can protect children without sacrificing adult entertainment. It's simple. It should be acceptable both the industry and the public. And it's needed. I would propose a TV rating system similar to that used by.the movies. The movie rating system has come for a lot of criticism, mostly by movie makers who feel their pictures have been placed in the wrong categories. Surveys show, however, that parents find the ratings helpful in choosing movies for their children. Dr. Joyce Brothers is a psychologist, newspaper and magazine columnist, and radio and TV news commentator. From my conversations with parents around the country, I am convinced that they would welcome TV ratings too. Something simple that would show them at a glance, when they consulted TV Guide or newspaper listings, which programs would be safe for their children to watch, which might be unsuitable. I ‘think the form the rating system takes is not as important as its existence. My own iecommendation'would be for the designations “G,” “A,” “P”—”GAP”—a reminder that far from being a censoring system this is a method of bridging the generation gap in the TV audience, a way of presenting programs suitable and attractive to both ‘children and adults, even a way of getting television over the gap from where it is today to the place it might be. “G” would denote programs for the general audience, children included. It would guarantee that the subject matter was not too mature for the young viewer and that the episode did not contain unnecessary or unusual violence. “A” would alert viewers to a program meant for adults only. “P” stands for parents and would indicate a program that children might watch but preferably with a parent or another adult. To my mind, “P” is an especially important category. Several studies have shown that children are less frightened by program content if they are watching with an adult. Even some dramatic specials (”Jane Eyre” and “The Count of Monte Cristo,” fOr instance) can be quite threatening'to children. Yet youngSters should not be denied the right to watch these significant bits of their literary heritage, nor should they be kept on a diet of television pap. The “P” category will allow parents to arrange their own television time so that they can watch with their children when their presence will be comforting. They can also study their children's reactions to unusual programs, and share and discuss an experience that may help close their generation gap. This could be particularly important in the sexual area, where television is posing problems that many parents have found difficult to talk about with their children7‐and about which many teenagers have been afraid to consult their parents. The question of who will make and enforce the ratings is an important one. I think the industry itself should do so, at least until it proves itself unable or unwilling to act in this capacity. I doubt that that will happen. The pressure for action has been mounting for 10 years. Three Congressional committees are currently badgering the Federal Communications Commission to investigate the networks. The FCC, fearful of budget cuts, is threatening public hearings. The networks realize that they must make some concessions or risk Government intervention on behalf of an unhappy public. A workable rating system would be one that the networks could live with and the public could rely upon. In newspaper TV listings and advertisements, and on the screen before and during the program itself, viewers would be able to see how many programs in prime time were “General” and how many “Adult.” It would give them the knowledge with which to protest the presence of unsuitable material in children's viewing time. Change could result as viewers protested to networks, stations, sponsors and their representatives in Washington. Change would result faster as they stopped watching or letting their children watch programs in the wrong time slot, heavy on unnecessary violence or explicit sex. TV programers would then be forced to realize that profits come not from advertisers but from viewers. Instead of trying to grab audiences with violence, TV producers might start trying to develop a whole new spectrum of honest, original, imaginative programing. That would be a whole new experience for everybody."
"Communists to the left, Gaullists to the right, grandeur behind, chaos ahead",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/12/archives/communists-to-the-left-gaullists-to-the-right-grandeur-behind-chaos.html,"PARIS. The inauguration day story in Le Monde began with a quotation from Goethe: “On this day and at this place a new era began.” The quote comes from the battle of Valmy in 1792 when the French revolutionary army defeated the Prussians and saved the Revolution, but it gives an idea of what Frenchmen were expecting of their new President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the first non‐Gaullist President of the Fifth French Republic. Only days before, on May 19, Giscard had edged veteran Socialist Francois Mitterrand in the election (he beat Gaullist Jacques ChabanDelmas in the primary two weeks before that) and proved that France was not condemned forever to the extremes of Gaullism or leftism. Just as for the nation after Valmy, expectations soared. “Kennedy style may be 10 years old,” commented Le Monde, “but it is new to France,” At 48, Giscard became the youngest directly elected President in French history, and on inauguration day delighted the people by breaking all traditions, discarding tails, medals and limousine for a stroll down the Champs Elyses shaking hands, waving, hatless in the Paris sun, a man who—a collaborator would later say—”loves his work, loves being President” and, the ultimate cliché, “est vraiment bien dans sa peau.” But six months later, at the end of November, poll showed that Giscard had only 48 per cent of France's popular support, under 50 per cent for the first time; it showed that 77 per cent of the people believed France heading toward economic and social disaster and that only 32 per cent thought Giscard able to deal with it. A December poll showed that Mitterrand would beat him in new election, 53 to 47 per cent. Much of the press, now virulently anti‐Giscard, is openly regretting Mitterrand's loss. The honeymoon had been barely longer than Kennedy's before the Bay of Pigs. The comparison should end there. Kennedy had time to recover from his fiasco. Giscard is faced with a powerful Socialist‐Communist alliance that missed power by a whisker in May and is readying for the next attempt. Though divisions in that alliance have broken out, its leaders must wonder if missing out was not fortunate. The French left James 0. Goldsborough is European correspondent for the Paris‐based International Herald Tribune. now stands back, clucking its tongue, waiting for Giscard and his Government policies to fall flat, so it can step in and show that only the rigors of Marxist‐Leninist analysis can save the West from decay and catastrophe. It is the picture that haunts Henry Kissinger. What happened? Despite a great start, France has slipped back into what the French call morosite. Strikes, austerity programs, rising prices, unemployment, scarcity, insecurity, disintegration of the Common Market, Arabs, Israelis, oil, bad weather, a thousand things are happening to make Frenchmen pessimistic. Even the Beaujolais nouveau is mediocre this year and costs too much. There is nary a glimmer of light on the horizon. The young technocrats around Giscard shake their heads and wonder if angst doesn't run deeper in the Gallic psyche than in that of their Germanic neighbors. If there is any theme to the discontent it would be unemployment. France always has been a full employment nation, with inflation be damned. Giscard's agreement last summer with German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to bring their two economies into line has led him to take austerity measures that clearly have scared his work‐oriented countrymen, and it has become Giscard's greatest political danger. Giscard's recent measures providing massive Government help to the ailing automobile industry and substantial insurance for the unemployed have been well received, but the malaise persists. There is a quite distinct feeling now that the Socialist‐Communist left, with its neat program for nationalizations, planned economy and chickens for every pot could somehow better control things than Giscard with his potion of Adam Smith, Franklin Roosevelt and Charles de Gaulle. Giscard was elected under the slogan “Giscard to the helm.” Recent cartoons show him still standing there all right, guiding his craft through the night, only the rudder, unfortunately, is no longer But Giscard keeps trying to encourage his countrymen. In a recent telecast he remarked, almost wistfully, “When you elected me I asked you to believe in change. You elected me without really believing it. Today I tell you that we will do it together and then, when it is done, perhaps you will believe.” It is change with balance which he seeks to achieve. “Soon France will be the only liberal country left in Europe,” he says, referring to the trend toward leftist Governments, and points out that his ultimate success — or failure — will depend on whether France can perfect a system between the “capitalisme sauvage” of the United States, which disdains such indispensables as national health and railroad services, and the stultification of the Socialist bureaucracies. He wants to strike a balance, too, between his Gaullist predecessors’ dream of grandeur and a Government of sound economic policies. Thus while the supersonic‐jet project, the Concorde, is continued, only 16 planes will be built. While the $500‐million rocket project Ariance is continued, the liner France is abandoned. The costly turbotrain has been dropped, shortwave foreign language radio broadcasts eliminated and atmospheric nuclear testing ended. If Giscard d'Estaing remains optimistic, with chaos breaking out all around, it is largely because he still firmly believes that France, despite her lack of energy resources, has the ability and vitality to ride out the storm. With Giscard at the helm. Whether he's right, of course, is the When President Ford arrived on the French island of Martinique for his first meeting with Giscard, he was greeted by a man whose arrival at the presidency was as predestined as Ford's own was providential. Probably no leader of any great country today was as carefully prepared for leadership as Giscard d'Estaing, who attended all the right schools, including the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the French Harvard Business School, served as Junior Minister at 32 and became Finance Minister at 36. Throughout his career it seemed inevitable that he would, as the French say, have a “destin national.” At school he was always at the head of the class (”It was so natural nobody noticed,” says a contemporary). Entering the Government when most men still are obscure civil servants, he soon was dazzling the country with such tours de force as presenting the national budget to the Assembly for three hours without Many called it showing off, but wished they could do as well. Yet there always have been questions about Giscard. With his family all carefully married to princes and princesses, was he really the man to unify the divided nation, transform it and as he says, “stay ahead of events?” Georges Pompidou, his predecessor, of modest origins, doubted it. Pompidou's Foreign Minister, Michel Jobert, speaks openly about Giscard's “faiblesse de caractere” over titles and castles. Despite his flair, technoci ‐ tic brillance and obvious self‐confidence, Giscard never has been able to light the flame in his countrymen that de Gaulle did. Pompidou was warm and reassuring, a kind of Mirabeau after the king had fallen. Mitterrand with his Jacobin rhetoric can bring crowds up out of their seats. Jobert, with his nimble wit and 5‐foot stature appeals to Napoleonic instincts. Giscard is admired and appreciatedfor being crisp and modern, but in his first six months he has not touched the hearts of the people nor convinced them that technocracy, belt‐tightening and laissez‐faire will solve their problems. The French like activism, even dirigisme, from their leaders, and for a while in the fall they had the feeling they weren't being governed at all. Giscard's lonely belief that he can unite a divided nation, in spite of his origins, perhaps draws inspiration from F.D.R., the The country is not totally comfortable with Giscard's personal style either. To begin with, he didn't move his family into the Elyse Palace as other Presidents have done. but instead uses the palace as a kind of combination officepied‐a‐terre and gets out of it as often as possible. In some ways, parts of the once austere old mansion resemble a kind of Hefnerian pad, with hi‐fi rooms, modem bars, avant‐garde painting resting on thick carpets and all white breakfast Though his life‐style makes him often remote, it is also making a strong impression on his countrymen. One adviser says he is like a racing thoroughbred who goes excessively fast, but is not bred for distance and tires easily. After a day's or a week's work, Gis. card likes to relax, and some of.the relaxing has led to rumors that have touched or scandal, particularly his disappearances on weekends. II is true that he leaves a sealed envelope telling of his where. abouts when he goes off. In truth, Giscard has a big family, including five brothers and sisters, a wife, Anne Aymone, and four children, and he likes to spend time with them, whether on private hunt in one of the woods’ around Paris or at his family's chateau in the Auvergne. He also tends to pop up in the evenings with one or more of his children in the more mundane Parisian spots, cinemas, theaters, restaurants or bistros, but the Elysee makes certain that there are always security guards near him. There are also the rumors—unsubstantiated, really —that not all his disappearances are spent en famille, even that he has taken a special liking to one of Paris's prettier photographers. He Lends to dismiss the gossip as political talk that will backfire, but he admits that some Giscard, for the most part, does his decision making alone. Several times a day he will retire to his Elysee quarters for private reflection. In the Government he has only two close advisers, Michel Poniatowski, the Interior Minister, and Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist Premier. With the exception of Finance Minister Jean‐Pierre Fourcade, whose reputation is growing, most other Government members are without influence. There is no doubt that in foreign and defense policy Giscard is underadvised and often poorly informed. His remarks on defense policy so far have succeeded in confusing nearly everybody. His own staff at the Elysee is oriented toward economic affairs. It has a definite young, technocratic flavor that, while no doubt competent, also lacks the peasanty bonhomie of Pompidote.s staff, which made the Elysee seem closer Throughout the furor the Government has remained calm. “You don't base policy on what the commentators say,” says a member of the Elysee staff. To be perfectly honest, much of the private press and radio didn't like Giscard's blend of arrogance and informality from the beginning. French intellectuals lean toward extreme solutions and find it easier to identify with austere nationalists leftist revolutionaries than with reform centrists. But Giscard is betting that despite ups and downs in the press and the polls, the people will stay with him, and that short of revolt he is in for seven years. By the end of his first six months he had learned at least one lesson: the French may like Kennedyism and Trudeaumania in North Americans, but in their own President they want firmness and a certain solemnity—at least in his public person. By late fall Giscard had dropped the chatty tone of earlier telecasts and even began his latest with the rather foreboding: “It is your President speaking to you. The one you chose yourselves.” France is a country facing serious problems. It seems almost trite to say so at a time when every country whose ancestors didn't have `Giscard seeks balanced change a system between America's “capitalisme sauvage” and the stultification of the Socialist bureaucracies.’ the foresight to make geological soundings for hydrocarbons before pitching their tents faces varying degrees of disaster, but France at best is theoretically among the worst hit. To put it simply, France has no oil, After the prosperous years of Gaullism when France was able to use cheap energy for an industrialization program that saw her pass Britain in per capita income 10 years ago and West Germany five years ago (the problem during the Gaullist years was never growth nor wealth, but income distribution), France under Giscard faces gradual exhaustion. If West Germany can survive the present crisis thanks to a strong currency, to $35billion in monetary reserves and to neighboring supplies of natural gas; if Britain is an important financial center and with North Sea oil will become a net energy exporter by the eighteen‐nineties; if Italy, a far poorer country, has less far to fall, then France — as a prosperous, in monetary nor oil reserves—is the perfect victim for oil blackmail (which in a nutshell is why France is pro‐Arab). Under de Gaulle and Pompidou, France’ got used to development, investment, moderate inflation, growing reserves, export surpluses ana full employment. In 1974, the smell of stagnation has replaced that of sweat. Even the most optimistic forecasts sound ominous. Thus, if the balance of payments deficit for this fiscal year will be $4.5‐billion, the hope for the next is to keep it under $3billion. There is a slowdown in capital spending, an inflation rate of 14 per cent (though falling), rising unemployment and acute labor unrest. From the beginning, from inauguration day, Giscard d'Estaing sought to stamp his own style on French affairs, clearly not caring too much about the lingering rancor of the Gaullists. Worthy men such as Michel Debre, ChabanDelmas, Pierre Messmer, Olivier Guichard and even Michel Jobert were left out of power after having held it all. The majority of the new ministers were faceless (and too often talentless) centrists, those anonymous democrats Andre Malraux ignored completely with his Manichaean “us (Gaullists) and them (Communists).” The Gaullist “barons” were dropped to avoid their clan warfare. “He suffered from that too much,” says a staff member, “to impose it on others.” It was also true that Giscard didn't want any rivals. But it was a calculated risk, for the tradition is to bring one's most dangerous allies into the Government—much as de Gaulle and Pompidou had done with Giscard himself instead of leaving them outside to snipe The first measures announced after young (41) Pompidou protege Jacques Chirac became Premier were full of Giscardian symbolism: an end to most wiretapping and abrogation of a Gaullist law against insulting the President. “Ymi are now free to insult me,” Giscard told the press, “though I would prefer you didn't.” In taking those steps Giscard was showing his desire to reconcile the left and right camps. Traditionally, bugging was as much a way of snooping on one's political opponents as ferreting out spies, and the insult law had been passed to keep the opin line. The new reforms, the “transformation of society,” began during the gray Paris summer, the worst in years. For a time, in July and August, the reforms came so fast Frenchmen hardly knew whether they were real or not, hardly learned of one before it was lost in the next day's headlines. All this time there was a feeling of legerdemain in the air, of prestidigitation, as though it were some great public‐relations fraud inspired by journalists Jean‐Jacques Servan‐Schreiber and Frangoise Giroud of L'Express, both of whom came into the Government (although the former left when he disagreed with Giscard's decision to hold one more round of atmospheric nuclear tests). All the while, the left, with the taste of power still on its lips, called the reforms cosmetics to cover up the growing crisis. With Frenchmen throughout the dull summer more interested in soleil than societe, much of the impact Many of the measures were, however, far‐reaching, at least for France. Giscard concentrated on women, realizing that they had helped him to his wafer‐thin margin over Mitterrand and gave him higher marks in the polls than men. The presence of the electric Mme. Giroud in the Government (probably the country's most influential woman) helped considerably, especially since she had supported Mr. Mitterrand in the election and turned down an initial Government post saying that Giscard's men “want me in the kitchen making coffee.” A decree was announced making the “pill” free under the national health system. Next came announcement of a no‐fault divorce bill and an abortion bill, which when passed became the most far‐reaching in any democratic Catholic country. Taking advantage of his youthful image, Giscard had Led by the apparently indefatigable Chirac (Giroud speaks of his “immense physical vitality”), the new Government moved on several fronts at once. One of the weekly Cabinet meetings was held in Lyons as a symbol of the decentralization to come. Wanting to cut into Mitterrand's working class vote, the minimum wage was pushed up to 1,300 francs, about $275, per month. A tar‐reaching unemployment regulation was adopted, giving laid‐off workers a full year's pay, the most generous of any country. A 10 per cent income tax surthe nation's 2 mil lion richest taxpayers; an 18 per cent corporation surtax and a capital gains tax were all drawn up for next year. To woo the left, Giscard moved the July 14 Bastille Day parade from the spacious, though bourgeois.; Champs Elysees, to the crowded Place de la Bastille, symbol of all revolutions. Even L'Humanite, the Communist newspaper, applauded him for that. Inspired by that change in city planning, Giscard vetoed two urban projects that had been dear to Pompidou, the Left Bank expressway, which would have wiped out the lover's lane sous les poets de Paris, and a high‐rise officebuilding complex on the site of old Les Halles, the produce center made famous by Irma la Douce. On the latter site, the `Giscard's belief that he can unite a divided France, in spite of his origins, perhaps is inspired by F.D.R., the orig inal traitorto his class.’ of greenery, though it will be to look at, not walk on. Lawns for lounging are a reform not even Giscard has yet dared to try. The genius of de Gaulle was not his efforts to apply 19th‐century diplomacy to a 20th‐century world, but in inspiring institutions that provide a framework for balancing personal initiative and social justice. France's is truly a mixed economy, with a large degree of paternalistic welfare statism mixed in with private enterprise. Some examples: There is a free national health service, but private hospitals and doctors if you prefer. The economy is basically capitalist, but coal, trains, telephones, radio, television, airlines, Renault automobiles, and gas and electricity all are Government owned. The French oil companies are partly Government owned and controlled. The unions are powerful, but there is no such thing as a union shop or exclusive bargaining rights. The Government stays out of collective bargaining as much as possible, but has passed severance pay, retirement, women's rights, unemployment benefits and so on. Unfortunately, the minimum wage has been kept abominably low, largely because most of the workers at that level are foreign imports who would earn even less at home. Some of the more leftist Gaullists maintain that Gtscard's liberalism is really a brand of laissez‐faire that will disrupt the balance, and that the fate of his Government will be decided in the street. During the fall postal strike there were fears that the test of strength had arrived earlier than expected, but the unions backed down when the “silent majority” supported Giscard's anti‐inflation policy rather than their demands. Actually, either of the other two men who might have been President today, Chaban‐Delmas or Mitterrand, would not be doing things much differently. The fine tuning between contending forces might have been a bit different, but any French President who knows his history knows that the essential balance must be maintained. De Gaulle, despite all his efforts, was the last to learn the lesson in 1968: Grandeur at the price of too much In stressing the importance of sound economics, Giscard particularly irritated the Gaullists recently when he said that he, at least, understood the difference between “grandeur and bombast.” If de Gaulle concentrated on French dignity, Pompidou on industry, Giscard is trying to make France less kinky.* His is the counsel of a good‐natured friend after that of an awesome old grandpa and erachety granny. Giscard is goodnatured because he believes that, for one thing, there really is nothing comparable between France and Italy or Britain. For the British, the North Sea oil was like drawing to an inside straight on the last card (and the game is not over). Italy is best summed up in the words of Mussolini recently echoed by Aldo Moro: “It's not that it's so difficult to govern Italy, but that it's useless.” France, in Giscard's view, is more to be compared with West Germany, and her economic potential is what brought the Hudson Institute last year to predict that France eventually would pass West Germany in Gross National Product, though, admittedly, the energy crisis clouds the Hudson re He certainly mud be the first President to tell Frenchmen on nationwide television that they should be more “relayed.” Neves that his policies of rapprochement with the Arabs, financial austerity, international cooperation and an allout export drive will eventually bring accounts back into balance. One of the two key words in Giscard's reform plan is decentralization. In a way it is a shame that Servan‐Schreiber, the gadfly of French politics, quit as Minister of Reforms over the nuclear nonissue. For all his exoticism, ServanSchreiber at least seemed the man who might truly have decentralized France, ending the awful strangulation of the provinces by the Parisian octopus. The crux of any reform will be creation of regional assemblies with powers to tax, spend and develop the regions. If Giscard's reforms don't have that they will be as phony as de Gaulle's and Pompidou's, and the exodus of the best students, teachers, doctors, engineers and businessmen from the provinces to Paris will con The other key reform will be the redistribution of income. A recent report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that despite the very generous social benefits of the French system, the differential between incomes of the very rich and very poor was growing. The Government's new corporate, capital gains and wealth taxes will reduce this somewhat, but that doesn't take into account that over the centuries rich Frenchmen have developed highly sophisticated ways of cheating on their taxes. Giscard recognizes the problem, and in his emotional end of November telecast (”the first time he sounded like a President, not a Finance Minister,” said one commentator) he indicated that if there was one guiding principle to his social policy it was to “reduce the differences between Frenchmen, in their incomes, inequality of opportunity for their children and lack of consideration for those at the bottom of the ladder.” He had just settled with the garbage collectors after a week‐long strike because, he said, that kind of work deserves higher pay. The Post Office, already featherbedded, was something else. That strike ran on two months before the mailmen drifted back to work un The urge to unify France, to break down her divisions and create a national synthesis, has motivated French leaders since the Revolution, but only rarely has it been satisfied. After 1789, the Girondists thought the synthesis could be achieved through moderation, but failed. The Jacobins tried with the Terror and found that the French would not be intimidated. Napoleon achieved a measure of national unity through his military conquests, and later the Third Republic, which lasted nearly 70 years, did it by gradually winning most Frenchmen to the idea of a republican form of government. The monarchists, Bonapartists, separatists, Boulangists—all the great springs of French division — dried up under the Third Republic, and by the end of World War a true measure of national unity had been reached. But hardly had the unity of 1918 been achieved when it was broken by the Russian Revolution and the growth of the Communist party, which split off from the republican The consequences of the Communist revolution are one of the prime considerations of any French leader today. During the cold war, the Communists stayed in their ghetto, ostracized by the others. De Gaulle's transformation of France into a Presidential system in 1962 and the beginning of détente changed the pattern. The emergence of a coherent Gaullist electorate and its evolution under Pompidou and Giscard d'Estaing into a “Presidential majority” stretching from right to center left had the unintended consequence of drawing the leftist parties back together. And their defeat in May by such a narrow margin as 49.3 per cent of the vote to 50.7 indicated that leftist parties are, indeed, a force to be One of the clearest internal policies that has emerged under Giscard is that of trying to redivide then to isolate the Communists again and win moderate Socialists over to the majority. It is not a new policy, but has a new sense of urgency. “The real alternative in France should be between Social Democratic and Christian Democratic parties,” Giscard says, not between Gaullists and Communists. The Government is betting that the Communist party will be broken once the working classes perceive that they can prosper under the “The Swedes have evolved enlightened socialism,” Giscard remarked. “Our goal is to achieve enlightened capitalism.” The middle way. Interestingly, the Communists feel the danger. In a series of October by‐elections they were outscored badly not only by the center, but also by the Socialists. Since the by‐elections, Socialist‐Communist relations have been marked with deep tension, despite their obvious need of each other. As Government strongman Michel Poniatowski (who is a prince. related to Giscard's wife) put it: “The Communists ara divided over whether they should take power to make the revolution or make the revolution to take power.” (The Communists accuse Ponia, as he is called, of being a fascist and habitually refer to him as “your highness.”) The real problem on the left is that the two parties don't trust each other. The Communists think Mitterrand is only using their votes, and Mitterrand worries that once in power he could become another Leon Blum, or worse The French political structure today is highly anomalous, resembling almost no other country. “Our system is half‐Presidential, half‐Parliamentary,” Pompidou used to say, “entirely suited to us.” But is it? Giscard has said he wanted a more Presidential system, with greater separation of powers as in the United States, but tampering with the Gaullist Constitution is one of those things he doesn't want to risk so early in a seven‐year reign. Already the restless Gaullist‐dominated Assembly has beaten him back on an attempt to give the Constitutional Council powers of automatic judicial review. Until the Assembly elections in 1978, when Giscard hopes to win his own majority, he will move carefully in the two areas most jealously guarded by the Gaullist watchdogs: the Constitution and foreign policy. The priority today is to social But those reforms are not easy. The other side of what might be called the “will to national synthesis” is what sociologist Michel Crozier lias called the “stratified society.” Comparei to the United States, a vertical society with great social and economic mobility, France is a horizontal class society with minimum mobility. For example, only 7 per cent, an incredibly small percentage, of working class children go on to higher education. The cleavages in French society, the nonconnecting strata, the social avoidance are not imposed from above. To a very large degree they exist because Frenchmen like it that way. “The fear of faceto‐face confrontation,” Crozier says, is what makes each individual stay on his level, mistrust mixing, suspicious of outsiders and totally disinclined to social mobility. Strangers mistake this for xenophobia, when the French really are that way with each Giscard is out to change this rigid class structure, but the rigidity is in the character of the people and not in the economic and social structure. A negotiation, a confrontation, a debate, even a dialogue all are dominated by the notion of adversary relations. Unions and employers negotiate in an atmosphere of polite, teethgritting mistrust. Nothing is more suspect than appearing agreeable. The French unions were the leading critics of de Gaulle's plans for workers’ participation in factory management (a weak version of the West German Mitbestimro ung) because they thought it was a trick to end class warfare. For the left, the class struggle is a postulate and will not end just because there is no more reason to struggle. Workers, management; students, teachers; farmers, urbanites; motorists, pedestrians; Government, citizens—each interest group starts from the premise that the other is out to do it in, and that one's own success depends upon domination of the other. The notions of participation, cooperation and compromise never have been strong in French society (as de Gaulle unfortunately put it in 1968, “A government does not negotiate, it gives orders”). Breaking down this “blocked society,” as ChabanDelmas called it, one torn between paternalism and anarchy, is difficult, but it is the task Giscard has set for him In foreign policy, the Government's action so far has been brilliantly prismatic, with each observer able to find some strand of light that satisfies him. Atmospheric testing was ended after one test, with nationalists happy with the one and the others with only one (only Jobert complained that more tests were needed). The unfortunate Middle East arms embargo was lifted, with proIsraelis satisfied because it ended a sanction aimed them and pro‐Arabs because France could hint at Mirage sales to Cairo. The frost with Canada over Quebec melted and Pierre Trudeau was welcomed in Paris with the French promising not to “mix in internal Canadian affairs,” but adding that Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa would be coming too. A twitter ran through the Gaullist camp when the Government called for some “ceding of sovereignty” to the European Economic Community in Brussels, but spirits were calmed when the French proposals turned out to be quite modest. Above all, on that most emotional of subjects, FrancoAmerican relations, the pirouettes have been so spectacular that only the most unesthetic boor could protest. In truth, in the Atlantic sphere, nobody is quite sure what is going on, including the men at the Foreign Ministry. No, France would not join the United States‐backed international energy agency (although a poll showed that the public desired it), but she didn't mind if the others did. No, Giscard would not go to Washington to meet Ford as Kissinger had asked, but he would go over later during the bicentennial celebrations. No, France would not rejoin NATO's integrated military structure, but she thctught that improved European defense cooperation was a fine idea. No, France did not like the whole nasty Atlantic quarrel and agreed that Jobert was the villain, but France still couldn't be pushed around by the superpowers. Giscard would say one thing to the to see him and quite another thing to Gaullists at lunch. This is not to minimize the change under Giscard, but to be appreciated it must be put in the Gaullist context. Even to hear a French President punctuate his speech with words such as “cooperation, coordination, concertation and compromise” is new. The desire to de‐dramatize issues, discuss calmly though disagreeing, attend meetings though not joining, allow one's partners to disagree without walking out—all that is new to the Fifth Republic. Jobert came back from the disaster of the Washington energy meeting openly calling the other Europeans “traitors,” and heaping contempt on Kis. singer's concepts. It was Gaullist‐style at its best, but as the present Government admits, was self‐defeating and weakened the very pro‐European policy Jobert was defending. In a hard judgment, Raymond Aron wrote that toward the end Pompidou was a man “paralyzed by disease and discouraged by failure.” De Gaulle left France with the message that she was unique, but much of the inheritance became a great millstone that had France defending positions inconsistent with their purported ends. Giscard's pragmatism and technocratic sense of efficiency are disinclined to such theater, but still he must bear in mind that the Gaullist stream runs deep. Frenchmen don't have quite the tolerance for foreign hegemony—Kissinger would call it leadership —that some others seem to have. “We are not an over Claude Imbert in the weekly Le Point. Typical of Giscard's approach was his meeting in Martinique with Ford. A pure synthesis of French and American views on energy and economic questions was achieved as Giscard, Ford and Kissinger bobbed about in various island swimming pools, and the two sides even were able to settle the sevenyear‐long negotiation over how much France owed Washington in compensation for the NATO bases left behind when de Gaulle ordered NATO out of France in 1966. “Having attended many similar meetings between French and American leaders,” Kissinger ‘said afterwards, “I must say I found this atmosphere the most positive.” Those who had accompanied Giscard were struck by something else. The man's extreme fragility. On Guadeloupe several incidents involving demonstrators turned him quite literally pale, and he erred politically on Martinique when he let the large crowds discourage him from calling on the Communist mayor—who promptly branded him chicken. Le Figaro commented two days later that Giscard was like a came‘eon, wild with enthusiasm when well received, but withdrawn and suspicious when French foreign policy has become more European‐oriented under Giscard, but as Willy Brandt suggested during a recent Paris trip, it might have come too late. The economic crisis has contributed greatly to the disintegration that was already appearing in the E.E.C. Recession breeds nationalism and protection. ism, and it has set back pia is for a politically and ecom mically united Europe by 1980. Each European nation eves the impression of goin its separate way. British r licy —if Britain has one—ii to reduce its Common Market bill and dig those wells. German policy is to pay less for French produce and live off its monetary reserves. French policy is to export—anything —from Mouton‐Rothschild to Mirages. There is no better way to understand French foreign policy than to look at France will spend $10‐billion this year to import oil (up from $2.5‐billion last year), and that helps explain pro‐Arab policy. To pay for these imports, France will run a $2‐billion agriculture surplus which helps explain her vigorous agriculture policy. France will run a $300‐million surplus in trade with Eastern Europe, which accounts for her interest in the Communist countries. With West Germany and the United States, however, France will run deficits of $2‐billion and $1.5‐billion, which helps explain tension in and things as farm prices and aircraft Giscard d'Estaing has asked that he be judged not on his first 100 days but on his first 500. (Despite that, there is already a book out on the first 100 days by Alfred Fabre‐Luce which contains the noteworthy line: “Now, finally the princes and counts can come out of their ghettoP) The first 500 days will be up Sept. 30 and even then we might be fooled. When Goethe wrote in 1792 that the Revolution had ushered in a new era, could he have known what was to follow? Could he have known that the first Republic would be succeeded by the Directorate, Empire, Restoration, Second Republic, Second Empire and so on? France is a nation of complicated contradictions, and her people, even in the best of times, are cynics. Mitterrand, in a grudging compliment to Giscard not long ago, said, “It is a bit like Louis Philippe after Charles X; we can breathe a little.” Not to overdo the compliment, he added, “But we all remember how Louis Philippe ended” (with a revolution). Andre Maurois, in his “History of France,” tells us: “Louis Philippe afforded France some of the happiest years in her history, but the French do not live on happiness.” That should be some small comfort for Giscard d'Estaing."
Abortion Trial's Crucial Issue: When Does Life Begin?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/12/archives/abortion-trials-crucial-issue-when-does-life-begin.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 11—In a high ceilinged courtroom nine stories above downtown Boston a jury of 13 men and three women has embarked on a journey through uncharted le gal areas that will confront them with profound questions about when human life begins and what duty the doctor owe. the unborn. The jury, selected this week, is to judge a young physician, Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, indicted by a Suffolk County grand jury for manslaughter in connection with a legal abortion at Boston City Hospital. The case, which experts say is unparalleled in the annals of medical law, has attracted na tional attention and may help clarify difficult questions left by a decision of the United States Supreme Court in 1973. That decision restricted the authority of states to prohibit abortion to only that stage of pregnancy, left ill‐defined, at which the fetus was “viable,’ or capable of life outside the womb. The prosecution does not contend that the abortion, performed on Oct. 3, 1973, was illegal. At the time,. Massachusetts had no law regulating abortions because its old law had been struck down by the Supreme Court decision early in 1973. Instead, the prosecution is saying that Dr. Edelin, an obstetrician and gynecologist, killed the fetus, called a “baby boy” in the indictment, after having ended the pregnancy, by depriving the fetus of life‐sustaining oxygen while it was still in the womb. The implication is that the “well‐developed, well‐nourished black male fetus,” said to have been 24 weeks in gestational age, was already a person entitled to protection under law and that the physician was obliged to try to save its life after having separated it from the mother. “The male child would have lived but for the actions of this defendant,” the chief prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Newman A. Flanagan, said yes terday. Rights of Fetus Doubted Dr. Edelin's lawyer, William P. Homans Jr., countered that no person ever existed to be killed and that the law had never given rights to the unborn. He told the jury yesterday that the fetus “never drew a single breath outside the mother's body,” and that the doctor's actions were “in accord with accepted medical standards.” The trial raikes some delicate ethical and legal issues: ¶Can the beginning of life be pinpointed? Woes an unborn fetus have legal rights and, if so, when? ¶Is a doctor primarily reponsible to his patient, or does unborn life make a claim on him, too? ¶How is he to divide these responsibilities’ when they conflict? ¶Are these issues better settled by statutory law than by criminal trial? Many here have criticized the trial as being quasi‐political, an effort to skirt the Supreme Court ruling and to intimidate doctors in this heavily Roman Catholic city, where abortion and research on fetal tissues by scientists have been recurrent and sometimes emotional political issues. The indictment came after a City Council hearing at which fetal experimentation was denounced by politicians and antiabortion groups. Four other doctors at the hospital have also been indicted, charged under a 19th century law against grave robbing, for doing fetal research. No trial date has been set for them. Political Motive Denied Mr. Flanagan, a respected prosecutor who is said to hope to run for district attorney, bristles at suggestions of politics. “It is a sad commenta4 that allegations are made than anyone would indict for manslaughter to further political careers,” he said. “I don't think abortion is the issue. It is criminal manslaughter.” But this is obviously much more than a routine manslaughter trial. The proceedings have attracted the attention of antiabortion groups, who hope it will bring public attention to their argument that American society has become casual about the value of human life. The courtroom in Suffolk County Superior Court reflects these underlying tensions. At the prosecution table is Mr. Flanagan, a graying father of seven, and his assistants, Joseph Mulligan, Donald Brennan and Charles Dunn Sr. Behind them at the defense table sits Dr. Edelin, a 36‐yearold black man who recalls the results of back‐alley abortions from his childhood in Washington, and who now faces 20 years in prison. Beside him are Mr. Romans, a leading criminal lawyer, and Frank Susman of St. Louis, a specialist in abortion law. The judge is James P. McGuire, 64, who has impressed observers with his fairness. The jury reflects the heavily Irish. Italian and Polish character of Boston with names like Shea, Kelly, Ciano and Sokolowski. The trial, likely to last month or more, is expected to hear a welter of conflicting testimony from doctors, nurses and medical authorities. The prosecution intends to produce in court persons who were as small as the fetus at birth and survived to maturity. The basic events are not at issue. In regular duties at the city hospital, where he is still employed, Dr. Edelin one day aborted the pregnancy of a 17year‐old black woman, at her request. She was 20 to 28 weeks pregnant, according to various estimates. After three vain efforts to extract the fetus by the injection of salipe, called “salting out,” Dr. Edelin made a surgical incision in the woman's abdomen Ito remove the fetus by hysterotomy, a technique similar to birth by Caesarean section except that its objective is to terminate pregnancy., In this method, the surgeon puts his finger into the uterus and carefully detaches the placenta and amniotic sac that surrounds the developing fetus from the uterine wall. The entire mass is then expelled by contractions of the uterus. The state contends that manslaughter was committed before the expulsion. It is charged that Dr. Edelin “stood in the operating room with his hand in the mother and watched the clock for three to five minutes,” during which time the “male child” died of anoxia, or lack of oxygen, because it was removed from the mother's support. The implication is that Dr. Edelin purposedly waited to be sure there would be no life when the fetus was removed and discarded and that had he removed it quickly and attempted to keep it alive it might have survived, at least for a time. The defense says the procedure was not unusual. “We do not concede a deliberate wait of three to five minutes,” said Mr. Homans in an interview, while pointing out that a leading obstetrics textbook says that “the finger is not removed until it is felt that the sac and placenta are entirely free in the uterine cavity.” At any rate, he said, since the state says death occurred in the uterus, there is no legal ground for manslaughter. He will give evidence from pathologists that the lungs showed no signs of ever having filled with air or that there was blood circulation or heartbeat outside the mother's body. He argues that Dr. Edelin is protected under the Supreme Court's abortion decision, known as Roe v. Wade, which held that after the fetus has become viable the state ‘may; if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion.” The Court, Mr. Homans said, was referring to legislative regulation, not prosecutorial decision. The matter of viability will be a difficult court issuer The preserved fetus in this case weighs 700 grams, or 1.54 pounds, although there is dispute` over whether it has gained or lost weight from being preserved in formaldehyde. Experts say the chances for such a fetus, about 24 weeks old, to survive with brain intact are less than 1 in 100. But there have been cases in which babies weighing 700 grams or less have survived. With medical science likely to raise the chances as time goes on, it is not possible to fix firm age.or weight for viability. Because of the possibility of delivering a live baby through hysterotomy abortion, many clinics refuse abortions after more than 20 weeks of gestation. For Dr. Edelin, a tall strapping man, who is the son of a post office worker, the issue goes beyond legal and medical facts. He is known for his concern for indigent patients, and he sees legal and safe abortions as a necessary alternative to the dangerous “coathanger” abortions the poor often resort to. Feared for Woman's Life. ‘Nobody likes to do abortions,’ he said the other evening in an interview after court, “but the least we can do is make it safe and humane.” Did he feel any responsibility to the unborn? ‘I have responsibility to that woman,” he replied. “Because if I do not do it, someone else will and not only might the fetus die, but she might, too.” Not all doctors agree. Dr. Joseph R. Stanton, a Boston internist who is a leader of “Right to Life” groups, feels medicine has abandoned its respect for life. “Human life is being more ‘casually created and destroyed today than ever before,” he said. “The only thing that stands to protect the patient now is the courts and the law. As you nibble away at human life, where do you draw the line?” “I don't think we can deny the issues in this case are vet}, real,” said William J. Curran, professor of legal medicine at the Harvard Medical School. The key. issue, Professor Curran said, is that of a doctor's responsibility. “Seems to me you have to give notice of that in law,” he said, noting that in criminal matters the crucial question is intent. He observed that intent to kill would be hard to prove in a legal abortion, in which termination is the object and in which the doctor could hard ly be expected to deliver a live baby. “It is not going to be over with this trial because we have not settled in this country what is meant by life,” he ‘said. “The issue is going to continue for years.”"
Atlantic City Clinic Assailed By Senator as ‘Abortion Mill’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/13/archives/atlantic-city-clinic-assailed-by-senator-as-abortion-mill.html,"BERLIN, Jan. 12—State Senator Joseph A. Maressa charged today that an Atlantic City abortion clinic had.”apparently been operating as an abortion mill for out‐of‐state women” and he called upon the State Health Commissioner to revoke the clinic's license,. Mr. Maressa, a Democrat of Camden, said in his office at this Camden County community that failure of the Atlantic Abortion Clinic to provide the state with reports had made it “impossible to determine whether such a facility is needed in South Jersey.” Michael Land, president of the clinic, denied Senator's charges. “A record of every abortion case handled in our clinic has been sent to the proper authorities in Trenton,” he said. “We have followed every regulation to the letter.” Dr. Joanne E. Finley, the State Health Commissioner said she would turn Mr. Maressa's request over to the office of the Attorney General vhich. she noted, was explor4 ing the over‐all issue of abortion procedures in New Jersey. Dr. Finley emphasized that the permit under which the clinic has been functioning since last February was an “emergency interim license.” The clinic, which began treating patients in August, operates off the lobby of The President Towers, a 13‐story apartment building at Albany Avenue and the Boardwalk. Senator Maressa said there was no doubt in his mind that the Atlantic City clinic had been taking patients primarily from out of the state “and that reports are withheld from authorities because they will tend to show the need said to exist a year ago cannot be’ substantiated.” The Senator, who was the only legislator to oppose the icensing procedure last year said he was convinced that the in Atlantic City, besides serving as an “abortion mill” or out‐of‐state residents, also served to promote promiscuity m the part of young women."
DEFENSE WINS TEST AT ABORTION TRIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/14/archives/defense-wins-test-at-abortion-trial.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 13 (AP)—The defense lawyer for Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, charged with an abortion‐related manslaughter, chipped away today at a definition of birth put forward by the first prosecution witness. Dr. Mildred Jefferson of University Hospital, who is active in the antiabortion Right‐toLife movement, had given as her definition of birth that moment when a fetus was detatched from its mother and “has to go on its own systems.” She said a fetus became a baby when the placenta was severed and “in order to get oxygen to go on living, it must breathe oxygen in and out, either air or oxygen supplied by someone in a resuscitation effort.” William P. Homans, Jr., defense attorney, asked if that definition of birth applied to a fetus that had never drawn breath, and established with the witness a distinction between a fetus that was born and one that was stillborn. The distinction could be crucial because Mr. Homans has said he would prove that the fetus involved in the case “never drew breath.” Dr. Edelin, a staff member at Boston City Hospital, is charged with manslaughter of a “baby boy” in connection with an abortion he performed in 1973. The prosecution has alleged that the fetus was 24 weeks old, able to live outside the womb, with medical help."
Supreme Court Expands Curbs on States’ Rights to Prohibit Abortiom,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/14/archives/supreme-court-expands-curbs-on-states-rights-to-prohibit-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 13—The Supreme Court indicated strongly today that it would not permit states to punish physicians for performing abortions before the Justices legalized most abortions in January of 1973. The Justices unanimously affirmed a decision prohibiting Louisiana from suspending doctor's license on charges that he performed an abortion in 1969 and invalidating a state law permitting such regulation of the medical profession. Since the high court decided the Louisiana case without a nearing or an opinion, it was difficult to determine any limits of the ruling. It seemed to say, however, that the Justices would apply retroactively their authorization for all but end‐ofterm abortions. Such a policy could remove any criminal or professional stigma from doctors who performed operations that were illegal at the time but later won approval from the Supreme Court in a ruling that remains highly controversial. At the same time, the Court, refused a request to permit, Pennsylvania to enforce temporarily, while a legal challenge is being brought, a law that, would restrict abortions by requiring consent from a spouse or parent and by banning thel use of public funds for such operations. Associate Justice William O. Douglas did not participate ini any actions announced today. Since Jan. 1 he has been hospitalized with a stroke that partly paralyzed the left side of his body. Medical reports have been encouraging, but there no indication when he may be able to return to the bench. In the Louisiana abortion case, the state Board of Medical Examiners notified Dr. I. I. Rosen in November, 1969, that it intended to hold a hearing on suspension of his license for alleged abortions. Dr. Rosen filed suit in Federal District Court to halt these proceedings on the ground that the state antiabortion law was unconstitutional. After a three‐judge court denied the doctor an injunction, he appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in the interim had handed down its landmark abortion ruling. The Justices sent the case back to District Court for re‐examination in the light of their abortion decision. Then the lower court reversed itself and granted Dr. Rosen an injunction against any suspension probeedings, but the board of Medical Examiners appealed to the high court, urging the Justices to take another look at their position. In the brief memorandum of affirmance issued today, Associate Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist noted that they were concurring only “under the compulsion” of the high court's ruling of 1973, which they said had been “erroneously decided.” Both men dissented to that ruling. The Pennsylvania law the Court reftised to put into effect would have limited the time during which abortions were permissible by barring any such operations while the fetus was viable. ‘It defined viability as the power to live outside the womb with artificial aid. In its ruling in 1973, the Supreme Court majority defined viability more narrowly as the time when the fetus was capable of survival on its own, limited that period to the last 10 weeks of pregnancy and barred abortions during that time except in the interests of the health of the mother. The Pennsylvania law of 1974, stayed by a lower court on objections raised by Planned Parenthood, would also prohibit any abortion unless the husband or, in the case of an illegitimate pregnancy, the parents, approved. It would also prohibit the use of any state or local welfare money to finance abortions. The high court also declined today to review a jury award of $10,000 in malpractice damages against Dr. Rosen, brought by a woman who charged he had perforated her uterus during an abortion while it was still illegal."

Abortion Performed Here In Pregnancy's 26th Week,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/15/archives/abortion-performed-here-in-pregnancys-26th-week.html,"Despite legal moves by antiabortion advocates to prevent the Beth Israel Medical Center from performing an abortion on a 33‐year‐old woman in her 26th week of pregnancy, the operation has taken place. The abortion became known In State Supreme Court yesterday in a report made to Justice Irving H. Saypol, Justice Saypol presided at a brief hearing on an order signed by Justice John C. Leonforte at 11 A.M., Sunday, an hour and a half before the operation took place. The order had named Dr. Ada Biffar Ryan as guardian of the unborn fetus. Hospital authorities said that the order, which would have blocked the operation, was not received until P.M. Sunday. Through her lawyer, Loretta A. Conway, Dr. Ryan called the operation illegal. Outside of court, she termed it “murder.” Dr. Ryan, who is associated with Flushing Hospital in Flushing, Queens, is president of an organization called Doctors and Nurses Against Abortion. Hospital Sought Order She withdrew her motion for a temporary injunction, saying that she would press for information on the kind of medical procedures used to perform the abortion. The hospital sought a court order last Wednesday directing the surgical staff to perform a therapeutic interruption of the pregnancy. The suit was withdrawn on Friday and never acted upon by the court. The hospiital's counsel, John Bower, advised the court yesterday that the pregnancy had been terminated as a result of “an induced birth” by which the woman, called Mary Roe, delivered” a 2‐pound 4‐ounce stillborn fetus. Mr. Bower said in an affidavit that the operation had been legal and necessary “to save the wothen's life.” Abortioh after the 24th, week is illegal in New York State Unless the mother's life is in danger. Exercising their medical judgrhent, five physicians attended the operation, Mr. Bower said. Probable Defects Indicated The woman, who had a history of alcoholism and had threatened suicide unless she received a therapeutic abortion, had been examined at Beth Israel by geneticists and a psychiatrist. John F. Reilly, the hospital's assistant director, said that a study of her amniotic fluid inside the womb had revealed extra chromosomal material. He said, it was probable therefore, that her child would have been born retarded and with birth defects. A hospital psychiatrist found that because of severe anxiety and self‐destructive tendencies, a therapeutic interruption of ler pregnancy was warranted “in order to save her life.”"
Top French Council Rules Abortion Law Constitutional,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/16/archives/top-french-council-rules-abortion-law-constitutional.html,"PARIS, Thursday Jan. 16—The Constitutional Council ruled today that the abortion bill passed Dec. 4 by the French National Assembly is constitutional. The decision was on the request of 77 members of the Assembly who strongly opposed the bill and had asked the Council to declare it unconstitutional. The council is the highest authority on constitutional issues. Details of the decision were not immediately available. The bill allows any woman over the age of 18 to have an abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, provided the operation is carried out by a doctor in an established hospital. Girls under 18 need parental permission."
TV: Lear's Jeffersons’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/17/archives/tv-lears-jeffersons-archie-bunkers-black-neighbors-star-in-own.html,"The trick in watching a serie§ by Norman Lear is to keep an eye on the subsidiary characters — neighbors, domestic help, relatives. In one, long‐ago episode of “All in the Family,” the Bunkers went to visit Edith's cousin someone named Maude. On “Maude,” her own subsequent series, she has a black maid named Florida, who now presides over her own struggling family in the series “Good Times.” Now,, beginning an CBS tomorrow at 8.30 P.M., in the valuable time slot following the still popular “All in the Family,” ‐bigoted Archie's black neighbors become stars of a series called‐”The Jeffersons.” The Lear method is ingenious. Every TV producer is preoccupied with the problem of product ‐ “sampling,” getting the audience to tune in just to discover what the basic situation and characters are all about. Mr. Lear simply incorporates a number of samplings into his own shows, which happen to at tract the‐largest audiences in television. In fact, last week's episode of “All in the Family” turned out to be the true first installment of “The Jeffersons,” with the black family bidding farewell to ‘the Bunkers and moving into a luxury apartment house on Man‐’ hattan's East Side. Interestingly enough, with five Lear programs now on the air (a sixth, “Hot 1 Baltimore,? will be added next week, on ABC), three involve black families, each representing a further progression on the socioeconomic scale. TAe title characters of WSanford and Son” are junk dealers. The family of “Good Times? is lower‐middle class living in a housing project. The Jeffersons are making it through a successful chain of dry‐cleaning stores. On tomorrow evening's episode their first crisis is over the hiring of a maid. Mr. Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley) wants one. Mrs. Jefferson (Isabel Sanford) doesn't Despite some fascinating touches, the”comedy's situation is somewhat,shaky. The character of JefferSon snobbish and: given to frequent terhper tantrums verges on the unattractive. Even Archie Bunker is an “appealing” bigot. And much of the humor is based on it suit, what used to be called “playing the dozens,” When content can become secondary to delivery. On “The Jeffersons” too.much of the content is But, again, keep an eye on those secondary characters. There is the son Lionel (Mike Evans), who is being underused for ‘ the moment. Diane ‐ (Pauline Myers) is a black maid who is working for several tenants in the building and who initially assumes that Mrs. Jefferson is a maid working for a white family, named the Jeffersons. And Harry Bent‐ ley (Paul Benedict) is a strange white neighbor with madcap potential. And then there is the Willis couple, new neighbors of the Jeffersons. Mr. Lear has carefully cultivated a reputation for dealing with the unusual and controversial: breast cancer, menopause, abortion economic inflation: This‐time however, in terms of network television and wherever the collective. psyche of the nation may be at the present moment, he is teetering on the explosive. Mrs. Willis (Roxie Raker) is black. Mr. Willis (Franklin Cover) is white. Weekly TV entertainment’ has produced its first interracial marriage and Mr. Lear is not about to be coy about it. Not for him the liberal tentativeness of a film like “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?” During an argument instigated by Mr. Jefferson, Mrs. Willis wonders if her husband, in a fit of anger, was ever tempted to call her “nigger.” He finds her referring to him as a “honky.” The two leave and discus's the problem while waiting for the elevator. In the end, they embrace and kiss, warmly, passionately as “smack full on the lips” as is htunanly possible. On. April 2, 1968, liss than seven years. ago, Petula.

ABORTION INQUIRY ASKED BY SENATOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/17/archives/new-jersey-pages-abortion-inquiry-asked-by-senator-legislator-says.html,"BERLIN, Jan. 16—State Senator Joseph A. Maressa today called for a new hearing by the New Jersey Health Planning Council on the state's abortion policies, saying that statistics from an Atlantic City abortion clinic indicate “an appalling disregard for the morts of girls and single women. The Camden Democrat said that the statistics from the Atlantic Abortion Clinic, Inc. showed that of 286 women treated at the clinic since it opened four months ago, six were under 14—the youngest being 12—and 85 were 18 years old or younger. Senator Maressa added that although the State Health Commissioner, Dr. Joanne E. Finley had predicted at planning council hearings that most of the abortions at the clinic would be performed on married women over 30 with children, the clinic figures showed that 223 of the 286 patients were single and 229 were under 30. He ‘also said that figures provided by Dr. Watson Nieman, Deputy Health Commissioner, showed that most of the women patients were from out of state, with 200 of them listing motels and hotels in Atlantic County as their homes when they entered the clinic. The Senator, who is majority whip in Trenton, said this figure “proves conclusively to me that the Atlantic City clinic, the only one operating in South Jersey, has become an abortion mill for out‐ofstate pregnant women.” He said he had sent a letter to Dr. Finley asking for the new hearing by the health council and for statistics from the only other abortion clinic in the state, which is in Jersey City. “I am confident that h rehearing by the health council will indicate that New Jersey does not need any abortion clinics,” he said in his office here."
ABORTION WITNESS CITES PROCEDURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/18/archives/abortion-witness-cites-procedure-doctor-in-boston-trial-says-live.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 17 (UP1)—The chief prosecution witness in the manslaughtter case against Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin testified today that the physician's operating room procedures could have killed a live birth resulting from an. abortion. Dr. Edelin, 36 years old, is on trial in the death of a 24‐week to 28‐week‐old fetus he aborted in Odtober, 1973, at the request of the pregnant woman, who was 17 or 18 years old. Returning to the witness stand for the second day, Dr. Enrique Gimenez‐Jimeno, an operating room observer at the time the abortion took place told the jury of 13 men and 3 women in Suffolk Superior Court that it was likely that the operation performed by Dr. Edelin would have produced live birth. Guided by the Assistant Attorney General, Newman A. Flanagan, Dr. Gimenez‐Jimeno testified that Dr. Edelin had allowed “the baby boy or baby girl” to remain in the uterus for at least three minutes after separation from the mother. This delay would have suffocated the fetus, Dr. Gimenez‐Jimeno said. Dr. Edelin's chief defense attorney, William Homans; ob jected repeatedly to use of words like “live birth, baby boy and baby girl.” From time to time during the ninth day of the tt'5al, Judge James P. McGuire took. up the questioning of the witness himself. Mr. Homans sought in crossexamination to establish the witness's certainty as to what room the operation took place in. Dr. Gimenez‐Jimeno said he could not recall which operating room it was, nor could he recall the placement of a clock that Dr. Edelin allegedly stared at during the three‐minute period. Pennsylvania Law Upheld PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 17 (UP1) —A three‐judge Federal court Friday restored a Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act provision that permits the State Health Department to regulate abortions in clinics and hospitals. Enforcement of the provision, along with other key sections of the act, had been enjoined by the judicial panel last October. The other sections, involving viability of the fetus, consent of a spouse or guardian and misdemeanor convictions, remained under court ban, pending a final ruling expected after Feb. 10. The Federal panel presided all all week at a trial of a suit seeking to invalidate the entire abortion control act. The restored safety regulatalons include limitations on special abortion clinics, requirements for emergency backup equipment and restrictions on drugs."

ALL DALKON SHIELDS TAKEN OFF MARKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/21/archives/all-dalkon-shields-taken-off-market.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (AP) —The A. H. Robins Company said today it was taking off the market all Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive devices of the type involved in 14 deaths and at least 219 cases of infected abortions. The company termed its action a “market withdrawal” and not a recall because it was undertaken voluntarily without Food and Drug Administration pressure. Robins said it had dispatched its salesmen to pick up an unknown number of old, unused Dalkon Shields from wholesalers, physicians, hospitals and family planning organizations and give refunds. The same offer will apply to the Agency for International Development for all Dalkon Shields remaining in this country, a spokesman said. The agency purchased the devices for distribution in impoverished nations, a spokesman said. Last month the Food and Drug Administration lifted a six‐month‐old ban on Dalkon Shields but imposed new marketing restrictions, including a registry of new patients so that adverse reactions may be measured accurately and fully."
Bill to Erase Minor‐Arrest Data Gains,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/21/archives/bill-to-erase-minorarrest-data-gains.html,"ALBANY, Jan, 20—In its first day of consideration of new legislation, the Assembly today approved a measure that would ease criminal proceedings against first offenders accused of misdemeanors or minor violations by ordering the sealing of court records and the expungement of the arrest record in cases in which charges were dismissed. The measure, passed by a vote of 128 to 13, now goes to the Senate. It would mandate that records of criminal proceedings as well as any arrest records be sealed and not made available in cases adjourned in contemplation of dismissal, after a six‐month probationary period. Assemblyman George A. Murphy, Republican of Seaford, the sponsor of the bill, said the measure “would give the defendant the same advantage and protection afforded marijuana defendants [in minor cases] in having the record sealed and in having a complete restoration of prior status as a nonoffender by nullification of the proceedings.” He said the measure would give first offenders a sharp warning not to commit another crime and would give full justice under a statute that was intended to give full justice.” Assemblyman Thomas J. Murphy, Republican of Syracuse, warned that passage of the measure was “going to undermine law and order in this state.” He said that 19,000 cases in the state had been dismissed under the current procedures and that, under provisions proposed, employers would never know if the person they were subsequently hiring was honest and reliable. By a vote of 135 to 6, the Assembly also passed and sent to the Senate a bill that would authorize cases involving $1,000 to be adjudicated by the Small Claims Court in New York City. Thb bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Edward H. Lehner, Democrat of Manhattan, increases the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court from the present $500 to $1,000. Assemblyman Lehner said that because of inflation the higher limits were needed. The Assembly also passed a bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, Democrat of Queens, that would extend to three years from the present 12 months the period in which a person could file a claim for a fire loss against his insurance company. There was a somewhat desultory start to the work week, as the Senate held only a perfunctory meeting after private conferences that went into such matters as how members should fill out their new expense vouchers. The Assembly began with the two floor leaders introducing new members on their respective sides of the aisle—30 new Democrats and eight new Republicans—and allowing each freshman a separate smattering of applause. Other actions here included the following: FUEL‐PRICE PROTEST The Assembly minority leader, Perry B. Duryea, Republican of Montauk, L. I., criticized President Ford and Governor Carey as he proposed creation of a state office of energy and resources to anticipate and prepare for fuel shortages. Mr. Duryea said the combined effect of President Ford's proposed crude ‐ oil tariff and Governor Carey's proposed gasoline‐tax increase of 10 cents a gallon would be to drive the price of gasoline up to near 80 cents a gallon next summer. The two levies, Mr. Duryea said, “will hit the pockets of every car owner, rich and poor alike, and add to our woes of the recession.” FATAL FIRES Assemblyman Hevesi charged that elimination of fire companies in New York City because of budget restrictions, might have contributed to a significant number of deaths. He said that Fire Department personnel had compiled a list of 71 fatalities that could be attributed to elimination of 22 fire companies in the last two years. Mr. Hevesi said he would introduce legislation calling for a $16.9‐million appropriation by the state to enable restoration of the most‐recently eliminated fire companies. ANTI‐ABORTION VIGIL The New York part of the Right to Life Committee's drive for a Federal constitutional amendment to reinstate tighter controls over abortion got under way here with a prayer vigil on the steps of the Capitol. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Lieut. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak is seeking $1.2‐million to run her office this year, more than four times the amount given to former Governor Malcolm Wilson in his last year as Lieutenant Governor. Governor Carey has reportedly balked at authorizing that amount. During a news conference, the Lieutenant Governor repeatedly said that the over‐all budget for her office and that of the Governor would be less than the previous total. She said she was seeking additional functions for her growing staff. RUMOR REACTION With Governor Carey remaining secretive about his reorganization plans, legislators in both parties began reacting to rumors. Senator Carl McCall, Manhattan Democrat, released a letter to Mr. Carey urging against the reappointment of Louis L. Levine as Industrial Commissioner, contending that Mr. Levine had failed to protect the rights of minority groups and women during his years in the Rockefeller‐Wilson administration. Two suburban Republicans, Alvin Suchin of Westchester County and Armand P. D'Amato of Nassau County expressed concern over reports that the Governor intended to cut back the office of Local Government. Assembly Republicans argued against the proposed elimination of the office of Welfare Inspector General, saying that millions of dollars had been saved in the three years that the office has existed. Democrats argued that the office was part of a vendetta against New York City and said that its functions should be part of the Controller's office."

Shapp Promises to Persevere as Liberal,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/22/archives/shapp-promises-to-persevere-as-liberal.html,"HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 21—Milton J. Shapp, the only Pennsylvania Governor to succeed himself in more than a century, began his second term today with a pledge to persevere in the liberalism that brought both acrimony and acclaim to his first four years in office. “This administration shall continue to serve as the people's advocate,” the 62‐year‐old Democrat promised in his inaugural address from the steps of the granite Capitol—and to the chilled ears of most of those in the shivering audience of 1,500 they were welcome words. As his friends and supporters, they regard him as a paragon of liberal virtue and a shining symbol of long‐awaited reform. From their ranks and those similarly persuaded, he forged a 300,000‐vote victory last November. To other Pennsylvanians, however, the diminutive man who took the oath of office at noon today represents nothing more than an unwelcome challenge to cherished institutions, and his subsequent speech in the 13‐degree temperature signaled for them a continuation of policies and plans they have come to dread. Ideological Division While such division is common enough in American politics, its dimensions here are rather striking, for it seems solely ideological. For those to the left of center, regardless of party, Governor Shape is a hero. For those to the right, regardless of party, he is anathema—a man to be feared and fought. What is more, the Governor's enemies seem more frightened than ever these days that, without the constraints of future political considerations — he cannot seek re‐election — he will become even more of a threat to the conservatives. His remarks today did little to allay those fears. Shapp Lists Targets Laconic as ever —the Governor has never been regarded as a spellbinding orator by either his allies or his enemies —he listed the targets he has chosen for his proposed reforms over the next four years as follows: ¶Health care and hospital services should be brought within the financial reach of every citizen. ¶Tax rates and election laws should be revised to a more equitable schedule. ¶Land use statutes and environmental controls should be tightened. ¶Mental institutions and the prison system should be reorganized. Governor Shapp's opponents were not surprised by the tone of his address today. It was as energetically liberal and as reformist‐minded as they had expected. “I told him last year,” a conservative legislator said, “that if he was re‐elected, I was going to go hide for four years.” The Governor insists, however, that what a policy might mean in some future election is of no consideration to him. “I make decisions based on the merits of the programs alone,” he said after watching the inaugural parade. “I call the shots as I see them, election or no election.” The Governor's aides take the same view. “If the man's so sensitive to elections, how do you explain his moves last year —an electionn year?” Edward Mitchell, his press secretary, asked last night. He was referring to a series of vetoes by Governor Shapp of bills aimed at limiting abortions, eliminating pornography and re‐establishing the death penalty in the state. All three vetoes were viewed as fairly unpopular among the general public. When Mr. Shapp first began his pursuit of the Governorship in 1966, he was an unknown, millionaire businessman from Philadelphia who had been a pioneer in the cable television industry in this country. In 1966, he captured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination by upsetting the party's organization candidate but lost in the general election. Four years later, he won the nomination and the general election and became the first Jewish Governor of this state. His immediate goals were to cut back the long‐abused patronage system and to increase goverment services to the elderly, the disadvantaged and the handicapped. Even those who call themselves his foes seem to agree that he has made substantial progress toward those goals during his first term. He also named as his Commissioner of Insurance, Herbert Denenberg, a consumer activist professor from the University of Pennsylvania, who became nationally noted for his criticism of the local insurance industry. Now the Governor has appointed Mr. Denenberg an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate last year, to the Public Utilities Commission and that has caused some ripples in the State Senate where it must be confirmed. “That's an example of how foolish people are to he afraid of Milton,” said James N. Wade, the newly appointed Secretary of Administration and the second black given Cabinet rank by the Governor. “There are legislative restraints, such as the Senate on Dehenberg, and there are fiscal restraints, and then there are the common sense restraints that he places on himself.”"
"25,000 in Capital Call for Amendment To Outlaw Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/23/archives/25000-in-capital-call-for-amendment-to-outlaw-abortion.html,"WASHINGTON, Ja. 22 (UPI) —Antiabortionists rallied on the icy steps of the Capitol today and urged Congress to establish a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Police estimates of the crowd ranged up to 25,000. Carrying roses and placards —with slogans such as “Kill Inflation, Not Babies” and “It's Not Nice To Fool With Mother Nature” — the demonstrators gathered at the West Front of the Capitol to hear Congressmen and clergymen speak out against abortion. Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative ‐ Republican of New York, a long‐time advocate of antiabortion measures, received the loudest reception from the crowd when he announced that he would introduce tomorrow in the Senate a constitutional amendment banning abortion. He introduced an identical proposal last May. Today's demonstration marked the two‐year anniversary of the historic United States Supreme Court decision that struck down restrictive abortion laws in many states. Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina, a cosponsor of the amendment, called that Supreme Court decision “a complete reversal of our moral tradition” and suggested that, because of it, the elderly, the disabled and dissenters, political and religious, could be murdered “under the guise of social necessity.”"

Birth Control Gains Support,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/26/archives/birth-control-gains-support-support-increasing-for-birth-control.html,"SOME members of the family of nations, after arguing long and loudly over the problem of population pressure, are now doing something about it, even as the controversy rages on. Several countries, in a momentous change of attitude, have adopted a policy of controlling their population growth by encouraging family planning. This view is gaining ground even in some Roman Catholic nations that have a strong tradition of opposition to artificial birth control. Other countries insist that population control is not the answer. They want to ease the plight of teeming multitudes by accelerating economic development. The contrast between these two basic approaches came into sharp focus last year at the United Nations population conference in Bucharest, Rumania. The industrialized nations have been urging the third world to raise its standard of living through population control. But some developing countries view a large population as, a national asset and prefer to seek faster economic gains, and amid this confrontation ideas are changing in a number of countries. Mexico, which for decades was firmly opposed to birth control, has done an about‐face in the last two years. Mexico now has a Government‐backed program of family planning. The country has one of the fastest growing populations in the world—now 58 million and increasing at the rate of 3.5 per cent a year. Economists hope that the new program will help stabilize Mexico's population at about 150 million in the first quarter of the 21st century. The Government of President Luis Echevarrfa Alvarez was evidently driven to change the. traditional policy by such forces as unemployment and the failure of schools and medical services to keep up with the expanding population. Under Mexico's family‐planning program, birth‐control information and devices are provided free at Government clinics. A publicity campaign is under way to help change popular attitudes. The middle and upper classes have generally accepted the plan. But progress among the poor has been slow, partly because they regard children as contributing to family income and partly because men view large families as evidence of virility. France has just gone through a long, searing debate on abortion. A bill legalizing it was finally enacted by the National Assembly amid intense pressure from all sides. The legislation, hailed by women's liberation groups, may be a blow to France's efforts to increase her population. Former Premier Michel Debré, speaking against the bill, said: “Motherhood must be encouraged in the interests of the country. In the era of competition that we have entered, it is more important than ever not to weaken the French nation.” However, statistics suggest that the Government's views are not necessarily shared by French citizens. Despite tax exemptions and allowances for large families, the birth rate has been steadily declining. The monetary benefits have been offset by cramped living space, at least in the cities, and by increasing employment of women. In Italy, laws against distribution of birth‐control information were struck down only in 1971. And there is still no Government‐sponsored family‐planning program. However, a private organization, the Italian Birth Control Association, with 22 clinics throughout the country, has been calling attention to the population problem. Luigi de Marchi, the association's director, contends that Italy, as a country poor in natural resources, must curb indefinite population growth if living conditions are to be further improved. Two other Catholic countries, Spain and Portugal, have no official birth‐control programs, although contraceptive pills are available with a physician's prescription. In both countries, the official attitude appears to favor development of new job opportunities lather than population control. The Soviet Union's rate of population increase has been declining. In 1960 the Soviet populationincreased at the rate of 17.8 per 1,000. By 1972 the rate of increase was down to 9.3 per 1,000. Relatively few new workers are entering the Soviet labor force. A major effort is under way to increase labor productivity, which has been lagging far behind that of the Western countries. Population growth varies widely among the Soviet Union's ethnic groups. Latvia recorded a birth‐rate increase of only 3.2 per 1,000 in 1972 while the Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, a Moslem area, had a rate of 29 per 1,000. The official Soviet policy tends to be lax. Abortions are cheap, and contraceptive (mostly intrauterine devies) are available for women who want to keep their families small. However, special allowances are given to mothers of large families, including the title of “mother heroine” for a woman with 10 children. Greece has an unusual problem: births are slowing at a rate that is expected to bring an actual decrease in the population of Greece within the next decade. Today's population of almost nine million is increasing by only 149,000 births annually. One reason for this, a leading gynecologist in Greece explains, is the high number of abortions performed—more than 500,000 a year. Contraceptive pills are still prohibited by Greek law, and family planning is a subject that has not yet been discussed in public. Countries of northern Africa vary widely. Tunisia and Egypt run active family‐planning programs. But Algeria, a resources‐rich nation that wants a large population, emphasizes economic development rather than population control. Population pressure is particularly serious in Egypt, a largely desert country where cultivated land is limited to a strip along. the Nile River and to the Nile Delta. Egypt's birth‐control program is said to compare favorably with that of most other developing countries, although Government family‐planning services reach only about one‐fifth of the women of childbearing age. Dr. Kamal Bindari, an Egyptian population specialist, says population growth will not level off until more women enter the work force. Although education is free, this is likely to be a slow development. In rural areas of Egypt, only one out of three girls goes to school. An apparently effective program of family planning has been introduced in Singapore, the Southeast Asia island state with a population of 2.2 million in an area of 226 square miles. Singapore seeks to discourage large families by increasing charges for each additional child born in a hospital, by denying maternity leave for working mothers after the second birth and by lowering priority for large families in the allocation of Government housing. Dr. Margaret Loh, head of the Family Planning and Population Board, says Singapore's goal is to achieve zero population growth. Progress has been slow in India, which was probably the first of the developing countries to adopt population control as Government policy. Although $72‐million a year is being spent and although 80,000 workers are in the field to dispense birth‐control information and devices, the campaign is hampered by illiteracy and poverty. About 70 per cent of India's population, of 580 million is still illiterate. About 60 per cent of Indians are so poor that they welcome the presence of extra children in the family to help raise the meager income."
FREE CHOICE HELD ISSUE IN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/26/archives/free-choice-held-issue-in-abortion-doctor-charged-in-boston-case.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UPI) —A physician from Boston who is on trial for manslaughter in a case that may extend the United States Supreme Court's abortion decision said today that freedom of choice was the central issue in the controversy. Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin told the National Abortion Rights Action League's annual meeting that he would have much more to say about his case after the trial. “The central issue we've all been fighting for is freedom of choice,” the bushy‐haired, mustachioed doctor said in brief remarks. The manslaughter charge grew out of an abortion he performed on a 17‐year‐old woman between her 20th and 24th week of pregnancy. He is accused of killing a fetus that the prosecution says could have lived outside its mother's body. The Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that states could place no restriction on abortions during the first three months of pregnancy and could regulate only the medical aspects of abortion during the second trimester. States were empowered to place restraints on abortions in the final three months including outright prohibition except to save the mother's life. Antiabortion forces have been attempting to overturn the Supreme Court ruling through a constitutional amendment. Two such amendments are the subject of hearings in the Senate Judiciary subcommittee. Representative Paul McCloskey, Republican of California, who contends that in 1972 he was the first Presidential candidate to support abortion publicly,told the luncheon gathering that the constitutional amendment proposals were “very dangerous.” “Most of my colleagues in the House and Senate would agree with you” on a woman's “right of free choice,” Mr. McCloskey said. Headded however, that it was a political reality that if a small but “highly dedicated group organize and work hard” against abortion, the Congress would almost always respond to their pressure."
"Across generations, across a continent, across the ice",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/26/archives/across-generations-across-a-continent-across-the-ice-sycamore-year.html,"This is not quite one of those trendy pregnancy novels. There is not much in it about sex, or about whether a 15‐year‐old girl should sleep with a boy; except for a brief, unchallenged “right to life” statement, the question of abortion is skirted because it is too late for the girl to have one; and the pregnancy is written off as a “mistake” by the characters, including the adults, who all seem innocent of knowledge about birth control. By Mildred Lee. 191 pp. New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co. 35.50. (Ages 12 to 15) Anna Lewis falls in love with Tony Ferris, an older boy with a bad rep, “slippery looks and floppy hair and snazzy car.” “I just wanted Tony to love me and to love him back,” she says; “…it made me not care about anything else.” When Anna gets pregnant, she confides in her best friend, Wren Fairchild, for whom it is hard “to speak of boys without sarcasm.” “Sycamore Year” tries to create a world something like that of “The Waltons,” where adults are not the enemy but good people to be trusted and relied on. As Mrs. Fairchild says to Wren when she and the other parents learn what has been troubling the girls: “It's all in other hands, it's going to be taken care of with intelligence and—kindness. You did the best you could.” The author was ill‐advised to support this theme with a reference to the scene in “To Kill a Mockingbird” where “the old black gentleman woke Scout and told her to stand up because her father was passing by.” This book does not offer anything that touching, nor does it have the down‐home simplicity of “The Waltons.” It is narrated by Wren (grown up to be a writer), who may have escaped bad moral habits but has acquired some terribly pretentious literary ones. Characters “slip backstage,” smiles “echo” thoughts, grudges “melt away,” voices “ring out almost as one voice,” and fathers say things to their daughters like “it would be morbid and unhealthy to let Anna's mistake affect the natural development of your own good mind and wholesome body.” Scout and John‐Boy turned into better writer."

Before he attended the premiere Mr. Ford went to the National Press Club where he swore in the newly elected head and described the difficulties of being a president. “There are some impossible things about being President; first they take away your swimming pool, and then they want you to come clean,” Mr. Ford said as he swore in William Broom of Ridder Publications as the club's 1975 president. Mr. Ford referred to the recent covering over of the White House swimming pool and the construction of a press room atop it. Earlier today, Mr. Ford attended a traditional red mass for justice at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral where Most Rev. James Rausch told him from the pulpit that it was his duty to oppose abortion. Mr. and Mrs. Ford joined Chief Justice Warren E.

Special to The New York Times Supporters of the Government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said a negative ruling would be a serious setback to the cause of social reform, one of their planks in the 1972 elections. The abortion reform was passed by a parliamentary majority of Social Democrats and Free Democrats last June, but the Christian Democratic opposition took the law to court and got a temporary injunction. The law allows for an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy at the request of the mother. A majority of the judges was said to hold that abortion was permissible only when the mother's life was endangered. Officials of the German Constitutional Court, in Karlsruhe, declined to comment on the television reports today."

Panel Finds Little Effort to Alleviate Health Risks Women Workers Face,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/29/archives/panel-finds-little-effort-to-alleviate-health-risks-women-workers.html,"Although half of American women now work outside their homes, little attention has been paid to the special risks female workers may face from exposure to toxic chemicals and other on‐the‐job hazards, a panel of experts on occupational health said yesterday. Members of the panel pointed out that certain occupational hazards might be especially dangerous to pregnant women, since the development of the fetus might be adversely affected. Sources of Danger Agents in the workplace that are known to damage the fetus include radiation, lead and carbon monoxide, with many other substances suspect and still others as yet undetected. Surveys have shown that 60 per cent of women work during their first pregnancy and 20 per cent work during subsequent pregnancies. The panel further noted that men and women might react differently to some substances or working conditions because of inherent biological differences between the sexes. But sex differences are almost never considered in studies of work hazards, said Dr. Vilma R. Hunt, biologist at Pennsylvania State University, who presided over the panel. The panel was hold at the Americana Hotel here as part of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Interest in the health problems of female workers peaked about half a century ago, when only 20 per cent of women worked. after a series of dramatic events. These included widespread phosphorus poisoning among women and children who worked in match factories and the disastrous 1911 fire in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York, which resulted in the deaths of 145 women and young girls because the building lacked fire escapes. In 1918, the United States Department of Labor created a Women's Bureau, initially to attend to the needs of women working in wartime munitions plants. But the attention that focused on women in industry during World War II, when 36 per cent of the work force was female, faded rapidly with the war's end and the return of men to the labor force. In recent years, said Andrea M. Hricko of the Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader organization in Washington, interest in She occupational hazards women face has suffered a further setback with the growth of the women's rights movement. “The concept of protective legislation became objectionable to women, since it was often based on the assumption that women were phyically inferior and belonged in the home,” Miss Hricko said. Dr. Jeanne M. Steilman, a scientist with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, said she saw a frightening trend toward employment policies to protect women's health that ultimately discriminated against women's job opportunities. Lead Industry Cited Dr. Stellman cited as an example a recommendation she said had, been made by the lead industry to exclude from employment all women who were fertile, pregnant or nursing to prevent adverse effects of lead on the fetus. The most pressing need at the moment, the panelists agreed, is for more studies on how the health of women, whether pregnant or not, and the health of unborn children may be harmed by occupational conditions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a Federal agency, is currently studying health problems of personnel in beauty shops and hospitals, where the vast majority of the workers are women. There are also indications that risks to unborn children may be transmitted by the male worker as well as the female. Following a recent finding that female anesthesiologists suffer unusually high rates of spontaneous abortion and birth defects in their ofspring, the national institute found that the children of male operating room personnel also faced an increased risk of birth defects. Miss Hricko concluded that “our current emphasis on the hazards of chemical exposures for child‐bearing‐age women may be too one‐sided.” She urged testing of the effects of toxic industrial chemicals on both male and female reproductive functions."
Rockefeller Visits Jersey To Help G.O.P. Cut Debt,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/30/archives/rockefeller-visits-jersey-to-help-gop-cut-debt.html,"MILLBURN, N. J., Jan. 29—In his first partisan political foray since being sworn into office last December, Vice President Rockefeller visited New Jersey tonight in an effort to revitalize a state Republican party that has been debilitated by Watergate, the disastrous gubernatorial campaign of Charles W. Sandman Jr. and the economic ravages of the nation's continuing recession. While assuring New Jersey Republicans of their most successful fund‐raising dinner in five years, Mr. Rockefeller's appearance also re‐emphasized the continuing animosity among Republicans that was exacerbated by Mr. Sandman's conservative campaign for Governor in 1973. In fact, a few hours before Mr. Rockefeller's plane landed at Morristown Municipal Airport, State Superior Court Judge Irwin I. Kimmelman or dered the proceeds of tonight's fund‐raising dinner impounded until the court decided how the money would be distributed. Last fall, officials of the Republican state finance committee, the sponsors of this evening's affair, declared that neither Mr. Sandman nor his financial backers would get any of the proceeds, a decision that was challenged in court yesterday by one of the former Representative's most generous financial supporters, Vincent Citarelli, a West Caldwell insurance executive. This morning, J. William Barba, the chairman of the finance committee, sought to have the funds unfrozen. But Judge Kimmelman refused and scheduled a hearing for Feb. 7 to weigh opposing arguments. In an interview later at the airport, Webster B. Todd, the Republican state chairman, said he was optimistic that the court would award the state financt committee all the money raised tonight and that Mr. Sandman would get none of it. Arriving in a light drizzle at 5 P.M., Mr. Rockefeller held a news conference in the maintenance garage of the airport's operations office after receiving a mixed reception from a crowd of about 200 standing behind a wire fence. About half of them applauded while the other half shouted criticism of his pro‐abortion position as New York's Governor. Inside, Mr. Rockefeller, flanked by two of New Jersey's three Republican Representatives—Matthew J. Rinaldo and Millicent H. Fenwick — was asked if he supported a re‐entry of former President Richard M. Nixon as a political spokesman for the Republican party. Question Avoided In effect, Mr. Rockefeller sidestepped the question and said it was “no time to rake up the past.” He said that the nation was just recovering from the “moral and economic shock” of Watergate and the recession and that he had “no intention” of getting into another political squabble. As for the disputed proceeds of the dinner, Mr. Rockefeller threw up his hands and said, “I don't want to get involved in that one, either.” Mr. Rockefeller then drove a few miles from the airport to nearby Harding Township and the sumptuous new home of William E. Simon, the Secretary of the Treasury, where about 50 Republicans paid $1,000 each for the privilege of exchanging cocktail conversation with the former New York Governor, The Vice President's appearance at the Simon home also gave the New Jersey Republican establishment of bankers, lawyers and industralists an opportunity to show off Mr. Simon as a potential Republican candidate for high office in the state, presumably for Governor in 1977 should Governor Byrne's political fortunes continue to sag under the weight of the state's fiscal problems. While the 47‐year‐old Mr. Simon remains reticent abgut his political plans, leading New Jersey Republicans were not, and were clearly enthusiastic about Mr. Simon's and their prospects in the state. “Given Nixon, Sandman, and the recession, and all the rest,” one official remarked, “you could say that we have bottomed out and have no place to go but up.” In his address, Mr. Rockefeller said that this country had a “moral obligation” to back up the South Vietnamese Government with new military aid despite the misgivings of the Democratic Congress. “It's not a question of our men going back in there,” he said. “It's a question of a moral obligation negotiated by the Secretary of State which the Congress authorized.” South Vietnamese troops are “running out of ammunition” and “being encircled by Communist forces,” Mr. Rockefeller said, asserting that the “fate of South Vietnam was at stake.”"
FETUS'S SURVIVAL STRESSED IN CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/30/archives/fetuss-survival-stressed-in-case-it-breathed-outside-womb-doctor.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 29 (AP) —The prosecution rested today, using its final witness to emphasize the central theme of its case: that the fetus aborted by Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin could have lived if given the chance. Dr. Edelin, 36‐year‐old obstetrician at Boston City Hospital, is charged with manslaughter in the death of the fetus. The case has drawn national attention. Just two years after a United States Supreme Court decision overturning most state abortion regulations, the Edelin case enters delicate legal areas left open by that decision—when a human life begins and what responsibility a doctor has to an aborted fetus. After 17 days of testimony, the 14th and final witness, Dr. John F. Ward, a Pittsburgh pathologist, defended his assertion that the fetus had breathed outside the womb of its mother. Dr. Ward had testthed that his microscopic study of portions of the lungs showed evidence that the fetus breathed air after being removed from the uterus. Under cross‐examination today, however, he conceded that “it is not necessary for a baby to be alive to make respiratory efforts.” The issue is central to the case. Central Issue in Case The prosecutor, Newman A. Flanagan, contends the respiratory activity shows that the fetus was alive and could have survived outside its mother. The defense attorney, William P. Homans, argues that the fetus “never drew a single breath outside the body of the mother” and that therefore no person ever existed to be killed. Mr. Homans has also sought to indicate bias on the part of prosecution witnesses, eliciting the fact that four of them are active members of antiabortion organizations. Dr. Ward testified today that he is a member of a group called People Concerned for the Unborn Child, which opposes abortions as permitted by the Supreme Court's decision. Dr. Ward also showed an apparent difficulty in understanding Mr. Homans's questions and caused frequent objections with his rambling answers. At one point, looking at a photograph of one Of the slides from which he had made his conclusions, he said, “I don't have the best eyesight in the world.” The court heard arguments later in the day on a defense motion for dismissal of the case on the ground that the jury was selected in a manner that excluded women."
Rockefeller Visits State to Help G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/30/archives/rockefeller-visits-state-to-help-gop.html,"MILLBURN, Jan. 29 — In his first partisan political foray since being sworn into office Vast December, Vice President Rockefeller visited New Jersey tonight in an effort to revitalize a state Republican party that has been debilitated by Watergate, the disastrous gubernatorial campaign of Charles W.

Decision Is Challenged Last fall, officials of the Republican state finance committee, the sponsors of this evening's affair, declared that neither Mr. Sandman nor his financial backers would get any of the proceeds, a decisoin that was challenged in court yesterday by one of the former Re‐, presentative's most generous financial supporters, Vincent Citarelli, a West Caldwell insur‐1 ance executive.

While most top Republicans here are convinced that President Ford will seek election in 1976, Mr. Rockefeller and his friends in the state do not want to miss any opportunities in the event Mr. Ford changes his mind. The last time Mr. Rockefeller was in New Jersey was in October, 1973, when he was Governor of New York and Mr. Sandman was running for Governor here. However, Mr. Rockefeller's appearance then failed to raise a great deal of money and it did not prevent Mr. Sandman from suffering a stunning defeat. Last November, Mr. Sandman's political career seemed finished when he was defeated for re‐election to the House. Last March, Mr. Ford, who was then Vice President, appeared in the state under an unusual fund‐raising arrangement in which he would appear in North Jersey at a Republican State Committee affair and later in Atlantic City for Mr. Sandman. But those appearances did not bring in anything approaching the $100,000 Mr. Rockefeller raised tonight, almost eliminating the party's state debt. Tonight, neither Mr. Sandman or any of the Republican him were in evidence. Instead, the turnout of about 300 Republicans seemed more like what one official described as a “Republican coming‐out party.” And the mood reflected it. There was talk of winning the Assembly this fall and hope that the worst for Republicans was behind them. Even party officials wer not too concerned by the legal squabble over how tonight's proceeds would be spent. In his address, Mr. Rockefeller said that this country had a “moral obligation” to back up the South Vietnamese Government with new military aid despite the misgivings of the Democratic Congress. His remarks were regarded as the most impassioned Administration defense thus far of President Ford's determination to continue United States military aid in Indochina."
Juvenile Care,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/01/archives/juvenile-care.html,"Among those involved in the general effort to help children in need of assistance in New York State there is a broad consensus that the facilities for serving juveniles are strained and outmoded. Beyond shared fears and apprehensions, however, the consensus ends. The large migrations of poor people to Northern urban centers in the nineteen‐fifties and sixties, continued discrimination, and the impact on the birth rate legalized abortions—all have significantly changed the size and the nature of the youth population in trouble. Close observers believe that it has become larger and older. There are approximately 600,000 young people growup on welfare in the City of New York and almost 30,000 in the foster care system. Under the weight of such numbers and with the challenge of a significantly different kind of population in need, available services seem to serve neither the needs of children in trouble nor those of the society, which the most deeply troubled of those children endanger by aggressive or criminal behavior. The youth‐serving bureaucracy in the state is enormous. At least seven state agencies deal with youth problems, along with an equal number of city agencies. In addition, a complex of voluntary private agencies the city provides foster care and other specialized services. Despite this massive battery of agencies, there are few facilities for extended treatment of violent juveniles who, but for their youth, would be considered criminally insane. An general, facilities for juvenile offenders are so crowded that incarceration for even the most serious crimes is quite brief. Supportive services to enable deprived families to cope with child‐rearing problems are severely limited as are supportive services designed follow‐up detention. Although there is general agreement about these problems in the child services community, there is little agreement upon what the remedies ought to be. Professionals involved in the operation of one aspect of the system are quick to point out the limitations of other parts of it. Competition and jealousy exist where coordination and joint planning are required. The most urgent immediate requirement is for the state to exercise necessary political and fiscal authority to bring representatives of the disparate parts the child‐care system into one room to identify the system's gaps and develop a process to address them. Governor Carey comes to this problem’ with no responsibility for past failures, but with great potential liability for future disasters. He is uniquely positioned to institute a powerful coordinated attack on the system's failures. Both the numbers on agency charts and the realities on city streets forecast much grimmer problems ahead if strong remedial action is not taken soon."
DOCTOR DISPUTES ABORTION METHOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/01/archives/doctor-disputes-abortion-method-cites-broken-clocks-to-deny-charge.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 31—Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, on trial here for manslaughter in connection with an abortion, frowned on the witness stand as he stared at the photograph marked as Exhibit No. 10. It was a picture of an operating room at Boston City Hospital. The defense attorney, William P. Homans Jr., asked, “In what respect does it appear different” than on Oct'3, 1973, when it was used for the abortion. “The clocks,” Dr. Edelin replied. “I think both were broken and out for repairs that day.” There were gasps throughout the courtroom, then snickers from some of the many spectators sympathetic to the doctor. The testimony ran directly counter to the core of the prosecution's description of the case. In his opening argument, Newman A. Flanagan, the assistant District Attorney, had told the jury that Dr. Edelin “stood in the operating room with his hand in the mother and watched the clock for three to five minutes,” causing the “male child” — the aborted fetus—to die from a lack of oxygen. Central Act Not Disputed The trial of Dr. Edelin in Suffolk County Superior Court has become the focus of medical, religious and political controversy. The issues being thrashed out inside the courtroom have narrowed to semantic — indeed, metaphysical—questions. What is an abortion? At what point does independent human life begin? The central act is not in dispute. On Oct. 3, 1973, Dr. Edelin performed an abortion on 17‐year‐old woman, carefully identified in court only as “Alice Roe.” After several unsuccessful attempts to induce abortion by a saline injection, he used a technique known as a hysterotomy, a procedure similar to a Caesarean section, in which the fetus is removed through an incision in the mother's abdomen. At that time, there were no antiabortion statutes here. The United States Supreme Court had struck down the previous restrictions on Jan. 22, 1973, and new state laws had not yet been enacted. The controversy arose last spring, when antiabortion activists discovered an article in The New England Medical Journal, detailing experiments on fetal tissue from abortions at Boston City Hospital. The experimenters were seeking substitute for penicillin in the treatment of syphillis. The “right to life” forces brought the experiments to the attention of politicians in this aeavily Roman Catholic city. A 2.ity Council hearing featured representatives of the church and antiabortion speakers. DisAct Attorney Garrett Byrne, facing what appeared to be difficult Democratic primary against John .J. Kerrigan, the chairman of the School Cornmittee, opened an investigation. Four doctors were indicted al connection with the experiments, charged with violating an all‐but‐forgotten 19th century grave‐robbing statute. And Dr. Edelin was charged with manslaughter. Worked Without Pay The 36‐year‐old doctor was on the stand in his own defense today, the 18th day of trial. Medical sources said that he was one of only two doctors at Boston City Hospital willing to perform abortions, and that he often worked Saturdays without pay because of the backlog among impoverished women who make up much of the municipal hospital's clientele. The prosecution rested its case Wednesday, after calling 15 witnesses, including a number of doctors who belong to “right to life” organizations who testified as expert witnesses. The prosecution's chief witness was Dr. Enrique GimenezJimino, who had been a resident with Dr. Edelin at the hospital. He testified that he had watched the abortion, and that Dr. Edelin had stood, with his hand in the incision in the woman's body, watching the clock for at least three minutes. Under cross — examination, however, he was unable to recall where the clock was. In a hysterotomy, the surgeon, using his finger, detaches from the uterine wall the placenta and the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus. On the ‘stand, Dr. Edelin's hands moved swiftly as he demonstrated the practice. The prosecution contends that, in this case, the fetus was capable of life and that the physician was obligated to attempt to save it. The final prosecution witness, Dr. John B. Ward, a Pittsburgh pathologist said it was his opinion that the fetus had breathed outside the mother before it died. The prosecution contends that the fetus was at least 24 weeks old; the defense contends that it was approximately 20 to 22 weeks. Hospital records show that doctors made both estimates."
Legal Abortions Up 53% Since Court Ruled in ‘73,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/03/archives/legal-abortions-up-53-since-court-ruled-in-73-legal-abortions-up-53.html,"More than 745,000 legal abortions were performed in the United States in 1973—an increase of 27 per cent over the total for I972—according to the findings of the first nationwide survey to measure the impact of the landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion two years ago. In 1974, it has been estimated, the total rose to 900,000, about 53 per cent above 1972. The survey's principal investigator, Dr. Christopher Tietze, estimated that about one‐third of these abortions resulted in a decline in the numbers of births that would otherwise have occurred, but that two‐thirds of the abortions would have been done illegally had the law not been changed. Thus, he said, the Supreme Court decision, which affirmed a woman's right to obtain an abortion early in pregnancy, had a greater impact on public health than on the birth rate. The survey released yesterday, revealed that the Court's decision led to an increased availability of legal abortion services throughout the country, allowing many women to obtain abortions close to home. As of early last year, however, there were still great regional differences in the availability of abortions, with some states providing little service or none. The study, sponsored by the Alan Guttmacher Institute of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. showed that abortion clinics accounted for 90 per cent of the increase in the number of abortions performed following the Supreme Court decision. Of possible providers of abortion, the survey revealed that public hospitals were the slowest in developing abortion services with the probable result that poor women, who have the highest rates of unwanted and unplanned pregnancies, had the least access to safe abortions. Dr. Tietze, senior consultant with the Population Council, who is an international expert on abortion and its consequences., said that by replacing illegal abortions with legal ones, the Supreme Court's decision resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths caused by abortion from more than 300 a year in the nineteen‐sixties to 47 in 1973, according to data gathered by Center for Disease control in Atlanta, a division of the United States Public Health Service. However, in 1973, despite a substantial increase in legal abortion services, a fair number of illegal abortions continued to be performed, Dr. Tietze said. He based this statement on the fact that 25 of the 47 abortionrelated deaths that year resulted from illegally performed abortions. The survey, which was directed by Edward Weinstock and will be published in the forthcoming issue of Family Planning Perspectives, attempted to cover all hospitals, clinics and private physicians who might be performing abortions. In all, 2,991 possible abortion providers were questioned and 95 per cent responded. Of these, 1,284 hospitals, 160 clinics and 198 private physicians said they provided abortion services. The authors of the report, who include Dr. Frederick S. Jaffe and Joy G. Dryfoos, both of the Guttmacher Institute, estimated that their survey missed between 5 and 10 per cent of the number of abortions that were performed. During 1973. the survey, found, hospitals performed 394,300 abortions, clinics did 337,800 and private doctors reported performing only 13,200 abortions—two per cent of the total—in their own offices. By the first quarter of 1974, the number of abortions done in clinics exceeded those done in hospitals. “If clinics had not taken up the slack, it would have been difficult to meet the abortion demand,” Dr. Tietze told a news conference, “because the established health delivery system of the country did not rise to the occasion.” Of the hospitals surveyed, only 17 per cent of the public ones said they performed abortions, compared to 28 per cent of non‐Catholic voluntary and private hospitals. “In some states, we could not find any public hospitals that did abortions, and in others only one of perhaps 20 public hospitals provided abortion services,” Dr. Tietze reported. There were also great regional differences in the abortion rate — which is the number of abortions performed per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. In the South Central states, the rate was one‐tenth of that in the Middle Atlantic and Pacific states. The net result is that abortion services remain highly concentrated, with 7 per cent of All the providers doing 57 per cent of all the abortions, the survey found. A year after the Supreme Court ruling. California, New York, New Mexico. Kansas and the District of Columbia—all of which had nonrestrictive abortion laws and served large numbers of out‐of‐state women before the ruling — still performed nearly 45 per cent of the nation's total of legal abortions. In a few states where the Supreme Court's decision was countered by new restrictive state laws or rulings, the effect generally was to inhibit the establishment of any abortion services, even though in most uses the new laws or rulings were ultimately overturned in the courts. Dr. Tietze said he doubted that the current rate of abortions would have a pronounced demographic effect, since about half of abortion patients are either childless or have only one child and most would probably eventually have more children."

The woman, Neith Nevelson Richen, turned herself in to the Florence police when she was informed that a warrant had been issued for her arrest after the police raided the clinic Jan. 9. Six persons, including the doctor who headed, the clinic, were arrested in the raid, and warrants followed for Mrs. Richen and two others said to have been in the clinic at the time. The abortion issue is turning into one of Italy's most heated controversies. Legislation Sought In Rome last Sunday, the police arrested Adele Faccio, leader of the Center for Information on Sterilization and Abortion, which ran the clinic. Mrs. Faccio, 54 years old, was arrested as she addressed a national convention on abortion organized by the Radical party, a small civil‐rights group that has campaigned for legalization of abortion in Italy. The party's leader, Gianfranco Spadaccia, was arrested in Rome several days after the raid on the clinic after he publicly declared his party's “political co‐responsibility” for the activities of the information center. Mrs. Richen, who is 29 years old and comes from New York, was arrested on charges of having aided the practice of abortion and of association to commit a crime. She has pleaded not guilty, although she admits she was in the clinic when the raid took place. She is being held in the Santa Verdiana women's prison in Florence. Her attorneys, Carlo Colombo and Fulvio Nicolodi, issued their statement after their routine request that Mrs. Richen be released in her own recognizance was turned down this week by a Florence court. The lawyers pointed out that such provisional release had already been granted to five persons held on similiar charges. In addition to Mrs. Richen, those still in jail in connection with the raid include Dr. Giorgio Conciani, who headed the clinic, Mr. Spadaccia and Mrs. Faccio. Two other persons —including another American woman — are being sought by the police. The information center and the Radical party have announced plans to open new abortion clinics throughout Italy as soon as doctors and nurses for them can be found. A drive is under way to organize a referendum on repeal of the ban on abortion. The campaign to legalize abortion is strongly opposed by the dominant Christian Democratic party. The Italian criminal code provides for up to five years in prison on conviction in abortion cases. All attempts at easing the ban since the fall of Fascism have run into stern opposition from the Roman Catholic Church."

At least 75 persons were reported killed and nearly 200 wounded in what was described as the heaviest fighting since the rebel movement began in 1962. [Page 1, Columns 3‐4.] In another step in an expanding Iranian military presence in the Persian Gulf area, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran has “guaranteed” Oman against intruding foreign aircraft, the commander of Oman's armed forces said, by committing his air force to combat the intruders if Oman so requests. The Iranian commitment is evidently directed mainly against the radical Government of Southern Yemen. [1:2.] National Democrats in Congress might propose tax cut as large as $22‐billion—$6 billion more than proposed by President Ford, Al Ullman, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a television interview. Mr. Ullman, Democrat of Oregon, also said that the President's goal of reducing foreign oil imports by a million barrels a day was “unrealistic.” [1:8.] Consumers who expect retail sugar prices to follow the recent 50 per cent drop in market quotations for raw sugar in bulk will probably be keenly disappointed. Not only will consumer prices for months to come reflect the record sugar costs paid by refiners last autumn, but consumers also will have to contend with worldwide shortages for a long time after the costly sugar moves through the commercial pipeline. [1:7.] Cartha D. Deloach, the former No. 3 man in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified under oath in 1973 that the bureau investigated Spiro T. Agnew shortly before the 1968 election it the request of President Johnson. In heretofore unpublished testimony, Mr. Deloach, who had been assistant to the F.B.I.'s director, asserted that President Johnson asked the bureau to investigate Mr. Agnew on a matter of “the gravest national security” and that an investigation was conducted. The White House, he said believed the Republicans were trying to slow down the South Vietnamese from going the Paris peace talks. [1:6.] The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it monitored millions of longdistance calls between 1965 and 1970 as part of an effort to stop cheating on toll charges. The voice recordings were first reported by The St. Louis Post‐Dispatch. A spokesman for A. T. & T. said that “I don't think we did anything illegal” and that he could not confirm the newspaper's figure of 1.5 million calls recorded and sent to New York for analysis. He said that about 500 fraudulent calls were discovered over the five‐year period.

Nurses’ Account Backs Doctor in Abortion Trial,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/05/archives/nurses-account-backs-doctor-in-abortion-trial.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 4 (UPI)—Two nurses testified today that Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin could not have watched a wall clock while a fetus died during an abortion he performed because there were no clocks in the operating room. The testimony of the two nurses, Ellen Curtis and Ruth Cox, supported Dr. Edelin's, recollection that the operating room clock had been removed for repairs the day of the abortion that led to his indictment for manslaughter. Miss Curtis, who assisted Dr. Edelin in the October, 1973, operation, said that she was certain there was no clock on the wall the day of the abortion at Boston City Hospital. Mrs. Cox, now the head operating room nurse, testified that “the clock was missing from the wall of Operating Room No. 2” on Oct. 3, 1973—the day of the abortion and alleged manslaughter. Their testimony challenged that of the main prosecution witness. A Different Account Dr. Enrique Gimenez‐Jimeno, the only state's witness present at tile abortion, testified that he had seen Dr. Edelin stand and watch the operating room clock for at “least three minutes” instead of trying to save the fetus, which, the prosecution contends, was developed enough to sustain life. But Miss Curtis said, “There were no clocks on the wall of Operating Room No. 2 at that time. The [wall] timer wasn't working and the clock was missing.” Under questioning from Dr. Edelin's attorney, William Hornans, Miss Curtis denied Dr. Gimenez‐Jimeno's allegation that Dr. Edelin, then chief hospital resident obstetrician, had stopped in the middle of the abortion for any reason. “He was moving his hand around,” she said. “He never looked at any clock.” She also supported Dr. Edclin's recollection that the abortion had been performed in Operating Room No. 2. Dr. Gimenez‐Jimeno in testimony two weeks ago first said he believed that Operating Room No. I had been used but under Mr. Homans's crossexamination, said he was unsure which room had been used."
The Supreme Court at Work: A Look at the Inner Sanctum,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/06/archives/the-supreme-court-at-work-a-look-at-the-inner-sanctum-the-supreme.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 —It might be the board room of an affluent, long‐established bank in Boston or Philadelphia. The walls are paneled in oak, a crystal chandelier hangs from the high, coffered ceiling, and a Colonial portrait above a marble fireplace overlooks a long table covered in black leather. But the red‐robed figure in the portrait is John Marshall, the first Chief Justice of the United States, and the men who gather around the table below him twice a week do not represent private wealth but the single most concentrated source of public power outside the Presidency itself. It is the conference room of the Supreme Court, the judicial branch. It is one of the least public places in this democratic government but, with almost majestic irony, it is a place where critically important decisions are reached. This report is cneant to open the doors of that room and give the public at least a glimpse of how those men who can overrule the President of the United States and the entire Congress—and often do —conduct their deliberations. No one but the nine Justices—eight while William 0. Douglas remains incapacited—is allowed in the room on Wednesday afternoon and all day Friday, while they deliberate, not even the clerk of the Court. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger himself records their actions by hand. Officially, these conferences never take place at all. The only evidence of their existence comes when a list of preliminary decisions, accepting a few cases for review and rejecting many more, is handed down from the bench the following Monday and released simultaneously in the court's pressroom. Final decisions reached at the same conference, rulings resolving disputes that have been argued before the Justices, do not materialize until weeks, or often months later, when they are handed down from the bench by the Chief Justice. The opinions are issued in printed page proofs that will ultimately become the official Court reports. The confessional secrecy that surrounds the conference and its results is intended to prevent premature disclosure of the sort of decision that would have galvanic impact on the stock market, such as a major antitrust divestiture order. Authorities generally agree that announcements of major changes in social or legal policy, like school desegregation, reapportionment or the legalization of abortion, should reach all the affected parties simultaneously and in full, rather than through piecemeal leaks that may later prove true or false. Over the years, this insistence on maintaining absolute secrecy as to what the Justices decide has tended to expand automatically to cover how they decide, cloaking the entire operation of the Court in a kind of unnecessary and undemocratic mystery. For a typical conference, the Justices meet at 9:30 on Friday morning in the conference room, which is actually a large ceremonial anteroom between the two offices of Chief Justice Burger. He uses one for private study and opinion writing and the other for his more public administrative work. Chief Justice Burger sits at the east end of the conference table, and the others are seated clockwise by seniority. This puts Justice Douglas on his immediate left and Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Potter Stewart and Byron R. White down that side of the table. Justice Thurgood Marshall sits at the other end facing the Chief Justice, and the three most recent appointees of former President Richard M. Nixon, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr., and William H. Renquist, occupy the right side. On the table in front of each Justice are pads, pencils and pens. Mr. Burger designed a vertical wooden stand for the notebook in which he keeps track of cases, and three other Justices have adopted the idea. Behind each Justice's chair is a cart which his law clerks have arranged all the legal papers he may need to support his position on different cases. The conference opens with consideration of a list of cases, prepared by Mr. Burger two weeks earlier, that have been filed with the Court by parties seeking reversal of lower Court rulings. The Justices must decide whether each of them is worthy of further consideration or not. On an average Friday, there may be 150 cases on this list, and it takes about three hours to separate the small amount of wheat from the almost suffocating load of chaff. In the course of an October — to ‐June term, the Justices agree to hear and decide about 150 cases out of some 5,000 filed. (It must be explained that about half those 5,000 cases are “in for‐ma pauperis,” requests for relief submitted under simplified legal requirements by poor people who cannot afford lawyers, the great majority of them prison inmates challenging their conviction. Most of these petitions are without legal merit; the Justices accept only 20 to 30 a year.) In making these preliminary decisions, the Justices deal with a list much smaller than the conference list, called the “discuss list.” It includes any case that one or more of the Justices regarded as worth at least talking about; cases that do not make this list, which means about 70 per cent of them, do not come up at the conference and are automatically rejected. For each case on the discuss list, Chief Justice Burger gives an oral summary and tells his brethren, as the Justices refer to one another, what action he is inclined to take. Then each Justice, in descending order of seniority, gives his views. Anyone can pass, to get the benefit of later discussion or because he has nothing new to contribute. Then the Justices vote, also beginning with Mr. Burger and working down the seniority scale. They used to vote in inverse order, enabling the senior men to see how the court was going before cornmiting themselves, but that practice has been dropped. At 11 A.M. on Friday the Justices take a 10‐minute refreshment break. But the clerk who wheels in the refreshments is the only ether human being permitted in the room. So sensitive are some of the senior Justices about the sanctity of the conference that they recently refused to allow a photographer, who had been given blanket authority to roam the rest of the building, to take their picture around the conference table. The preliminary rulings on accepting or rejecting cases are usually finished by 12.30 P.M. when the Justices take 45 minutes for lunch. Then they devote the afternoon, until about 5 P.M. to deciding the dozen cases that had been argued in the courtroom earlier in the same week. Supplementary Meeting That process is essentially the same as the morning routine, except that each case gets substantially more attention. The Chief Justice summarizes and gives his view, his colleagues follow in order and the vote is taken in the same order. Because the Court has experienced increasing difficulty in disposing of all the cases argued earlier in the week on Friday afternoons, Mr. Burger has scheduled a supplementary conference at 3 P.M. on Wednesdays just after the week's arguments have closed. Ordinarily, 12 cases are argued each week for 14 weeks during the term, cr four each on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. By adding the Wednesday session to the conference, the Justices have six hours of discussion on cases or an average of 30 minutes each. While this may seem short to the parties in any given dispute, each of the Justices has already read the briefs, heard an hour of oral argument during which he could question attorneys for both sides, and discussed the issues involved with his law clerks, who are the top law school graduates in the country. During the preliminary acceptance and rejection of cases for review, each of the two dozen nonpauper cases that make the weekly “discuss list” thus gets an average of seven or eight minutes of debate. But once again all the Justices have read and discussed the legal papers in chambers before. Within a week after each conference, the Chief Justice assigns the task of writing the opinion to one of the Justices who voted in the majority, taking both major and minor cases himself. The dissent, if any, is normally assigned, in the same fashion, by the senior dissenting Justice. Then within a matter of days or weeks, the first draft of the majority opinion begins its rounds through the Justices’ offices. Often suggestions from concurring Justices will result in changes. The minority opinion is usually not written until its author has had a chance to examine the majority opinion in detail, distinguishing their claimed sources of authority. Last‐Minute Changes During this gestation process, Justices sometimes change their minds. A refined draft of the majority opinion may convert an initial dissenter. Or a particularly wellreasoned dissent may persuade a lukewarm member of the original majority that his doubts were correct. These shifts in position affect only the outcome of a case, obviously, when a Justice on the prevailing side of a 5‐to‐4 ruling as yet unannounced, decides to join the other side, thus suddenly converting it from the minority to the majority. Sometimes these late switches are detectable in the opinions. Most majority opinions are detailed, positive legal positions without much reference to the arguments of the minority. But once or twice a year, lawyers and reporters will find that a majority opinion seems, in a puzzling way, to be largely devoted to criticizing the minority's case rather than building one of its own. Usually, this is a sign of a last‐minute reversal, so late in the opinion — circulating cycle that only a little hasty rewriting was possible. Any Justice can change his mind on a given case at any time before the decision is announced in open court. This persistent uncertainty creates additional pressure to keep votes secret during the time that opinions are being circulated and reworked. Demeanor in the conference is reported to be relaxed. Justices who later draft pointed, even angry dissents rarely if ever raise their voices in the heat of ideological confrontation, it is said, and sometimes soften their written opposition in redrafting dissents. Normally, it takes about two months between the time that the Justices vote on a case and the release of opinnions. This can be accelerated dramatically when circumstances demand, as it was last fall for the challenge to the Railroad Reorganization Act, in which a swift resolution was imperative for the industry. The Most Important Cases The most important and newsworthy decisions of a term are frequently handed down during its closing days because it took longer than the usual six weeks or two months to arrive at language with which everyone could agree. Throughout the nine‐month term, the Court alternates between two and a half weeks of public activity and 10 days of recess. During the recesses the Justices prepare to screen decisions at the next conference, research cases that are to be argued, and work on opinions. In a typical sequence, the Justices will hold their first conference of this month on Feb. 14, followed by arguments for three days a week the next two weeks and conferences on the next two Wednesdays and Fridays. After handing down decisions on March 3 they will recess until a conference March 14 and a decision day March 17. Reporters covering the Supreme Court are never given any advance warning of when a final decision in any case may be coming down. They do receive, on a semiconfidential basis, a list of cases due for preliminary acceptance or rejection in advance of each Friday conference. Such lists do not guarantee that the Court will dispose of all the matters on them; they do provide assurance that the Justices will not agree or refuse to review any pending case that is not on the list, to permit some advance study of the news that may or may not be made each Monday."

Election of a Republican Hailed as Blow at Carey,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/06/archives/election-of-a-republican-hailed-as-blow-at-carey.html,"ALBANY, Feb. 5—Jubilant Senate Republicans today introduced their newest member, Dale M. Volker of Depew, asserting that his victory in a special election was “a clear repudiation of Governor Carey's massive tax program.” Mr. Volker, a former Assemblyman, won the Senate seat from the western part of the state. Last November, along will six other Republican Assemblymen from the area, he was defeated when the Democrats swept the election. F or the special election last Tuesday, Mr. Volker campaigned strenuously against the Governor's proposed $806‐million tax package, especially against the 10‐cent‐a‐gallon increase in the gasoline tax. “The gasoline tax was the key issue,” Mr. Volker said in an interview here. “People in my area are really opposed to it. The tax would be worse for them than anywhere else in the state, and would only serve to further depress the area.” Mr. Volker said that the gasoline tax issue resulted in an extremely heavy turnout for a special election, with 30 per cent of those eligible going to the polls. He defeated his democratic opponent, Franklin A. Stachowiak, for the seat formerly bled by Senator Thomas F. McGowan, a Buffalo Republican who resigned following his re‐election last November to accept an appointment as a Supreme Court justice. ‘A Clear Referendum’ Unofficial returns in the special election gave Mr. Volker 31,053 votes on the Republican and Conservative lines to 16,890 for his opponent. “The election Was a clear referendum on the Governor's performance so far,” said Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader, as he brought Mr. Volker around the Capitol press room. “It is more than a strong indicator that the people upstate and throughout the state are not in sympathy with the Governor's proposals. “They're speaking out vociferously when they get a chance, and this was their chance.” Mr. Volker said that voters in the area were particularly incensed by what they felt was the Governor's promise during his election campaign of no new taxes and his talk of huge surpluses hidden in the state's coffers by the Republicans. Mr. Volker's election, which must still be certified by the Board of Elections, makes him the first Republican in the state to win on Row B. The Republicans lost the Row A line on the ballot because of Mr. Carey's victory in November. Other action here included the following: ASSEMBLY VOTES The Assembly, meeting for 38 minutes before fleeing the snowstorm that enveloped the capital, passed three routine measures, including a bill already approved by the Senate that will eliminate women's exemption from jury duty, to bring New York into conformity with the recent ruling by the United States Supreme Court. With a sea of waving hands and snapping fingers, Assemblymen had their names put on a resolution asking that the Governor proclaim “Catholic School Week.” Speaker Stanley Steingut asked that those who did not want to be sponsors raise their hands; only Melvin Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, raised his hand. ROSENBAUM CHARGES The Republican State Chairman, Richard Rosenbaum, held one of his multiple‐announcement news conferences, this one to criticize the Carey administration for being so slow to organize itself that it “approaches atrophy,” to denounce last weekend's furniture raids by Democratic staff members Ion Republican Assemblymen's !offices, and to urge the Governor's appointees to make “total financial disclosure.” NURSING HOME INQUIRY Alan G. Hevesi, a Queens Democrat, was appointed to the Temporary St ate Commission on Living Costs and the Economy, which has been conducting the investigation of nursing homes. He replaces Franz Leichter as Assembly appointee; Mr. Leichter has been elected to the Senate. Mr. Hevesi, chairman of the Assembly subcommittee on health care, said that omnibus legislation on residential and institutional care would focus on nursing homes “because of the recent revelations regarding abysmal conditions.” HOT LINE The Senate “hot line""—a tollfree telephone number that can be dialed to get information on the status of bills in the legislative process, is again in operation. The number (800342‐9860) can be dialed from anywhere in the state. ABORTION Senator Frank Padavan, Republican of Queens, has introduced a bill restricting the performance of an abortion on anyone under 18 years of age without first obtaining the consent of the parent or legal guardian. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Assemblyman Leonard Silverman, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, called for an increase in unemployment benefits in an amount sufficient to permit persons who lose their jobs to pay for the increased costs of healthinsurance premiums when they are forced to shift from group to individual coverage. PAYROLL GRIPE Assembly Republican staff workers complained that their pay‐checks had been delayed by the new Democratic majority, but Joseph F. Crangle, the majority counsel, said the checks would be along in a few days and had been held up by paperwork attendant on “an act of generosity,” not partisanship—delaying the removal of some Republicans from the payroll immediately so they could find work elsewhere."
The Equal Rights Amendment: Missouri Is the Target Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/07/archives/the-equal-rights-amendment-missouri-is-the-target-now.html,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Feb. 6 — As they swept through the dim corridors on the third floor of the old state capitol here, the pinchfaced, middle‐aged man in horn‐rimmed glasses suddenly brought his followers to halt, jamming the passageway. He was the Rev. John Percley of the Baptist Bible College of Springfield in conservative southwestern Missouri. And he was on mission. Blinking in the unfamiliar glare of television lights, as he stood in the front rank of a phalanx of fresh‐faced girls in modest dresses and shorthaired boys in neat jackets, the Rev. Percley declared: “We believe that male and female were made by God. And we believe that there is a difference. We don't represent a religious group, but we are all Christian people.” Seven Busloads The Rev. Percley was a leader of the 300 or so people from the Springfield area, mostly students, who had chartered seven buses to come to this Missouri River town to beseech their legislators not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment passed by Congress in 1972. The proposed amendment has been approved by the legislatures of 34 states, most recently by North Dakota this week, and it needs only four more to become the 27th to be added to the United States Consttution. (Two states, Nebraska and Tennessee, have voted to rescind their actions, but there is a strong body of legal opinion that it can't be done.) For the E.R.A. Coaltion, an umbrella organization for more than 60 women's groups avidly supporting the amendment, Missouri is a key target. The amendment sounds simple enough: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” And it moved swiftly to ratification in many states during the early going. But the remaining holdouts, such as Missouri, where it was defeated in the House of Representatives in 1973 and failed to reach the floor of either state legislative body lasL year. tend to be more conservative. Fear of Amendment What is more, local groups, made up largely in this state of Fundamentalist Protestants and worried Roman Catholics, have decided that the amendment would clear the way for everything from totally unrestricted abortions to homosexual marriages to sexually integrated public rest rooms. Not to mention their loudly voiced concern that it would inevitably lead to the breakdown of the institutions of marriage and the family by absolving husbands of the responsibility for wife and child support. “We believe that the citizens of our state—with the exception of a few radical groups — are opposed to E.R.A. or would be if they knew what it was all about,” the Rev. Pereley avowed. “We think the silent majority should be heard and the silent majority is opposed to this.” In the rear ranks of the Springfield assemblage as it straggled on down the hall in search of legislators to convert, were Charlene Walker, a 19‐year‐old Baptist Bible College student wearing a homemade “ERA Vote No” tag. “We got a whole bunch of people together to come up here to go against this E.R.A.,” she said in a tiny, little‐girl voice. “I didn't really know what it was until a couple of days ago when this lady explained it to us in detail. I don't know her name, but she spoke to us at the church.” Casting nervous glances down the corridor as she sensed she might lose her disappearing colleagues in the labyrinthine passages of the State House, she tried to explain why she was against the amendment. “I think if the bill is made to pass,” she said, “the women will have equal rights to the men and they can be drafted and in the dormitories, it can be mixed. Oh, yes, and homosexuality will be O.K. and they can adopt children. I don't really approve of that.” With that, she hurried off to catch her group, some of whose members were distributing a leaflet entitled “Ladies! Have you heard?,” published by an organization called W.W.W.W. (for Women Who Want to be Women), which has a Fort Worth, Tex., mailing address. “God created you and gave you a beautiful and exalted place to fill,” the leaflet said in part. “No women in history have ever enjoyed such privileges, luxuries, and freedom as American women. Yet, a tiny majority of dissatisfied, highly vocal, militant women insist that you are being exploited as ‘domestic drudge’ and ‘pretty toy.’ And they are determined to liberate you—whether you want it not!” ‘Right Not to Work’ Among other things, the leaflet warned, women would lose their “right not to work,” their husbands in the armed forces would be forced to share “sleeping quarters, rest rooms, showers, and/or foxholes with women” and not only public rest rooms but also “all public schools, college dormitories and hospital rooms” would be required to “desexigrate.” It was Tuesday when the Springfield contingent descended upon the capital. And that turnout, the largest outpouring of opponents they had seen, coupled with a rapidly intensifying letterwriting and telephone campaign by Pro‐Life and Stop E.R.A. movements, added to the growing concern among supporters of the amendment. Although they had always assumed the vote in the Senate would be close, they had been confident a few weeks ago of a relatively easy victory in the House, since several opponents of the amendment in that body had been defeated in November. Now they were not so sure. The word was around that their strength was being eroded, particularly among out‐ofstate legislators who were being subjected to considerable constituent pressure on their weekends home. Plotting Strategy So there was an air of tension at lunchtime that day in the Governor's office as Gov. Christopher S. Bond. a youthful Republican, and his wife, Carolyn, both strong advocates of the amendment, met to plot strategy with John D. Deardourff, whose Washington political consulting firm has been retained by the National Federation of Business and Professional Women to handle the E.R.A. coalition's national campaign. Between bites on a McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, the darkhaired Governor pointed out on a list of legislators the ones he thought his wife should try to call or see that afternoon. “You can catch them in their offices,” he said. “Find out where their offices are. The best thing is to just drop by.” “Gee, it's very close, isn't it?” Mrs. Bond said with a sigh. Mr. Deardourff had been hoping for more time to nail down the votes. He had been in Oklahoma where the amendment was defeated a couple of weeks ago because supporters had overestimated their strength. But with apparent erosion in the House here, the sponsors were eager for a vote before it got worse. “It's very tight,” said Representative S. Sue Shear of Clayton, a St. Louis suburb, looking nervous behind her desk in a crowded fourthfloor office. “We're afraid to let it be bandied around any longer. On weekends, they're putting a lot of pressure on.” She and Representative Harold L. Volkmer, another Democrat, from Hannibal, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, have been the chief sponsors of the amendment this session. “Close, close, awful close,” muttered Mr. Volkmer. “It's not a sure thing. It could go either way.” As an issue, people on both sides concur, the amendment was hard to figure. Democrats hold about a two‐to‐one edge in both houses, but some are for and some against it. Republicans are split about the same way, as are ideological conservatives and liberals of both parties. Some Roman Catholics, such as Mr. Volkmer and Speaker Richard J. Rabbitt of St. Louis, have been supporters; others are irrevocably opposed. Even some women legislators are strong opponents of the resolution. Not on Party Lines In the Senate, observers agree, the issue has more political overtones, but not along strict party lines. Senator William J. Cason of Clinton, also a .Catholic, wants the Democratic nomination for Governor next year and is counting on his backing of E.R.A. for help. He has lined up his forces behind it and has chided Governor Bond for his inability so far to win over more Republicans for the measure, which needs 18 votes to pass the Senate. “I've got 14 out of 24 Democratic votes,” Senator Cason declared. “There are only two out of 11 Republican votes and they were for it before the Governor. If he doesn't produce at least four‐elevenths of his party, we're in trouble.” Difficult Decision But some stanch Democrats, such as Mary L. Gant of Kansas City and John D. Schneider of St. Louis, are opposed, too. “I had a lot of trouble making up my mind,” Mrs. Gant said. “I know there is discrimination against women. But the thing that frighten me about the Equal Rights Amendment is that biologically, physically, psychologically, emotionally, women are different. I don't care to be a person. As far I'm concerned, there are two kinds of persons, men and women, and I am a woman.” Senator Schneider, who said he started out in favor of the amendment and decided after a long examination of it that it was “bad constitutional law,” is afraid that it may alter concepts of marriage and the family that have come down through thousands of years of JudeoChristian tnadition. With the prospects of such a close vote and with such committed opposition within his own party, Senator Cason said he would probably wait at least two weeks before bringing the resolution to the floor. Meanwhile, the E.R.A. forces in the House, with the assistance of the coalition's full‐time lobbyist and a number of volunteers, scurried around until they decided Tuesday night that they probably had 85 votes, three more than they needed. Yesterday they brought the resolution to the floor for the required preliminary vote. But their opponents had a surprise for them. Representative Robert O. Snyder, the minority leader, introduced a substitute that would have required a referendum to determine the sentiments of the people. It was narrowly defeated 84 to 77. “He didn't tell the Governor he was going to do that,” Mr. Deardourff complained. “That would have been on the ballot in ‘76. The Governor said, ‘Get down there and tell some of those people we don't care how they vote on the resolution, but we can't run with that on the ballot next year.’ We had to switch about five Republican votes on the floor.” Tentative Approval After more debate and more switching, the resolution itself won tentative approval by 84 to 75. Late into last evening the E.R.A. people lobbied frantically to keep their slim majority from shifting again or leaving town. They even called the White House to elicit support from Betty Ford. This morning Mrs. Ford called two wavering Republicans, Representatives Margaret Miller and William E. Stoner, whose constituents had been among those southwestern Missouri opponents who had swarmed the capitol Tuesday. She reminded them that she and the President were supporters of the amendment. After a couple of hours of desultory debate, which started shortly after the First Lady's call, the vote on the resolution was taken. It passed, 82 to 75, with a bare constitutional majority. Representatives Miller and Stoner voted aye. “I just hope we did the right thing,” said Representative Stoner. “On to the Senate,” Mrs. Ellen Walters of St. Louis, president of the Missouri E.R.A. Coalition declared. “Eighty‐two votes, that was a close thing,” Senator Cason, the Democratic sponsor in their party said with a thin smile, “but I'll settle for 18.” And that's what he needs to win in the Senate:"
New Brazilian City Rises Next to the Old,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/08/archives/new-brazilian-city-rises-next-to-the-old.html,"SALVADOR, Brazil—This ancient colonial capital, famous for its mad carnivals, religious festivals, spicy cuisine and mellow, easy‐going life, is acquiring a new modern image as it moves into the modern in‐dustrial age. “We’ll lose a little of our paradise,” Dr. Mario Kertész, the 30‐year‐old Secretary of Planning for the state of Bahia, conceded in a recent interview, but he emphasized, “Our aim is to build the future of Salvador without destroying its past.” The old city center is being restored while, 10 miles away, an entirely new Salvador is growing out of the tropical bush. Superhighways have been cut into the deep red earth to link Salvador to the vast new Aratu Industrial Center, the Camaçari petrochemical complex and the administrative center still under construction. A New Bus Terminal A new main bus terminal has been built here and the wholesale market and the evening newspaper, A Tarde, were moved to the area a few months ago. The city's first modern shopping center is going up and the woods have been marked out for residential development. The first capital of Brazil when it was still a Portuguese colony, Salvador was an important farm center until the 18th century, when it fell into a slow decline. “We’re in complete transformation,” Dr. Kertész declared. “The gap between rich and poor is still broad, but a middle class is starting to appear, and the 50 families who used to run things in Bahia are not so big now.” The modern development of Salvador has not gone without criticism. “Social problems are worse than ever,” the Rev. Jeronimo de Sã Cavalcante, a Benedictine friar, declared. “Development attracts more people to the city, but the factory jobs and social infrastructure — schools, hospitals, transport, housing—haven’t kept up with the population growth.” Friar Jeronimo warned that Brazil would face the same problems as India if such disparities continued to grow. He favors family planning as “a fundamental theological right” and shook the country two weeks ago when he declared, “It's just as grave a sin to bring a human being into the world without decent living conditions as to practice abortion.” Other critics have attacked the new industrial centers for provoking a general rise in the cost of living while costing taxpayers dearly. There are now 68 companies at the Aratu Industrial Center and 22 more are in the process of moving in for a total investment of over $600‐million. American concerns operating there include du Pont, Cummins, Union Carbide and Dow Chemical. This month the first terminal of a new deep‐water port will be inaugurated. Space a Problem “Our chief difficulty now is finding space,” said Carlos Ney Pires Franca, the budgeting and programing assistant for Aratu. He conceded that land was sold at a “suicide price” of 37 centavos, or five United States cents, a square meter and that the state was still spending more on roads and other amenities than it was receiving from the companies in taxes. He said that while Aratu employed only 16,235 workers’ last year it provided 64,9401 indirect jobs in construction’ and such services as trucking. One problem with decentralization is that most people do not want to move out of Salvador and, anyway, there is really’ no place yet for them to go. There are only 800 houses in the workers’ housing development at Aratu and not all are occupied. Plans for 1,200 more houses have been held up for lack of funds. Estelita Guimaraes da Silva, the wife of a welder, said she liked living at Aratu “because’ it's calmer than the city and there's more space.” But she complained that prices at the local pharmacy and supermarket were twice as high as those in the city, sewers were blocked and there was so much dust and so many mosquitoes it was difficult to sleep. “Most people don’t want to live at Aratu because there's nothing to do,” she added. Dr. Kertész pointed out that Salvador was growing by 4 per cent annually and insisted that decentralization was necessary “to save the city.” In 1950, the population was 389,422; today, it is estimated at over. 1.2 million."
City Welfare Rolls Expected to Reach 1.2 Million in 1976,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/10/archives/city-welfare-rolls-expected-to-reach-12-million-in-1976-increase-on.html,"Welfare officials are forecasting increases of 250,000 people on New York City's relief rolls in a 20‐month period starting this spring. They say that if the current Federal economic forecasts are accurate, more than 1.2 million people, or 15 per cent of the city's population, will be on the rolls by late next year. The city's Human Resources Administration is seeking an increase of more than a quarter of a billion dollars for its 1975‐76 budget to pay for the increase in cases it expects from the continuing recession and also to permit a 5 per cent increase in allowances for rent. At the same time, James R. Dumpson, the Human Resources Administrator, is urging that the state attack the problem of poverty by setting up a program to create public‐service jobs. In this, he proposes at least 10,000 full‐time jobs for home‐relief recipients here who are able to work. The city's present Work Relief Employment Project is a demonstration program the state has authorized only until May 31. This is currently providing about 9,100 jobs, mostly half‐time, in municipal agencies, paying wages to home‐relief recipients out of state and local home‐relief funds, and Mr. Dumpson says this number is less than half the total of home‐relief employables. In addition, the city has not quite $84‐million allocated for 12‐month periods by the Federal Labor Department for public‐service jobs. This could provide the equivalent of 12,000 jobs at $7,000 a year, but priority is set for the unemployed and veterans ahead of relief clients. Urging a greater effort to find jobs for welfare employables, Mr. Dumpson warns that the cost in idleness can be demoralizing — and more disruptive in the long run. Large‐scale unemployment is pushing “have‐nots further from the poverty escape hatch,” Mr. Dumpson says. How, he asks, can welfare clients compete “against the skilled and experienced workers now flooding the marketplace?” Under new reporting tabulations that count Work Relief Employment Project participants in the welfare caseload, as has been insisted upon by state, Henry J. Rosner, the city's assistant commissioner of social services, says welfare rolls here grew by an average of nearly 8,000 a month from last September through December. 12,000 a Month Predicted The revised data show increases of 11,419 in September, 7,779 in October, 647 in November and an estimated 11,789 in December for a tentative yearend total of 981,800. Mr. Rosner foresees increases rising to 12,000 a month by June or earlier, and an over‐all rise of 250,000 before federally forecast economic recovery begins. “We do have a correlation to unemployment,” Mr. Rosner says. “First, more people apply. Second, cases on the rolls are less likely to find jobs. Our people tend to be unaffected by unemployment insurance.” “People attached to the regular labor force may get unemployment insurance benefits now up to 52 weeks—and we may not see them at all,” he said. “We get the marginal or never employed.” If the welfare rolls rise to 1:2 million here next year, Commissioner Rosner says, the total will still be only about half the city's poor people, whose number he estimates at 2.4 million, or 30 per cent of the population. Aside from people on welfare, there are 230,000 aged, blind and disabled poor receiving Federal Supplemental Security Income here, according to the Social Security Administration. This is the nationwide guaranteed‐income program that replaced welfare for such poor at the start of last year. The home‐relief catch‐all category would normally see early impacts from a worsening economy. This is the program for the working poor—individuals or families with both parents present—with aid shared by the state and city and no Federal participation. Over the last year, homerelief has been edging upward, with 133,000 people estimated on the rolls here last December, or 13.5 per cent of the welfare caseload. This was 12,450 above the year before, when the proportion was 12.3 per cent. Fewer Getting Off Rolls The rest of December's welfare rolls included 839,907 persons, or 85.5 per cent, in the category of aid to dependent children, usually cases with a mother and children but no father present, and 8,893, or 0.9 per cent, in aid to dependent children—unemployed parent. In the latter case, both parents are on hand, but the father is temporarily unemployed or works less than 100 hours a month. People go on and off welfare, depending upon how much they can help themselves. The average stay may be about two and a half years, according to city estimates. With the worsening recession, the movement off home relief has slowed during the last year. Thus, 4,611 individual or family cases went off home relief here in December, in contrast to 5,588 cases closed in December, 1973. Data available for the first 10 months last year indicate that only 8 per cent of homerelief cases closed during that period were terminated because of jobs. On the other hand, 13 per cent closed their cases on home relief, only to be transferred into the aid‐to dependent‐children categories, a fact suggesting that working poor members had lost even their meager jobs. Home‐relief caseloads “used to be more reflective of the labor market” than they are now, according to Max Waldgeir, the city's first deputy commissioner of social services. Now home‐relief rolls have been swelled by poor people formerly considered disabled, but not meeting the more rigorous disability standard of the Supplemental Security Income program, Mr. Waldgeir says. Home relief is also providing aid for three months or more while the aged, blind and disabled poor undergo Federal processing for Supplemental Security Income, according to Samuel Elber, assistant administrator of the Human Resources Administration for public affairs. Family Planning Seen Helping Aid — to — dependent — children caseloads would be even higher if not for present‐day family planning programs and the state's permissive abortion law, according to Commissioner Rosner. Cases in the dependent‐children category now average about 3.5 persons each, down from 3.7 in 1971. The mathematical decrease of 0.2 for 300,000 cases, Commissioner Rosner notes, could mean 60,000 people. Welfare grants have been running about $97 a month a person in the dependentchildren category as of last October. This represents a rise from not quite $78 the year before, attributable to an increase in the basic grant last July 1 and to rising costs of rent. Assuming an increase of 12,000 people on welfare a month during the city budget year starting next July 1, and assuming the present basic grant and a 5 per cent rise in rents, the Human Resources Administration has asked Mayor Beanie for a 1975‐6 budget including $1,361,732,000 in payments for welfare recipients. This compares with $1,100,846,000 in the current 1974‐5 budget as modified. The increase would be $260,886,000, or 23.7 per cent. However, Administrator Dumpson says the basic welfare grant has “fallen far behind the pace of the rising cost of living.” The state‐ordered grants are based on standards as of January, 1972, and since that time the consumer price index has risen 25.1 per cent. The current basic grant for a family of four, before rent, is $258 a month. The Human Resources Administration Division of Home Economics estimates that as of last July, the family would actually have needed $310 “to keep up with inflation.” It says this need could rise to $385 by next August under recent trends. Mr. Dumpson says inflation has forced welfare families to cut down on food, clothing and other expenses, as well as on their “social mobility”—the effort to better their lives. Request to Carey He plans to “join the entire social welfare community” in urging Governor Carey and the State Legislature to approve “a substantial” but unspecified increase in allowances. He will also urge that the state pay for the entire share of the increase that would otherwise come from the city as a “first step toward the goal of state take‐over of all local welfare costs.” In the 1975‐76 budget request, 28.6 per cent of the projected welfare payments, or $389,921,000, would come from city taxes; $407,421,000, or 29.9 per cent, from the state; $546,890,000, or 40.2 per cent, from the Federal Government, and $17.5‐million, or 1.3 per cent, from the capital budget, financed by borrowing. Beyond the welfare grants, welfare recipients are automatically covered by the Medicaid program, which pays medicall bills for the sick poor. Its rates can be expected to rise. Medicaid costs for the city's poor in the year starting July 1 are estimated by Mr. Dumpson at $1.1‐billion, with half to be paid by the Federal Government and half to be shared by the state and city."
2 IN ABORTION CASE ARE FREED IN ITALY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/11/archives/2-in-abortion-case-are-freed-in-italy.html,"ROME, Feb. 10—Gianfranco Spadaccia, national secretary of the Radical party, who was imprisoned four weeks ago on charges of being an accessory to the crime of abortion, was freed on his own recognizance today. Special to The New York Times An American woman arrested on similar charges, Neith Nevelson Richen, was also released pending trial. Adele Faccio, head of a Florence center that ran an abortion clinic, and Dr. Giorgio Conciani, its director, remain in custody. On Jan. 9 the police raided the clinic, which is run by an organization affiliated with the Radical party, a small civilrights group not represented in Parliament that was instrumental in legalizing divorce and recently has been pushing for the liberalization of stringent antiabortion laws. The circumstances of the arrests and the length of detention had been the cause of some indignation because they were seen by many to be punishment on political rather than legal grounds."
Bill Proposes Local Votes To Allow Abortion Clinics,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/11/archives/bill-proposes-local-votes-to-allow-abortion-clinics.html,"TRENTON, Feb. 10—Assemblyman Robert M. Ruane today introduced a bill requiring that the establishment of abortion clinics within a community be subject to local referendum. Speciall to The New York Times The action by the Bloomfield Democratic Assemblyman was prompted by a heated dispute in the town of Montclair over the scheduled opening of an abortion clinic, the Pilgrim Medical Group. “Montclair has a different concept of morality than Jersey City, Newark, or Camden,” Mr. Ruane said. The clinic, which is being remodeled from an old appliance store at 393 Bloomfield Avenue, the main thoroughfare in downtown Montclair, has not yet been licensed by the state. However, it has received a certificate of need from the state, a preliminary requirement for licensing, and it has received zoning approval from Montclair. A group of irate residents calling themselves the Concerned Citizens of Montclair converged on the State House today and on the State Health Department offices of Dr. Watson E. Neiman demanding that the Pilgrim facility not receive a state license. The group contends there is no need for an abortion clinic in Montclair or the surrounding area. Estimates Challenged Moreover, they challenge estimates by the State Health Planning Council of abortion needs in the state as a “statistical fraud.” Assemblyman Ruane's bill was regarded here as being certainly unconstitutional and but one more roadblock in the legislative path for making abortions easily accessible. In 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that no state could interfere with the right of a woman to have an abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions in the later weeks, it said, are subject to state regulation. Also today, Dr. Neiman reported that the State Health Department, having been advised by the State Attorney. General's office that its regulaitions pertaining to abortion cliitions might be unconstitutional, would decide in the next 30 to 45 days whether to abandon imposing the regulations. Recent decisions in Federal District Courts have struck down health regulations that apply only to abortion clinics and not to other clinic facilities. While the constitutionality of the regulations has not been tested in the New Jersey courts, Dr. Neiman said, the department has an obligation to determine whether the regulations, which have already been promulgated, are legally defensible. State Has Two Clinics At present, two abortion clinics are licensed to operate in New Jersey, one in Jersey City and one in Atlantic City. Six others have received certificates of need, among them two facilities also known as the Pilgrim Medical Group. They are also owned by Dr. Herbert Wiskind, who will operate the Montclair clinic. Although the State Health Department has reported that about half of the hospitals in New Jersey are performing abortions, the State Health Planning Council concluded last year that the hospitals would not be able to fill the abortion needs of New Jersey residents, estimated at about 41,000 for 1975. The clinics, which are small facilities usually incorporating the practice of a few doctors, are being licensed to fill that need. Also, the costs of an abortion at a clinic are reported to be considerably less than those at a hospital. Earlier today, reports that the Pilgrim Medical Group in Montclair had already begun to perform abortions without a state license prompted Governor Byrne to order an investigation. A spokesman for the Health Department said an investigator found the facility boarded up and not yet complete and there was no evidence that any abortions had been performed or would be performed in the near future."

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/12/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1975 Britain's Conservative party decisively elected Margaret Thatcher as leader, succeeding Edward Heath, who resigned after losing to her in an earlier round of the contest. She started her bid last year as an outside challenger from the party's right wing. Asked after the vote how much she would shake up the party, she promised “a blend of continuity and change.” [Page 1, Col. 5.] The British Government announced that it would set up a network of centers in Northern Ireland to maintain contact with Irish Republican Army units to safeguard and monitor the current cease‐fire. It was the most formal structure for this purpose that Britain has ever accepted. If the ceasefire holds, the British Army's presence will become less obtrusive, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicated. [1:1–2.] Secretary of State Kissinger ended his first full day of discussions with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem with the comment that he remained optimistic on the prospects of a new interim agreement between Israel and Egypt. He emphasized that he was not attempting actual negotiations on this trip, which takes him to Cairo today and back to Jerusalem tomorrow. [1:3.] The health ministers of the nine Common Market countries agreed in Brussels to let the approximately 400,000 physicians in the member countries practice wherever they want within the European community. The accord, which Denmark has not yet ratified pending formation of her new government. gives 18 months for each member country to change administrative rules to let foreign doctors practice. It was the first such agreement for any profession. [1:1–2.] President Ford announced the release of up to $2‐billion in impounded highway funds to help stimulate the sagging economy. Addressing a joint session of the Kansas Legislature in Topeka, he said he had made the decision on the recommendation of a number of state governors who assured him the money would be spent by June 30 on pending projects including mass transit. White House officials estimated that the money, with lesser amounts of matching state funds, would lead to 125,000 new jobs. [1:8.] The National Academy of Sciences made public a major study, “Mineral Resources and the Environment.” warning that the world faces shortages, the first perhaps only a few years away, in materials that are vital to modern industrial civilization. The report said it was essentially impossible for domestic oil supplies to replace foreign supplies in the next decade. The chairman of the study panel, Dr. Brian J. Skinner of Yale, told reporters that all government estimates of total American oil and gas resources have been over‐optimistic. [1:7.] At the first Federal hearing on environmental impact of off shore oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf, Governor Byrne of New Jersey threatened to sue the Department of Interior unless it postponed its call for oil companies to name areas they would like to lease. He said the department had promised to take no action pending a Supreme Court decision in a 1969 Federal case involving Maine and 11 other Atlantic coastal states. [1:7–8.] Ken McFeeley, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, toured station houses to rally votes for the plan to save the jobs of more than 500 rookies and recruits. He stirred responses of support from a rank and file that had been overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal. He also won a pledge from leaders of the sergeants’ and captains’ associations to work a day at no pay by their members if that would help save the jobs. He promised to resign from his office “before I let one cop get laid off and before I ask you to give up one other thing” in bargaining with the city. [1:6–7.] The backlog of undisposed felony cases rose sharply in the city last year despite a decline in indictments and despite measures to improve productivity in State Supreme Court.

She started her bid last year as an outside challenger from the party's right wing. Asked after the vote how much she would shake up the party, she promised “a blend of continuity and change.” [Page 1, Col. 5.] The British Government announced that it would set up a network of centers in Northern Ireland to maintain contact with Irish Republican Army units to safeguard and monitor the current cease‐fire. It was the most formal structure for this purpose that Britain has ever accepted. If the ceasefire holds, the British Army's presence will become less obtrusive, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicated. [1:1–2.] Secretary of State Kissinger ended his first full day of discussions with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem with the comment that he remained optimistic on the prospects of a new interim agreement between Israel and Egypt. He emphasized that he was not attempting actual negotiations on this trip, which takes him to Cairo today and back to Jerusalem tomorrow. [1:3.] The health ministers of the nine Common Market countries agreed in Brussels to let the approximately 400,000 physicians in the member countries practice wherever they want within the European community. The accord, which Denmark has not yet ratified pending formation of her new government, gives 18 months for each member country to change administrative rules to let foreign doctors practice. It was the first such agreement for any profession. [1:1–2.] President Ford announced the release of up to $2‐billion in impounded highway funds to help stimulate the sagging economy. Addressing a joint session of the Kansas Legislature in Topeka, he said he had made the decision on the recommendation of a number of state governors who assured him the money would be spent by June 30 on pending projects including mass transit. White House officials estimated that the money, with lesser amounts of matching state funds, would lead to 125,000 new jobs. [1:8.] The National Academy of Sciences made public a major study, “Mineral Resources and the Environment,” warning that the world faces shortages, the first perhaps only a few years away, in materials that are vital to modern industrial civilization. The report said it was essentially impossible for domestic oil supplies to replace foreign supplies in the next decade. The chairman of the study panel, Dr. Brian J. Skinner of Yale, told reporters that all government estimates of total American oil and gas resources have been over‐optimistic. [1:7.] At the first Federal hearing on environmental impact of off shore oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf, Governor Byrne of New Jersey threatened to sue the Department of Interior unless it postponed its call for oil companies to name areas they would like to lease.

Jury in Boston Abortion Trial Listens to the Final Arguments,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/14/archives/jury-in-boston-abortion-trial-listens-to-the-final-arguments.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 13 (UPI)—The Jury hearing the abortion‐manslaughter trial of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was urged today to find the physician guilty of “the white coat killing” of a fetus in a legal abortion. The controversial six‐week trial of Dr. Edelin neared its end as the opposing counsels, presented their final arguments. The jury is to receive final instructions and begin deliberations tomorrow. Dr. Edelin, 36 years old, former chief resident obstetrician at Boston City Hospital, was charged with allowing a baby, “born or in the process of being born” during an elective abortion, to die on Oct. 3, 1973 while he stared at a wall clock. Assistant District Attorney Newman A. Flanagan made an emotional appeal for the jurors to “use your common sense.” It was in contrast to the earlier low‐key summary of William Homans, a defense attorney, who suggested that the state had failed to produce “hard evidence” that there had been a human victim or a crime. Mr. Flanagan contended that the crime had nothing to do with abortion and was a case of manslaughter. “Whether it be the back street killing, the white collar killing or the white coat killing,” Mr. Flanagan told the jury, his voice quivering with emotion, “you must make that determination.”"
Aborting the Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/14/archives/aborting-the-law.html,"A trial jury in a Boston homicide case now faces the unenviable—and perhaps impossible—task of deciding just when human life begins in order to determine whether a doctor committed the homicide of which he is accused. The charge arises from an abortion performed by Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, member of the staff of Boston City Hospital, on a 17‐year‐old unmarried woman who, according to the varying reports of experts, was somewhere between 18 and 24 weeks pregnant. The operation was legal at the time since Massachusetts then had no law prohibiting abortions. It occurred after the Supreme Court had handed down a decision permitting abortions during the first six or seven months of pregnancy and before the State Legislature had attempted to set up rules under the Court's guidelines. The prosecution contends that, though the abortion was not prohibited, the fetus was a live human being who would have lived had the abortion not been performed. In order to find Dr. Edelin guilty of homicide, the jury will have to decide whether human life had already begun, a substantially more precise answer to the question than either the medical or the legal profession has ever been able to agree upon. It is a question that should never have been put to a criminal jury. There is no question that a large segment of public opinion in, Massachusetts deplored the Supreme Court decision and desired to limit It. There was a similarly significant opinion in the state that believed that fetal life should be protected to the greatest degree possible. An entirely appropriate vehicle existed for translating those popular feelings into state law. It was the State Legislature, and only subsequently did it enact such a law—one which will doubtless be tested in the proper way in the courts. The impatient prosecutors in Suffolk County moved to accomplish the same result by prosecuting Dr. Edelin. In essence, the prosecution is asking the jury to define the crime before it decides the defendant's guilt or innocence. The prosecution is thus forcing upon the jury an inappropriate legislative function and on the defendant a burden which is quite possibly unconstitutional. No matter how nobly motivated the prosecutors may consider themselves, their effort to set social policy in a criminal courtroom constitutes a gross abuse of the legal process."
Boston Jury Weighs Case Against Doctor in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/15/archives/boston-jury-weighs-case-against-doctor-in-abortion.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 14—The case of Dr. Kenneth Edelin, who is charged with the death of a “baby boy” fetus in a legal abortion, went to the jury at 12:30 P.M. today after six weeks of testimony. The jury adjourned late this afternoon and will resume deliberations tomorrow morning. Dr. Edelin performed the abortion at the Boston City Hospital Oct. 3, 1973, on a 17‐year‐old unmarried woman during her sixth month of pregnancy. Judge James P. McGuire told the jurors that Dr. Edelin could be found guilty only if they considered the fetus a person and then if the Boston obstetrician had shown wanton and reckless conduct. Defining a Person As he concluded what he said was a necessarily lengthy 90‐minute charge to the jury of nine men and three women. Judge McGuire said, “You are asked to make a finding in the most sensitive area of human feeling.” He pointed out that use of the word “person” conventionally applies after birth and not before birth. “If there had been no person in this case, there could not be any conviction in the crime of manslaughter,” the jurors were told. “You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the death of a person alive outside the body of he mother.” Observers at the six‐weeklong trial regarded the judge's charge as narrowing the case to he legal definition of “a person” from the broader issues of deciding the viability of a fetus and determining when life begins. As the jurors stared attentively at the bench in the highceilinged, chilly courtroom high above downtown Boston, Judge McGuire said that they must be objective in reaching a decision “without sympathy, prejudice or emotion for any part of this case.” He reminded the jury that it had to consider conflicting evidence from several witnesses regarding the fetus's respiratory activity outside the body after the abortion. The judge said that Dr. Enrique Gimenez —Jimeno, the prosecution's only eyewitness to the case, had testified that the fetus showed no signs of life or breathing after Dr. Edelin removed the fetus through a surgical incision called a hysterotomy in the mother's womb. Conflict on Breathing Other witnesses testified that the fetus took no breaths outside the womb, but Dr. John B. Ward, a Pittsburgh pathologist and witness for the prosecution, testified that the fetus had breathed outside the mother before it died. “As another example of conflicting testimony,” Judge McGuire cited witnesses’ differing descriptions of where Dr. Gimenez was placed in regard to Dr. Edelin during the surgical procedure. In other testimony, witnesses gave conflicting testimony about the existence of a working wall clock in the operating room where the abortion was performed. “I take these to point out that certain conflicts exist — that happens in most trials,” Judge McGuire said. Then after a sip of water the judge reminded the jury that the points he raised were not the only pieces of evidence in the trial. He instructed the jury to consider not only what the witnesses had said but to weigh their demeanor and the way they formulated their answers to questioning from counsel. The 16 jurors who had been sequestered throughout the trial were reduced—by eliminating four men by lot—to a dozen who will return a verdict."
Issue of Permissible Research On Fetus Is Argued at Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/15/archives/issue-of-permissible-research-on-fetus-is-argued-at-hearing.html,NO TEXT FOUND
Nuns Discuss Euthanasia,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/16/archives/nuns-discuss-euthanasia.html,"In a time of growing depersonalization and sophisticated life‐prolonging medical techniques, what are the legal rights of dying persons? At what point should “extraordinary” means not to be used to keep a patient alive, and who is to make such a decision? These were the kinds of questions heard repeatedly at an all‐day educational program on euthanasia held recently at Bishop Ford High School, 500 19th Street, in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, by more than 250 Roman Catholic nuns from the Brooklyn and Rockville Centre dioceses and the Archdiocese of New York. Nobody had definitive answers. But, said the participants, who ranged from hospital nurses to physicians and legislative experts, the topic of mercy killing, like abortion, promises to become a major issue in the near future. “A good number of our people have been brought up with the idea that euthanasia is absolutely wrong in all circumstances,” commented the Rev. Thomas F. Cribbin, director of the Office of the Handicapped of Brooklyn Catholic Charities, who served as one of several “facilitators,” for free‐wheeling discussion groups that met in classrooms after the main speeches were given. “But there are a lot of gray areas, and we have to educate our people,” Father Cribbin said. “People are looking for something definite, and clear‐cut from the church. We should be honest and say we just don't have all the answers.” According to Catholic moral teaching, the direct causing of death for the purpose of ending human suffering—euthanasia—is recarded as murder. However, it is permissible to use drugs to ease suffering—even though it may bring on an early death—and it is also permissible for a seriously ill person or other responsible persons to refuse to permit “extraordinary” medical procedures although the refusal might shorten life. “People are beginning to question,” said one speaker, the Rev. Richard A. McCormick, a Jesuit professor of Christian ethics affiliated with the Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics of Georgetown University in Washington. “whether there is a moral difference between ‘letting the person die’ and deliberate killing. ‘Realm of Unreal’ “Increasingly, methods of supporting life have become so sophisticated that to remove them—to stop the respirator—is increasingly like an act of commission rather than an act of omission. There are those who argue that omission and commission are the same. “There is a virtual consensus that in America we have successfully conspired to repress death into the realm of the unreal. … Our first moral task is to acknowledge and then challenge from a deeply Christian root the cultural attitudes and values that generate and support this repression and prevent clear and Christian thinking about death.” In the light of the fact that no fewer than 16 bills dealing with the rights of the dying have been under consideration recently in various states, the issue is “desperately” in need of clarifica tion, said another speaker. Dr. Robert M. Veatch of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N.Y. It is “extremely dangerous,” he said, to allow individual physicians to decide moral questions relating to the stoppage or continuance of treatment of dying persons because the physician may misunderstand the values and philosophy held by the patient. It is “worse,” he said, to have such decisions made by a hospital committee of physicians. Dr. Veatch, who directs the Institute's Research Group on Death and Dying, has written a draft legislative proposal, similar to one introduced in West Virginia, affirming patients’ rights to refuse treatment. Lt would also authorize a person designated by the patient, or the next of kin, to make such a decision in case the patient becomes incompetent. Discussing possible Catholic strategy if the question were to come before the State Legislature, the Rev. Robert P. Kennedy, social action director of Brooklyn Catholic Charities, described the dilemma presented to Catholics who oppose abortion. “We are clearly pro‐life,” he noted, “yet we are also clearly in favor of the Christian value of dying, and the family values involved in dying. We need to educate ourselves in a whole spectrum of viewpoints.” “It is one thing,” said Dr. Gerard Griffin, an internist in cardiology at Mercy Hospital, Rockville Centre, in another principal talk, “to cease delaying death, but another to do violence to the living body.”"
FETAL REEARCH REPORTED ON RISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/16/archives/fetal-research-reported-on-rise-study-shows-technological-advances.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 — A substantial amount of research involving the human fetus has beeit done in the United States and elsewhere during the last five years, according to a preliminary study done for a national commission. The scientist in charge of the study said today that much of this research activity resulted from recent technological advances that made studies on the fetus more practicable and more effective than in the past. In answer to questions from reporters, he said the amount of such research was so substantial as to seem surprising. He said the studies had led to improvements in diagnosis of disorders that threaten the life and health of the fetus and, in some cases, had led to effective treatment of some important health problems. The subject of fetal research has become a hotly debated issue in recent years„ with many medical scientists defending it as worthwhile and necessary and opponents attacking it as violating the rights and bodies of unborn humans.’ Required By New Law The study of the, extent and nature of recent fetal research is being done for the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. A Federal law passed last year established the commission and required it to make recommendations by May 1 defining the circumstances, if any, under which research involving the living human fetus may be conducted; in federally funded research programs. The report is to go to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, who will then be required to draft regulations on the subject. At present a temporary ban is in force prohibiting Federal support for an research involving the living human fetus before or after an induced abortion. The ban, called ‘for’ by the same Federal law that set up the commission, is to last until the, commission makes its report. The preliminary study presented to the commission today is one of several being done to help the commission draft recommendations. The study is being done on contract with Dr. Maurice J. Mahoney of Yale University, who Made the preliminary report to the commission today. His study group is to make final report next month. In the preliminary report to day, Dr. Mahoney said thal ‘research had led to the current situation in which Virtually all aberrations of the chrothosomes of the human fetus can be detected while the fetus is still in the womb. These are abnor., malities in the basic hereditary material and generally presage serious, sometimes fatal, developmental defects. 23 Errors Detected Some 60 specific inborn errors of metabolism are now potentially detectable while the fetus is still in the womb, the report said, and 23 have ac tually been detected. This is done by a process called amniocentesis in which fetal cells are extracted from the fluid’ that surrounds the fetus. In a few instances, the survey of scientific research reports shows, it has beeen pos‐, sible to give treatment to help alleviate the problem. In the larger proportion of cases, the information concerning the fetus has either assured the parents that the baby will be free of gross genetic defects or, when such defects have been revealed, has given them the chance to decide whether to end the pregnancy by an abortion. One of the most controversial areas of fetal research is that involving the early fetus outside the womb. This characteristically involves fetuses delivered by abortion at a stage of development too early for survival. The preliminary report listed, as examples, eight reports of specific research of this kind performed in the last several years. The eight were culled from several hundred, Dr. Mahoney said. The report said the vast majority of reported researches on pre‐vidble fetuses outside the womb involved those that were clearly dead even though some of their tissues might still be alive. The pre‐viable fetus is one dot capable of surviving outside the womb. The report said there were many therapeutic and research uses for such tissues."

Doctor Guilty in Death Of a Fetus in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/16/archives/doctor-guilty-in-death-of-a-fetus-in-abortion-doctor-guilty-in.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 15—Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was found guilty today of manslaughter in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion that he performed at the Boston City Hospital on Oct. 3, 1973. The jury, which had heard evidence for six weeks, reached its decision at 1:25 P.M. on the second day of its deliberition in a case that had become the focus of medical, religious, and political controversy. The nine men and three women had been considering uncharted legal areas following the landmark decision on abortion by the United States Supreme Court on Jan. 22, 1973. The verdict was widely regarded as a victory for anti‐abortion and “right‐to‐life” groups. Dr. Edelin ‘s lawyer, William P. Homans Jr., said the case would be appealed because of the decision's importance to everyday medical practice and because “the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.” The verdict is expected to make obstetricians much more cautious in performing abortions during the second trimester, or the fourth through sixth months, of pregnancy. The abortion was Performed by Dr. Edelin on a woman during her sixth month of pregnancy. Dr. Edelin, composed but drawn, told newsmen, after the verdict, “We are not through with the battle yet.” “I just hope that this decision today will not throw us back where [women] will have to continue to put their lives and their health on the line,” he said. “I did nothing that was illegal, immoral or bad medical practice. Everything was in accordance with good medical practice.” Dr. Edelin also said he was uncertain how he would practice now that he had been found guilty of manslaughter. The answer, he said, would depend on consultations with his attorneys and decisions by the state medical licensing board. Dr. Carl Goldmark Jr. of New York, a spokesman for the American Medical Association, said the verdict “probably will please the right to life committees, but I think it will soon be forgetten—I hope,” The Associated Press reported. Nellie J. Gray, speaking for a Washington, D.C., right to life committee, told the A.P. the verdict “starts America back on the road to respect for the dignity of human life.” After the verdict, Judge McGuire ordered Dr. Edelin freed, pending an unspecified sentencing date, on his own recognizance and a $100 bond posted earlier. The maximum sentence is 20 years in jail. In its case, the prosecution said that Dr. Edelin, after having ended the pregnancy in the abortion, killed the fetus by depriving it of life‐sustaining oxygen while it was still in the womb. The defense maintained that Dr. Edelin, who is 36 years old, could not have committed manslaughter because the fetus was not a person and therefore no person ever existed. Further, the defense maintained, the law had never given rights to the unborn. Protective Clause Cited Yesterday, Judge James P. McGuire said in his charge to the jury that Dr. Edelin could be found guilty only if the jurors considered the fetus a person and, then, if Dr. Edelin had shown wanton and reckless conduct. He also told the jury that “you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the death of a person alive outside the body of the mother.” The jury deliberated more than four hours yesterday. Shortly after it resumed deliberations this morning, the foreman sent a note to Judge McGuire requesting a copy of the closing portion of the judge's charge. This portion dealt with the specifics of the laws concerning manslaughter, definitions of a person and fetus, and Judge McGuire's instructions. In the charge, Judge McGuire also said that the Supreme Court abortion ruling protected Dr. Edelin from criminal conduct during the abortion he performed. But because Massachusetts had not taken legislative action to regulate or proscribe abortion in accordance with the decision, the judge said that in Dr. Edelin's case “the law of manslaughter is inextricably intertwined in the Supreme Court decision.” In that decision, the Supreme Court barred states from interfering with a woman's right to an elective abortion before the fetus became viable—able to survive outside the womb. The Court also issued new guidelines for the relative legal rights of pregnant women and of the states that would control their acts. At 11:45 this morning, the jurors—all stern and stiff‐lipped —walked in and were told by Judge McGuire that I decline to give you a copy of the charge” unless the jury “cares to be more specific” about the sections it wishes to see. Some Shocked by Verdict In the closing portion of his 90‐minute charge, Judge Mcguire said he cited conflicts in the testimony “for purposes of illustration and example only.” In rejecting the jury's request, the judge told the jury that it was “your memory on the facts that governs:” After a luncheon recess, the jury walked into the high‐ceilinged, chilly courtroom on the ninth floor of the Suffolk County Courthouse in downtown Boston. “Guilty,” Vincent Shea, the foreman, responded in a loud voice when Judge McGuire asked him what verdict the jury had reached. Exclamations of displeasure from shocked members of Dr. Edelin's family and from spectators sounded through the courtroom. As some spectators asked each other “How could they do that?”, Dr. Edelin walked over to comfort his family. His lawyer, Mr. Homans, expressed displeasure by saying: “The vehemence with which the foreman shouted out the word ‘guilty’ says something about the temper of the populace.” Sixteen jurors heard all testimony given at the trial, but four of them, chosen by lot, were made alternate jurors after the judge's charge yesterday. The four included two of the youngest members of the original jury and an engineer, believed to be the only college graduate in the group. Francis E. McLaughlin, a juror, said the first vote, taken two hours after the deliberations began, was eight to four. Then it stood 11 to 1 on a series of votes until shortly after noon when the last juror, a man, changed his mind on the secret ballot. Mr. McLaughlin told reporters that the jurors believed the fetus was a person on the basis of the pattern of evidence rather than on the basis of specific testimony. Though the jurors agreed that the abortion was legal, Mr. McLaughlin said, “I don't think he [Dr. Edelin] did a thorough job once it [the fetus] was removed.” The jurors generally felt that the defense witnesses were “too cocky” in their answers and that the doctors were too callous in their concern about possibility that the fetus Tight be alive, Mr. McLaughlin said. Some observers said that the charge might have encompassed broader questions about Dr. Edelin's obligation, if any, to use all possible means to save the fetus after he had performed the abortion. Now, Dr. Edelin's conviction on a charge of manslaughter in a legal abortion may lead to further cases challenging such points. Some legal observers said they were surprised by the decision. Earlier, they had said they regarded the judge's charge as narrowing the case to the legal definition of “a person” from the broader issues of deciding viability of a fetus and determining when life begins."
Ideas &,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/16/archives/ideas-trends-a-textbook-case.html,"Continued The classic pattern of cause and effect in an outbreak of mass illness is often postulated but not proven. Recently, the actual sequence involved in food poisoning on an international jet flight was traced by epidemiologists, and their findings fit the textbook pattern. Here is what took place: Drawings by Oliver Williams Health Maintenance Organiza(H.M.O.'s), not long ago considered to be the promising vehicles for a system of health care, are suffering from patient disinterest, sagging governmental support and a faltering economy. H.M.O. is an arrangement in which subscribers prepay a flat fee for comprehensive medical services in a single, clinic‐like setting. Because the plan is supposed to emphasize prevention rather than treatment, some health experts see the H.M.O. as a way of slowing the rise in health costs. A few H.M.O.'s have been operating for some time and are flourishing, particularly in California. When the Nixon Administration began pushing the concept in 1970, others were set up, mainly by insurance carriers, physicians group practices, hospitals and consumer organizations. There are now around 180 serving 6 million people. However, the concept is not spreading as widely as proponents had anticipated, despite a Federal appropriation of.$375‐million a year ago to help develop the idea nationwide. Many of the newer H.M.O.'s are not getting the enrollments they expected. An example is Healthcare, set up in downtown Brooklyn in January, 1974, by Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. Healthcare looked for at least 10,000 subscribers; it has attracted less than 500. Connecticut General has now decided to end the program on March 31. The primary reason for patient disinterest, experts say, is that H.M.O.'s must charge high premiums to provide their many in‐patient services. Proponents argue, however, that in the long run the over‐all costs should be lower than with insurance plans, because the emphasis on prevention reduces sickness and hospitalization. In view of the public resistance, and in the present economic climate, organizations seem reluctant to make the big initial investment needed to get an H.M.Off the ground. They're gettiug little encouragement from the Federal Government, which itself is under bddgetary pressures. In a case involving controversial medical and legal issues, a jury has found a Boston doctor guilty of manslaughter on charges that he killed a fetus during a legal abortion. The obstetrician, Dr. Kennth C. Edelin, performed the abortion at the Boston City Hospital Oct. 3, 1973, on a 17‐year‐old unmarried woman during her sixth month of pregnancy. His six‐week trial attracted wide attention because it focused on questions of when a human life begins and what responsibility a doctor has toward sustaining the life of the fetus. During the trial, the prosecution argued that the fetus was born the moment it was separated from the wall of the woman's womb. The defense argued that the fetus never drew a breath outside the body and that therefore there was no living human to be killed. In his charge to the jury last week, Judge James P. McGuire said Dr. Edelin could be found guilty only if the jurors considered the fetus a person and then if the doctor had shown wanton and reckless conduct. The jury reached its verdict after seven hours’ deliberation. Caroline Rand Herron and Donald Johnston (More Ideas & Trends, Page 16)"
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/16/archives/the-world-the-world.html,"In Summary Brezhnev Fires A Salvo At the Mideast Shuttle Secretary of State Kissinger has completed his exploratory discussions with Middle East leaders and remains publicly optimistic about chances for a new interim peace agreement. Others are less hopeful, but it is not clear whether public statements accurately reflect the realistic bargaining positions of Israel or Egypt. Even the Secretary, however, admits that if his approach doesn't pay off soon, it may be necessary to reconvene full‐scale peace talks at Geneva. That would satisfy the Russians. As Mr. Kissinger was winding up his Middle East tour, Soviet Leonid Brezhnev repeated Soviet demands for the “speediest” resumption of the Geneva talks. For his part, according to Israeli officials, Mr. Kissinger kept his talks with Premier Yitzhak Rabin, President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt and President Hafez al‐Assad of Syria deliberately general. Mr. Kissinger also said that the talks had been exploratory, and that he would return about March 8 for a second round of talks. But Mr. Brezhnev said the Kissinger approach should be ended now. “Partial bilateral measures have already been implemented in the Middle East,” he said. “Have they eased tension in the area? Unfortunately not.” The Bankers’ War There were new developments last week in the campaign by Arab oil nations to use their wealth to exclude banking firms with Jewish members from major international deals. The latest actions affected syndicates led by Merrill,. Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., of New York and involved loans for the Mexican Government and Volvo, the Swedish automaker. The Kuwait International Investment Company, which had been co‐manager of the syndicates, said it was withdrawing because the other participants included Lazard Freres, an international banking house with Jewish participants. Lazard Freres is on an Arab boycott list. The Iraqis and Iranians began quarrelling some years ago over control of the Shatt al Arab, the strategic waterway formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and more recently have clashed over the claims of Iraq's Kurdish minority to a greater degree of autonomy. Winter snows have delayed an Iraqi offensive against the Iranian‐supported Kurds in their mountain strongholds but, following new skirmishes between Iraqi and Iranian forces, there is concern among outside experts that worse fighting will come in the spring. Increasing the potential for conflict is the rivalry between the two countries for hegemony in the Persian Gulf area. The Shah of Iran would like to use his oil wealth to revive Persia's ancient dominance. To the conservative, vigorously anti‐Communist Shah, any challenge to that dream by the socialistic, Russian‐backed Iraqis must be thwarted. A complicating factor is that while both Iraq and Iran are Moslem nations, the non‐Arab Iranians mostly belong to the Shia branch of Islam, While in Iraq the Sunni branch is much influential. The dispute over the Shatt al Arab, which controls the northern end of the Persian Gulf, in normal circumstances could be submitted to international arbitration. But the Kurdish war is a different matter. The Kurds, led by Gen. Mustafa alBarzani, want an autonomous Kurdistan in northern Iraq's oil‐producing area around Erbil and Mossul, perhaps lobsely affiliated with Baghdad. Iran, which has a sizable Kurdish minority of its own, has backed General Barzani with money and munitions. An inde‐ pendent Kurdistan would greatly diminish Iraq's power. Since Feb. 1, according to reports from the area, Iraq has moved large numbers of troops into the border area near the Iranian town of Mehran where major clashes occurred last year. The aim is apparently to curtail Iranian aid to the Kurds during Iraq's spring offensive. It is this agglomeration of forces that leads Western observers to fear wider hostilities. Peace between Israel and her neighbors apparently was not Mr. Kissinger's only purpose for visiting the Middle East. As he wound up 10 days in the area there were reports that the United States is trying to make longterm purchases with individual oil nations well below the current $10 to $11 a barrel price. How low the United States sought to go, whether it would be below the floor price of $6 or $7 a barrel already suggested by Mr. Kissinger as a means of safeguarding oil producers’ incomes while stimulating alternative fuel research, was not known. Nor was it known which nations the United States was dealing with. Mr. Kissinger had a private session with Sheik Ahmad Zaki Yamani, the Saudi Oil Minister, during the Secretary's visit to Riyadh. The effect of quadrupled oil prices on the North American and European economies, which is what Mr. Kissinger is trying to repair, has been bad but it has been even worse for many developing countries. To ameliorate their situation many of them have endorsed the Arab cause in the Middle East and sought aid from the oil producers. However, as India for one has discovered, the oil nations have not been exactly quick to respond. India had hoped that a visit last week by Sheik Yamani would yield substantive economic benefits. But the Sheik departed, declining to give oil credits although announcing a willingness to help finance joint industrial products. All but two oil producers have told India essentially the same thing. The exceptions are Iraq and Iran. After an exchange of visits between the Shah of Iran and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi last year, it was reported that Iran would supply close to $1‐ billion in aid. Agreements have not yet been signed. The Arabs have been more generous with India's Moslem neighbor, Pakistan. They have supplied $300‐million in aid for the Bhutto Government. In addition, the Shah has provided a $500‐ million loan. The Arabs reportedly also have set aside $800‐million for aid to African countries, but how much has been delivered is not known. Where Will Eritrea's War End? Secessionist fighting in Ethiopia's Eritrea Province has continued into a 10th week and the tenacity of the rebels is such that many Ethiopians believe the civil war could end in collapse of the nation's government. Ethiopia is far from a homogeneous state. Her 25 million people speak 70 different languages and represent scores of racial and religious groups. There have been struggles in the past by some of these groups to gain autonomy from the Orthodox Christian central Government; the conflict in mainly Moslem Eritrea has been going on intermittently for 12 years. The country's military rulers have predicted that victory by the rebels in Eritrea will “end Ethiopia as a nation.” Victory by the Government will also be probilematic. Even if the Government is successful in holding and re‐supplying Asmara, the capital of Eritrea where the fighting has been centered, there will be a long and costly guerrilla war to retain control of the province. The World In Summary Turks ‘Negotiate’ New Cyprus State Unilaterally Continued The negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriotes over the future of their shared island are effectively at an end. The Turks, who have military superiority by a large margin, have simply declared in existence the separate state they wanted. The declaration, and the Turkish military victory that occurred in July, is a ratification by force of the Turks’ desire for a better existence on Cyprus. There are 118,000 ethnic Turks, 500,000 ethnic Greeks. Before the fighting, the Greeks were ascendant. They were settled all over the island but many had valuable properties in the north. Archbishop Makarios was the island's President. The new state is in the north and the Turks now have taken over the land and property of the Greeks who once lived there. The area includes 70 per cent of the island's mineral wealth and its best farming land. Turkish armed forces are still there, and despite strong protests in Athens, militant rallies by Greek Cypriotes and a pledge of resistance by Archbishop Makarios, it is unlikely there will be a major military challenge to the Turks’ unilateral declaration. The. Turkish Government in Ankara promised military backing for the decision, which it doubtless made. It is possible the action was taken in part as a retaliation for the American cut‐off of military aid to Turkey, which in turn was a Congressionally‐ordered retaliation for the Turks’ illegal use of United States arms in July's invasion. Another Cease‐Fire For Ulster Once again, hope has been revived for an end to nearly five years of violence in Northern Ireland with the announcement by the Provisional section of the Irish Republican Army of an open‐ended cease‐fire. The Provisional? decision was reportedly the result of intensive discussion with British officials seeking resumption of a Christmas truce that broke down after 25 days. To gain the new cease‐fire, the British set up an elaborate and formal structure of contacts with the Provlsionals. The plan includes a network of contact points with the I.R.A. to monitor the cease‐fire. There will be fewer random searches of Ulster residents and homes by British troops. There is even a hint that some of the 14,000 British soldiers may be withdrawn. Despite the agreement, the I.R.A. continues to challenge the Government of the Irish Republic. Fourteen Provisionals, held in a Dublin jail are on a hunger strike, demanding segregation from other prisoners. Several killings that took place after the new cease‐fire announcement were reported to be the work of Protestant extremists intent on evening the score with the Catholic I.R.A. That motivation, an eye for an eye, is exactly what has ended all periods of peace in Northern Ireland, of whatever duration. Common Market Doctors The European Common Market has given the 400,000 doctors in the nine member countries the right to practice medicine wherever they want. It is the first time the nations have created European‐wide status for any profession. Starting in 1976, doctors trained in any member country will be free to practice in any other. No longer will they have to pass the existing national tests to do so. The hope is that doctors will leave those nations and cities where there are many physicians for countries and towns where there are fewer. But critics of the decision argue that doctors instead will go where they can Make the most money. Belgium offers much higher fees than Britain or Italy, for example. There is also the problem, already felt in the United States and in West Germany and Italy, of checking the flow of doctors to lucrative city practices and keeping them in poorer rural areas. Mr. Thieu and The Critics Opponents of President Nguyen Van Thieu have been staging demonstrations against his regime, including one in which his photographs were burned on the steps of the South Vietmanese National Assembly. Mr. Thieu has answered with severity. Five opposition papers have been closed, leaving only one publishing. Several important journalists have been arrested. And, to the annoyance of the United States mission, Mr. Thieu has returned to power several highranking military and police officers ousted for deserved reputations of corruptness. The demonstration at the National Assembly, the former opera house, was staged by a number of deputies, but also drew a rare appearance by Duong Van (Big) Minh, the retired general who is an opposition figurehead. This and other protests by Buddhists were quickly subdued. Sources in Saigon suggests that the military shake‐up is pre‐emptive—the regime fears demonstrations may intensify if the United States Congress does not grant the $300‐million in supplementary aid the Ford Administration seeks for Saigon. A key figure in the changes is Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Van Toan. Last October, under opposition and American pressure to clean up corruption In the army, Mr. Thieu removed General Toan from a command position, even though the two are close associates. Now the general is back as head of the region that surrounds Saigon. Abortion Is Now ‘the’ Issue Italy's governing Christian Democratic party, defeated in a referendum on divorce last year, is now being challenged on abortion. Petitions are already circulating for a new vote on whether abortions should be made legal. The official position of the Christian Democrats, who are close to the Vatican, is one of continued opposition to abortion under any circumstances. Like divorce, abortion could become an issue between political forces that support or oppose continued church influence in state matters. A group linked to the small but vocal Radical party has been openly operating an abortion clinic in Florence despite a law stipulating severe penalties for anyone involved in abortions. Police raided the clinic Jan. 9 and arrested a number of persons. Some were freed last week but the others are still being held. The Radicals, a civil‐rights group not trepresented in Parliament, have also been seeking support for an abortion reform bill sponsored by Loris Fortuna, the same deputy who initiated divorce‐reform law last year. There are varied estimates of the number of abortions in Italy each year. The Health Ministry conservatively puts the figure at 800,000. An Italian Gynecological Congress in 1968 said was 3 million. Generally believed to be more accurate is the World Health Organization's estimate of 1,200,000. Bhutto Cancels The Opposition The Government of Pakistan has outlawed its main political opposition, the National Awaml party, ostensibly because of terrorist activity including the assassination of a popular Government official. But it is not at all clear that the Awemi was responsible for the assassination, and the ban raises doubt about Prime Minister Bhutto's commitment to democracy and his willingness to compete politically with the pro‐Moscow Awami. New York Times correspondent Bernard Weinraub reports: “Mr, Bhutto has drafted a new constitution, set up a strong central and parliamentary form of government and is democratically elected after 16 years of military rule. But emergency powers remain in effect and the press is pliant.” Mr. Bhutto is pro‐West, and in that connection the United States has decided to resume arms shipments to Pakistan. India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has predicted that the decision to end a 10‐year‐old arms embargo will worsen Indian‐American relationships. “These arms have always been used against India.... Our young people have died. There has been unprovoked aggression on us,” she said. Re‐enter Mr. Brezhnev The great Brezhnev mystery is over. After nearly two months during which he was absent from public affairs, the Soviet leader, smiling and joking and in apparent good health, welcomed British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to the Kremlin last week. Mr. Brezhnev had missed talks with several other visiting leaders since his last appearance before the Russian Federation Parliament on Christmas Eve. There had been reports that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. Last week, a Soviet official said Mr. Brezhnev had had the flu."
Implications of Abortion Verdict,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/17/archives/implications-of-abortion-verdict.html,NO TEXT FOUND
"Doctor, Convicted in Abortion, Charges Prejudice Barred Fair Trial in Boston",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/17/archives/doctor-convicted-in-abortion-charges-prejudice-barred-fair-trial-in.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 16 (UPI)—Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, convicted of manslaughter in an abortion operation, said today that racial and religious prejudice had made a fair trial in Boston impossible. “It was a witchhunt,” the 36‐ year‐old black obstetrician said the day after an all‐white, nineman, three‐woman, predominantly Roman Catholic jury returned a guilty verdict ending his six‐week trial. “A lot came together for them [the prosecution] in my case,” he said in an interview. “They got a black physician amp they got a woman more than 20 weeks’ pregnant and they got a fetus in the mortuary.” Dr. Edelin, former chief resident obstetrician at Boston City Hospital, and his attorney and friend, William P. Homans Jr., said that they had initially believed Judge James P. McGuire's charge to the jury would insure a not‐guilty verdict. The judge told the jury that manslaughter required the death of a “person,” which he defined as an infant “born live” and outside the womb. See Support for Case To the defense this charge seemed to support their case since the prosecution throughout the trial contended that Dr. Edelin had killed a baby that was “born or in the process of being born.” “After the charge we were very, optimistic and in a light frame of mind because the charge was so specific and so great and supported our theory of the law,” Dr. Edelin said. But, Dr. Edelin said, his “optimism” turned to “concern” as the hours passed Friday, the first day of deliberations and when the jury recessed for the night he said he was worried. Dr. Edelin said that he had read the guilty verdict on the faces of the jurors early yesterday afternoon even before the foreman, Vincent Shea, shouted it out. When the jury strode in and “none of them would look me in the eye,” Dr. Edelin said, “I began to get very apprehensive.” “I don't think this jury was fair,” Dr. Edelin said. “I don't think it would have been possible to get a fair jury in Suffolk County [Boston] no matter how many challenges we might have had.” Praise for 2 Jurors Mr. Homans and Dr. Edelin expressed admiration for two urors—an unmarried bank teller who was the lone holdout for a time against conviction and an alternate, Michael Ciano, who charged after the verdict that racial slurs against Dr. Edelin had been made “more than once” before closing arguments. Dr. Edelin asked Mr. Homans if he could tell about whispered comments he said Mr. Flanagan had made during the doctors three days of testimony as an example of what he said he had been subjected, to. Mr. Homans nodded and Dr. Edelin began: “While I was on the stand one of Bill's [Mr. Homans's] last questions was to go look at the picture of the fetus [which the state had introduced as evidence over defense objections and which a number of jurors said had convinced them to vote guilty] and he asked me if it looked the same as the fetus I had aborted. “I said, ‘No, the face is different.’” “And Bill said, ‘How?’” “I said, ‘It's all distorted.’ And Flanagan leaned over and whispered loud enough for me to hear, ‘Yea, with pain.’ “Then Bill asked me how it looked on Oct. 3 [the date of the abortion in 1973] and I said the skin was smooth and tight and the face was not distorted then. And again Flanagan leaned over and whispered to me: ‘And it was beautiful.’”"
Abortion Foe Cites Role,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/17/archives/abortion-foe-cites-role.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 16—For six weeks Thomas M. Connelly Jr. was a fixture at the trial of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, sitting slightly apart from the other spectators in a folding chair by the courtroom door. Mr. Connelly, a 36‐year‐old bachelor from the city's Dorchester neighborhood who is full‐time “right to life” activist, says he played a major role in the case, in which Dr. Edelin was found guilty yesterday in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion at the Boston City Hospital Oct. 3, 1973. The trial had its beginnings in the publication in The New England Medical Journal in June, 1973, of an article detailing experiments seeking a substitute for penicillin that were performed at hospital on fetal tissue obtained in abortions. The indictment was brought, local political observers noted, “in an election year,” with District Attorney Garrett Byrne up for re‐election. Mr. Connelly said that he sent the Journal article to Raymond L. Flynn, a Roman Catholic who is a State Representative from the largely Irish South Boston neighborhood. Mr. Flynn, in turn, sent it to City Councillor Albert L. O'Neil with a letter saying that all “right thinking people” deplored such activities. Mr. O'Neil was running for sheriff at the time, a race he lost. He held a City Council hearing—at which representatives of the archdiocese testi fied at length—and announced that he would be in the District, Attorney's office in the morning. Four doctors at City Hospital were indicted under a 19thcentury grave‐robbing statute in connection with the experiments. Their trial is pending. In the investigation, two aborted fetuses were found in bottles at the morgue. Mr. Connelly said in an interview that he had learned of the existence of the fetuses and passed the information on to friends in the District Attorney's office. The city hospital had considerable difficulty with its paper work, medical sources said, and the required premature death certificates had not been filed. One of the fetuses, aborted by an operation called a terotomy, similar to a caesarien, section, came from the abortion performed by Dr. Edelin and he was indicted for manslaughter. Mr. Connelly, for a time medical student at the University of Vermont, in made a respectable showing in the last City Council election as an antiabortion candidate. His interest in the matter began, he said, when the girlfriend of an acquaintance became pregnant and the couple wanted an abortion. Because of his medical school background, he recalls he accompanied them, but then warned them away, saying he felt that the practitioners were unskilled. Finally, as the situation became more dangerous, the woman had an illegal abortion in New York and became quite ill, he said. It was the same kind of experience that led Dr. Edelin, among others, to feel that woImen had the right to safe abortions. Dr. Edelin faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, although it would appear unlikely that such a term would be imposed. Colleagues portrayed Dr. Edelin, who had recently been named the hospital's chief resident in obstetrics, as a man unusually dedicated to the hospital's largely poor, black and Latin patients. “That's the crime here,” said Leon White, the city's hospital commissioner. “That man is real municipal hospital doctor.” May Practice Medicine BOSTON, Feb. 16 (UPI)—The chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine said today that Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin can continue to practice medicine despite his manslaughter conviction unless the board rules otherwise. “The issue must come before our board and we may or may not revoke his license,” said Dr. Bancroft C. Wheeler. “We are not bound by a court decision and until his license revoked, he may practice med. icine.” Dr. Wheeler said that Dr. Edelin's case would not be considered unil the latter has exhausted his legal appeals."
Women Rally for Doctor Convicted in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/18/archives/women-rally-for-doctor-convicted-in-abortion.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 17—Lighted candles were placed on the State House steps tonight by crowd of about 1,500, mostly women, to protest the manslaughter conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion. The demonstrators, organized by Boston women's groups, chanted “Not the, church, not the state, women must decide their fate,” as they gathered near the Boston Common. Meanwhile, telephone calls of support poured into the office, of Dr. Edelin's lawyer asp preparations began for an appeal of his conviction. The attorney, William P. Homans Jr., said that about 100 calls offering aid had come in by late afternoon. The conviction of Dr. Edelin, on Saturday had spread shock and dismay throughout much of the medical community and among women's rights advocates who felt it would make doctors fearful of performing abortions in the second trimester, or the fourth through sixth month of pregnancy. The verdict was viewed, however, as a major victory by members of “right to life” organizations and the Roman Catholic hierarchy in their battle to limit the effects of a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1973 against sweeping antiabortion statutes in states. Mr. Homans said that he would file notice of his appeal tomorrow. The major basis, he said, will be a due process objection, contending that Dr. Edelin had not been warned by any state statute that he might be accused and convicted in connection with the abortion. Picture All Important Meanwhile, interviews with the jurors indicated that the most powerful piece of evidence in the case was a photograph of the dead fetus, introduced over defense objections that it was “inflammatory.” The photograph, taken sometime after the fetus was preserved in formaldehyde, showed the body fully formed and the face distorted. Jurors said they were shaken when they saw it. Earlier in the trial, outside of court, the chief prosecutor, Newman A. Flanagan, had said, “When they see those photographs, there's nobody who's going to say that's not a baby.” Despite Dr. Edelin's feeling that “the die was cast” for a guilty verdict “when the jurors were picked,” Mr. Homans said there was no legal basis for challenging the jury because of religious beliefs. The all white, nine‐man, three‐woman jury reflected the ethnic neighborhood makeup of Boston and the neighboring towns of Winthrop and Revere. The traditional influence of the Catholic church is strong in the area. Ten of the 12 members of the jury were carried on the parish rolls of local Catholic churches. Interviews with the jurors also indicated that they felt that the medical expert witnesses put on by the defense —who testified the fetus had little or no chance for survival —had a callous attitude toward human life. “We thought the fetus was alive when he [Dr. Edelin] went in and he neglected to do his duty to save life,” said Mrs. Liberty Ann Conlon. After three votes—and some reported shouting — on Friday night, the jury found itself deadlocked, 1–. On Saturday, the lone holdout, John G. Kelly, a young bank teller, changed his mind. “I believe the majority thought Dr. Edelin was a very fine doctor, a competent doctor,” Mr. Kelly told a reporter later. “But the majority thought he was really unconcerned about whether the fetus was alive.” An alternate juror, Michael Ciano, later told reporters that he had heard other jurors utter racial slurs about Dr. Edelin, who is black. The woman he performed the abortion on is also black. When the verdict was as announced Mr. Ciano burst into tears and was escorted. from the courtroom. The prosecution had contended that an abortion was a “termination of pregnancy,” resulting in either a live or dead fetus. If there was life, the argument went, the doctor's responsibility was to preserve it. The defense contended that an abortion presupposed the loss of the fetus. Dr. Edelin testified that he felt his primary responsibility was to the woman patient. Mr. Flanagan often used the word “baby” over defense objections. Dr. Edelin, in his testimony referred to “the products of conception.” The semantic differences underlined the almost theological struggle in the courtroom. And the protagonists, too, reflected the ethnic and cultural division so much a part of this city's life. Mr. Homans, a tall, rumpled Harvard‐educated man descended from a patrician family, is the area's leading civil liberties lawyer. Mr. Flanagan, the father of seven children, is a combative practitioner out of the city's Irish, Boston College political tradition who is still counted an excellent hockey player. As he paced in front of the jury box, he frequently walked backward with the sure strides of a defenseman back skating."
KILLING OF FETUS IS CHARGED ON L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/18/archives/killing-of-fetus-is-charged-on-li-nassau-prosecutor-to-check.html,"Denis E. Dillon, the Nassau County District Attorney, said yesterday that he would investigate the complaint of a Long Island antiabortion group that a fetus allegedly aborted at the Nassau Medical Center at East Meadow, L. I., on Jan. 19 was a victim of “infanticide” because it had been denied lifesupport systems. The complaint was made in a telegram to Mr. Dillon from John Short of Farmingdale, L. I., and James Ross of Melville, L. I., on behalf of the Long Island Coalition for Life. The telegram did not name the medical personnel involved or the woman on whom the abortion was said to have been performed. Nor did it cite the age of the fetus. It contended: “A live human being, whose birth was prematurely induced by abortion, was denied all the ordinary medical means and reasonable efforts to preserve and protect life and was left unattended for eight hours until death occurred. In protest, we hereby file a criminal complaint of infanticide against the medical personnel involved.” Mr. Dillon, in response, said, “I'll look into the facts and determine whether a violation of law has occurred.” Abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy are legal, but under a new statute in effect since last fall a second doctor must be present at an abortion to assist in maintaining life if a fetus is born alive. A Boston physician, Dr. KenIneth Edelin, was found guilty of manslaughter last Saturday in the death of a fetus after a legal abortion that he performed in 1973. The verdict, considered a victory for antiabortion groups is to be appealed. Mr. Dillon yesterday said he would prosecute a similar case if one arose in his jurisdiction “to clarify the legal situation.” But he added: “I think this is a gray area.”"

Convicted Boston Doctor Put on Probation for Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/19/archives/convicted-boston-doctor-put-on-probation-for-year-physician-given.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 18—Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, convicted of manslaughter in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion, was sentenced today to one year's probation. Judge James P. McGuire of Suffolk Superior Court immediately stayed the sentence pending outcome of an appeal of the case and released Dr. Edelin on his own recognizance. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Boston City Hospital said that Dr. Edelin could continue to practice medicine there. The light sentence pleased the doctor and his supporters, who had been shocked by the jury's verdict. “The judge was extremely fair,” Dr. Edelin said. Courtroom observers had regarded Judge McGuire's charge to the jury, delivered on Friday, as favorable to the defense position. He had instructed the jurors that they could return a manslaughter verdict only if the fetus had attained independent life outside the mother's body. Normally at the close of a trial, judges deliver a short speech thanking the jurors for their service and reflecting on the importance of the jury system, particularly in a complicated trial or one in which the jury has been sequestered, as this one had been for six weeks. Judge McGuire did not do so when the jury returned its verdict on Saturday. Today's action was somewhat unexpected. On Saturday, Judge McGuire continued the case indefinitely. But this morning, he summoned the prosecutor, Newman A. Flanagan, Dr. Edelin and his attorney, William P. Homans Jr. to his courtroom. Dr. Edelin faced a maximum sentence of 20 years. Mr. Flanagan made no recommendation for Dr. Edelin's sentence. During the trial, the courtroom was frequently packed with women supporters of Dr. Edelin, including a number of nurses from the hospital. But today, it was almost empty. Three of the members of the jury have reported to the Boston police that they have received threatening telephone calls and one has said that his car windows were smashed. As Mr. Homans left the courtroom, he said: “Dr. Edelin and I want to say in the strongest terms that we do not think this kind of activity towards any juror or any other person befits a civilized society. We would ask whoever is responsible to refrain from that kind of conduct toward the jurors. They don't deserve it, none of them.” In a case with important medical, political and religious overtones, Dr. Edelin was convicted of manslaughter after performing a legal abortion on a 17‐year‐old patient. So‐called right‐to‐life groups and officials of the Roman Catholic Church viewed the verdit as a victory in their drive to limit the effects of the 1973 Supreme Court decision. Women's rights advocates and many in the medical community say it will make doctors fearful of performing second trimester abortions. Some say it could drive women back to dangerous illegal abortions. The verdict raised the possibility that a woman could come to a hospital for an abortion because she did not want to have the baby, only to have it kept alive for an indefinite period by extremely expensive medical technology. At Beth Israel Hospital here, for instance, officials said today that they had instituted a new policy of keeping life‐saving equipment on hand in all late second trimester abortions. The policy, they said, would add hundreds of dollars a day to the cost of the abortion. Mrs. Beatrice Blair of the National Abortions Rights League in New York, said the women most affected were those who underwent a hysterotomy—the type of operation Dr. Edelin performed—which is used when other means fail. WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (UPI) —A spokesman for the nation's Roman Catholic hierarchy said today that news media coverage of the manslaughter trial of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin contained “innuendo and unfounded accusation directed against the Catholic community.” The spokesman, Russell Shaw, secretary for public affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and its action arm, the United States Catholic Conference, did not comment on the trial. But Mr. Shaw expressed “dismay” at what he called religious overtones in much of the media coverage “during the trial and especially since the verdict was announced.” BOSTON, Feb. 18 (AP)—Dr. Edelin opted for a trial by jury on the basis of a $10,000 poll that he commissioned showing that 85 per cent of Suffolk County's prospective jurors favored abortion in some circumstances. The poll, conducted by Decision Research Corporation of Wellesley, also showed that not all Catholics opposed abortion in this heavily Roman Catholic area. The poll was conducted between Sept. 9 and Sept. 20, 1974, among 1,000 persons considered representative of Suffolk County. Expensive Policy News Coverage Scored Poll Was Commissioned"

[1:3–4.] Metropolitan The Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all Democrats, in Washington for the midwinter session of the National Governors Conference, variously accused President Ford of proposing an economic program based on “planned unemployment,” failure to address the “economic undertow” and failure to appreciate the full impact of “this depression.” Governors Carey of New York, Byrne of New Jersey and Ella T.

Abortion Error,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/19/archives/abortion-error.html,"The complex and sensitive issue of legal abortion in this country—already the subject of bitter controversy —has been made more agonizing than ever by the almost unbelievable decision of the Boston jury in the Edelin case. The conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin for manslaughter is a blow not only to physicians who perform legal abortions but also to the women who need these operations or may need them in the future. It will now become more difficult than ever for women to obtain abortions when they are in the second trimester after conception. Those who do not seek abortions until the third to sixth month of pregnancy are often the poor, badly educated younger women for whom the prospect of giving birth is a particularly great personal disaster, while the life prospects for their undesired progeny are especially grim. One fundamental error, as we have previously noted, was in asking a jury of twelve laymen in a criminal case to decide when human life begins, a judgment that taxes the competence of scientists, physicians, bioethicists and theologians. The jurors—or at least some of them—apparently made the decision on the basis a photograph. As one of the jurors put it, the picture of the fetus “looked like a baby” and that was that. Even more basic to the case than the scientific or ideological debate over the beginnings of actual human life is a much simpler question of law. It is the question whether the state should ever be allowed to try a person for an action that had not previously been specified as legally wrong. The retroactive definition by a prosecutor of a defendant's act as a crime flies in the face of the judicial process, as does the attempt by a prosecutor to use such tactics as a means of outflanking existing law—in this instance, a specific ruling by the Supreme Court. The case was an attempt to use a criminal jury to set social policy. The prosecution's deliberate effort to confuse the jury by using interchangeably the terms “fetus” and “baby” speaks for itself; it showed clearly that the law was being politicized. This is an exercise that should be considered intolerable in any court of law. It is entirely appropriate that Dr. Edelin plans to base his appeal largely on the grounds that his right to due process under the 14th Amendment has been violated by his conviction of an act that had in no way been defined as a crime prior to his indictment. Both the text and the spirit of the historic Supreme Court verdict legalizing abortion suggest that the probability is very high that Dr. Edelin's conviction will be reversed. But the damage done to the cause of rational abortion may be much harder to undo than the conviction itself. Worst of all, it will be the most unfortunate of women—the youngest, the most ignorant, the poorest and the most unsophisticated—who will be the chief sufferers from this jury's misguided decision—until it is reversed."
Italian Abortion Ruling Draws Vatican Warning,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/20/archives/italian-abortion-ruling-draws-vatican-warning.html,"ROME, Feb. 19—The Roman Catholic Church warned Italians today that a ruling by the nation's Constitutional Court easing the legal ban on abortion “does not free human and Christian conscience” from the duty to apply moral standards to the issue. In a landmark decision yesterday, the 15‐man court, Italy's highest tribunal, determined that an article in the penal code outlawing abortion was “partly unconstitutional.” The decision by the court, which was unexpected, caused consternation in the Vatican. In a first commentary yesterday afternoon, the Vatican radio station termed the finding “questionable and of extreme gravity.” The Vatican and Pope Paul VI have made plain in several recent statements that the church is adamantly opposed to any liberalization of abortion laws in Italy or elsewhere. The Constitutional Court's ruling concerned Article 546 of Italy's penal code, which was last revised in 1930 during the Fascist era. The article declares abortion to be punishable by up to five years imprisonment for the consenting woman as well as anyone who causes interruption of her pregnancy. The court re‐examined the penal code provision after a petition from a lower tribunal in Milan. The request for a decision by the Constitutional Court grew out of the case of a Milan woman, a doctor and two other persons facing criminal charges. In yesterday's decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that pregnancy could be interrupted without involving a crime if its continuation endangered the health of the mother."

Returning to work on the obstetrics ward, Dr. Edelin was greeted with cheers, applause and a “Welcome Home” banner. It was one day after he was sentenced to a year's probation pending the appeal of his conviction Saturday. “I was tickled pink that Dr. Edelin got a light sentence—I wish him no harm,” said the jury foreman, Vincent B.

They said there had been no blood transfusions nor any heart failure or change, despite the fact that the 69‐year‐old patient's health had been “compromised” by myasthenia gravis and subsequent cortisone therapy for it, heart fibrillation, pneumonia and severe gall‐bladder infection with jaundice. • When the heir to the world's only remaining Hindu throne ascends it in Nepal during ceremonies Saturday to Wednesday eight Americans will represent President Ford at the coronation of King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva, 29.

Doctor Asks judge to Void Conviction in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/21/archives/doctor-asks-judge-to-void-conviction-in-abortion.html,"BOSTON, Feb. 20—The defense in the trial of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin asked today that his conviction for manslaughter of a fetus in a legal abortion be set aside on the ground that it was “against the weight of the evidence.” The motion, filed in Suffolk County Superior Court this afternoon, contended that the verdict was the result of “bias, misapprehension or‐ prejudice” on the part of the jury and should be voided by the judge as a “miscarriage of justice” under the precedent of previous state cases. Dr. Edelin was convicted last Saturday of manslaughter for the legal abortion he performed on a 17‐year‐old woman in Boston City Hospital. He was later sentenced to one year's probation. The defense argued today that newspaper interviews with the jurors after the trial had indicated that their verdict was based on their feelings of “negligence, as distinguished from the wanton and reckless conduct” the judge's charge had instructed the jury was necessary for a manslaughter conviction. In a telephone interview, the defense attorney, William P. Homans Jr. stressed that he was not raising the issue of the religious affiliations of the predominantly Roman Catholic jury. But, he contended, there was some, “misapprehension or misunderstanding of the law involved, so that the law was not properly applied to the evidence.” “The evidence was so strongly in our favor as to demonstrate there had to have been some kind of extraneous consideration in the minds of the jurors,” he said. The motion asked that either a verdict of not guilty be entered or a new trial ordered. Anger Is Reported BOSTON, Feb. 20 (AP)—The conviction of Dr. Edelin by an all‐white jury has aroused anger in parts of the already tense black community in Boston. “The weight of the evidence in this case was so overwhelmingly on the side of the doctor that we can only explain the verdict as having been motivated either by religious bias, racial bias or both,” Thomas Atkills, president of the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said today. At the same time, Mr. Atkins condemned efforts to overturn the state law which has brought the busing of black and white schoolchildren, saying its repeal would be “proof positive that ours has become a state in which racists may feel comfortable.” Dr. Edelin himself has attributed his conviction in part to racial bias, calling the indictment a “witch hunt” in a city where he could never have received a fair trial. He said two alternate jurors had told him of instances of racial slurs against him while the jury was sequestered. Mr. Atkins said that “of all the doctors at Boston City Hospial, the prosecutors chose the only black department head to make an example of, from the only hospital in the city which has a clientele which is predominantly black.” He said a newly formed Criminal Justice Committee of the Boston N.A.A.C.P. would investigate the circumstances of the indictment and conviction. Dr. Edelin's wife, Prof. Ramona Hoage Edelin, also accused the jurors of racial bias. “What realistically do they care about a black fetus?” said Mrs. Edelin, head of the African‐American Studies department at Northeastern University. Religious bias has also been cited in the jury's verdict, in this heavily Roman Catholic city. Twelve of the original 16 jurors, from whom the final 12 were chosen, were at least nominally Catholic. Archdiocese Defends Jury BOSTON, Feb. 20 (UPI)—The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston defended today the jury in the Edelin case. Ending an editorial silence that extended throughout the six‐week trial, the Archdiocese said, “The juror is not the villain of the piece,” It was responding to Dr. Edelin's postverdict charge that an unbiased jury was unobtainable in Boston. An editorial in the Pilot, the official organ of the Archdiocese, also criticized the press for what it termed biased reporting in defense of the 36‐ year‐old Boston City Hospital obstetrician. The Pilot said Dr. Edelin's contention Sunday that the die was cast for his conviction when the jurors were picked, was like arguing “Mr. Nixon be judged [only] by former Presidents; Watergate defendants be checked only by political people ... criminals only by other criminals ... in short, [that] no one should ever be confronted by just ordinary citizens who might bring community and personal insights into a case far more valuable than peculiar expertise.” “The jurors in the Edelin case saw a person where the defense argued for a fetus,” The Pilot said. A Reaction in Pittsburgh Speciel to The New York Times PITTSBURGH, Feb. 20—Western Pennsylvania Hospital, which operates a widely used abortion center, announced today that it would no longer perform abortions on women who were more than three months pregnant unless the mother's life would be endangered. Hospital officials said the new policy was based on the conviction of Dr. Edelin. Officials also said their decision was based in part on “concern for the issue in the state legislature.”"
Funding Sterilization and Abortion for the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/22/archives/funding-sterilization-and-abortion-for-the-poor.html,"A Department of Health, Education and Welfare proposal, now under study, to fund 90 per cent of the costs of sterilization for the poor but only to match state funds for abortion for the poor, is but the latest example of an ongoing disregard for individual freedom of choice. By such an action, the poor would be deprived of the opportunity to select equally between sterilization and abortion. Worse yet, H.E.W. is encouraging the states to make sterilization the predominant mode of contraception among the poor. And given the history of coercion that characterizes sterilization programs, this proposal should be disallowed. When the Federal Government first entered the field of family planning, in 1970, it pledged to provide a wide variety of contraceptive services to the poor while respecting individual conscience and rights of choice. But a gap between rhetoric and reality quickly emerged. Although the Family Planning Act did not mention sterilization as a contraceptive service, the new clinics were soon sterilizing 100,000 to 150,000 women each year. The department justified this initiative by insisting that voluntary consent was always obtained first. Unfortunately, famiiy planners’ zeal to sterilize the poor often outran their regard for genuine voluntary consent. Convinced that lowering the birth rate among the poor was an apt solution to a host of social problems, from increasing welfare costs to the strain on environmental resources, they paid too little attention to fundamental rights of autonomy. In 1973 and 1974, a few headline cases captured attention. Two black teen‐age girls in Alabaina were sterilized without their consent or that of their parents; a South Carolina woman about to deliver her fourth child was threatened with a cutoff of medical and welfare services unless she “agreed” to sterilization. But abuses are not limited to a few Southern states, and are not the fault of a handful of overenthusiastic doctors. Rather, family‐planning officials in many states freely prescribed DepoProvera as a contraceptive drag even though the Food and Drug Administration had prohibited such use of it because permanent sterilization was one of its adverse side‐effects. The patients who received this drug, not aware of this danger, could not give informed consent. Moreover, national surveys of medical practices have discovered that women in nonprivate hospital wards and black women are sterilized far more frequently, and at younger ages, and after having had fewer children, than women in private wards or white women. One may well wonder how their informed consent was obtained. The coalition of forces ready to impose sterilization on the poor is overwhelming. It is the professionals, the doctors, social workers, and community‐action workers who in the name of doing good and delivering services have often deprived the poor of their rights. The slogan of “reproductive free dom” has come to mean the right to have fewer children, not the right to have more children. Perhaps some of the poor do wish to undergo sterilization, although probably just as many of them, as research has made clear, find having children one remaining source of gratification in otherwise grim lives. Perhaps a reduction of the birth rate among the poor would reduce the environmental crisis (but one doubts it). Perhaps smaller families would elevate the standard of living among the poor (but this reasoning is a variant on the theme of blaming the poor for their poverty). Neverthless, in a society committed to the integrity of the individual other solutions to these problems must be found. Hence, when H.E.W. proposes to fund sterilization but not abortion it selects the worst possible option. Abortion, at least, has none of the finality of sterilization; the woman can later decide to have another child. If the original mandate of the Family Planning Act is to stand, all types of contraceptive techniques must be available to the poor. Ninety per cent funding for sterilization offers seductive incentive to clinics and hospitals to promote this service that they are already overcommitted to. Better to fund. 90 per cent of both programs or to fund neither, than to resolve, as H.E.W. has done, to fund that program which is most irreversible and most susceptible to abuse."
ABORTIONS CURBED AT HOSPITAL ON L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/22/archives/abortions-curbed-at-hospital-on-li-limited-to-first-12-weeks-by.html,"EAST MEADOW, L. I., Feb. 21 — The superintendent of the Nassau County Medical Center said today that the physicians in its department of obstetrics and gynecology would no longer perform abortions on women who were more than 12 weeks pregnant unless the mother's life was in danger. Donald H. Eisenberg, superintendent of the 725‐bed facility, said that the 11 resident physicians, eight full‐time staff members and one part‐time attending staff member in the department were “very concerned” about the manslaughter conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin in Boston last week in an abortion case. The operation is legal in Massachusetts the case centered on whether the fetus had been a “live per son.” Mr. Eisenberg said that the physicians at the Nassau Center took their position at a meeting with the hospital administration Tuesday night after they were told that the hospital could not guarantee they might not be subject to criminal charges. Concern Over Future Dr. Leon Mann, chief of the obstetrics and gynecological department, described the members of his staff as “quite troubled” and “torn with concern over their futures and the women who will come to us for the service.” He added that there was “no question of a live birth within the 12‐week period,” which is known as the first trimester. State law provides that abortions may be performed legally up to the 24th week. The physicians’ stand is not the policy of the hospital. Outside physicians who practice at the county facility will be permitted to perform such abortions if they wish. Mr. Eisenberg said that the department's physicians want clarification of the law. “Doctors who perform abortions want assurances that their best medical efforts will not end in criminal charges,” he said. Charge Over Fetus Another source of concern to physicians who perform abortions at the hospital was charge made last week by spokesmen for the Long Island Right to Life coalition that live fetus had been permitted to die at the medical center after an abortion on Jan. 16. This charge is now under investigation by the United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District in Brooklyn, the Nassau County District Attorney and the hospital itself. Meanwhile, the center will continue to perform all abortions requested up to the 12th week of pregnancy and arIrangements are being made with other hospitals in the county willing to perform the abortions for those women seeking abortions beyond the 12th week, Mr. Eisenberg said. He noted that the county facility performed 1,200 abortions last year, of which more than 300 involved women who were pregnant were more than 12 weeks."
Vatican Condemns All Abortion In Reply to Italian Court Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/22/archives/vatican-condemns-all-abortion-in-reply-to-italian-court-ruling.html,"ROME, Feb. 21—The Roman Catholic Church said today that abortion is morally unconscionable even if it is permitted by civil law. Special to The New York Times The statement released by the Italian Bishops’ Conference was an official church reaction to al ruling of Italy's constitutional court earlier this week that an. article in the penal code outlawing abortion was “partly, unconstitutional.” The court said that abortion was not a crime if the pregnancy endangered the physical or psychological health of the mother. The wording was thought to. permit a broad interpretation of dangers to health in allowing abortions. Until now, abortion has been a crimp punishable by up to five yeas imprisonment for the woman s::eking an abortion or the person performing it. The office of the Pope's Vicar of Rome, Ugo Cardinal Poletti, had issued a statement earlier this week saying that the ruling did not “free human and Christian conscience” from a moral examination of the problem of abortion. Today's statement, which appeared in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, by the Italian church hierarchy said that although the Bishops respected autonomous jurisdiction of church and state, the court's ruling “infringes on a fundamental principle of natural and Christian ethics and of a civil society. No eventual concession by civil law can make an abortion morally legal,” it said."
FOES OF ABORTION CHANGING FOCUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/23/archives/foes-of-abortion-changing-focus-will-seek-to-achieve-goals-by.html,"A leader of the Right to Life Committee in New York State said yesterday that her movement in the state and the nation was concentrating this year on seeking an amendment to the Constitution barring all abortions except those requiredto prevent the death of the mother. Johanna Jankowski, chairman of the New York State Right to Life Committee, also said her Movement was seeking state legislaton designed to encourage “alternatives to abortion” In this category she put Increased medical and hospital maternity coverage in health insurance plans Her organization contends that the present coverage is so poor that it “causes coercion for abortion.” The state organization has been lobbying hard in Albany to persuade the Legislature to urge Congress to act on the “human life” amendment to the Constitution proposed by the national Right to Life Committee. The Right of Life Committee has dropped its effort to get the State Legislature to repeal New York's abortion law because the United States Supreme Court in effect upheld this law when it laid down guidelines for abortion two years ago. The organization instead decided to seek a strong antiabortion amendment to the Constitution as an alternative to repeal. Mrs. Jankowski predicted that physicians in this state would be “a lot more cautious” about performing abortions because of the manslaughter conviction of a Boston physician in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion. “We are going to keep our eyes and ears open to make sure nothing illegal is done,” she said. Under New York law abortion is illegal after the 24th week unless the mother's life is in danger. A second doctor must be present after the 20th week of pregnancy to save the fetus if it shows signs of life. In the field of state legisla‐ tion, the Right to Life Committee is also backing bills to prohibit abortions on minors without parental consent and to require nil abortion counseling agencies receiving public funds to distribute information on available prenatal and postnatal maternal and child‐care services. Other bills it supports would require more accurate and complete statistical information on abortions performed in the state and would broaden the present law protecting the rights of those who refuse to participate in abortion procedures."
Headliner,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/23/archives/headliner-sentence-in-boston-a-guilty-plea-senators-suit.html,"Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin, convicted of manslaughter in the death of a fetus during a legal abortion in Boston, has been sentenced to a year's probation. The sentence, which was announced unexpectedly, pleased the doctor's supporters; it was stayed by Judge James P. McGuire, pending the Outcome of an appeal of the conviction by Dr Edelin. The appeal is based on the premise that Dr. Edelin was denied due process because he was never warned of a possible criminal violation before he performed the abortion However, Dr. Edelin, who is black, also contends that racial and religious prejudice made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial in Boston's Suffolk County. The jurors were all white and predominantly Roman Catholic. Three of the jurors have received threatening phone calls since the verdiet was announced; another had a rock thrown through his window. Representative George V. Hansen, Republican of Idaho, has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor violations of the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. The violations concerned his failure to file one financing report as required. and his omission on another of $14,000 in contributions. His sentencing was postponed because presiding Judge George L Hart said he believed the violations were intentional, and he wanted more information before deciding on a sentence. Mr. Hansen blamed the violations on a misunderstanding of bookkeeping technicalities. State Senator Alene S. Ammond has sued the 28 other Democrats in the New Jersey Senate because they barred her from the Democratic caucus. She was barred because she told reporters what was said during caucus meetings. A Federal judge has ordered that the 28 stand trial for having violated Senator Ammond's constitutional rights. Assistant Senate Majority Leader Joseph D. Merlino was not pleased at the judge's decision. Upon being informed by phone of the decision, he called Mrs. Ammond “a bitch” and “a spoiled brat.”"
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/23/archives/the-world-vorster-talks-to-more-african-leaders-us-arms-aid-to.html,"South Africa's Prime Minister John Vorster has met with Liberian President William Tolbert, further evidence of Mr. Vorster's apparent determination to Improve South Africa's relations with black Africa. News of Mr. Vorster's trip provoked mixed reactions at the Organization of African Unity meeting in Addis Ababa. Some delegates viewed the visit in a positive way and reportedly hinted that South Africa might be considered for membership. Others derided the visit as an “inevitable reaction” to the changing situation in Southern Africa. South Africa and Rhodesia are now almost entirely Surrounded by black‐controlled governments. Mr. Vorster told Mr. Tolbert during their talks that South Africa was willing to yield control over South West Africa, though not immediately. He warned against outside interference in the stalled negotiations between leaders of Rhodesia's white minority government and black leaders. Mr. Vorster and Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda effectively forced the two sides to talks in Rhodesia that may lead one day to black rule; but Mr. Vorster now believes that the Rhodesians should be given time to solve their problems themselves. Ethiopia's requested 530‐million in United States military equipment to help fight rebels in Eritrea province will probably be slow coming, if it is approved at all. Ethiopia is not as important to United States interests as she once was. Most functions of a formerly important American communications center in Asmara are now carried out by communications satellites. Also, the United States is apparently reluctant to antagonize Syria, Libya. Southern Yemen and other Arab countries that support the Eritreans. America's military sales and grants to African nations represent a small percentage of such foreign allotments. Only 2.8 per cent (524.5‐million) of America's total military sales credits and 1.4 per cent ($14.8‐million) of her military assistance grants is scheduled to go to African countries in 1975. The bulk of those allocations will go to countries with strategic Mediterranean or Atlantic Ocean locations. Ethiopia is scheduled to receive $5‐million in sales credits and $11.3‐million in grants this year. With or without additional American arms support, the Ethiopian Government seems to be stepping up the offensive against the Eritrean rebels. The Government has threatened to mobilize six million volunteer militiamen and, to rally public support behind the effort, it has held several mass rallies for national unity. Government troop reinforcements along with several thousand citizen militiamen arrived in Eritrea. Portugal's jubilant revolution of last April that seemed to proclaim the end of dictatorship and the beginnings of democracy, may be all over. The military rulers who promised to relinquish control when a democratic civilian government was elected now elan to retain veto power indefinitely. The military officers said they have .decided that the civilians nominally in charge were unable to cope with the broad changes in policy and form of government that are planned. These include negotiating indepen‐ dente for Portugal's three African colonies, restoring the economy, and forming a stable government. The efforts have been generally successful in Angola, Mozambique and GuineaBissau. However, attempts to reverse the nation's 25 per cent inflation rate have not worked, and workers have struck for increases of 100 per cent or more. Politically, the civilians have faced a classic problem of forming coalition government that included Communists and democrats. The powerful Communists have in recent months made things difficult. For example, they forced passage of bill that places all the trade unions under their control, nearly shattering the coalition. As the problems persisted, so did hints from the Armed Forces Movement that it would take control if the politicians failed with promised econimic and political reforms. Time ran out last week. If the interim civilian government rejects the military's veto plan, the Armed Forces Movement reportedly has threatened to delay elections for national assembly planned for April 12. There has been no response so far from the civilian politicians and it remains unclear what form of government will now emerge in Portugal. However the country's leftist forces have been strengthened by an announcement that the state will take control of key industries and dissolve large land holdings. Portugal has not exactly exported her revolution to neighboring Spain, but the Spanish people, long accustomed to a fascist government have taken heart at developments in Portugal. Protests have grown in recent weeks. Most recently 5,000 Spanish students protested the closing of the University of Villadolid and thousands of of housewives joined an illegal boycott of Madrid's food shops to protest rising prices and political repression. Italy's Constitutional Court has ruled that abortion is legal in some circumstances. The decision could make more difficult the efforts of the Vatican and the governing Christian Demotratic party to defeat proposals for abortion reforms. The court's ruling said that a 44‐ year‐old section of the penal code covering abortions is “partly unconstitutional.” As a result, abortion is legal if continued pregnancy endangers the physical or mental health of the mother. The ruling is bound to speed consideration by Parliament of various bills seeking to end the Fascist‐era law's rigorous prohibition of all abortion. Following his expected re‐endorsement by a carefully controlled national referendum, South Korean President Park Chung Hee, announced he would try to unite all political elements in the country. To that end, last week he began to free political prisoners. Many of those freed had originally been sentenced to death or life imprisonment last year for criticizing the suppression of personal and political freedom by President Park as he assumed near‐dictatorial powers. Among those freed, there were many stories of tortures to extract spurious confessions of Communist sympathies. The best known of the prisoners, the Most. Rev. Daniel Cht Hak Soun, a Roman Catholic bishop, marked his release by celebrating mass at Myongdong Cathedral In Seoul. He said he intends to continue his protests. “We have to have real freedom and a really just society,” he said. President Park's Minister of Justice warned that those engaging In “reckless remarks and behavior” might be re‐arrested."
Soviet Letters on Sex Get No Replies,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/23/archives/soviet-letters-on-sex-get-no-replies-no-proposals-offered.html,"MOSCOW, Feb 22—The day may be coming when teen‐aged Soviet girls get straight answers about sex and love from their parents and teachers. But for now the young women must apparently be satisfied with thesporadic publication of their anxious letters. Every few years, Yunost, a monthly, and Komsomolskaya Pravda, the national youth daily, open their pages to letters pleading for frank discussion of love and sex. But nothing much seems to result from campaigns like the one that seems to be under way. There is no sex education in schools, nor are there programs for counseling or parents It seems It is almost necessary to be a rapist or a nymphomaniac to get official attention. The predominant view of sex in this country, which preens itself as a world leader in social progress, remains puritan In one letter, a girl said her mother dropped her knitting at the posing of a question about Sex. The letter‐publication campaign does not include editonal proposals of what is to be done. Presumably, exposing the problems is as far as the editors dare go. The possible troubles of teen‐aged boys are altogether ignored. In the girls’ letters, the boys appear as lewd fellows who think they know all about love. The excerpts of letters in Komsomolskaya Pravda, said to be from girls up to 16 years old, are full of suffering and indignation. The girls write how mothers and teachers tell them they are too young to be told about sex, which is usually referred to as “it.” One girl said that after she became dizzy several mornings, she and her mother went to several doctors only to learn that the girl was pregnant. Chided for her condition, the girl countered, “And Romeo? And Juliet? How Ohl were they!” Another girl had a legal abortion and the Komsomolskaya Pravda article noted that many pregnant teenagers went to “semiliterate midwives and nannies” for illegal operations. “I was 16 years old,” one girl wrote. “I was waiting for a prince, like everyone my age. I met a boy in the South. I didn't love him, I didn't like him, but the irretrievable took place.” Then she asked whether the boy could be charged with a violation of law. The answer was that he could be brought Into court, but that most families would probably want to avoid that. The author of the Komsomolskaya Pravda article, S Lapteva, noted that while a language was apparently being created for conversations between earth people and creatures from other planets, there was not adequate communication on this planet be‐ tween children and elders The writer predicted that some mothers would hide her article trom their daughters. In Yunost, a 15‐year‐old girl described her frustrating quest for sex information. Her mother dropped the knitting when asked. Her older brother told her love was an anachronism that was now called sex and that she would learn about it soon enough. Women she respected were too embarrassed to discuss It A long‐haired boy “from another courtyard” offered ex‐ plicit instruction, but she declIned In exasperation, the girl wrote “Why don't you teach us love? You are grown‐ups, experienced, wise If you do not answer my questions, there will be others Just eagerly waiting for the chance. They won't shy away. Is it possible that you have never read graffiti on fences and toilet walls” Have you never heard dirty Jokes, words, hints, curses? Those who do all those things will readily explain everything.”"
Article 11 — No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/23/archives/article-11-no-title.html,"“Upstairs, Downstairs,” is over for the season, and the mournful gap left in Sunday evenings can not be filled, even by watching the reruns. The sad truth is, the further the television series gets from High Edwardian times, the less breathlessly we await another installment. The steady decline of Empire, Family and Standards the Bellamys et al. are resolutely illustrating is interesting, but it is no longer fun. It is a long and painful good‐bye And so, one turns to “The Prince and the Lily” with great hopes The Prince is himself, Edward VII, and the Lily is Lillie Langtry, “The Greatest International Beauty of Her Day.” Surely the craving for more Edwardiana will be wonderfully satisfied by a book which lists at its sources such works as Sir George Chetwynde's “Racing Reminiscences and Experiences of the Turf,” Ian Malcolm's “Trodden Ways” and “Vacant Thrones,” Edward Michael's “Tramps of a Scamp” and Frances, Countess of Warwick's “Life's Ebb and Flow.” “Recourse was also made,” the author's introduction goes on, “to the files of …Town Talk … Truth, and The Sporting Times.” Delicious! mounts. A quiek glance through 32 pages of illustrations reveals that some of the required photographs have been included, especially that favorite of late 19th‐century buffs, the picture of Queen Victoria in a garden surrounded by two generations of royal children, all of them apparently immobilized in swaths of clothing. Regrettably, the author does not bother to identify the individuals, although surely the audience for this sort of book still wants to be reminded which one was Eddie (who might have been Jack the Ripper) and which one was Beatrice, the youngest and James Brough concludes his introduction by thanking Sir Basil Bartlett for an interview which “supplied the key to the climax.” It is a measure of the disappointments in store for the reader of this book that two careful readings have still not revealed to what climax Mr. The Prince And the Lily By James Brough. Illustrated. 352 pp. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan. $10.95. Brough had in mind. Perhaps he means the moment that Lillie, a budding 15, learns from her father, the Episcopal Dean of the Isle of Jersey, that she is not to fall in love with or ever see again a young man who is in fact her half brother (and not the only one scattered about the island either!). Perhaps Mr. Brough means the year she meets Prince Edward, (“Bertie” to the family) and becomes his first publicly acknowledged mistress (but not the lasts). Perhaps the author means the year that Lillie finds herself pregnant by the Prince's friend and nephew, Prince Louis Battenberg, goes bankrupt, ships her husband off to America (the husband, having served his purpose, is now alcoholic and poor), has the baby anonymously in France and determines to earn her own living All of these events, and the others in the book, remain somewhat murky due to James Brough's excessively oblique habits of hterary style and construction Perhaps his circumspection is due to a mistaken assumption that Lillie Langtry remains a hying legend even today, and therefore her personality needs only the sketchiest description Perhaps the difficulties that arise while for a reader trying to follow the story spring from too much conjecture based on too little research, or else they come from the author's stubborn refusal to examine the questions raised in the course of the re‐ Why, for example, does the author tell us some interesting stuff about the methods of birth control and abortion that would have been available to a woman of Lillie's class, but say of Lillie herself: “There could be no talk of an abortion … Lillie would bear her child and take the consequences, even if she had not wanted to conceive.” Why? Brough does not say, or even guess Nor does he tell us how he knows that Louis Battenberg was the father, although the author fleetingly claims Louis sent a messenger to make arrangements for support of his daughter. We are never told what those arrangements were, not does the author bother to snake some kind of clarifying admission, such as, perhaps, no one knows. We are told, however, that the Prince never actually denied paternity of Lillie's child. Very mudoling Very typical of the book's approach to biographical We are told, but not particulady shown, that Mrs. Langtry was cold, determined, hulependcot, without illusions. She was breathtakingly beautiful, and just as we have begun to resign ourselves to the possibility that perhaps beauty alone was sufficient to secure the friendship of such people as Whistler, Wilde, Gladstone, Boucicault and Sarah Bernhardt, we begin to read about Lillie's post‐Prince days as an actress, touring America with her own company and making millions. We are not given any of the business details of how she spent those millions (except that she did not spend lavishly on salaries) even though she was one of the first women who shrewdly made a fortune by capitalizing in the onty way available at the time —making a spectacle of herself. Lillie Langtry was obviously nobody's fool, but part of her success was a steadfastly closed mouth, and if this book is any example of the tales she left behind, she took her we The book is full of little historical plums, which the author has irritatingly refused to examine as he races past details in a determined effort to present a superficial sweep. As a result, the book reads as though It had begun as three sections, one was for Lillie, one for the Prince and one for the world—all three having finally been scissored and pasted together, with paragraphs about the Prince in Germany colliding with paragraphs about Lithe buying ranches in California, interspersed among them with small chunks about desperate mill hands and starving miners One of the book's most peculiar omissions is dates. It takes a strong memory and rapid calculation to figure out when anything is happening. It should not be necessary for an author to be circumspect about dates, unless too much is being ascribed to a falsely‐used relationship The Prince and the Lily actually seem to have been lovers for only about four or five years (it is almost impossible to tell from the book) until he introduced her to Prince Louis “Bertie” was a good and loyal long‐time friend, and that friendship helped Lilhe's career —but their whole lives were too separate to sustain a book together. It Is hard to figure out why the effort was made, unless Edward, as well as Edwardian, seemed a good commercial “The Prince and the Lily” reflects so little feeling for the age, and for the personalities of its characters, that readers who are well primed by the accurate historical details of “Upstairs, Downstairs” will find thernselves filling In the blanks in the book. Surely it should be the other way around"
Will Medicine Be Strangled in Law?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/25/archives/will-medicine-be-strangled-in-law.html,"In winning Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin's manslaughter conviction for performing an abortion, the forces opposed to the historic Supreme Court decision of two years ago may have won a battle but lost the war. Certainly the Edelin verdict has produced a national wave of anger that has turned that young physician into something of a hero. But the full significance of the Supreme Court's abortion ruling and of the counterattack represented by the prosecution of Dr. Edelin goes far beyond just this one medical procedure. What has been proved in the abortion area is that it is possible to get public, legislative and judicial support for widening the area of freedom and discretion in doctor‐patient relationships. And this has happened in a period when the great tide has seemed to be just the reverse, a flood of laws, bureaucratic ordinances, and judicial decisions tending to restrict ever more greatly the freedom in this area. More laws involving medicine have been passed this last decade than in all of the rest of United States history before 1965. Through Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, the Government pays for an ever‐increasing portion of all medical care in this country, and it is increasingly demanding the right to control what it is paying for. Simultaneously, however, Government is increasing tile stringency of its controls over all branches of Medical care, regardless of who pays for it. Last May, speaking to the new graduates of the University of Rochester's School of Medicine and Dentistry, the university's Chancellor, Dr. W. Allen Wallis, sketched the 1984‐type vision he saw ahead for the new physicians and dentists: “You may find lawyers defining the range of treatments that you are allowed to use in specified circumstances. Lawyers may prescribe the criteria by which you are to choose among the allowable treatments. Lawyers may specify the priorities you must assign to different patients. Lawyers may require you to keep detailed records to establish at all times that you are in full compliance. Lawyers may punish you unless you can refute beyond a reasonable doubt their presumption that your failures result from not following all of their regulations and requirements.” It is less than a year since Chancellor Wallis made that forecast, but the passage of time has only strengthened the probability that he is right. The justification for these governmental interventions is the alleged desire to protect people or to achieve seemingly positive ends such as better cost control and increased efficiency. And from, time to time there are spectacular scandals such as the current nursing home mess which shows what can happen when Government funds gush forth bountifully with virtually no check at all on how they are used. But what is becoming glaringly evident is that the proliferation of controls and safeguards in the medical area threatens the very possibility of even conducting medical care as we have hitherto known it. One reason is the incredible complexity of the medical system, and the inability of legislators and bureaucrats alike to foresee the consequences of their interventions. Another reason is simple ignorance, and more than one law is on the statute books now that would not be there if the legislators had really known what they were doing. Two out of many possible examples may illustrate the ignorance of legislators in the health area. A few years ago there was a wave of legislative action to do something about sickle‐cell anemia, a disease primarily affecting blacks. In the event, it turned out that the Government‐ordered and Government‐financed screening of black Children and black adults for the sickle‐cell trait was producing many harmful results for the intended beneficiaries, and contributing little if anything to their welfare. Then there was the bill passed in late 1973 designed to subsidize and otherwise promote the formation of so‐called Health Maintenance Organizations. Now many leaders in that movement believe the bill to help them turned out to be a severe deterrent to their growth because the legislators simply did not understand what they were doing. Chancellor Wallis ended his message to the young physicians and dentists last May on a note of hope: “The lawyers have you outnumbered,” he declared, “but on the average they are no match for you in intelligence or dedication. Just don't let them ambush you while you are absorbed in caring for the sick.” But perhaps the Supreme Court decision on abortion and the negative public reaction to Dr. Edelin's conviction provide a more concrete ground for optimism that growing bureaucracy and regulation need not strangle doctor‐patient relations. The Supreme Court declared two years ago after all that at least in the early months of pregnancy abortion is a matter for decision simply between each patient and her doctor. Who knows? Perhaps some day other phases of medical care will regain that same old freedom."

TOP GERMAN COURT REJECTS ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/26/archives/top-german-court-rejects-abortion-bonns-1974-law-allowing.html,"BONN, Feb. 25—The West German Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, in a highly controversial decision, today struck down as unconstitutional a law allowing abortions on request during the first three months of pregnancy. The court's 6 to 2 decision said the measure legalizing abortions, which was approved by the West German Parliament last June but never became effective, violated the Constitution's guarantee of the right to life for everyone. The court, whose authority is similar to that of the United States Supreme Court, did however rule that abortions could be performed in the first three months of pregnancy in cases of rape, of danger to the mother's health, when there was a prospect that the child might be born deformed and when the birth could cause “grave hardship.” The court president, Ernst Benda, read the decision at the tense, heavily guarded Karlsruhe court building as about 1,000 pro‐abortion demonstrators staged a protest march in the city center. Other demonstrations against the decision, involving thousands of protest‐ ers, were held later today in many German cities including Munich and Hamburg. The decision is a major setback for the Government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats. The Government is now expected to propose a new law that will probably interpret in the widest possible legal terms the “grave hardship” principle of the court's ruling. Nevertheless, the decision means that West Germany will not join the growing number of West European countries, which now includes Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, where all abortions performed in a certain period, usually the first three months of pregnancy, are either legal or are not subject to prosecution. Instead it will remain among those countries, such as Italy and Belgium, where any abortion must meet sharply defined criteria. In Bonn today Justice Minister Hans‐Jochen Vogel said that the Government would accept the decision as reflecting the law but still considered its arguments for the three‐month unconditional abortion period “sound and conclusive.” Leaders of the opposition Christian Democratic Union said they were now ready to work with the Government to find a solution to the abortion problem along constitutional lines, but the leader of the West German Roman Catholic Church, Julius Cardinal Döpfner of Munich, welcomed the ruling as a “limitation to the growing trend of watering down basic social values.” It is estimated that. hundreds of thousands of West German women get illegal abortions in this country each year or go abroad for them and there have long been calls for reform of the 104‐year‐old abortion law, which prescribes a five‐year jail sentence for infractions. As opposition to any change, especially from the Roman Catholic Church, has stiffened in recent years, bitter debates and incidents have developed. The Social Democrat ‐ Free Democratic Government made the issue a central element in its social reform program in 1972. Last June it pushed the liberalizing law through the lower house of Parliament by vote of 260 to 218, overriding a veto by the upper house, which is controlled by the conservative, church‐linked Christian Democratic Union. The Christian Democrats immediately appealed the law to the Constitutional Court, which issued an injunction on June 24, 1974 suspending the legislation while it deliberated. The court's conservative majority ruled today that the Constitution gave top priority to the preservation of life and required that this principle be given the widest possible interpretation in the laws. Thus, according to the court, the state has a duty to protect the human being from the beginning of its existence, which, the rulmg said, means the 14th day after conception. The decision took note of more liberal laws in other coun‐ tries, but said that the “bitter experience” of the Nazi period in Germany provided historical grounds for determining that protection of human life should receive absolute priority. This order of values, the court said, can be overridden only in the special instances that were cited."

Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/27/archives/metropolitan-briefs-nassau-suit-seeks-to-force-abortions.html,"A class‐action suit to force the Nassau County Medical center to perform abortions on welfare recipients who want them up to the 24th week of pregnancy was filed yesterday in Federal Court in Brooklyn. Chraging that hospital policy banning abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy was dictated by “hysteria and fear of criminal prosecution,” the suit sought an injunction to force the hospital to comply with a two‐and‐a‐half‐year‐old Federal Court ruling specifically directing that abortions be performed on indigent women up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Donald H. Eisenberg, superintendent of the hospital, said it was willing to have the abortions performed, but the house staff had voted unanimously against doing them following the manslaughter conviction in Boston earlier this month of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin for performing a legal abortion that resulted in the death of a male fetus. Charles W. Bates, former Welfare Director of Ohio, has been named as Westchester County's Commissioner of Social Services. He replaces Dr. Leonard Berman, who resigned six months ago after his wife was indicted on welfare fraud charges. The Department of Social Services administers public‐assistance programs, and its budget of $175‐million represents more than half the county budget. In Ohio, the 47‐year‐old Mr. Bates supervised a $1‐billion budget. During, his three years in Ohio, Mr. Bates implemented a computerized Medicaid management system. The Westchester County Executive. Alfred B. DelBello, said Mr. Bates hoped to computerize much of Westchester's socialservices work. William J. Ronan agreed yesterday to testify at a New Jersey legislative inquiry into gifts totaling $550,000 given him by Vice President Rockefeller.

Mr. Valdez then shot himself once in the head and died shortly afterward at Flushing Hospital… A 21‐year‐old man was shot and critically wounded on a Bronx street in an apparent dispute over drugs, according to the police. He was identified as Michael Weber of 230 West 129th Street. He was shot in the head, back and chest at 11:30 P.M.

ROCKEFELLER POSES ENERGY SOLUTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/27/archives/rockefeller-poses-energy-solutions-urges-that-auto-industry-adapt.html,"DETROIT, Feb. 26 — Vice President Rockefeller, appearing in the capital of the depressed automobile industry, said tonight that the solution to the energy problem was not to “downgrade” the auto industry but to adapt it to “new energy realities.” Mr. Rockefeller told an enthusiastic audience of about 2,700 members of the Society of Automotive Engineers and top industry executives in Cobo Hall that the years ahead could be the “golden age” for automobile engineers, with improvements in gasoline mileage and development of new types of engines and alternate fuels. He urged Congress to act quickly on President Ford's economic and energy proposals, which he described as “a Swiss watch” with interrelated parts. “This country doesn't have too much time to waste. So we've got to get going,” Mr. Rockefeller said. The speech tonight was Mr. Rockefeller's fourth speaking engagement out of Washington since he took office last Dec. 19, and it brought him into one of the areas that unemployment has hit the hardest. Unemployment in Detroit now stands at 14.2 per cent, com‐ pared with the national average of 3.2 per cent. An estimated 263,000 auto workers, out of the industry's total of 700,000 in the nation, have been laid off, either temporarily or indefinitely. Mr. Rockefeller, according to one of his aides, made the trip at the request of President Ford, who was in Florida. The Vice President said in an impromptu news conference after arriving at the Detroit airport, that he and the President “feel very badly” and “are deeply concerned about the unemployment situation here.” He said that reversing the unemployment trend was “the first and most important thing” on the President's mind. The Vice President said he thought the unemployment situation would improve, “but not as fast as everybody would like to see it” Asked when that improvement would come, Mr. Rockefeller replied: “When the people start buying cars again.” About 250 pickets, ranging from opponents of abortion to a group chanting, “Jobs at home, not war abroad,” were outside the hall when Mr. Rockefeller's motorcade arrived, but his car entered the vast arena by a back entrance without encountering them."
Catholic Officials In Philadelphia Cut Ties to Girl Scouts,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/27/archives/catholic-officials-in-philadelphia-cut-ties-to-girl-scouts.html,"PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 26 (AP) —The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia is severing relations July 1 with the Girl Scouts organization in a dispute over moral questions of abortion and birth control. The Rev. Francis X. Schmidt, director of the department of youth activities of the archdiocese, said yesterday that Philadelphia was the first archdiocese in the nation to sever ties with the Girl Scouts. The 8,000 girls will be asked to switch to the Camp Fire Girls, which an archdiocese spokesman described as more God‐conscious. There are about 29,000 Grl Scouts in the area. Father Schmidt said that the Girl Scouts had failed to show “adequate concern or desire” for the beliefs of Roman Catholics. “We are, of course, not at odds with the humanistic goals of the national Girl Scout organization,” Father Schmidt said. “But we believe the Girl Scouts have moved more directly into an area which has deep religious dimension.” Specifically, the archdiocese opposed a badge program begun 1973 called To Be a Woplan. This advocated study of birth control devices, and discussions on abortion and rape. We agree that these areas sought to be addressed by young girls but we believe that they are, for Christians, areas directly involving one's relationhip with God,” Father Schmidt said. The archdiocese, in a statement, said that the Camp Fire organization had the same general goals as the Girl Scouts but recognized the right of religious sponsors to handle religious questions."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/27/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"Of Abortion, Manslaughter and the Case of Dr. Edelin To the Editor: The conviction in Boston of Dr. Kenneth Edelin of manslaughter of a fetus during a legal abortion should help dispel pro‐abortionist claims that abortion is no longer an issue in either American society as a whole or in the medical community in particular. The verdict in this major trial is one of the most significant legal decisions since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. It could herald the return to a respect for the dignity of human life protected by law. Our strong belief in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness has no significance if life itself is not also guaranteed. Let the good news from Boston, historic cradle of American liberties, spark a new era in our efforts to save the unborn child. MICHAEL G. KIELTY, M.D. La Jolla, Calif., Feb. 19, 1975 • To the Editor: The prosecution and conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin for manslaughter in connection with the death of a fetus, removed in a legal abortion, is totally unacceptable as a matter of law. No one in the position of Dr. Edelin could reasonably have known that he might commit homicide because the fetus, who was expected to die, did die. Of course, Dr. Edelin should have tried to save the fetus, if possible. That is not the point. The point is that, given the overwhelming expectation of death, death should not be crime unless a physician disregards specific rule establishing his obligation to the fetus, after the abortion. A general manslaughter statute is not such a rule. Therefore, its general language should not have been read as applicable to the death of a fetus following an abortion. Indeed, such a reading makes the manslaughter statute, as applied, unconstitutionally vague, for the statute fails to give the warning we demand of our criminal laws. HARRY H. WELLINGTON Phelps Prof. of Law. Dean Designate Yale Law School New Haven, Feb. 17, 1975 • To the Editor: Space permits me to point out only four of the fairly well concealed legal and logical contradictions contained in your Feb. 14 editorial “Aborting the Law.” • Dr. Edelin's guilt or innocence rightly revolves on the issue of whether a human life had already begun. There can be no homicide without the death of a human being. The U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, the case responsible for the present status of abortion law, answered the question of when life begins, despite its disclaimer. By permitting “elective” abortions until a certain point of gestation, can there be any serious doubt that the Court was implying that until that point a fetus was not a human being, and therefore the taking of its ‘life” criminal homicide? You now complain when the issue is squarely faced by a jury; perhaps the Supreme Court's method of deciding crucial issues by evading them is preferable. • The jury in deciding whether life was present is not defining the crime. The definition of homicide is clear. In any homicide case the jury must decide whether the victim was in fact killed. Thus, the jury performs the same function when, for example, man is accused of killing another who he contends was already dead. The jurors must decide from the facts whether the victim was alive when the defendant acted. This is all they are asked to do in this case. • You succeed only in clouding the issue by saying that a legislative rather than a judicial solution is required. Need I remind you that it was the judiciary which subverted the legislative will in Roe v. Wade? Why was there no objection then but such strenuous dissent now? • Let's not kid ourselves. Social policy is always set In a courtroom. This case is no different from any other in which a court may decide issues bearing on privacy, civil rights or freedom of the press. DANIEL STERN Carlisle, Pa., Feb. 14, 1975 • To the Editor. The right‐to‐life people spent a great deal of money, time and effort to convict Dr. Edelin. In light of their concern, I cannot help but wonder about the “rights” of Mrs. Elsie. DeFratus, who was terminated by starvation (news story Feb. 13). The abortion was the result of an agreement between at least two reasonable (we presume) and responsible., people. Who agreed to the death of Mrs. DeFrattis? And who will put forth any effort to see that her fate does not befall the thousands of old people like her? Before the anti‐abortion forces intrude themselves into the professional affairs of doctors and the private lives of patients, there should be a re‐examination of “the right to life”—in terms of those who have already earned that. right. It is the most perverse pracace of the Christian ethic which commits. Us to posterity and blinds us to the suffering of our fellow men. KAKY DAFLER Yardley, Pa., Feb. 16, 1975 On a China Issue To the Editor: Anthony Lewis has been guilty of a glaring untruth. In a recent column he wrote that the “effort to blame individual Americans for ‘losing China’ to the Communists” began with a: series of articles I wrote for the Saturday Evening Post in 1950. A hairsplitting supporting argument might be made if Mr. Lewis had stopped right there. The articles were an analysis of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell's devastatingly incompetent leadership of the China‐Burmedndia theater in the Second World War; so an “individual” was indeed blamed. But Mr. Lewis instead summarized my articles’ as arguing “that U.S. Foreign Service officers biased against Chiang; Kai‐shek's• regime and toward the Communists had helped to undermine.’ the Nationalists.” No such argument was put forward by me at any time. John Paton baviei and the other Foreign Service officers who held appointments under General Stilwell did not—at least in my opinion—have much influence on events in China while they were active there. The responsibility. belonged to General Stilwell alone. This was made abundantly clear throughout’ My “artides. In fact, I should hardly have mentioned John Davies and the other Foreign Service officers if it had not been useful to document the viewpoint then prevailing on General Stilwell's staff. Furthermore, I did my best to put their publicly recorded views into sensible, proportion. Of John Davies, for example, I wrote that he had foreseen something like Titoism in China before Titoism had manifested itself in Yogoslacvia. I then continued to see all of these men, whom I had known in China. in the various security proceedings, gave testimony for them, appearing for John Davies no less than five times if my memory serves. I further secured lawyers for John Carter Vincent and at least one other man in the group. I also appeared before the McCarran committee to make a public accusation of perjury against the exCommunist Louis Budenz, who had charged‐ John Carter Vincent with being the Communist party's “guide” of former Vice President Henry A. Wallace on his China trip. In my opinion, Budenz was a perjurer, but it was neither easy nor fashionable to say so in those days. In addition, the files show that Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and his allies had no more vocal, no more persistent and, above all, no sharper and earlier opponents in the whole spectrum of the American newspaper business than my brother Stewart and myself. Being falsely accused by Mr. Lewis of starting the whole thing was therefore just a mite embittering. JOSEPH ALSOP Washington, Feb. 6, 1975 • Dancing in the Park To the Editor: In regard to the possible summer uses for the Wollman skating rink in Central Park, a question raised by Ms. Eugenia Flatow in her Feb. 15 letter, I would like to suggest an activity for which it had been used before the inception of the Rheingold, and later Schaefer, concerts. That is, free square and folk dancing sponsored by the Parks Department. When these dances were held there, a person could enjoy the beauty of a Central Park sunset and then continue the evening by dancing (a good form of exercise, more fun than jogging) to the calls provided by two recreation leaders from the Parks Department It would be a wonderful idea if these dances were revived. They would not draw the huge crowds that the concerts draw, but those who do participate will enjoy the events. CHARLES KLUEPIEL Glen Oaks, N.Y., Feb. 15, 1975 Plea‐Bargains vs. the Innocent To the Editor: Your Jan. 27 news article on resolution of homicide cases in New York City correctly points out one aspect of the abuses of justice by the pleabargaining system. However, throughout the article a dangerous assumption is implied: that all those who plead guilty to a lesser charge have in fact committed the offense for which they were indicted. This obscures another, equally serious injustice in the system. Consider a man arrested and indicted for murder, often, as you point out, on insufficient evidence. He is represented by a lawyer appointed by the court, whom he neither knows nor necessarily trusts and who is himself often harried and overworked. He is pressured by the District Attorney, and often by his own lawyer, to plead guilty to a lesser charge. ‘He knows that if he does, ‘he may get probation, or parole after three years; if he does not, he may get a life sentence. If he says he is guilty, he may be immediately released, but if he says he is innocent, he may go to jail for life. Given this choice, the question of his actual guilt or innocence becomes academic. Unless he has complete faith in the justice of the criminal‐justice system, it is very possible that he will take the course of least risk, whether he is in fact guilty or not. As a physician working in pretrial detention facilities I met many men facing similar “choices.” Often, indicted for a lesser offense and having waited many months in jail for a trial, they were offered immediate release for “time served'’ if they pleaded guilty, versus a longer wait for a trial, which could result in a longer sen‐ tence, if they insisted on their innocence. Does a guilty plea under such circumstances have any relation to defendant's actual guilt or innocence? The system of plea‐bargaining, and of pretrial detention, violates the concept of justice on all counts: The guilty are freed, the innocent are punished, and both are denied due process, Thesystem should be abolished. DAVID A. MOLTZ, M.D. New York, Feb. 4, 1975 A Regent's Rebuttal To the Editor: In your editorial “Reforming the Regents” (Feb. 15), you have used the Regents’ opppsition to forced busing of children for integration purposes as a reason for favoring reform in the method whereby the Legislature has elected Regents for the past 190 years. You have stated, directly and by innuendo, that I and other Regents have been selected “in the log‐rolling secrecy of legislative offices”; that “conflicts of interest” have existed in the past; that I have been “required to make specific prior commitments on policy matters,” etc. I was elected as a Regent ‘by the State Legislature a year ago after be ing questioned intensively by members of rival political parties. My preparation for service as a Regent is thirty years in the New York City public school system as a teacher and assistant principal who was active in professional, not political, affairs. I did not seek election as a Regent, nor have I ever sought public office. I have not been active in politics, and I am not active in politics now. I made no advance commitment to anyone about busing, or any. other matter facing the Board of Regents—the highest edu‐ cation‐policy‐making body in the state. The gravamen of your opposition to me and to the new majority in the Regents is that we have rejected forced busing as a means of integration. Ergo, opposition to a dearly held position of The Times must be equated with perfidy and subjected to calumny. Rather than the Regents doing damage to the schools, as you conclude, I believe that the action of the new majority in changing the Regents’ position on forced busing will prevent school districts in our major cities from undergoing the Boston trauma. We have made serious efforts to integrate for twenty years. The effect of further forced integration would be disintegration and, thereby, damage irreparably children of all races and national origins In our pluralistic society. GENEVIEVE S.

Cancer Institute Chief Cautions On the Use of Birth Control Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/28/archives/cancer-institute-chief-cautions-on-the-use-of-birth-control-pill.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 — The so‐called “morning after” birth control pill called DES should be banned if unnecessary use of it cannot be curbed, the director of the National Cancer Institute testified today. The testimony, by Dr. Frank J. Rauscher Jr., came only a few days before Food and Drug Administration approval of DES becomes effective for “morning after” contraceptive use in emergencies. Earlier witnesses today at a Senate subcommittee hearing said the drug was already being widely used for birth control purposes by college students and others who did not understand the risks involved. The full name of the drug is diethylstilbestrol. It has several other medical uses, for which it is already approved. During the 1950's and 1960's DES was considered useful in preventing spontaneous abortion or miscarriage in women whose pregnancies seemed to be in danger and thousands of pregnant women used’ the drug. There appears to be no risk for the woman who uses the drug but if she becomes pregnant and bears a daughter, there is a slight possibility that the child will develop a rare vaginal cancer 15 or 20 years later. Testimony of Mothers About 220 such cases have come to light in recent years, all of them associated with treatment of the mother with DES during her pregnancy. At the hearing today two mothers whose daughters died of this rare type of cancer det scribe their tragic experiences and urged that the drug be banned. A third woman, whose mother had taken the pill to insure that her pregnancy would be successful, testified to her own experience with the cancel. She has survived, but the surgery necessary to preserve her life rendered her incapable of bearing children of her own. Approval of the drug for contraceptive use is to become effective in. March, but only for emergency use. Dr. Alexander M. Schmidt, Commissioned of Food and Drugs, said today the drug should be used only for such birth control purposes as preventing pregnancy after rape or incest. If used soon after intercourse it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, Dr. Schmidt said, and it appears to Ibe entirely safe for the woman who takes it. He emphasized that it should only be used under emergency circumstances, and that a package insert for the patient, as well as information to be made available to the doctor, would make this abundantly clear. Kennedy Is Skeptical Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the subcommittee on Health and Administrative Practice, said that the history of the drug's use made him skeptical that it would be used only as advised by the drug agency. The Democrat film Massachusetts said the F.D.A. itself had contributed to the current confusion over DES in birth control. In May, 1973, the drug agency sent doctors a bulletin announcing that it had approved DES for emergency contraceptive use after rape, incest or in cases in which the patient's life would be endangered by pregnancy. The agency explicitly warned against routine or frequent use of DES as a contraceptive. Dr. Schmidt said today that the bulletin was correct in all respects except one: The F.D.A. intended to approve the drug for emergency contraception, but had not actually done so officially and, indeed, did not actually do so until this year. Under extended questioning by Senators Kennedy and Richard S. Schweicker, Republican of Pennsylvania, Dr. Schmidt did not make clear why the F.D.A. never sent out a corrective bulletin saying DES had not yet been approved for contraceptive use. In his testimony, Dr. Rauscher agreed with Dr. Schmidt that DES was safe and effective as a contraceptive for the woman who used it and was worthwhile drug for emergency use. Under questioning, however, he said it should not be used at all if the use could not be kept tightly restricted."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/01/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: The statement attributed to Morris Abram, chairman of the Moreland Commission on Nursing Homes, that he is considering “the advisability of moratorium on the building of such homes and the channeling of their Medicaid funds to home‐care services” (news story Feb. 16) suggests a possible light at the end of one of the darkest tunnels in the recent history of U.S health care. Aside from the question of fraud, U.S health policy is crying out MT reexamination of our overcommitment to institrtional care and undercommitment io less‐expensive services such as public‐health nursing, home care and consumer health education. Consider, for example, ‘a recent home‐care experiment based in St Vincent's Hospital and reported in the January 1975 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine. Despite the modest dimensions — involving only 169 patients — the authors claim significant savings. At a minimum rate of $800 month for Medicaid patients in a New York City nursing home, and with an estimated total of seventy maintained at home rather than institutionalized, they claim a one‐year saving of $340,000 from this factor alone. At $150 day for acute hospital care and on the assumption that 1,000 days were saved during the year, they estimate an additional saving of $150,000. Even if these figures are overstated, the broad conclusion is inescapable: Home care, when efficiently organized, with quality controls and good back‐ up services, is a highly cost‐effective way of caring for many of the elderly. Moreover, most prefer to remain in their homes. Despite the general praise for home care, however, we are unlikely to see rapid expansion. Even where financial support is available, as under Medicare, relative use is declining. The reasons are damply imbedded in existing methods of organizing and financing U.S health care, in the education of physicians and in our societal mores. They will not be easily overcome. One possibility for positive action grows out of current unemployment and interest in public‐service jobs. Hospitals are a likely site. Instead of adding more nurses’ aides, janitors and others, who may not be needed, why not develop a corps of home health workers and health educators who could provide the basic health information, human support and continuing links to the physician and hospital that are often all that is needed. Ten thousand such “paramedics” could bring assistance and comfort to many of our 21 million aged while acquiring useful skills themselves. If accompanied by meaningful institutional cost controls, the saving to society could be substantial. Sooner or later, the nation will have to face up to the basic issue: Who should be the primary beneficiaries of gur $100‐billion‐a‐year health‐care economy: consumers or providers? (Assoc. Prof.) ANNE R. SOMERS New Jersey‐Rutgers Medical School Piscataway, N. J., Feb. 18, 1975 The Young Killers To the Editor: The recent tragic slaying of Paul Walter in an IRT subway train, with no apparent show of remorse by the three teen‐aged suspects in the homicide, once again points to the need for reform in our juvenile‐justice system. It is quite clear that today's youth, educated and indoctrinated more intensively than in any time in history by the media, matures at an earlier age. Lagging behind in this maturation process, particularly in the case of those with dislocated families, drug volvement and other problems, is the inculcation of a moral sense. When teen‐ager, in short, realizes he can commit virtually any criminal act and get away with it or suffer at most light sentence, he will tend to commit the act more often. It is time to give the judge the option to treat juvenile offenders as adults where circumstances warrant. Any legislation drafted to accomplish this aim, however, should also create, Chavez and the Winery To the Editor: Ronald Taylor's Feb. 8 Op‐Ed article, “Chavez's Union: A Future?”, contains misstatements of fact as they apply to the E. & J. Gallo Winery and, its workers. Since these misstatements are the keystone of his case that our workers had no voice in their own destiny, they must be clarified. Taylor attributes a statement to Ernest Gallo acknowledging that workers who had gone out on strike had not taken part in the contract ratification process. Taylor then goes on to state immediately, “Only those strike breakers working behind the U.F.W picket lines had signed cards authorizing the Teamsters to represent them....” Through advertence or inadvertence, Mr. Taylor is confusing two totally separate actions on the part of our workers, i e., the selection of the Teamsters as their bargaining agent and the ultimate ratification of the Teamsternegotiated contract. On Stine 25, 1973, by hand‐delivered letter to the E. & J. Gallo Winery, the Teamsters stated that they represented a majority of our farm workers and could demonstrate such proof to us. On June 26, Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers were notified or at least contemplate, changes in the penal system which would eradicate the “revolving door” which characterizes it today and substitute a real rehabilitative program. There is no priority as between prevention, punishment and rehabilitation. While we need to realize that the system of criminal‐justice administration cannot be reformed piecemeal if we expect to create lasting positive effects, comprehensive reform is timeconsuming. Either the Legislature must act quickly and positively to study and correct the growing problem of street crime, or society is doomed to watch the ten o'clock news and wonder when their turn will come. RICHARD H. REIBEN New York, Feb. 20, 1975 Death by ‘Benign Neglect’ To the Editor: I read with some discomfort the prominence given to a news article concerning Dr. Edelin's charge that “racial and religious prejudice had made a fair trial in Boston impossible.” A more balanced treatment of this verdict would suggest that the jury's decision, until proven otherwise, reflects the opinion of a substantial segment of the community, both medical and non‐medical. It is most difficult to justify termination of the life of a potentially viable 24‐week gestation without providing medical support. The question here is not only one of a second trimester abortion but whether a physician may choose to ignore the modalities of treatment available to sustain life. It appears to me that the ethos of a civilized society mandates that no physician shall arbitrarily decide that a life may be terminated by the process of “benign neglect.” DAVID KOFFLER, M.D. Professor of Pathology Mount Sinai School of Medicine of this claim. On the morning of June 27, for the first time, a strike was called by the United Farm Workers. Substantially less than a majority of our workers responded to this strike call. In fact, the Teamsters had secured their proof of representation of a majority of our agricultural workers prior to the strike call. No further action taken by the U.F.W offered any factual evidence to the contrary. The contract negotiated between the Teamsters and the E. & J. Gallo Winery was ratified by our workers on July 10, 1973, by a vote of 158 to 1, as reported by The Times on July 11. Ernest Gallo's statement that those who were out on strike on that date did not vote in the ratification was factual but had no reference to the petition signed by our workers designating the Teamsters as their bargaining agent. The contract that was ratified by the workers on July 10 made them the highest‐paid agricultural workers in the continental United States, with a full package of fringe benefits to include such items as paid vacations, pension plan, hospitalization and major medical protection and unemployment insurance. The pay scale of the Gallo agricultural workers today ranges from a minimum of $3.10 per hour to $4.05. GEORGE W. FRANK Vice Pres., E. & J. Gallo Winery Great Neck, L. L, Feb. 21, 1975 Of Jersey and Taxes To the Editor About the only printable word I can think of to characterize the conclusion of your Feb. 14 editorial “Jersey Reckoning” is “hogwash.” In whose constitution is it written that government should be all things to all people? Certainly not the U.S. Constitution or that of New Jersey. I'm persuaded that income should meet expenditures. To do otherwise is to invite bankruptcy. I can't run either my business or my home on the principle of repeated deficit financing, and I'm hard‐pressed to understand how municipal, state or Federal government can or should. To label an income tax as “the one fair way” out of the fiscal bind of New Jersey is the most specious postulate I've ever read. Solemn promises by our Governor to the contrary, enabling legislation to provide for a personal income tax is nothing more than license to steal from the New Jersey taxpayer. ‘All one has to do is to open his eyes and look at our neighboring states. Every bit of tax legislation designed to keep property taxes down has failed to achieve its stated goal. A modest sales tax of 2 to 3 per cent has ballooned to 6 and 7 per cent. Personal income taxes, while modest to start, have expanded equally. Yet property taxes have remained at their prior levels or grown as well. Any scheme that makes one citizen, compared to another, pay a disproportionate share of his income to support a government appears to me to be regressive rather than progressive. What it accomplishes is to penalize a productive person for the privilege of being a citizen. I object to anyone sticking his hand in my pocket to fund programs that are ill‐conceived, illadministered and nonproductive. I, for one, don't want to see the New Jersey taxpayer in the same dilemma as the New York State resident, or worse, God forbid, the poor soul who lives in New York. City. We have enough people in New Jersey trying to work out our problems without articles such as this. Hang in there, Senators! A. F. TABER JR. Linden, N. J., Feb. 14, 1975 Army vs, Life To the Editor: The unseemly haste with which the Secretary of the Army dispatched his orders to massacre millions of blackbirds underscores the spuriousness of the military's contention that their planned rain of death was prompted by reasons of health and safety. During this century the peoples of this earth have been painfully aware that, given sufficient technical power, a criminal mentality and a commitment to extermination, it is more “feasible” to destroy a landscape than to protect it, to decimate a population of living creatures than to control them, to violate humane sensibilities than to enhance them. [Editorial Feb. 19.] The coda of “Over There” has finally become “Over Here.” ‘The war has been brought home, and life is the enemy. EDMUND D. ASSANTE New Rochelle, N. Y., Feb. 20, 1975 Wage Substitute Flaws To the Editor: The recent report that the state's Commissioner of Labor, Louis L. Levine, was considering legislation to increase the Unemployment Insurance maximum raises several tandem problems. Disabled and unemployed workers in our state are protected under three different forms of wage replacements, i e., Unemployment Insurance, Workmen's Compensation and Disability Benefits, designed to replace lost wages when a worker is unemployed, sick or disabled. Since the social and legislative objectives of all programs appear to be identical, it is difficult to understand, or rationalize, the variations used to compute and determine the differences in income to which worker is entitled under each law. Under Workmen's Compensation, for example, a disabled worker receives benefits calculated at twothirds of his earnings with a maximum of $125 per week. The wage base used to determine average earnings is the year's earnings prior to the disability. Under Disability Benefits, the benefits paid are calculated on the basis of 50 per cent average earnings, and the maximum payment is $95 a week. The base period used for determining average wages is the eightweek period immediately preceding the date of disability. Under Unemployment Insurance, benefits paid are approximately (but not exactly) 50 per cent of average earnings, and the weekly maximum is $95. The base period used to determine average earnings is either the 52‐week period or the 104‐week period prior to the of I urge the Governor and the Legislature to give serious consideration to the following: Establish a single, uniform base period to be used for determining worker's average wage for all three programs. Reinstate the original legislative intent by providing all unemployed or disabled workers with a weekly benefit equal to‐approximately 75 per cent of their prior earnings. Increase the weekly maximum, for all three programs to $150 immediately and thereafter provide for automatic annual adjustments of the maximum based on the prevailing annual average wage paid in the state.

EQUAL RIGHTS TEST IS NEAR IN ILLINOIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/equal-rights-test-is-near-in-illinois-state-senate-vote-tuesday-is.html,"WASHINGTON, March 1—The Equal Rights Amendment is scheduled to come up in the Illinois Senate on Tuesday and its advocates believe the vote will mark the end of a recent string of defeats for this proposed change in the Constitution. Opponents say they believe the vote in Illinois will be “very close.” If the Illinois Senate should vote down ratification, the prospects for approval of the amendment would be severely harmed. Five states have scheduled votes on the amendment in the next two or three months, and Illinois is one of them in which the measure is given a chance of passing. Unless four of them approve, there is little or no likelihood that the amendment will be ratified this year. The four other states are North and South Carolina, Missouri and Florida. The amendment, which would ban any form of discrimination based on sex by action of the Federal Government or state or local governments, needs approval by 38 states to become the 27th amendment to the Constitution. So far, 34 states have ratified, but two have rescinded their ratifications, a step of questionable legality. Thus, ratification will be required in at least four more states, and possibly six. The new developments in the ratification fight this year include the following: ¶Phyllis Schley, the conservative Republican who is the leader of the antiratification forces, has been making headway with legislators in several states with a new argument against the amendment. The argument is that the Roman Catholic Church could be required to admit women to the priesthood and to abandon its single‐sex schools if the amendment was ratified, or else lose its tax‐exempt status. The argument is vigorously disputed by Catholics who are supporters of the amendment. ¶Betty Ford has actively and in some cases quite successfully solicited votes for ratification in key states and has pledged to continue her campaign despite criticism. Mail reaching the White House about her participation in the ratification effort, originally critical by a ratio of 3 to 1, has turned favorable by almost the same ratio in the last two weeks, according to Mrs. Ford's press secretary, Sheila Rabb Weidenfeld. ¶A Federal Appeals Court held last week that a requirement of the Illinois Constitution that ratification of amendments to the United States Constitution must be by a threefifths vote in each house of the state legislature was not binding. Both pro‐ and antiratification forces believe the decision has significantly changed the outlook for ratification in Illinois. Mrs. Schlafly's argument that ratification of the amendment could threaten the tax‐exempt status of various Catholic institutions is based, she, said in a telephone interview, on a recent Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. Simon, that had the effect of permitting the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the tax‐exempt status of the university because it engaged in race discrimination in its admission policies. Mrs. Schlafly said that adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment would put sex discrimination on the same footing as race discrimination is now and thus Catholic schools could similarly lose their tax exemptions if they did not admit students of both sexes on an equal basis. The interpretation was disputed by Catholic lawyers who said that the Bob Jones case was a purely procedural one, dealing with the right of any organization to bring an injunctive action against the Internal Revenue Service. The substantive issue of the validity of the revocation of tax exemption was not decided in this case, they said. 1st Amendment Shield In addition, a lawyer for the United States Catholic Conference, who did not wish to be quoted by name because the conference has no official position on the matter, said that “it is obvious that the Equal Rights Amendment would be read in the light of the First Amendment,” which prohibits governmental interference with the practice of religion. Although the Catholic Church as such has taken no position on the amendment—something that could be done only by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops—and although different Catholic organizations are found on both sides of the ratification fight, individual Catholic priests who oppose the amendment are having an effect on key legislators in Illinois, Missouri and possibly Florida, according to a key worker for ratification. John Deardourff, of the political consulting firm of Bailey, Deardourff & Eyre, said “an increasing number of priests are preaching from the pulpit against E.R.A. and exerting enormous pressure on individual state representatives who are Catholics.” Only yesterday, the diocesan newspaper in St. Louis came out with an editorial saying that the amendment was “unnecessary and dangerous in involving the courts more deeply in family life.” Other Lobbying Other denominations where some clergymen and some laymen are lobbying against ratification include the Lutherans, especially in Illinois, and the Church of Christ, which is apparently heavily involved in attempts to organize rescissions of earlier ratifications in Texas and New Mexico. Church groups that oppose the amendment generally say that they fear that its adoption would make abortion and looser sex standards more prevalent and that it would undermine family life by ending the traditional legal requirement that a man is responsible for the support of his wife and family. Advocates of the amendment scoff at all these assertions. A number of major religious denominations, including both branches of the Presbyterian Church, the United Methodist Church and the Unitarian‐Universalist Church, support the amendment. Other denominations, like the Catholics, have communicants on both sides of the issue. Major Lutheran groups are all opposed."
"Abortion Is a Bitter Issue in Italy, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/abortion-is-a-bitter-issue-in-italy-too-most-politicians-would-have.html,"ROME—The raid by police on an abortion clinic in Florence last Jan. 9 that eventually resulted in the arrest of nine persons, with arrest warrants currently out for four others, set in motion a chain of events that politicians of nearly every shade of the Italian political spectrum would have preferred to avoid. The clinic, run by the Center for Information on Sterilization and Abortion, an organization linked to the Radical party, had been functioning since September of last year, and the center's activities had been publicly announced by the party in November. Radical party members may well be right when they maintain that police and the judiciary—and politicians—almost certainly knew about the clinic all along, but because the politicians have been sitting for four years on a bill in Parliament calling for the liberalization of abortion laws, they bad avoided investigating the clinic in order not to risk exposing a sensitive issue to public scrutiny. The Radical party, insignificant numerically and with no representation in Parliament, has for years acted as a pressure group for civil rights issues. It frequently adopts the tactic of publicly announcing its support of activities that may be illegal, as when Gianfranco Spadaccia, the party's national secretary, declared the party's “co‐responsibility” for the clinic following the raid to draw public attention to an issue and hopefully spur a sluggish Parliament to discuss a bill. The abortion issue is being discussed by more than just Parliament. With the arrest of Mr. Spadaccia as an accessory to the crime of abortion, the Radical party quickly made the most of the issue while it was hot. The arrest of a leader of a political party, and the fact that he was in jail for four weeks before being freed pending trial, enhanced their argument that his arrest was a “punishment for opinion” rather than for any particular action. The Radicals' efforts seemed to pay off. By mid February, three separate new proposals for reform of abortion legislation had been submitted by the Republican, Social Democrat and Communist parties. A week later, on Feb. 18, Italy's Constitutional Court ruled that provision in the penal code outlawing abortion was “partly unconstitutional.” The ruling, which stated that abortion is not a crime if the “physical or psychological health” of the woman is endangered by the pregnancy, leaves wide latitude for interpretation and is considered a major step toward changing the existing legislation. Church's View Unchanged The Vatican also has shown signs of taking a more open‐ended view of the problem. In reality, it may more likely be a sign of the grassroots pressure that the church is feeling at this time. In early February, when the controversy was particularly heated, the Italian Bishops' Conference declared that certain “extenuating circumstances” should perhaps move magistrates to consider reducing, in some cases, the present one‐to‐five‐year jail penalty for participation in abortion. The bishops made clear however, that the church's objection to abortion had in no way changed. It is widely assumed in Italy that one of the motivations behind the interests of some anti‐abortionists is not so much a respect for life or a rigid adherence to the teachings of the Catholic Church as the fact that a lot of people stand to lose a lot of money if abortion is legalized. The head of a highly respected birth‐control organization here (which does not perform abortions) estimates that $3‐to‐$5‐million yearly end up in the hands of those who do clandestine operations. Some pro‐abortionists openly accuse the Christian Democrat party of getting kickbacks from expensive illicit operators or clinics whose activities are discreetly tolerated by the forces of the law. According to this view, one of the chief “crimes” of the Florence clinic was to charge a reasonable price for abortions, about $150, or less if a woman was in financial need. Few Italians can miss the parallel between the current abortion controversy and the divorce reform issue that involved a heated campaign just one year ago. Like divorce, abortion reform is likely to turn into a bitter confrontation between political forces that support or oppose continued church influence in civil legislation. The drubbing that the Christian Democrats took in the divorce referendum last year cannot help but be a disadvantage for them in a similar referendum for abortion reform that is bound to ensue‐100,000 preliminary petitions have already been collected and the beginning of a formal referendum campaign is now tentatively scheduled for April."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: What has happened to all the oil we've been producing? Recently the Oil Journal published figures showing that continental oil production and continental oil consumption in the U.S. were only 5 per cent apart. Confirmation of this statistic would occasionally seep through the murky fog that oil companies seem to have established around oil inventories, as when the chief oil geologist of the Interior Department spoke on offshore oil at the New York Academy of Sciences last month. This doesn't sound anywhere near the vast shortages depicted by the industry to justify its recent cutbacks and price rises. It certainly assigns the Arab embargo and price rises a very minor role in our so‐called shortage since a 5 per cent deficiency can very easily be made up by other minor producers all over the world. Where then is the leak of our oil that makes the oil industry claim a shortage of about 30 per cent? Since a worldwide inventory of U.S. oil companies seems beyond the power of our Government to obtain, one must induce the parameters of the problem from the facts on hand and look for an unlisted consumer of massive proportions. Such a consumer, the one with the hollow leg, is probably the military establishment. We know that our military has 2,500 foreign bases. We also know that we have at least 34 military missions in client nations throughout the world with which we are undertaking to maintain the status quo despite the wishes or desires of the people in those nations. Most often this means fueling a military and civilian sector of a military dictator ship completely at our expense, the entire information being classified and Pre‐Palestine Settlers To the Editor: In your otherwise fair and accurate Feb. 13 editorials “Economic Warfare” . . . “Under Review” you have one curious sentence: “Ever since the start of Jewish settlement in Palestine, neighboring Arab regimes have attempted to enforce economic sanctions.” Might I remind you that Jewish settlement in the area between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, and indeed also immediately east of the Jordan River, started centuries before there were any “Arab regimes” anywhere and millennia before anyone thought of referring to that entire area as “Palestine,” JAC FRIEDGUT New Rochelle, N. Y., Feb. 13, 1975 • Minimum‐Wage Handicap To the Editor: What one single action can the 94th Congress take right now to relieve the unemployment situation in the small towns and rural areas of midAmerica? An immediate suspension of all minimum‐wage laws for the “duration plus six” would do more good to help the unemployed in small towns and rural areas because small business could employ the young, train the unskilled without a lot of red tape, thus kept from the American public. A rough calculation of the oil needs of these client nations yields a figure in the neighborhood of 30 per cent of U.S. civilian consumption. This is most probably the cause of our abnormal shortage. If this construct is true, then we have been standing in line for our gas while clients such as South Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan got theirs first—and, most outrageously, got it free, out of our pockets, and even developed black‐market caches to fuel their rich tyrants. It is time that the veil of secrecy surrounding the inventories of oil being dispensed by our corporations—some of whom enjoy vast Government subsidies by reason of tax allowances—be removed. GILBERT WASSERMAN Staten Island, N. Y., Feb. 23, 1975 lower food costs in local restaurants, help the housewife and stimulate the local economy; and best of all, it would not cost the Government a dime. In short, minimum‐wage laws have always made good politics but bad economics. Today the country needs employment and economic stimulation more than it needs veto‐proof politicians. Is there enough statesmanship left on Capitol Hill to put the economic welfare of the country ahead of the monopolistic interests of the big unions? GEORGE PETRAKIS Columbia, Mo., Feb. 15, 1975 • Car Rationing: An Example To the Editor: Bruce Wallace's Feb. 10 letter suggested automobile rationing to conserve gasoline. In Bermuda, cars have been restricted, with few exceptions, to one per family unit ever since private car ownership was first allowed at the end of World War II. The main purpose was to reduce traffic congestion, and for the same reason cars are taxed by body size. The system has worked well here, but enforcing a similar one across the United States could prove difficult. PERCY BALL Southampton, Bermuda, Feb. 13, 1975 U.S. Economy: The Case For Total Reorganization To the Editor: The residents of modem industrial nations are becoming slaves to the very economies that were designed to serve them. Sacrifice in the name of economic stability is nothing new in the United States, but recently the sacrifices seem to be increasing. To keep the economy functioning, we are being asked to buy cars but not gas, to spend money but refuse to buy at inflated prices. We are asked to pay taxes to the Government so that it can support the sagging private industries of its choice. We consent to the popular definition that senior citizens and adolescents are only marginal members of our increasingly specialized work force. In general, we give up a significant amount of our personal liberty to uphold a sagging economy that is sadly in need of reorganization. There have been a number of proposed solutions to our current economic dilemma which, though they would accomplish as much as the President's, lack some basic logic. Building and attacking a great wall and paying car, producers to dump their creations into the sea are examples of this kind of plan. That people have resorted to suggesting such solutions, even in jest, points to the realization that we are sacrificing more and more to support an economy that must be completely revamped. Specifically, the Fededal Government must step up its efforts to discourage monopolistic trade practices and must cease to subsidize outmoded industries (e.g., the auto industry) just to prevent unemployment. The money saved from cutting these subsidies should be applied to a nationwide program to train unemployed workers to function in new industries. Without this total reorganization of our economy, any solution to the current recession will be only temporary. The American economy can no longer afford the gross misallocation of resources to which it has been tomed. JONATHAN V. HOLTZMAN Haverford, Pa., Feb. 21, 1975 • The Tiffany Principle To the Editor: The discovery by Tiffany and Co. [advertisement Feb. 18] of the unity of all economic systems because they all employ capital represents a significant intellectual break‐through for it helps clear away the confusion generated by such meaningless distinctions as state ownership, mixed ownership and private ownership of capital. Like all important intellectual discoveries, Tiffany's has some very important ramifications not explored in the original statement. For now we can see that all political systems are actually basically alike since they are all concerned with the distribution of power, and we need not muddle our thinking by overly refined distinctions between democratic and totalitarian systems. So, too, all religious systems are fundamentally alike since they are all concerned at bottom with beliefs in supernatural beings and powers, and who, on perceiving that fundamental unity of mankind, would want to introduce any opaqueness into that clarity by paying attention to differences between Christianity, Judaism and Mohammedanism, much less attend to the over 200 silly distinctions different Protestant sects make among them selves? In sum, Tiffany is to be congratulated for an extraordinarily seminal discovery of a principle of unity that; if duly appreciated, can render meaningless all existing sources of difference and problems based on those differences. I am troubled, finally, only by a concern as to whether one ought to apply this clarifying principle of basic unity to such mundane matters as the quality of diamonds. Is one carat as good and really the same as four or six or eight carats because, after all, they are all matters of carats? I hope Mr. Having will develop the theme further in future editions of The Times. MELVIN M. TUMIN Princeton, N.J., Feb. 18, 1975 • Toward a U.S. Adventure To the Editor: Why is everyone so worried that the Pentagon has hired the Vinnell Corporation to send 1,000 men to train Saudi Arabian troops? Or do people remember that other fiasco, where we sent only 35 men as a Military Assistance Group to Vietnam on June 27, 1950, and how those 35 men grew and grew to about a million? Could it just be possible that we are starting on a new grand adventure? BERNARD SANOW Los Angeles, Calif., Feb. 16, 1975 • Longfellow's Tree To the Editor: Anyone who ever sat “under the spreading chestnut tree,” where the village smithy stood, would know that it was not an American chestnut, the species which has undergone a devastating blight (news story Feb. 13). Longfellow's tree was a horse chestnut, a European import, which has a nut similar to the native buckeye, inedible and enclosed by a non‐prickly husk. The native chestnut was one of autumn's joys. Anyone collecting the choice edible nuts would cherish the fun of handling the intensively sharp burrs which contained them. This is the American heritage which has been almost completely eliminated by the chestnut blight. American chestnuts were mostly found on wild, remote hillsides in modem times. DALE PONTIUS Chicago, Feb. 14, 1975 Biomedical Research at a Crossroads To the Editor: Lay groups of citizens are starting to be required to make decisions concerning experimentation or treatment on human subjects. These groups consist of upright, conscientious people who try their best, under specialized instruction, to uphold the law. But how can they do so when they do not understand the key issues involved that are not legal issues? And it is not their fault that they do not understand. In order to learn more and more about disease and improve treatment it is necessary for patients to help. But only after scrupulous honesty, and obtaining appropriate permission after complete information is given, may any trial or procedure be performed. This goal is not too difficult to obtain. If the unborn baby, infant and child are involved, we are then in a maelstrom of present concern, lack of information and even outrage. A recent expert committee report in the United Kingdom recommended that an unborn baby of over twenty weeks gestation should be considered capable of life. A curious recommendation since it is excessively rare for any fetus of less than 28 weeks gestation to survive, with the best of present knowledge and science. Research, or lack of certain treatments, on fetuses up to this time would .presumably be unlawful. And yet this Is just the period when life is virtually unobtainable and research and trials would and do lead, in particular, to major strides In the treat ment of those very‐high‐risk infants born at or after 28 weeks. Only the physician (s) present at the time can make a decision on the likelihood of viability and the appropriateness of trial and treatments. Such biomedical men and women are rarely dishonorable, and rarely do not have integrity. While controversy in the United States rages over this particular area of human experimentation, and recommendations for legislation abound, it is important not to allow other controversies, such as legal or illegal abortion, to overshadow the main target: to improve the health and happiness of all humans of whatever age. Biomedical investigators and physicians very largely shun limelight. They must, however, communicate, using modern methods—which the opposition and agitators use so well. Unless the public comes to learn about, understand and trust the biomedical profession, discord will continue the present downhill course of lack of progress in medical research.

The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/the-world-in-summary-oil-producers-find-they-cant-go-on-alone.html,"There is further evidence of the mutual Interdependence among individual nations in a world economy. The oil cartel that eschewed international bargaining procedures when it unilaterally raised oil prices is now suffering the aftershocks of the worldwide recession that those higher prices produced: orders for oil have been greatly reduced; for some producing nations, painfully so. As a result, producers now seem as anxious as consumers for a plan that will prevent further economic disruptions. The main thrust of the oil producers' position has been outlined by ministers of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna to prepare for a conference of their heads of state in Algeria this week. They propose to provide steady oil supplies in exchange for guarantees that their petrodollars will not be eroded by the industrial nations' high rates of inflation or currency devaluations. The dollar, the currency for most oil payments, has dropped 12 per cent in relation to the Swiss franc in four months and this has hurt some oil producing countries such as Kuwait which lost 9 per cent of her real oil income in January because of it. The OPEC planners may propose to tie oil payments into the International Monetary Fund's money standard to offset future dollar devaluations. Price‐cutting Begins It remains unclear how the OPEC planners will cope with erosion of their petrodollars but it will clearly be a major issue during consumerproducer negotiations. New data shows that if OPEC extends the current oil price freeze beyond the September cutoff to the end of 1976, as proposed by Saudi Arabia, the current 15 per cent inflation rate of the consuming nations will have reduced the nominal oil price of $11 a barrel to a real price of $8.50. Behind OPEC's planning is a new urgency. Its unity is jeopardized by the reduction in oil orders and the resulting threat by poorer OPEC countries to unilaterally reduce oil prices. At the Vienna conference Abu Dhabi and Libya requested and received approval to reduce some oil prices. Algeria had previously done so and Ecuador is expected to follow. The reduction in orders results from the economic slowdown and an unusually mild winter in many industrial nations. A survey taken during the Vienna meeting showed that current production among the 13 OPEC members was down by more than 10 per cent. That means Arab oil exports have dropped to even less than they were during the oil embargo a year ago. Meanwhile, the oil consuming nations have come closer to a unified approach. Common Market Governments are expected to approve a three‐tiered plan of oil floor prices to replace the single floor proposed recently by Henry Kissinger, whose oncecriticized strategies for solving the oil crisis new appear to have been vindicated and who will probably go along with the Europeans' three‐tier plan. One price level of the European plan woud assure oil at a reasonable price for countries that cannot develop their own sources, another would be high enough to protect development investments in sources of new energy such as coal and oil shale and the third level would encourage investments in expensive energy sources such as bituminousschist. Pakistan Profits At the End of the U.S. Embargo After 10 years of denying arms to both India and Pakistan as a means of lessening their capacity for renewed warfare, the United States has lifted the embargo against both nations. The practical effector the decision will be to permit Pakistan to resume buying American weapons: India has been filling her arms requirements with purchases from Russia and with her own defense industry. Thus India is predictably bitter about the United States decision. The longer‐term effect of the end of the embargo is debatable. One view is that the United States will be stimulating an arms race on the subcontinent, exacerbating the tensions that have long fed on Indian fears of American support of Pakistan. This view holds that the trend toward slight improvement in the last two years of relations between New Delhi and Washington is endangered. The opposite view is that the reasons for the 1965 embargo were removed by the war of 1971, which dismembered Pakistan and left India overwhelmingly pre‐eminent politically, economically and militarily. The Pakistanis, on the other hand, are prey to a heightened sense of insecurity. They have been buying arms from Britain, France and China, but their major weapon systems are American and they have a preference for American arms. Washington's decision was made largely for its psychological effect on an allied nation. The sales are to be for cash, not credit, and the Pakistanis don't have much cash to spare. Informed officials say the sales will be limited to modest quantities of defensive weapons. And the storm in India, they hope, will blow over as that becomes clear. Kennedy's Bill The decision on Pakistan comes amid rising concern in Congress over the steep growth in American sales generally—to a total of $8.5‐billion in the year ended last June, almost $7‐billion of that for the Middle East, and with Iran alone getting $4‐billion. Most of these sales are for cash, and not under Congressional control. Senator Edward M. Kennedy has now introduced a bill providing for six‐month moratorium on arms sales to Persian Gulf states, while Congress and the Administration re‐examine what he calls an “Indiscriminate” policy. Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger rejected the proposal, saying “we are attempting to maintain influence in these areas.” There Is Some Optimism on The Mideast Secretary of State Kissinger is scheduled to return to the Middle East this week, and there is growing optimism that he will be able to arrange a new agreement between Israel and Egypt. Israeli officials remain cautious on what might be achieved. Egyptian reports suggest this formula: Israeli forces would withdraw in the Sinai behind the Mitla and Gidi passes and from the area around the Abu Rudeis oil fields. In return, Egypt would reopen the Suez Canal, allowing passage of Israeli‐bound cargo on non‐Israeli ships. To make up for the oil Israel would lose from Abu Rudeis, the United States would pay for $250‐million worth of Iranian oil. In addition, Egypt would give an informal pledge to the United States, but not directly to Israel, that Egypt would not resume fighting against Israel while peace negotiations show progress. There would be no time limit on the Egyptian pledge. That apparently may be enough to satisfy Egypt's ally, Syria, which has opposed a new EgyptianIsraeli agreement. The Syrians fear would undermine their efforts to regain territory on the Golan Heights and permit Israel to fight a single‐front war there. The Israelis have severe economic as well as diplomatic problems. Already the heaviest taxed people in the world, they will have to pay still more. New taxes proposed by the Government will maintain the proportion of gross national income that goes to national or local treasuries at the current rate of 64 per cent. The comparable figure in the United States is 32.6 per cent. The new budget also will add five per cent to the inflation rate, which, based on the consumer price index for December, 1973 as against December, 1974, was 56.2 per cent last year while income increased by an average of 39.7 per cent in the same period. Defense costs consume 40 per cent of the $9.38‐billion budget and social and welfare services another 31 per cent. Labor unions, some of whose members staged demonstrations last year over taxes imposed then, are angrier now. They say the Government had promised a tax freeze until July. Businessmen are saying that demands for pay raises to compensate for the new taxes could be difficult to meet and that layoffs are likely. A Coup Attempt In Greece Since last July, when his civilian government took over after seven years of military rule, Premier Constantine Caramanlis of Greece has moved cautiously to keep the influence of the military in check, at the same time attempting to retain the allegiance of the generals. There was evidence last week of the obvious difficulties inherent in that policy: 37 army officers were arrested for allegedly planning a coup to restore military rule to Greece. While the alleged plot apparently involved a small percentage of Greece's 15,000 army officers, many rightists in the military have resented the Government's legalization of the Communist party, its negotiations with Turkey over Cyprus and its charging of 100 officers with crimes allegedly committed during the years of military rule. Student groups and other reformers have been demanding that Mr. Caramanlis purge the military of all officers connected with the former Junta. The alleged coup attempt is expected to increase pressure on him for such a purge. (The World Continued, Page 6.) The World In Summary Germany Takes A Stand Against Legal Abortions West Germany will not join the growing number of developed countries with liberal abortion laws. The nation's highest court has ruled unconstitutional a law that would have legalized most abortions. The court noted more liberal laws in other countries, but ruled that the preservation of life was a greater priority in West Germany because of the “bitter experience” of the Nazi period. The effect of the ruling will be more political than real. Experts predict that about one of every four pregnancies of West German women, as many as 400,000 to 500,000, still will be aborted. The women will either have the operation illegally in West Germany or legally in one of several neighboring countries. West Germany's one‐in‐four abortion rate is about the same as the world rate, There were approximately 55 million abortions last year out of 250 million pregnancies, according to estimates by the Population Council of New York and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. From the 250 million pregnancies, 125 million live births resulted. Only 25 of the world's 150 nations permit abortions liberally, but because China, India, the Soviet Union and the United States are among them, abortions are legal for about half the world's population. Abortion may now be the most widely used method of birth control. The Population Council reports that the 11 countries with nonrestrictive abortion laws basically Bove the decision to the patient and doctor. In the Soviet Union an estimated 10 million abortions may have been performed each year for the last decade, approximately 260 for every 100 live births; in the United States, 900,000 were performed last year, 28 for every 100 live births. No figures are available for China. Fourteen countries have moderately restrictive laws that allow abortions for a combination of social, economic and medical reasons, usually with government authorization. The rest of the world's governments either prohibit abortion altogether or, in a few cases, such as Italy, permit it if a woman's life is in danger; for eugenic reasons or for juridical reasons such as rape. In most countries where abortions are permitted they must be performed during the first three months of pregnancy. In that half of the world where abortions remain illegal, such as most of Latin America and the Middle East, they are easily obtainable by those with enough money. Army Policy: No Jews Assigned To Saudi Arabia A Congressional inquiry into the Arab boycott of companies doing business with Israel has brought into open discussion charges of American governmental and corporate acquiescence in the boycott. An example of such acquiescence is a Pentagon policy not to assign Jews to projects in Saudi Arabia. The issue has been raised in a manner that forced President Ford to condemn religious and ethnic discrimination in international commerce at a time when the United States‐Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation was meeting in Washington. The question was raised by charges, later confirmed, that in deference to Saudi policy the United States Army Corps of Engineers does not assign Jewish personnel to posts in Saudi Arabia. The ban was extended to employes of companies that had won contracts for construction there from the corps. President Ford ordered an investigation, but did not order the corps to cease its acknowledged practice. In testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Harold H. Saunders, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, reiterated the Department's—and Secretary Kissinger's—position that lifting the boycott was “linked to resolution of the ArabIsraeli territorial dispute,” and is “best dealt with through quiet diplomacy.” Under the regulations of the Arab League's boycott office, established in 1948, participating countries are permitted to make expedient political or economic exceptions to the blacklist, said to number between 2,000 and 3,000 companies, most of them American. Before last year's quadrupling of oil prices, Arab countries provided relatively limited investment opportunities, and some Israelis have suggested that the list had more propaganda than economic effect. The Senate subcommittee made public a 1970 Saudi list; on it were companies that said they had dealings with both Israel and Arab League countries. Representatives of the Arab League meet semiannually to consider the list, and applications from companies to be removed from it. A 10‐day meeting began last weekend in Cairo. Two hundred companies are said to have applied to be removed; it has been announced that bans on three American companies have been lifted. The Politics Of Kidnapping Radical groups in recent years have turned increasingly to kidnapping as a political weapon. Their objective usually is fulfillment of a political demand, or ransom money to support their activities. Last week there were two more cases, both involving demands related to prisoners. One of the kidnappings ended in the slaying of John Patrick Egan, United States honorary consul in Argentina. He had been abducted by leftist guerrillas who said they would kill him if authorities did not prove that four of their captive comrades were still alive. The Argentine Government refused to “negotiate with extremist groups.” Four hours later Mr. Egan's body was found. In Germany, the Christian Democratic candidate for Mayor of West Berlin in today's election, Peter Lorenz, was abducted in his car near his home. His kidnappers demanded the release of six German leftists from prison. The six prisoners have been convicted of violent crimes. They were identified in court as members of an anarchist organization with which the kidnappers' group is said to be closely related. Mihajlov's Long Sentence Yugoslavia, often looked upon in the West as the least repressive Communist society, has sentenced the distinguished writer Mihajlo Mihajlov to seven years at hard labor for spreading “hostile propaganda.” Mr. Mihajlov has for years sharply criticized the Yugoslav (and Soviet) Government as a one‐party dictatorship permitting no freedom of speech or expression. That is specifically what last week's conviction was for—saying it again. The Yugoslav court also ordered Mr. Mihaljov to abstain wrom writing, public speaking and broadcasting for four additional years. Mr. Mihajlov was accused of having criticized the Tito Government in articles he wrote for Western publications, including The New York Times. The conviction was the fourth for Mr. Mihajlov in recent years on essentially the same charges. A London Subway Crash More than 30 people have been killed and many more injured in the crash of a London subway train which failed lo brake and ran into the wall of a station. It is the worst such accident in the history of the London system, considered one of the safest and most efficient in the world. Why the train failed to brake is not known (unlike New York City's subway system, the London Underground has no automatic braking equipment at most terminals). Workers have had difficulty getting to what is left of the operating compartment in the front of the train: the first 15 rows of seats were crushed into a two‐foot space. Continued"
Medical Center Challenged on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/medical-center-challenged-on-abortions-medical-unit-sued-on.html,"A woman in her 14th week of pregnancy and a Long Island activist on birth control have filed suit in Brooklyn Federal Court to force the Nassau County Medical Center to perform abortions on welfare recipients through the 24th week of pregnancy. On Feb. 21 the hospital had announced a new policy banning abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy because of the possibility of criminal charges being filed against both the hospital and its physicians. In the papers filed in Federal court last week, Jerome Seidel of 50 Court Street, Brooklyn, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, charged that the new policy was “completely without a medical rationale,” but was dictated by “hysteria and fear of criminal prosecution.” The fears, the court papers said, stemmed from the conviction on manslaughter charges last month of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin by a jury in Boston in the death of a fetus after an abortion. Donald H. Eisenberg, superintendent of the medical center, said last week that the hospital was willing to carry out abortions. But he emphasized that in the case of women receiving Medicaid or other forms of public assistance, the abortions were normally performed by members of the hospital staff. “The residents,” he said, “have taken the unanimous position that they won't do any abortions until they are satisfied that they are acting within the law.” Mr. Eisenberg said the staff would be satisfied if it received an opinion from State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz. He said a request had been made for such guidance. But Mr. Lefkowitz said late last week that neither his office in Albany nor the one in New York City had received any such request. The Attorney General adds ed that he would be involved in the case in any event since the state had been named as one of the defendants. Other defendants are the medical center; its board of managers; Mr. Eisenberg; Ralph G. Caso, the Nassau County Executive; staff physicians in the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Federal Government. The pregnant woman, appearing as one of the two plaintiffs, was listed only as Jane Doe, residing in Holtsville, in Suffolk County, but was said to be bringing the suit on behalf of all other women receiving public assistance in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The plaintiff was described in the court papers as the mother of two children, one 22 months and the other 3 years old. She was separated from her husband. Court Order Cited When the plaintiff, Jane Doe, was 14 weeks pregnant, she sought an abortion, saying she was desperate and could not continue with her pregnancy because she felt “it is a struggle living on a small amount of money which welfare gives me and my children.” But she was, according to the complaint, said to have had no other resource but the Nassau County Medical Center. She did not apply there because its policy of no abortions after the 12th Week of pregnancy had been highly publicized. A three‐judge Federal Court decision handed down in August, 1972, had ordered that “the responsible officials in charge of Nassau County Medical Center treat requests for Medical assistance from eligible women desiring to terminate a pregnancy within 24 weeks on the same basis as they would requests for medical services and hospital care for other conditions . . . .” The lawsuit asked that the court grant an injunction to force the hospital to comply with the 1972 Federal Court directive that it perform abortions on indigent women during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also asked that the court order the appropriate medical personnel at the Nassau Medical Center to perform an abortion on the plaintiff immediately, that the plaintiff be granted $250,000 for the “intentional and malicious abrogation” of her Constitutional rights, and that contempt citations be issued for the medical center, its superintendent, the physicians in the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and the Nassau County Executive, Ralph G. Caso, for ignoring, the three‐judge court's order. The case was assigned to District Court Judge John F. Dooling Jr. who scheduled a hearing of all the parties for 2 P.M. tomorrow."
Factors to Weigh When Deciding On Contraceptive,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/04/archives/factors-to-weigh-when-deciding-on-contraceptive.html,"A generally held view among experts in the contraceptive field is that each woman's needs and circumstances must be considered individually before choosing a contraceptive. Implicit in this view is criticism of physicians who stress a particular method they favor, rather than giving the woman a choice from among all the alternatives. Doctors seem to agree on one thing: The most important consideration from the standpoint of safety is the woman's personal and family medical history. Since both the pill and the IUD have been linked to some medical hazards, a predisposition to these conditions might make some women more at risk suffering such ill effects than other women would be. Dr. Allan Rosenfield, obstetrician‐gynecologist the Population Council, has developed “check lists” for women considering the pill or IUD. Important Check List If a woman has had any of the following conditions, Dr. Rosenfield and many other doctors would advise her not to take the pill: a history of serious liver disease (hepatitis or jaundice), especially if during pregnancy; a history of thrombophlebitis (clots in the legs), stroke or inflamed varicose veins; severe migraine‐like headaches; a history of heart disease, and previous cancer of the uterus or breast (some doctors also include breast cancer in close blood relatives). If a woman has a discharge from the breast or abnormal vaginal bleeding, Dr. Rosenfield said, the condition should be explored thoroughly by a physician before starting the pill. He added that, if the pill is prescribed for a woman with high blood pressure diabetes, she should be kept under close medical supervision to be certain her condition is not adversely affected. Some doctors believe that such women should not take the pill at all. Similarly, in considering the IUD, Dr. Rosenfield would hesitate to prescribe this method for women who have pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, Dr. Rosenfield and others recommend that women with menstrual irregularity, bleeding following intercourse and heavy vaginal discharge (indicating a possible infection) should be checked thoroughly by a physician before being fitted with an IUD. Dr. Rosenfield emphasized that women should be aware of these considerations because doctors frejuently failed to do a sufficiently thorough examination before prescribing a contraceptive. Other Factors to Consider Doctors interviewed suggested that, in addition the woman's medical history, the following factors be taken into account before selecting a contraceptive: How important is effectiveness of the method? Would an accidental pregnancy seriously disrupt the woman's life? Would she be willing to use abortion her contraceptive failed? Women demanding the best possible protection against pregnancy may be willing to accept the risks of a more hazardous but highly effective contraceptive. How prominent are the woman's safety concerns? If in taking the pill or using an IUD she constantly fears for her life or health, the resulting anxiety might be more of a price than the woman would want to pay. How frequently is the woman exposed to the risk of pregnancy—that is, how often does she have sexual intercourse? If it is infrequent, such as once every two weeks, it is harder to justify the risks associated with the most effective methods. For her, the diaphragm condom might be a safer choice. What effect would a birth control method that must be used at the time of intercourse have on sexual adjustment of the woman and her partner? Dr. Sheldon Segal, medical director of the Population Council, said, “If using a condom or diaphragm would wreck a couple's marital life, it would hardly make any sense to use it.” How tolerant is the woman of minor but annoying side effects that might be associated with contraceptives? Does the pill result in undesirable weight gain? Does the IUD produce intolerable menstrual discomfort? Does the condom, diaphragm or foam cause irritation? —J.E.B."
Assembly Passes Primary‐Date Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/04/archives/assembly-passes-primarydate-bill.html,"ALBANY, March 3 The I state's primary election would be held in June under a bill passed today by the Democratic‐controlled Assembly. “And we're going to kill it,” said John D. Calandra, the Elections Committee chairman in the Republican‐controlled Senate, who strolled into the Assembly chamber during the noisy debate. “They can send it over with four pall‐bearers,” Mr. Calandra said, merrily, “because that's where it's going.” The Assembly sent the bill to the Senate by an 84 to 59 party‐line vote, with an assertion by the Majority Leader, Albert J. Blumenthal of Manhattan, that the September primary favored by the Republicans meant that “you wake up after vacation with a candidate you never heard or and with a concession by the bill's chief sponsor that the Senate Republicans could, by delay, probably win their point. ‘Permanent Primary “What happens if they sit on it?,” Assemblyman Melvin Miller, the Brooklyn Democrat who sponsored the asked. “Then the primary stays in September.” If action is held up until early April, the time would pass when nominating petitions must be circulated for a June vote. This establishment of what is known as a “permanent primary” is an annual affair. Both parties say they are motivated solely by the interests of the voters. Later primaries, according to political thinking, favor the incumbents. But when the Republicans pushed the primary ahead to September last year, they wound up losing both the Governorship and control of the Assembly in the general election. “Permanency is important,” argued ‘Assemblyman Brian Sharoff, Democrat of Brooklyn, during the partisan debate, because it means people will pay attention. And June is impor ‘milt because it gets the campaign over in the shortest possible realistic time. July and August are months when the voters do not give a hoot.” Assemblyman Joseph M. Margiotta, Republican leader of Nassau County, said he had always favored the September primary even when his party did not. “There's no doubt in my mind,” he said, “the public overwhelmingly in this state prefers a short campaign. In an extended campaign, the public has it up to here.” He pointed to his neat blue shirt collar. Senator Calandra, meanwhile, was busy with two of his own election bills in the Senate. He broke even. Passage was voted on a measure, described by Democrats privately as another “one‐house” bill, that would, in effect, bar the Liberal party from waiting until after the Democratic primary to replace the Liberal line designee with a Democrat. The Senator failed with a measure that would have permitted party organizations to use party funds to finance petition costs of candidates in the primaries. Other action here today included the following: BIPARTISAN BUDGET TRIMS The two houses fiscal committees jointly proposed denying Governor Carey all but $15million of the $88‐million in loan funds he had requested as a deficiency appropriation to complete the cost of the South Mall office project here. The additional $73‐million was not immediately needed, according to the fiscal chair man, Assemblyman Burton G. Hecht, Democrat of the Bronx, and Senator John J. Marchi, Republican of Staten Island. Aside from the mall funds, the committees recommended that the Governor's proposed deficiency budget, which deals Fith late‐occurring costs in the ‘fiscal year ending this month, be cut by $23.5‐million to $40.4million. The major change was a $13.9‐million cut in the mental‐hygiene services fund, based on new estimates that the fund; had larger balances than expected. ABORTION ALTERNATIVES A mandate that publicly ‘aided abortion agencies distribute information about alternatives, including prenatal and postnatal care, received firsthouse approval in the Senate, 36 to 10. The sponsor, Bernard C. Smith, Republican of NorthpOrt, said it was only proper that women know of the alternatives. A critic, Karen S. Burstein, Democrat of Lawrence, L. I., questioned whether “some kind of psychological harassment by the state” was intended and said that the bill was vague and that agencies already offered such information. SAVE‐THE‐FARE The $45‐million state loan to the Metropolitan Transporation Authority, which the authority says is vital for keeping subway and bus fares from rising, was put off in both Houses.

Seizes Unsafe IUD,” “Senators Question Pill's Safety.” Headlines such as these throughout the country have produced an increasingly common phenomenon — the contraceptive scare, marked by frantic phone calls to doctors, erratic switching from one method of birth control to another, and confusion and concern on the part of women and their doctors. The question of the safety of modern contraceptives is paramount in the minds of many. But, family planning specialists say, decisions as to which birth control mete od to use are often based on incomplete information as to the risks and benefits of the various methods, and are reached without taking into account factors other than safety that should influence a woman's choice of contraceptive. “There is no such thing as absolute safety when it comes to contraception—you get nothing for nothing,” said Dr. Sheldon Segal, medical director of the Population Council. “It is not enough to look at just the risks. You must also consider the benefits—the hazards that the contraceptive is protecting you from, as well as other advantages, such as convenience.” Safest Method Available An analysis of medical statistics indicates that although oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices can sometimes cause serious, even fatal, side effects, when their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is considered, the pill and IUD remain the safest methods of birth control currently available. While older contraceptive methods, such as the diaphragm and condom, themselves cause no known serious ill effects, these traditional methods are more like‐ ly to expose a woman to the hazards of pregnancy than the pill or IUD. Even for women receiving the best of medical care, the nine months of pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period are far more dangerous to life and health than any existing contraceptive method, the statistics show. Family planning specialists who have analyzed the relative risks and benefits of the available techniques have concluded that for the average woman—when the hazards of the various methods of birth control are added to the hazards of the pregnancies that would result from using those methods—the pill and IUD turn out to be safer than the diaphragm, condom, foam or rhythm method. However, if the woman uses abortion as a backup birth control measure for those occasions when her contraceptive fails to prevent ‘There is no such thing as absolute safety when it comes to contraceptionyou get nothing for nothing.’ pregnancy, then the less effective traditional methods (such as the diaphragm and condom) turn out to be safer than the pill or IUD, according to the calculations of Dr. Christopher Tietze, biostatistician for the Population Council. Dr. Tietze emphasized that this conclusion would hold “only if the abortion is obtained under good medical conditions during the first three months of pregnancy.” None of these conclusions, however, take into account the possibility of long‐term hazards, as yet unidentified, that might be associated with use of the pill or IUD. The calculation of relative safety is also based on the characteristics of the “average” woman For any individ‐ ual, the equation may be weighted for or against the pill or IUD depending on such factors as her personal and family medical history and her reliability in using the various contraceptive choices, as well as her willingness to use abortion as a backup measure. Another factor influencing relative safety would be the quality of medical care a woman receives.. Women in the upper socioeconomic brackets have a much lower pregnancy‐related death rate—perhaps two‐thirds less than the national average of 20 per 100,000 live births. Better Medical Care However, experts say that such women might also be expected to receive better medical care for contraceptive side efrects and be less likely than the average woman to succumb to these hazards. According to statistics prepared by the Rockefeller Foundation, on the average, among one million women aged 20 to 34 using the pill for one year, approximately 13 would die from pill‐caused complications, usually blood clots. Since the pill, if used properly, is about 99.5 per cent effective, 5,000 of the million women would become pregnant, with one death resulting from pregnancy, giving a total of 14 deaths. For the IUD, which is about 97 per cent effective when in place, the total would be about nine deaths—two from the method and seven from pregnancies. If the same number of women used the diaphragm for one year, there would be no deaths caused by the method but, given an average effectiveness of 88 per cent, approximately 27 deaths would result from the 120,000 pregnancies that would occur. However, if those pregnancies were all terminated by early abortion, the pregnancy‐related deaths would drop from. 27 to about 3 from abortion, lower than either the pill or the IUD. The relative safety of the diaphragm would be further enhanced if it was used exactly as prescribed—inserted properly with a contraceptive jelly or cream and used with proper timing. Low Death Rate Under these circumstances, Dr. Tietze said, the diaphragm is about 98 per cent effective in preventing pregnancy, which would mean only 20,000 pregnancies among one million users each year and about five pregnancy‐related deaths, or 0.6 deaths if all of the pregnancies were aborted. Thus, used properly and consistently, the diaphragm would present the least risk to life and health. Even if used without regard to proper procedures and backed up by abortion, the diaphragm or condom would be the safest as a combined approach to contraception, Dr. Tietze concluded. The calculation of relative risk would also be changed if sterilization is considered as one alternative in the choice of contraceptives. The known risks of sterilization are essentially one‐time risks they are faced only at the time of the procedure. Dr. Elizabeth Connell, chairman of the medical committee of Planned Parenthood ‐ World Population, said that unless a woman considered the risks of a particular method in the context of other options, the reaction to a “contraceptive scare” could be that she “drops a method well‐suited for her medically and psychologically and adopts one that might in fact be more hazardous in her particular case.” Critics have charged that the medical profession and the Government recklessly encouraged widespread use of the pill, the IUD and sterilization before they were adequately tested. More Study Needed Birth control researchers reply that there is simply no way to test for rare side effects until such methods are used by tens of thousands of women, and, in terms of long‐term effects, not before the methods have been used by large numbers for 10, 20 or even 30 years. Although the question of long‐term safety of these methods cannot be answered completely now, much has been learned about the shortterm risks associated with their use. The pill has been subjected to numerous studies already completed and several major studies that will continue indefinitely, producing interim reports as new findings emerge. In the United States, these include the Boston Collaborative Drug Project and the Kaiser‐Permanente study in Walnut Creek, Calif. The latter, sponsored by the Center for Population Research of the National Institutes of Health, takes in nearly 12,000 In Britain, the Royal College of General Practioners is following more than 46,000 women, half of whom take the pill. Intrauterine devices were the subject of two major American studies, the Cooperative Statistical Program of the Population Council, which covered more than 30,000 IUD users for up to five years, and a national survey of nearly 17,000 physicians conducted by the Center for Disease Control, a division of the Public Health Service. Various aspects of the long term and short‐term effects of male sterilization are currently being explored in about 10 studies sponsored by the Center for Population Research, and dozens of small studies of the physiolo‐ gical and psychological consequences of male and female sterilization have been completed. The following is a summary of the current knowledge and the unknowns as gleaned from the findings of such studies. The Pill Oral contraceptives, first marketed in 1960 and now used by 10 million American women, have always been associated with a number of annoying but minor side effects, including nausea, headache, breast tenderness and fluid retention. These are far less common today with pill formulations containing a tenth of the hormone dose in the original birth control pills. Nonetheless, after one year 20 per cent of new pill users discontinue the method because of such discomforts. On the other hand, the pill offers a number of good “side effects” to many women — regular menstrual cycles, little or no cramping, shorter and lighter menstrual periods and less premenstrual tension. The most common serious hazard caused by the pill is an increased tendency of the blood to clot, resulting in an increased risk of thrombophlebitis (clots in the leg veins) and pulmonary embolism (clots in the lungs), stroke and possible heart attack. This problem results in a four‐fold to ten‐fold greater risk of disease and death among pill users. Yet the absolute risk remains very small — 1.5 deaths from thromboembolic disease per 100,000 women aged 20 to 34 and 3.9 per 100,000 women aged 35 to 44. Recent studies have indicated that this risk has declined now that the level of estrogen has been reduced. The pill has also been shown to cause a slight elevation in blood pressure in many users, with pill users two‐and‐a‐half times more likely than nonusers to develop excessively high blood pressure. The absolute risk of developing high blood pressure on the pill is about 5 per cent. Pill users also have twice the usual risk of gallbladder disease. Other conditions that have been suggested in some studies, but are not yet proven risks of the pill, include liver disease and tumors (very rare but they can he fatal) and birth defects if the pill is continued inadvertently into pregnancy. The pill has also been found to bring out certain metabolic abnormalities, such as a decreased ability to handle sugar, in some women already prone to the condition. A major British study showed that pill users faced a small but definite increase in the incidence of urinary tract infections, as well as skin disorders such as eczema and sun sensitivity. The pill also has been blamed for prolonged infertility following its discontinuation. Although the pill probably occasionally causes such infertility, most cases are believed to result naturally but are masked by the artificial menses that accompanies pill use. With regard to cancer, the early fears thus far have not been borne out. Studies to date have indicated the following for women on the pill: a decreased risk of benign breast diseases, which many doctors consider precursors of cancer (some doctors are now entertaining the hope that pill use by young women may help protect against later breast cancer); fewer ovarian cysts (also possible precursors to cancer), and no increased risk of cervical can‐ Nonetheless, experts like Dr. Roy Hertz, reproductive endocrinologist at George Washington University Medical Center, are still worried. He warned early in the history of oral contraceptives that the use of these steroid drugs could promote cancerous growths. He estimates that it will take 10 more years before the question of cancer and the oral contraceptives is settled. Two doctors at the University of Colorado have begun a registry of cases of endometrial cancer in young women taking oral contraceptives. They have gathered fewer than 20 cases, most of which seem to be related to the sequential oral contraceptives that use estrogen alone for 15 days a month. They say now, “It does not seem to be a terribly common problem.” Intrauterine Devices Like the pill, annoying but minor side effects are the most common complications of the IUD, which is used by three million to five million American women. Most frequent complaints are heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding and menstrual cramps, causing up to 20 per cent of IUD users to request removal of the device within a year. More serious side effects are relatively rare. The nationwide survey by the Center for Disease Control indicated that 2 to 10 IUD‐associated deaths occur yearly among one million users, with complications necessitating hospitalization occurring at a rate of 3 to 10 per 1,000 users each year. The hospitalization rate is five times higher than that of the pill, but the death rate is only one‐fourth as great. The most common serious complication associated with the use of the IUD is infection. In one major study, pelvic infection necessitated the removal of an average of two IUDs among 100 users within two years of use. However, thus far the evidence indicates that the IUD does not cause pelvic infection; rather, it seems to increase the severity of an infection (including gonorrhea) should one occur. If treatment is delayed or inadequate, such infections can sometimes lead to infertility. Recently, the IUD was linked to a rare but sometimes fatal infection: septic abortion during pregnancies that occur while the IUD is still in place. The problem, which centered on one type of IUD, the popular Dalkon shield, resulted in a moratorium on use of the shield, a change in its design, and a requirement that women who subsequently are fitted with the shield are followed and their experiences recorded. However, this requirement does not apply to women who already have a shield with the old design. Planned Parenthood physicians and others have recommended that women who become pregnant while using shield should have the device removed immediately or have an abortion. Whatever type of IUD woman has, a pregnancy that occurs with the device in place is more likely to end in miscarriage. Pregnancies that occur with an IUD in place are more likely to be ectopic, that is, outside the uterus. This is not to say that IUD's cause ectopic pregnancies; rather, they are less effective in preventing such pregnancies. Another potentially serious side effect associated with the IUD is piercing of the wall of the uterus, usually at the time of insertion. On the average, perforations occur in about 4 in 10,000 insertions, with the risk lowest when the insertor is an experienced physician. Most perforations now are of minor consequence. However, if undetected, it may mean that the IUD is not properly situated and therefore ineffective. Diaphragm, Condom and Foam No serious side effects have been attributed to any of these methods. However, occasional individuals have sensitivity or allergy to the chemicals involved or to the rubber, causing irritation, burning, itching, rash or swelling. Recently, an advisory com‐ mittee of the Food and Drug Administration began investigating what is and is not known about the effects of vaginal contraceptives. The committee's conclusion thus far is “very little,” according The concern persists. One expert says it may take another 10 years before the question of cancer and oral contraceptives is settled. to Dr. Connell, who is chairman. The committee did find, however, that several brands of contraceptive jelly and cream (including the best‐selling brand, Koromex) contained a mercury compound. Its effects are unknown, but since mercury can cause birth defects, it is possible that pregnancies that occur in spite of the chemical's use may result in an increased incidence of birth defects. It is not known whether the woman or her partner absorbs any of this chemical. Sterilization The popularity of sterilization has increased, with more than one million sterilization operations now being done annually in the UniteeStates, according to estimates by the Association for Voluntary Sterilization. Sterilization is an operative procedure, less risky for men than for women, but with the possibility of complications. Vasectomy, the male procedure, can be done in a doctor's office under local anesthesia. The most common postoperative complaints — bruising, swelling and pain—are usually minor and rarely severe enough to prevent a man from returning to work the next day. More serious complications occur in 2 to 4 per cent of the cases. These include infection, hematoma (a trapped mass of clotted blood), granuloma (an inflammatory reaction to sperm outside their normal habitat) and epididymitis (swelling and tenderness near the testes). Most such complications are treatable without surgery. There have been no recorded deaths due to vasectomy in the United States. One‐half to two‐thirds of men with vasectomies develop antibodies to sperm, but the significance of this is unknown. A few physicians have suggested that men who have the operation may be more than usually prone to autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, but there is no scientific evidence as yet of such an effect. Thus far, the National Institutes of Health studies dispute the suggestion that vasectomy adversely affects the body's output of testosterone, the male sex hormone, and some studies indicate that testosterone levels may rise slightly after vasectomy. Although studies on rodents indicated that vasectomy might lead to abnormalities of the testes, no such effect was found in monkeys (or man), nor was any change noted in the monkeys’ sexual behavior after vasectomy. As for psychological complications, there is no known physiological basis for them and most cases of post‐vasectomy psychological disturbance have been traced to pre‐operative conditjons such as frigidity in the wife or impotence that the men hoped vasectomy would correct. Perhaps the most annoying complication of vasectomy is that it is not always effective. The failure rate in recent studies is in the order of less than one per cent. Some doctors advise periodic semen checks to be sure fertility has not returned. The comparable operation for women, tubal ligation, usually involves at least an overnight hospitalization with a general anesthetic. However, several doctors use a local anesthetic in an outpatient setting. The operative mortality risk is similar to that of an appendectomy — about one death in 15,000 to 20,000 procedures. But the death rate is believed to be dropping now that techniques have been simplified and most tubal ligations are done on healthy women. Causes of death include anesthesia reactions, massive hemorrhage or unrecognized infection of the abdominal organs. The risk of serious complications with the new techniques is in the range of one in 200 to one in 500 cases, usually the result of injury to the bowel or uterus or excessive bleeding. Some complication occurs in an average of 1 to 2 per cent of cases. No long‐term adverse effects are known and few are suspected, but adequate studies have not been done to rule out this possibility. The failure rate in female sterilization is much lower than for vasectomy — less than 2 per 1,000 cases."
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/04/archives/metropolitan-briefs-35million-citybuilding-cut-urged-court-backs.html,"After five days of hearings on the proposed $1.95billion capital budget for 1975‐76, the City Council's Finance Committee decided yesterday to recommend that construction projects totaling $35.3‐million be scrapped and the money reallocated for other projects. Matthew J. Troy Jr., committee chairman, said that the first priority of the Council would be to reallocate $3.5million to the Board of Education for rehabilitation and maintenance of existing public schools. The board had originally asked for $7‐million. The funds to be reallocated, Mr. Troy explained, were for projects that had not been started and had little likelihood of moving in the next fiscal year. The capital, or construction, budget must be approved by the Board of Estimate and the Council by March 15. Mr. Troy said his committee would meet by the end of this week with Mayor Beame and the members of the Board Estimate to reach final decisions on which projects should be dropped and which should receive the allocations. Court Backs Medicaid for Sex Change Sex‐change operations were ruled eligible for Medicaid funds, in an opinion handed down by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The 3‐to‐1 decision overturned a Kings County Court decision of last March upholding the state and the city Departments of SocialServices in their refusal to supply Medicaid funds for the surgery. The request had been made by Denise R., a 41‐year‐old genetic male who has been living and working as a female for the last 16 years. When the applicant's first request for public assistance for the surgery was denied, he asked for a hearing to review the determination. The Appellate Division rejected the medical basis for the denial of the application as “without substance” inasmuch as “the agency offered no independent medical evidence and its representative at the hearing admitted that it had never made a medical examination of the petitioner.” A spokseman for the state's Commissioner of Social Services said the opinion was being studied to determine whether an appeal would be made. Sutton Opposes West Side Road Plan Percy E. Sutton, the Manhattan Borough President, told Mayor Beame in a letter that he now opposed the city administration's plan to rebuild the dilapidated West Side Highway as a six‐lane Interstate System route, which would enjoy 90 per cent Federal financing but would have to be opened to trucks. Mr. Sutton's decision followed reports of similar opposition by five of the six community planning boards that have a say in the matter. Opponents generally say an interstate road would attract more traffic and would increase pollution. A spokesman for Mr. Sutton said the Borough President preferred getting Federal funds for mass transit, possibly by “trading in” anticipated Federal highway funds. 3 Women in Suit Get an Abortion Plan Attorneys for three young pregnant women and officials of Nassau County and its medical center agreed at pretrial conference that the women would be referred other hospitals for abortions if they reported in person the Nassau County Hospital Center. However, Federal Judge John F. Dooling Jr. reserved decision on a motion to restrain physicians at the medical center from refusing to perform abortions beginning with the second trimester. 9 Indicted as Drug Plotters Nine men were indicted in Federal District Court here on charges of conspiracy to distribute substantial amounts of heroin and cocaine in New York and Pittsburgh. The indictment said one of the defendants, Anthony Manfredonia, 37 years old, of 1483 Stadium Avenue, the Bronx, had delivered about one pound of heroin every three weeks for a period of several months. The alleged conspiracy was said to have continued for the last seven years, according to United States Attorney Paul J. Curran."
JEWISH WOMEN VOW DRIVE FOR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/05/archives/jewish-women-vow-drive-for-abortion.html,"PHILADELPHIA, March 4—The National Women's Division of the American Jewish Congress vowed today to work for “free access to abortion” for all women. In a unanimously adopted resolution, the 500 delegates voted to urge all legislators to oppose anti‐abortion measures. The resolution, one of several adopted by the women's group, highlighted the closing sessions of the divisions', biennial convention at the Bellevue‐Stratford Hotel. The delegates voiced concern that a “climate of fear? has been generated In the medical profession following the conviction last month of a Boston physician on charges of manslaughter for performing an abortion. In 1973, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional a Texas statute that made abortion a crime except when necessary to save the life of the mother. The manslaughter conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin in the death of a fetus after a legal abortion “threatens to nullify the constitutionally guaranteed right of the woman to have an abortion,” the resolution said. It added that the American Jewish Congress women would file a friend‐of the‐court brief in support of Dr. Edelin's appeal of the one‐year probation sentence'"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/05/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Although I am opposed in toto to your “Abortion Error” editorial of Feb. 19, I do not wish now to restate the noble contrary position, for the opposing positions are evident. However, one cannot remain silent to one of your statements in support of abortion, Which I hope you will recant. As part of your statement in dire prophecy you condemn the Edelin verdict and support abortion because “the life prospects for their undesired progeny are particularly grim.” Have you finally reached the ultimate immorality? Have you taken the first step toward your own totalitarianism? Now you order that abortion be performed when an infant's future may be some degree less than average or, as you phrase it, “particularly grim.” What unborn child, or “progeny,” as you prefer, with a grim future is to be subject to your abortion rule? The Harlem black? The white Appalachian? Just how would you decide or have others decide? And would eventually your “grim future” doctrine also support euthanasia, genocide, on and on and on. Terrible, no? Re‐examine your statement on “grim life prospects.” Although I deeply disagree with your position on abortion, I recognize your right to print it. But when your dicta become absurd and insidious, one expects you to admit error publicly. We will be looking for your retraction of such nonsense. A study in irony is suggested: The editorial subject following “Abortion Error” was “Bird Massacre,” an essay on the “poignant spectacle” of “bird massacre.” I propose that you substitute your choice of “baby” “progeny” or “fetus” for “blackbirds in “Bird Massacre.” This might help all of us to balance our values. MATTHEW T. MARTIN Edison, N. J., Feb. 19, 1975 • To the Editor: My response, to your Feb. 19 editorial “Abortion Error” is this: Is the Supreme Court, consisting of nine men (albeit lawyers), qualified to decide when human life begins? Is human life so expendable that we en trust a group of nine persons with so vital a decision in the first place? Did you respond, so strongly when those nine persons made their decision two years ago? And are they any more qualified to make such a monumental decision than those twelve people in Boston? I think not. The judgment given by the jurors in this nation, under God, blessed by a government of the people, by the people and for the people (and who were the jurors, if not people), was in my opinion right and quite courageous, given the climate of expediency and concern for only one's own skin that is so prevalent in our society today. AGNES P. MCGRANE South Ozone Park, N.Y., Feb. 19, 1975 To the Editor: The Feb. 19 editorial “Abortion Error” prompts us to make two points: • The question of judicial process is by no means as clear as you pretend. Inasmuch as the Supreme Court has not ruled specifically on the issue of an aborted but still viable fetus' right to available medical resources following abortion (i.e., its right to life), a manslaughter charge against a doctor denying those resources would appear on the face of it to be a legitimate way of raising the issue in the courts.  • What you lightly refer to as the “ideological debate over the beginnings of actual human life” is, however complex, crucial and central to the question of law. You condemn the prosecutor for using the terms “fetus” and “baby” interchangeably. The fact that the defense referred only to “products of conception” (a phrase you evidently felt to be too embarrassing to mention) leads one to the conclusion that both sides in the case encouraged the jury to make an implicit judgment on this issue. As you correctly point out, even experts fail to agree here. Yet you yourself seem to have no trouble deciding the merits of the question. We would suggest to you that the “rightto‐life” groups are raising the issue of what criteria are to be employed in deciding, whether an unborn or viable aborted fetus is human or not. It, therefore, becomes an essential ingredient in any reasoned reconciliation between the parties to this controversy. By avoiding this issue, The Times, far more than the Boston prosecutor, appears to be substituting rhetorical sophistry for argument and thus forfeits its readers' serious at tention. JAMES MCKEON ELLEN BRADY, RONALD BRADY Sloatsburg, N.Y., Feb. 20, 1975 America's First Victory To the Editor: I am writing in reply to the letter of Arthur M. Jones published on. Feb. 7. Mr. Jones' letter is well presented and based on careful research. I do not dispute his statements of facts or the importance of the bravery and initiative shown by the Americans at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The “Shot heard round the. World” deserves, the fame accorded to it. To quote Ethan Allen: “The first systematized and bloody attempt at Lexington to enslave America thoroughly electrified my mind, and fully determined me to take part with my country.” He did so and three weeks later, with Benedict Arnold at his side, led 83 Green Mountain Boys across Lake Champlain in the early morning, into Fort Ticonderoga through a breach in the wall and obtained the surrender of the British garrison from its commandant, Captain de la Place. This was the first American Revolutionary victory. Getting back to Lexington, the instructions issued by General Gage to Lieut. Col, Francis Smith, who commanded the British expedition, were to march to Lexington and then to Concord and back to Boston, destroying American supplies along the way. The British did just that. Hearing that the expedition was meeting resistance, General Gage sent a relief force, under the command of Lord Percy, to Lexington, bringing not only men but two cannon. With this help the expeditioriary force made it back to Boston, in accordance with the orders issued to its commanding officer. JOHN H. G. PELL Ticonderoga, N. Y., March 1, 1975 • Bring On the Squirrels To the Editor: It is heartening to read that the attack capability of the United States Army has been raised to the point where it can wage a successful battle against blackbirds. Perhaps if we‐give the Pentagon all of, the money It asks for, some day it may even be able to take on squirrels. BURTON UNGER Upper Montclair, N. J., March 1, 1975 On Arming Turkey To the Editor: Your Feb. 14 editorial “Turkish Boomerang” is a departure from your previous policy pronouncements on behalf of Cyprus. The issue is essentially more than tactical, it is fundamental. It is simply against the law to advance military aid to allied countries who use this aid for aggressive purposes. Do we make an exception from this law for Turkey? Is this a country of laws, or do we suspend these laws whenever our Administration chooses? The flagrant violation of Cyprus' independence by the Turkish Army armed with U. S. weapons and its occupation of 40 per cent of the land with the known ruinous effect on the island's economy and the displaced population has continued because of the October and December compromises that the Administration extracted from Congress. If our Government had applied the law in our statutes from the beginning, the Turks could have at least allowed the 200,000 refugees to return to their homes, and we would be on the way to solving the problems of this unhappy island. But the Turks know that our Government is on their side—read Mr. Ford's statement that the halt in arms deliveries to Turkey was a “tragedy”—and as a, result they take advantage of the division in our ranks and continue to play games with the lives of the Greek Cypriotes. The freezing‐over of the negotiating climate does not suggest the desirability of a return to the more flexible approach. On the contrary, it suggests the necessity to bring the Administration in line with both houses of Congress and to derdand the respect of human dignity, freedom and justice in Cyprus and the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish invaders. GEORGE J. BIRBILIS Chairman, Americans for Cyprus Flushing, N.Y., Feb. 15, 1975 • Misdirected Message To the Editor: Yehudi Menuhin writes (letter Feb. 23) that “boycotting is a coward's action and costs the doer nothing.” Would he please direct his suggestion, to the boycott office of the Atab League? DAVID L. GOLD Bayside, N. Y., Feb. 26, 1975 Carey's ‘Giant Step’ To the Editor: Governor Carey deserves warm thanks and high praise from all of us concerned with court reform in New York State for his courageous action on Feb. 23 in removing future judicial appointments from the political arena. Under the Carey Executive Order, nonpartisan committees of laymen and lawyers, themselves selected on a broad basis, will submit to him lists of well‐qualified candidates from which the Governor must select his appointees. This is “merit selection” at its best, as learned from solid experience in other states, and is a cause for rejoicing. What makes Governor Carey's, actions particularly valorous is that his constitutional power to fill judicial vacancies is one of the most tempting sources of political patronage available. Last year, when a delegation from the Committee for Modern Courts urged former Gov. Malcolm Wilson to issue a similar executive order, his response was blunt and disheartening—he said that he would continue to seek recommendations to fill judicial vacancies from Republican county chairmen. Governor Carey's voluntary surrender of that prerogative, which could so obviously be used to build political loyalties for himself, is an act of rare statesmanship. Since March of 1973, the New York State. Bar Association has been working hard toward the goal of judicial reform, with merit selection of judges at the top of the list. It has been a wearying process. We therefore take great heart at the‐giant step forward that has just been taken by the state's chief executive. Now it is the Legislature's turn. Our elected representatives should show equal political courage by passing a constitutional amendment to mandate merit selection of judges in all courts and end, once and for all the cruel charade which deprives the public of their franchise in selecting judges and which has undermined public confidence in the courts. WHITNEY NORTH SEYMOUR JR. Pres., New York State Bar Association New York, Feb. 25, 1975 Pension Watchdog To the Editor: Reuben W. Mitchell states in his Feb. 24 letter that “with all the threats the present fiscal stringency is posing to public employes, their morale could hardly be helped by having the Kinzel Commission looming in the rear.” As a member of the City Teachers' Retirement Board, Mr. Mitchell, of all people, should be keenly aware that a major contributing factor to the current fiscal crisis the city faces has been past political “cave‐ins” to reasonable union pressures and demands for‐further enriched public employe pension benefits. The city taxpayers' bill for public pensions has doubled in the last four years to $1.5‐billion (including Social Security payments) Perhaps because the State Pension Commission has been effective in working with the Governor and Legislature in halting excessive benefit liberalizations, it is now under attack. The commission was established as an independent, bipartisan, nonpolitical body to review continuously and evaluate New York's public pension programs. The need for such review Is more important than ever. In March, the commission will release an extensive study on financing the public pension systems. The study will demonstrate that the pension crisis in New York City has not been solved but is actually growing worse. Indeed, the report will show that the Teachers' Retirement System of the City of New York is in deep trouble. JOSEPH G. METZ Executive Director Permanent Comm. on Public Employee Pension and Retirement Systems New York, Feb. 24, 1975 Health Care for the Jobless To the Editor: As unemployment soars and more people draw benefits over a longer time, it is imperative that the Ford Administration act to have the Government assume payment of healthinsurance premiums for the unemployed. Coverage for hospital and doctor care should not be allowed to lapse along with the loss of jobs, nor should the cost of such care be allowed to add to the already heavy burdens of those seeking employment in this depressed economy. Since this Administration appears unaware that the problem exists, Congress ought to enact appropriate legislation. Health care as a universal right and not a privilege was endorsed years ago by almost every major group involved in rendering such care. SAM ALLALOUF New York, Feb. 25, 1975"
Political Pressure Mounts,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/06/archives/political-pressure-mounts.html,"BERLIN, March 5 — In the wake of the kidnapping and release of Peter Lorenz, the Christian Democratic leader of West Berlin, a wave of political reaction is gathering force here and in West Germany. In a televised speech tonight, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt alluded to the Government's release of five anarchist convicts on Monday in exchange for Mr. Lorenz, saying: “We were fully aware that we would have to pay a very high price. This high price can only be justified if the solidarity of responsible politicians in dealing with questions of domestic security is not forgotten the same day we got Peter Lorenz free.” But the solidarity has already begun to dissipate. Richard Jaeger, a conservative Bavarian deputy, is talking in favor of restoring the death penalty in West Germany. And a bomb explosion in the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe last night has led to a likening of the situation in West Germany now to the disorders in the Weimar Republic preceding Hitler's take‐over in 1933. Next Thursday, the Parliament in Bonn will hold a debate on domestic security, although most of Mr. Jaeger's colleagues, including Mr. Lorenz, have declined to endorse the death penalty proposal. But after a group calling itself the Revolutionary Women's Cell claimed responsibility for the explosion in Karlsruhe—the court last week declared an abortion reform unconstitutional—doubts were being voiced here along the lines of a televised debate tonight, “Is the state defenseless?” The issue that will be debated in Parliament is how to deal with the isolated, fanatically ideological' leftists who carried out the kidnapping. “They should take them all into a prison yard and shoot them,” a Berlin storekeeper said yesterday. The sentiment is common."
Persistent Violation Found in Study Here Of Private Hospitals,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/06/archives/persistent-violation-found-in-study-here-of-private-hospitals.html,"Since the state Department or Health took over the job of regulating private, profit‐making hospitals from New York City in 1973, it has found thousands of sanitary and safety violations—many of them serious enough to pose imminent danger to the patients at some of these institutions. But an investigation by The New York Times has determined that it is far easier for the department to find infractions than to force their correction. In addition, the agency's ability to oversee conditions in the hospitals has been further weakened by the diversion of its manpower to assist in investigations of scandalous conditions in the nursing homes. Because it says it does not have the staff to revisit these hospitals speedily and to follow through on amelioration, the violations have persisted. And although there is a surplus of hospital beds in the city, the state says it has been unable to convince the courts that they should uphold the denial of a license to an institution in serious noncompliance with the state hospital code. While the violations persist at some of these hospitals, the state ironically finds itself helping to keep them operating through Medicaid payments. These payments are the major source of income for many of the hospitals where the most serious faults have been found. In some cases Medicaid payment rates have been raised substantially to hospitals having continuing serious violations without even an audit of the need for the extra payments. That is because the state says pit doesn't have enough auditors to do the job. All of the Health Department auditors are now working on nursing‐home investigations and the auditing of the private profit‐making hospitals is left to Blue Cross. But Blue Cross's auditors usually check the books long after the Medicaid money has been paid. There are 126 hospitals in New York City aside from specialized state and Federal institutions. Of these, 32, with a total of 4,401 beds, are proprietary, or profit‐making, hospitals; 75 are voluntary hospitals gperated by private groups on a nonprofit basis, and 19 are municipal hospitals operated by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. With public attention focused on the private nursing homes, the state Department of Health has now moved to close 62 of these facilities. But health officials say they do not have enough lawyers to take on what they say could be a legal battle of two to five years to close a hospital. “We just don't have enough lawyers to go through the process, said Dr. Richard Nauen, associate commissioner of the state Department of Health in charge of New York City affairs, in an interview. Court Attitudes Cited But even if the lawyers were available, state health officials who are charged with licensing hospitals are still pessimistic. “The courts have been sympathetic to the operators of private nursing homes and hospitals,” charged Raymond Tobia, associate director of the Health Department's hospital division. David Ross, the city's Administrative Judge of the Supreme Court, said in an interview that he was not aware of any judicial sympathies toward hospital owners. But he said that judges were reluctant in general to allow a final and extreme action of shutting down an institution if they are not sure that other, less drastic remedies have been fully exhausted. In the state's procedure for checking hospitals, a letter is supposed to be sent to an institution outlining its deficiencies within 10 days after an inspection has disclosed violations. Within 10 days of receiving that letter a hospital is supposed to reply, saying what it is doing to correct the deficiencies. Within 90 days of the Drip final inspection the state is supposed to go back to re‐in spect the hospital. “I have to confess to you that those deadlines have not been very rigid,” said Andrew Krieger, the state Health Department's assistant director for New York City affairs. “We've been focusing our attention on nursing homes.” “If we did fully what we were supposed to do on hospitals,” Mr. Krieger said, “we would need half again as many people on our staff.” He said this would mean 25 to 30 more people than the 55 he now has. Two Actions Pending If the state fails to get the hospital to correct its violations the state can withhold the institution's license after a proper hearing. The state has never moved to take away a hospital's license as a result of sanitary and safety deficiencies because it feels it would be too difficult to win such a case, Mr. Krieger said. In the rare cases where it has tried to deny a hospital a license the state has moved on the relatively simple ground of the failure of a hospital to seek state approval for a change in ownership. Last month, for example, the state health agency said it would not continue the licenses of two jointly operated proprietary hospitals in Manhattan—the 106‐bed Park East Hospital at 112 East 83d Street and the 72‐bed Park West Hospital at 170 West 76th Street—because of what it contends are unauthorized changes in ownership. The hospitals denied the charge and went to state Supreme Court, where they gained an injunction allowing them to continue operating. Walter Livey, the Health Department lawyer in charge of enforcement, said that 10 more attorneys are being requested by the agency in its budget objective to supplement the seven now bringing legal action against nursing homes and hospitals with serious violations. He maintained in an interview that the additional lawyers were needed to prosecute those hospitals that were unwilling or unable to correct violations. Violations Are Cited Violations found in some profit‐making hospitals include dirty and inadequate operating rooms, a lack of records in the dispensing of drugs—including narcotics, inadequate sterilization of dressings and equipment, staff members without proper qualifications and serious fire hazards because of inadequate exits. The state says, for example, that at the Madison Avenue Hospital, a 121‐bed, 16‐story structure at 30 East 76th Street built in 1928, there is only one exit. A memorandum dating back to January, 1969, that is in the state Health Department's files says: “The [Fire Safety Advisory] Committee was unanimous and emphatic that a single means of egress is wholly unacceptable and should not be permitted.” Frederick P. Hans, the administrator of the Madison Avenue Hospital, said last week, “We are still negotiating with the owner of adjacent property for a place to put another exit, but there are cost factors.” At the Kew Gardens General Hospital, 80‐02 Kew Gardens Road in Queens, state inspectors last February found “the Psychiatry Department leaves so much to be desired. . . . The physical plant and atmosphere is not adequate. It is considerably overcrowded and there is a conspicuous lack of recreational facilities . . . Almost all patients receive electroshock in combination with chemotherapy. Electroshock today is considered a valid and effective treatment only for selected cases.” Asked about the state's criticism of how Kew Gardens treats its psychiatric patients, Benedict L. Lurie, the hospital's administrator, said, “That's their opinion. We disagree. Unfortunately, medicine is not a science, it's an art.” The state inspectors there also found that “due to the limitations imposed by a poorly planned kitchen, including storage and refrigeration areas, it is impossible to maintain acceptable standards of sanitation in the dietary department.” ‘We're Not Young’ Mr. Lurie said the hospital might have some sanitary problems. “Everyone expects a hospital to be all modern glass and stainless steel,” he explained. “But we're not a young hospial. We go back to 1935.” An institution that has one of the widest ranges of violations n the Health Department files ??s Wadsworth Hospital, a fivestory brick building at 629 West 185th Street in Washing??on Heights. A blue awning juts ??ut from between two crum??ling white columns that flank ??he single front door, which is ??he only exit from the upper ??loors. In the Health Department ??iles there are repeated warnings from the Fire Department that Wadsworth “has serious ??ire safety deficiencies” because of the lack of an alter??ate exit and because of non??ireproof wooden doors. Wadsworth has contended that putting In another exit would mean cutting down on the number of beds. In a letter last month to the Health Department, Dr. Albert C. Bottari, the executive administrator of Wadsworth, said that providing an additional exit would involve “major reconstruction” and “probably decertification of at least three beds [from the current 50‐bed capacity], which is not in the public interest.” Dr. Bottari says all the beds are needed to serve the community. Disagreeing is the Health and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New York, a quasipublic organization of representatives of physicians, hospitals, philanthropies, insurance carriers and labor and management groups that was set up to advise the Health Commissioner on the hospital needs of the area. “It is the opinion of the council,” a 1972 report says, “that the hospital needs of New York City do not include a need for Wadsworth Hospital at its present site.” The council also found that Wadsworth had “serious deficiency as far as fire safety was concerned” and that it had “no day rooms, an inadequate ventilation system, no recovery room and poor circulation and control for asepsis in its operating suite.” The most common operation performed at Wadsworth is abortion. Some 30 per cent of its patients are there for abortions, Dr. Bottari said in an interview last week. Dr. Bottari conceded there were no day rooms for patients. “The plant wasn't ideally laid out,” he said. He added that the ventilating system that raised questions about the control of contamination in the operating room could be replaced. But he said all changes were being held up because of the uncertainty of how much the second exit would cost. “We are willing to comply with as much as is financially feasible,” Dr. Bottari said, adding that constructing another stairway and exit in the 50‐year‐old building could cost more than $350,000 and might be unfeasible. Charges Are Disputed He disputed the charge that the hospital had no recovery room and showed a visitor to a room with curtained ‐ off wheeled stretchers. He said this had been the recovery room since the hospital opened 50 years ago. Last April when the Health Department inspectors went into Wadsworth Hospital they said they found no records to indicate that its governing body had met in the last year. They also said the hospital actually seemed to be run by another corporation in violation of the state hospital code. The code insists that the licensees run the hospital directly through the governing body so that those in charge are responsible to the state. “There is no documented evidence,” the state inspectors reported, “that the governing body participated in or periodically examined the goals and policies of the institution and that it is responsible for the management and operation of the hospital.” On Oct. 1, 1972, according to hospital records, the Wadsworth Hospital building and the land it is on was acquired by Tender Care, Inc., of Glen Head, L. I. The state code does not regulate who owns a hospital building or land. It just concerns itself with the operation of the hospital. “On Jan. 16, 1973,” the state health inspectors reported, “Wadsworth Hospital entered into a service agreement with Tender Care, Inc., delegating management and operational responsibilities to Tender Care, Inc.” ‘Never Heard of Them’ The hospital lists Dr. Carlos, Lithgow as the chairman of its governing body. When Dr. Lithgow was asked this week what role Tender Care performed; he replied: “I have never heard of them.” Dr. Bottari said in a letter to the state Health Department last month that Tender Care “has no responsibility for the operation or management of this hospital.” He said that Tender Care only assists Wadsworth in maintaining records and helps “in educational, administrative and general hospital supportive activities.” The president of Tender Care is Bernard Halpert. In response to an inquiry he said Tender, Care was in the “health resources business.” He said the, company held real estate and, supplies services to hospitals and other health facilities. Tender Care does not manage Wadsworth, Mr. Halpert said. He said that aside from Wadsworth, Tender Care did not own any other health care facilities in New York but it did have “another hospital in Texas” As to records of governing board meetings at Wadsworth, Dr. Bottari said they did exist, but the administrator at the time — his predecessor — “was unfamiliar as to their location” on the day of the inspection. Dr. Bottari, who is addressed as doctor by patients and staff at the hospital on the basis of a Ph.D. he was awarded “in cardiac resuscitation and hospital administration” at “an offshoot of the University of Rome,” joined Wadsworth last July. Procedures Are Assailed The state health inspectors also said that other records were either nonexistent or inadequate at Wadsworth. “Proper procedures for appointment to the medical staff have not been followed,” the report said. “No system for verifying licensure or specialty qualifications have been followed.” The report of the inspectors noted: “One inpatient had an order for oxygen to be administered, but no oxygen tank was at her bedside. The nurse stated that the order had been discontinued. This was not evident from the medical record. “Another patient had received blood and methadone on a physician's telephone order. These orders had never been countersigned by the physician.” Dr. Bottari says the records were there, but just could not be found at the time of the inspection. Conditions in Wadsworth's oxygen storage room were found to be “poor” by the inspectors. “The oxygen cylinders are stored with old medical files, and not in a separate room for oxygen only,” their report said. “Gauges and nasal cannulas are stored on shelves which are extremely dusty and dirty.” Dr. Bottari proudly opened the door of the basement oxy gen storage ??m for a visitor last week. The medical files were not there. The ?? of the: laundry ?? found and by the state to be a problem that could affect those outside the hospital. “Occasionally, gowns are laundered in a neighborhood laundromat,” the state report says. “There is no control over the 180‐degree water temperature required for the processing of hospital laundry. In addition, there is no control over the spread of infection from hospital laundry to other persons using the laundromat facilities.” Dr. Bottari says that the inspectors must have misunderstood about the hospital's laundry management. He said all the surgical gowns and most other hospital laundry is done by a professional laundry that services other hospitals. “I do send the lab coats [the white jackets worn by the laboratory technicians] out to a neighborhood Chinese laundry because they do a nice job, clean and nicely starched,” he said. In the operating room, the state report said, “clean‐up procedures are not adequate. On the day of the survey a patient was being taken into one O.R. and the room had not been adequately cleaned. Paper was present on the floor and the soiled linen receptacle had not been completely emptied.” In addition, the report said, that operating room personnel “were observed throughout the hospital in O.R. garb. The state hospital code requires that O.R. personnel remove contaminated gowns ... footware covering and gloves at the door before leaving the O.R. suite.” Dr. Bottari scoffs at these charges. “You always see people walking around hospitals in scrub suits.” The sterilizing of equipment used in the entire hospital is done in the operating suite, the inspectors found. “This is unsatisfactory,” they said, “since this increases the traffic into this sensitive area as equipment is brought in from the patient floors.” Dr. Bottari said that most of the equipment is disposable and, therefore, it would not be economical to put in additional sterilizing facilities. In taking a visitor to the newly painted operating suite, Dr. Bottari made sure that the requirements to avoid contamination were followed. There was a change into a green scrub suit and donning of mask, cap and shoe coverings. He pointed to the stainless steel sink with foot‐operated waterand‐soap dispensing controls so that operating room personnel could scrub up and not contaminate their hands. No Re‐Inspection Made Since the inspection last April the state has notified Wadsworth of the violations found, but there has been no re‐inspection, which is supposed to come 90 days after the first inspection. The state says that since it took over inspection of the city's proprietary hospitals it has been able to visit each of the 32 in the city at least once. But it also says it has been unable to recheck to make sure that a hospital actually removes violations. Hospitals are licensed for a maximum of two years and they are supposed to be examfined before a new license is issued. While the state has concentrated somewhat on the private hospitals since it added them to its responsibility in 1973, it has not gotten around to visiting all the municipal and voluntary hospitals even once every two years. Such a record has upset independent hospital watchdog groups that have become increasingly critical of the state's inspection system. Donald Rubin, president of the Consumer Commission on the Accreditation of Health Services, a private group, has calculated that at the rate inspections are going now, “It will take five or six years for the state Department of Health to inspect all New York City hospitals even if no followup inspections are made, which can further delay re‐inspection. Without aggressive followup, there can be no effective enforcement of standards or assurances that violations are corrected.” City Is Critical According to Mr. Krieger of the state Health Department, the state took over inspecting the city's proprietary hospitals so there would be uniform standards and uniform implementation across the state. The state Health Department earlier had been charged with regulating the proprietaries outside of the city. But city officials are now moving to take back that authority. Dr. Lowell E. Bellin, the city's Health Commissioner, said, “We are closer to the scene and more cognizant of the problems and deficiencies than the state can ever be.” Dr. Bellin said that the city had not compiled a better record in closing substandard hospitals when it was in charge of inspections. But he said it was difficult to close hospitals then because there was a shortage of beds. Now, because of new building and different treatment methods, there is a surplus of beds and enforcement could be firm without depriving the sick, Dr. Bellin said. Despite the violations found at Wadsworth, the state Department of Health last Sept. 20 raised the daily payments it gives the hospital for each Medicaid patient from $89.07 to $163.03. Seventy per cent of Wadsworth's patients have their bills paid by Medicaid. The cost of Medicaid is shared —50 per cent is paid by the Federal government, 25 per cent by the state and 25 per cent by the city. “We use the limited number of auditors we have for the nursing homes,” said Donald B. Davidoff, associate director of the Health Department's division of economics, when he was asked about how the figures were verified. Competition Is Cited Mr. Davidoff said the department relied on reports from Blue Cross, which sends its own auditors to check on the hospitals. “Wouldn't it be crazy for us to go in, too?” Mr. Davidoff said. A Blue Cross official said last week that the new Wadsworth figures had not been audited. “We generally lag about two years behind,” he explained. Dr. Bottari said he was “competing” for patients with such well‐known institutions as the nearby Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center. “We're getting more Spanishspeaking doctors who don't like the grandness of ColumbiaPresbyterian,” he said. “They like more of a home‐type facihty.”"
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/07/archives/metropolitan-briefs-jersey-asks-medicaidpayment-study-news-back-in.html,"The New Jersey Attorney General's office was asked yesterday to investigate a 1973 settlement for $368,787 of an overpayment of $483,316 in Medicaid funds to a Wayne Township nursing home. Richard C. Leone, the State Treasurer, who heads a cabinet‐level review committee on Medicaid costs, said there had been “highly questionable circumstances” surrounding the settlement between the Alps Manor Nursing Home and State Medicaid officials, after an auditor said the nursing home had overcharged the state by $488,316 from July 1, 1968, to June 30, 1971. The auditor recommended recovery of that amount. According to the audit, most of the money in question was listed as salary under several categories but actually was taken as management fees by Michael Kampel, Michael Maneli and Martin Fishbein, the three operators of the nursing home. News Back in Operation The Daily News, unable for three days to distribute its papers because of a strike of deliverers, is back in full operation. The deliverers returned to their jobs Wednesday evening and worked through the early morning hours distribute yesterday's delayed editions. Under terms of the settlement, The News and the union agreed that “the total reduction in overtime hours involved in the changes scheduled to begin March 2 (455 hours of overtime per week) to be distributed equitably as practical among the men involved.” The deliverers had struck last Sunday night protest against the schedule changes. A spokesman for The News said none of the members of other unions, many whom had been furloughed as of Wednesday afternoon, would lose any pay. Doctors Upheld in Refusing Abortions A Federal judge in Brooklyn upheld the right of physicians at the Nassau County Medical Center to refuse perform abortions after the 12th week because of fear possible criminal prosecution despite the United States Supreme Court ruling that abortions may be performed legally, up to the 24th week of pregnancy. In a preliminary opinion, Judge John F. Dooling Jr. also upheld the right the center to refuse to admit three pregnant women for abortions after their 12th week of pregnancy because actively undertook to place them in other facilities willing to perform the abortions. From the Police Blotter: A 16‐year‐old boy in East Haven, Conn., was charged with killing the owner of a supermarket there and wounding the owner's wife in a robbery. The police said the suspect, Joseph Turcio, had shot and killed Frank Massaro and wounded his wife, Jean, after they had closed their store and were getting into their car. Mrs. Massaro was in serious condition in Yale‐New Haven Hospital. . . . A lye solution was thrown in the face of a Transit Authority policeman on the platform of the Seventh Avenue IRT subway line at 41st Street at 3 A.M. The attacker, identified only as Fred Jenkins, was wrestled to the ground and arrested by another policeman. The injured man was listed in satisfactory condition in Bellevue Hospital. . . . The police report on guns for the 24‐hour period ended midnight Wednesday showed one homicide, 17 assaults, 51 robberies and two rapes committed with the use of guns. Court arraignments for possession or use of guns totaled 35, and the police seized 54 handguns three shotguns and six rifles. Guns voluntarily surrendered since March 1 under the dangerous weapons ??esty program totaled 98 handguns, 11 rifles, two shotguns, an air pistol, a tear‐gas gun and a starter's pistol."
SWISS LEGISLATORS BAR ABORTION SHIFT,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/07/archives/swiss-legislators-bar-abortion-shift.html,"GENEVA, March 7—An attempt by the Swiss Cabinet, to find a compromise on the abortion issue, which sharply divides the nation, suffered a sharp setback today in the lower house of Parliament. After three days' debate the National Council rejected, by a vote of 90 to 82, with 12 abstentions, a Government bill that for the first time would have legalized abortions for other than medical reasons. The measure can be given a second reading if the upper house, the Council of State, supports it. United in opposition were supporters of a more liberal approach and opponents of any liberalization of the law. The Council rejected a counterproposal by a study committee that would have permitted abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. A counterproposal by the committee's minority to permit abortions only when a pregnancy was medically certified as “seriously endangering” health was also rejected. The present law forbids abortions except for medical reasons that must be certified by experts. The law is under fire from all sides because it is not uniformly applied and is said to make legal abortions available only to the well‐to‐do. The Government proposal would have added “social” grounds."
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/09/archives/ideas-trends-education-ornithology-law-court-decides-not-to-define.html,"In three caste in its current term, the United States Supreme Court was celled on to measure the balance between the privacy of the individual and the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press. In its considerations, the high court chose ?? restrict itself to the narrower issue in each case; the effect of its caution has been to leave unadvanced the argument about what private matters are of rightful public interest and to what extent damage suits constitute censorship of the press after the fact. Information from public records. Last week, the court struck down a Georgia law that made it a misdemeanor to print or broadcast, the name of a rape victim. On the basis of that law, a bereaved father had brought a suit for damages for invasion of his family's privacy. The suit against the Cox Broadcasting Company arose after an Atlanta television reporter included the name of the man's slain daughter in an account of the trial of five men who had pleaded guilty to her rape. The court also denied the right of a victim or her parents to base a suit for damages on such publication. The ground for the court's decision was that the information involved was available from public law enforcement records. But the opinion left open the broader question of whether privacy laws may ever be used to limit the accurate publication of information from public records. In addition, the opinion did not imply any protection for accurate press accounts of inaccurate public records. Earlier Cases False reports. Last December, in another case, the Court decided not for the press but for the plaintiff. The widow of a disaster victim in West Virginia, had charged The Cleveland Plain Dealer with portraying her family in a false light. She said the paper had pictured them as victims of Appalachia and had maintained she refused to talk about the family when in fact she had not been present at an interview of her children. A jury award of $60,000 was upheld on the ground that the statements implying Mrs. Margaret Cantrell was interviewed were “calculated falsehoods.” The Court emphasized that the ruling was not intended to relax standards of proof by which the press may be held liable in reporting the personal circumstances of private citizens inadvertently involved in events that become public. Those standards are generally malicious intent; the paper had argued that its report had been published without malice. The purely private. The third case involved the right to make public a sequence of events that had been purely private, through the publication of a psychiatric case history after the treatment of the anonymous patient had been terminated. The Justices accepted the case, but decided not to resolve it. No reason was given. However, a “friend of the court” brief had argued that the records available to the Court did not make clear whether the plaintiff had given permission for publication. Not All Gulls Are Equal Dedicated bird watchers, on hearing that a rare specimen is up and about, drop everything and rush off in hopes of catching a glimpse for themselves. Last week hundreds of “birders” flocked to the northern Massachusetts coast where experts had reported seeing a “Ross's gull.” Many of the bird watchers saw the gull and said it was the sighting of a lifetime. Roger Tory Peterson, an authority on birds, called it “unbelievable.” The bird is a small, gray‐winged seagull distinguished by a rosy chest marking, a wedge‐shaped tail and red feet. The bird normally is found only in the Arctic and is seldom seen even in its own habitat. This was the first record of its appearance on the East Coast of America. Ornithologists could only speculate on how the gull reached Massachusetts. They say that other birds often wander out of their habitat, join other migrating birds, perhaps are swept along by unusual weather conditions and turn up thousands of miles away. Equal Rights Amendment Is Slipping The drive to complete ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment has been stalled, apparently because opponents have successfully frightened off some legislators with claims about the potential effects of such a change in the United States Constitution. Proponents say the claims are exaggerated and in some cases false. The amendment would ban discrimintion based on sex by action of the Federal, state or local governments. Among the arguments the opposition has used with legislators is that if the amendment is ratified the Roman Catholic Church could be required to admit women to the priesthood and to abandon its single‐sex schools, or else lose its tax‐exempt status. The argument is disputed by Catholics who are supporters of the Amendment. Other arguments stressed by opponents include these: that the amendment would undermine marriage and family by absolving husbands of the responsibility for wife and child support; that it would make women eligible for the draft, and would open the way to unrestricted abortions and sexually integrated public rest roams. Except for the draft, proponents say all these arguments are simply false. It is now questionable whether final ratification will come this year, if at all. The amendment will die, if it is not ratified by 1979. The measure, passed by Congress in 1972, requires approval by 38 states to become the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. It is now four short of that total. In recent months it has been rejected in several states and it faces strong opposition in states where votes are still to come. The latest setback came last week in Illinois where a vote in the State Senate was postponed indefinitely because the sponsor said she did not have enough votes for passage. Missouri postponed a vote earlier for the same reason. The two states had been regarded by proponents as likely to take prompt and favorable action this year. In addition to Illinois and Missouri, Florida and North and South Carolina had been expected to vote soon, but the outlook in all of these states now appears uncertain. Education By Satellite The United States is now using a communication satellite to help educate the children of relatively remote areas, much as foreign nations are using satellites to reach where there are no traditional communications. The National Institute of Education is using a satellite 22,300 miles above the Galapagos Islands to beam educational programs to Appalachia, the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. About 4,300 students are involved. Because of their remoteness, the three regions are not reached by regular television. The people, largely of poor ethnic groups, are scattered in rural areas. They have little contact with the “outside” world. The quality and availability of education have been limited, and few teachers have wanted to go to the areas. Videotaped and live TV programs are transmitted from city stations, bounced off the satellite over geographic barriers and received by terminals in schools. Some of the schools have two‐way communications equipment and students can converse with the program originators. Written materials supplement the TV offerings. In each region, the emphasis is on needs pinpointed by advance surveys. In the Rocky Mountains, the focus is on career education for junior high and high school students. In Alaska, where native languages are used primarily in the participating villages, the stress is on spoken English for young children. In Appalachia, the programs emphasize teacher training in reading and career education. The performance and benefits will be evaluated at the end of the experiment in June to determine whether the satellite technique is feasible, academically and economically, for wide application. A spokesman for the institute says preliminary soundings have been favorable."
March and Rally Celebrate First International Women's Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/09/archives/march-and-rally-celebrate-first-international-womens-day.html,"Chilled by brisk March winds, hundreds of women from a coalition of 50 women's groups marched down Fifth Avenue under sunny skies yesterday in celebration of International Women's Day. The marchers weer mostly casually dressed, exuberant young people, although there were a number of middleaged matrons in fur coats. Many carried colorful signs, with such slogans as “Recession, Depression, Wars—Women Can Do Better,” “120,000 Women in Saigon Jails,” “Reverse the Edelin Verdict,” “We Refuse to Be Shock Absorbers for Capitalism's Crisis” and “Self‐Defense Is Not a Crime—Rape Is.” The parade route stretched for 25 blocks, from the New York Public Library, at 41st Street and Fifth Avenue, to Union Square, where a rally was held. Police estimated number of marchers at between 1,200 and 2,000. About 15 per cent of them were men. At first, the marchers were limited by police to the eastern half of Fifth Avenue. But at 32d Street, they took over the entire width of the street, causing one police officer to shake his head and say, good naturedly, “What a city!” hTe parade was led by a group of women carrying a huge red, white and blue banner reading: “International Women's Day Coalition—March 8, 1975.” Behind theme was the Victoria Woodhull Marching Band, an all‐women band in rag‐tag purple costumes, whose bass drummer said: “You don't have to know anything about music to join our group.” The march and rally drew some of the most prominent names in the American feminist movement, including Betty Friedan; Representative Bella Abzug; Gloria Steinem; Jacqueline Ceballos of the National Organization for Women and Lieut. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak as well as Cleanor Tilson president of the New York Coalition of Labor Union Women; Beulah Sanders of the National Welfare Rights Organization and Sylvia Wexler of the Grey Panthers. The most popular chants during the march seemed to be “E.R.A., All the Way,” “Equal Pay for Equal Work” and “Money for Jobs, Not for War.” Across the street from where the parade formed, Harry Britton, who makes his living selling antifeminist newspapers for 25 cents, carried a sign saying “International Husbands' Day.” The march was one of the first events in New York City to commemorate the United Nations‐declared International Women's Year 1975, which many women feel was largely ignored in the city until this weekend. Officially, the march was dedicated to the three goals of the I.W.Y.: equality, development and peace. But as Miss Friedan saw it, the women had many more specific reasons to be marching: ‘Unfinished Business’ “Women are being hurt the most by job layoffs, unemployment, and the chaos of a massive depression,” she said. “We also have to fight our enemies who refuse to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, and our enemies who are trying to deny us abortions and the control of our own bodies. Yes, we do have unfinished business.” The march had a strong labor component, as it also commemorated the march of thousands of working women on New York City's Lower East Side on March 8, 1908, when they demanded an end to sweatshop conditions. For the most part, the march was orderly — although there were a few scattered incidents. In Union Square, a man who identified himself as Frank Lenihan had the pig mask he was wearing torn from his face by angry feminists. They also ripped the two anti‐woman signs he was carrying, one of which said “Wench.” And during the rally, a woman in boxing gloves who called herself Tiger exchanged punches with a television camerman who, she said, had made obscene remarks her placcard calling for women's right to box. The man received a bloody cut on his left jaw. List of Demands At the rally, Carolyn Reed of the Progressive Househould Technicions of America read a list of demands that had been agreed upon by the coalition. They included: Equal job opportunities at equitable wages; 24‐hour‐a‐day universal child care; immediate ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment; access to abortion and contraceptives; civil rights for Lesbians; freedom for all politicalprisoners in this country and abroad; an end to United States “militarism” and a re‐appropriation of defense funds for human needs; and a comprehensive national health care program. Among the most applauded speeches at the rally were those given by Mrs. Abzug and Miss Krupsak, both of whom called for an end to war and the use of “war money” for human needs. As the women spoke, about a half‐dozen persons stood a block away on East 17th Street, with anti‐abortion placards with slogan such as “Abortion Is Murder,” facing the speakers' platform. Another man had shouted earlier, during the march, “Baby murderers, that's all you women are, baby killers.” Among the other groups that were included in the coalition were the Puerto Rican Socialist Party; Jeanette Rankin Committee; Women's Center of Sarah Lawrence College; Ukrainian Women's Club; Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs; Catholics for a Free Choice; National Gay Task Force; New York Women's Caucus of Rank and File Taxi Women; Women's Health Forum; Young Women's Christian Association; Women in the Arts; the Communist Party, and the Girl Scouts of the USA. International Panel International Women's Day was celebrated at the United Nations on Friday, with a day‐long conference on “Women and Men: The Next 25 Years.” It featured 18 panelists from throughout the world, who took turns making statements and answering questions from a panel of journalists and the audience. But the biggest excitement among United Nations women employes that day was about the petition calling for an end to discrimination against women at the United Nations, which 2,700 out of 3,000 U.N. employes had signed. It was presented to U.N. Secretary‐General Kurt Waldheim as the conference was being held. Citing statistics that only 21.7 per cent of the U.N.'s professional employes are women, the women who wrote the petition also called for an “ombudswoman” from outside the United Nations, who would act on individual complaints as well as suggest ways of elevating more women to policy‐making and professional posts. “Since the United Nations is sponsoring International Women's Year, it must set an example as far as discrimination against women is concerned,” said one of the panelists, Father Anthony De Souza, S.J., from India, a member of the World Council of Churches. “Otherwise, the year is just a mockery.” The panelists, who agreed from the outset that they weren't going to offer any “solutions,” discussed a wide range of subjects, including whether women are more peaceful by nature than men; why women are not more involved in the political process; the ways various religions may have kept women down; the need for more and better education for women; the future of the nuclear family; the effect on society of test‐tube babies; and the unimportance of physical beauty. Many observers expressed surprise that more was not said about the so‐called polarization between Western women and their struggle for careers and third world women and their struggle for survival. This division is said to be a possible threat to the success of the I.W.Y. World Conference to take place in Mexico City June 19 through July 2. The only reference to this polarization came from Justice Annie Jiagge of the High Court of Ghana, who said, in answer to a question: A Basic Difference “Women of the third world are not being divided from the women of the developed world over equal pay for equal work. But we are being separated by value judgements. Today, one‐third of the world makes use of two‐thirds of the world's wealth, and then you have two‐thirds of the population with one‐third of the wealth, and then you tell them to manage on that. “As a result,” she went on, “We are faced with starvation and a struggle for the basic necessities. You are so concerned with equality, but you do not see the injustices of this setup, and that's where our basic differences lie.” Germaine Greer, author of “The Female Eunuch” and a panelist, denounced “the queen bee complex” that she said was continuing among some women and harming other women. “You see it in the women who made it on their own, and they think that other women will never make it on their own,” she said. “In a way, it is like the oppressed people who do not want to see one of their own in power.” The conference had its light Moments, such as when the panelists insisted that a nursing mother, who had been banned from the conference room, be admitted. And when Prof. Alla Ghenrildrovna Masevich, vice chairman of the Soviet Union's Council on Astronomy, passed out gifts from Soviet women to the panelists. ‘In the Same Stew’ She gave the men large wooden spoons, “not only for eating, but as a suggestion that they should try some recipes themselves,” she said. And she gave the women aprons, “probably to let us know that we're all in the same stew,” one of the panelists remarked. The topic that drew the longest and most heated discussion seemed to be the fu ture of the family. Several panelists, including Professor Masevich, said the traditional nuclear family was the best answer, while others, including Betty Friedan, argued for new models, “not the nuclear family of the West, which is in crisis, nor the extended family of the East.” In fact, so much time was spent discussing women as wives and mothers that Elizabeth Reid, personal adviser on women's issues to the Prime Minister of Australia, drew the biggest applause of the day when she said: “If we aren't careful, the I.W.Y. is going to become one huge Mother's Day.” Dr. Jessie Bernard, the American sociologist and author, ended the conference by summing up its two long, wordy sessions in two terse statements: ¶“The final liberation of women must come from our own efforts, and we must not depend on other people to do it.” ¶“We are headed for a pluralistic future, with options of all kinds.”"
Cobra,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/09/archives/cobra.html,"By Severo Sarduy. Translated from the Spanish by Suzanne Jill Levine. 176 pp. New York: E. P. Dutton. $8.95. “Cobra” is a mystery show staged by transvestites in disturbingly familiar cities that may, for all we know, belong to an alien universe that is about to crash into us. The personae are constellations that explode into various shapes throughout the book. Cobra, Severn Sarduy's heroheroine, begins life as a mummy, a wax doll in a “lyrical bawdyhouse.” Here she performs and sleeps, “imprisoned in machines and gauze, immobilized by threads lascivious, smeared with white facial creams.” The other dolls, Dior, Sontag, and Cadillac, are jealous of Cobra, the “queen” of the “Lyrical Theater of Dolls.” The Madam of the bawdyhouse, the creator and protectress of the dolls, “would lcok them over, slick on their eyelashes and an O.K. label for each, and send them off with a slap on the backside and a librium.” But Cobra's existence does not reduce itself to simple questions of mechanics. She is more than a doll “who opens and closes her eyes, who urinates and everything, with real hair.” Cobra has been “pricked with ardor,” and “humanized by force of whacks and slaps.” Like Caracas; the inflatable doll in Tommaso Landolfi's remarkable story, “Gogol's Wife,” Cobra complains about her new, brittle humanness. Griping to the Madam, she says: “Why did you bring me into the world if it wasn't to be absolutely divine?” Fussy, particular, she demands a change of sex, for which she travels to a mysterious abortion clinic that may or may not be located in Tabgier. Accordingly, Cobra enters the second part of the novel as a kind of teddy boy who takes up with a motorcycle gang from a cosmic Amsterdam. The gang members, who assume totemistic names, seem to be reincarnations of the dolls out of the hawdyhouse that Cobra inhabited earlier in the book. Cobra is mutilated and destroyed by the gang in a kinky religious ceremony. But there is little need to mourn. By the end of the novel, Cobra may have become an embodiment of Shiva, the elusive Hindu deity of destruction and creation: “His arms, swift propellers, shaking the world, a peevish god dances.” Sarduy's book defies specific meaning or single‐minded interpretation. It is a novel that embraces opposites. It takes the entire cosmos as its subject, adheres to mutilations and swift changes, and deals with the disintegration ??and rebirth of worlds. “A file of black zebras striped white” can be seen as “a file of white zebras striped black.” Ktazob, the godlike abortionist who performs Cobra's sex operation, “hides in the most visible, in the center of the center.” Sarduy disallows any satisfying permanence in his definition of humankind. “Neither word nor object,” man moves “in his own yellow world of sucessive circles.” Perhaps Sarduy is suggesting the ultimate mutability of all human landscapes. Sarduy's transvestite is almost as indefinable as Thomas Pynchon's heroine V.: both creatures hump through time and space to manufacture the illusion of history for themselves. A Cuban novelist living in Paris, Sarduy may be defining himself in terms of interior exile; existence, according to Pynchon and Sarduy, seems to be movement toward the inanimate, and the stylized props of a nightmare. Sarduy's syntax becomes the modulations of a scream, a bitter cry that is shaped and controlled by laughter and a sense of dread. Language is everything in Sarduy's hook. It has few contemporary counterparts. If anything, it resembles the dreamscapes of Rimbaud's “Illuminations,” but with a further twist: Sarduy's fictions are hallucinatory prose poems that melt into one another. It is the rightness of an image, the powerful beat of a sentence, that keep “Cobra” alive. His sentences surprise; the rhythms confound and startle us, and exhaust us, with a frightening beauty: “Beneath the striped halo of street lights, blue rectangle, the store windows frame fruit baskets full of apples, pastry bowls dripping honey, kitchen boys with starched white caps, iron ovens where, stuffed with almonds, surrounded by laurel wreaths, whole animals revolve.” (Starting with hints of a benign world, with halos and blue rectangles, and moving through an abundance of almonds, honey and fruit, Sarduy's sentence ends on a spit, with roasting animal flesh.) Sarduy is the master of wordscapes that dip, shake, and explode. But if “Cobra” is a magical juggling act, of image balancing dangerously upon image, the translation is as remarkable as the book itself. Suzanne Jill Levine has managed to snare Sarduy's sense of play, all his conundrums and fabulations, and a good many of his Spanish puns, with a gorgeous transference of rhythms from one language to another. Of course “Cobra” isn't for everybody. It's an “aphasic opera,” a skitterish text devoted to lyrical noise, snaking music, and passionate silences. For those who desire fiction that is unsoiled, that has reasonable insights, a pleasant story, and identifiable characters, stay away from “Cobra.” It is crafty, slippery and poisonous. ■"
The Dilemma of the Republicans,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/10/archives/the-dilemma-of-the-republicans-minority-is-torn-by-centrists.html,"WASHINGTON, March 9 —For any minority party, the pressing question is always, “How do we assemble a majority?” It has vexed the Republicans since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt, occasionally producing bitter battles between the conservative purists and the base‐broadeners (Taft vs. Eisenhower in 1952, Goldwater vs. Rockefeller in 1964). News Analysis A similar schism seems to be developing now, as the party struggles with the bleak reality shown in its own polls: Only 18 per cent of the voters consider themselves Republicans. As Senator Robert Dole of Kansas remarked last week, the party is “in worse shape than it has ever been before in its history.” There is no agreement either on the cause of the party's time of troubles or on the proper remedy, and the disagreements have become more and more evident at a series of gatherings in and near Washington this winter. How to Form Majority If only we would stick to principles, argue the conservatives, we would quickly put together a majority; it's the trimming and the pragmatism of the Nixons and the Fords that's gotten us in trouble. No, no, reply the moderates; you can't read anybody out of the party; you have to attract new adherents by sticking close to the center and making room for people on the left wing as well as the right; we need a broader base. The argument takes many forms. Last week, in four days of Republican meetings here, it arose first in a debate about delegate‐selection reforms. (After a virtual tie vote, the moderates gave in and backed a compromise that severely weakened the proposed reform). And it arose again in a series of speeches by party leaders, with President Ford, Vice President Rockefeller and a series of Senators urging a heterogenous party (“open door” was the code phrase) and former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California urging purity. There are evident problems with both theories. The conservatives, for example, insist that major public opinion polls show a conservative majority in the country. But they fail to mention that the same polls show that that majority holds up only on social questions—abortion, gun control and the like. On economic questions, many of the self‐styled “conservatives” respond a great deal like New Deal Democrats. Thus, the conservative majority tends to come apart on an issue like wage and price controls, with the Reaganites bitterly opposed and the followers of Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in favor. (Interestingly, the Democrats have the opposite problem: The liberal majority they try to assemble is solid on economic questions but shaky on social questions.) So there is no guarantee that a rigorous conservative would do much better at the polls in November, 1976, than did Barry Goldwater in November, 1964. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that talk about open doors and broad bases will attract dissident Democrats or independents, especially in a time of widespread disillusionment about all political parties. Clearly, people walk through doorways only when there is something on the other side. What happens as a result of all the debate depends in the first instance on the conservatives, now that Mr. Ford has made it evident that he is not going to be stampeded into some symbolic action (such as jettisoning Mr. Rockefeller) to appease them. Leaning to Third Party One group of conservatives, dominated by theorists and publicists and adherents of conservative organizations, wants to press for a third party. They dominated the recent conservative conference here, which led to the formation of a Committee for Conservative Alternatives, headed by Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina. It is now exploring how to get a third party on 50 state ballots. Most of the professionals consider this more a pressure tactic than a probability. Clarke Reed, the conservative Mississippi party chairman, calls a third‐party candidacy by anyone of significance “a ten‐million‐to‐one shot at best.” Unless, of course, Governor Wallace should follow that route. A second conservative group, 28 officeholders and others, met in Eastern Maryland a week ago and agreed to keep an eye on President Ford to prevent a “fait accompli”—meaning a Rockefeller anointment—if Mr. Ford does not run. Out of this group and its allies could emerge a Reagan battle with Mr. Rockefeller, or a Reagan challenge to the President if he lives up to his increasingly firm, but still not quite accepted, declarations that he will seek another term. Wary of Challenge Few Republican politicians doubt that Mr. Reagan could have the nomination if Mr. Ford pulled out, given the traditional conservative control of Republican conventions. But equally few think that such control would be enough to enable him to take the nomination away from the President if Mr. Ford fought for it. Republicans, by and large, are uncomfortable with challenges to incumbents of their party. The politicians could be wrong of course; they said the same thing about a Democrat's challenging Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. And the course of events will be influenced by Mr. Reagan's decision, due some time next fall about his own plans. He comes close to being the indispensable man for a conservative challenge within the Republican party. But for the moment, at least, Mr. Ford appears to be in command. For all his low standing in the polls, he is popular within the party, as his reception at the Republican Leadership Conference on Friday night demonstrated, and he has his hands on the levers of power. If he chooses to press on, it looks as if the Republicans will try to rebound from their 1974 disasters by the base‐broadening route, not by purging themselves of moderate heresy."
What's With Boston?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/10/archives/whats-with-boston.html,"BOSTON — Strolling down State Street toward the waterfront the other evening, I was accosted by a man in Colonial dress, out of breath, obviously distressed. “Did you see any other guys in Colonial outfits come this way?” he wanted to know. I had never spoken to anybody in a three‐cornered that before, and shook my head, dumbly; he hurried on, murmuring, “They'll kill me for being late.”  A block farther on, a parade passed by, with people three‐cornered hats predominating; perhaps the lone patriot had been for them, or for another event celebrating the onrushing Bicentermial. “Liberty is dead!” was one of the signs, and a Coffin, presumably containg Liberty, was carried along as in olden times. This group was complaining about involuntary busing of schoolchildren to achieve racial balance equating a Federal judge here with George III. What's happening in Boston? Only a few weeks ago the nation's attention was riveted on that city for the abortion‐manslaughter trial of Dr. Kenneth Edelin. His conviction on century‐old grave‐robbing law—dredged up to circumvent the legality of the operation he was performing—his convinced many Americans that Bostan has suddenly become a hotbed of right‐wing reaction. Prolonged demonstration against racial integration, sucessful prosecutions against abortion—can all this be happening in the capital city of the only state that voted for George McGovern for President with one of its two leading newspapers the most aggressively liberal in the nation, in the area that boasts the most prestigious seats of learning in the United States, where a Kennedy can do no wrong? The seeming paradox can be explained in terms of race, politics and social tradition. Boston is not a homogenized community, with franchised retail outlets spreading blandmanship, but an uneasy agglomeration of distinct, neighborhoods: Irish here, Italians there , blacks in another place, and intellectuals in a ghetto all their own. Racial “resentment mixes with class resentment to oppose busing. Whites do not want their children transported away from local schools to worse schools in black areas, and bitterly resent being called bigots by wealthier whites who avoid the problem in suburbs. Using education to force integration, of course, leads to heightened racial tension, an undercurrent of which was present in the abortion trial. Dr. Edelin may appear white on national television, but he is a black, and the white jury knew it. A political connection also exists between abortion and busing. A challenge to the local District Attorney was mounted late last year by one of the fiercest anti‐busing school board members, and the D.A.—who draws his primary support from the same constituency—needed an issue of his own to shore up his strength. The most pervasive connection between the two issues is the resistance of most people at the local level to rapid social, change demanded at the national level. Not so long ago, Boston was the proudest bastion of prudery; stiff‐necked Brahmins joined with stern middle‐class moralists in common cause, and to be “banned in Boston” was a boost to book of ticket sales in less staid areas of the country. ESSAY It ought not to be so surprising, then for Boston to try to ban the breakdown of neighborhood tradition, or to ban the breakdown of moral tradition that many see in legalized abortion. Change has come too fast and wants to go too far for the majority, ,and the reaction is severe. The “reasonables” here, caught in the middle, know that forced busing is the worst means to a good end, but also admit that desegregation was blocked for a decade by political demagogues. And many Catholics who regard abortion as nothing short of murder feel that Dr. Edelin was given a raw deal, having been tried on an archaic law after a curious jury selection process that permits the defense no challenge for bias. Now Boston is in the period of the reaction to the reaction. If opposing forces pushing for fast‐change or nochange demand full satisfaction on both issues, one or the other may win—but at an enormous social and political cost. A line has to be drawn between legitimate desegregation and the misuse of the school system to force integration; some compromise has to be worked out between giving a pregnant woman the freedom to abort and giving a viable fetus the freedom to be born. The point is, no “side” can win; no unanimous Supreme Court decision can ring through the land, no universally satisfying solution can be found. What's happening in Boston? The kind of reaction that might soon take place in the next targets of desegregation law suit: the major cities of Texas and Ohio. That is why the reaction to the reaction in Boston is so important; the reasonables will never be heroes but in their compromises lie the hopes of men in cities which were built long after patriots in three‐cornered hats started a revolution in Boston."
CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON ABORTION URGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/11/archives/constitutional-ban-on-abortion-urged.html,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (UPI)—Two Republican Senators called today for a constitutional amendment banning abortion and possibly prohibiting some birth control methods. Senators Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and James L. Buckley, RepublicanConservative of New York, described their proposed amendments before a judiciary subcommittee headed by Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana. Mr. Buckley's proposal would extend Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment protections of due process and equal protection to unborn children “at every stage of their biological development.” Mr. Helms, defining the beginning of life as the “moment of fertilization,” would have Congress place the basic right to life in the Constitution, then allow the states to implement it as they saw fit."
BOLIVIANS DENOUNCE U.S. BIRTH‐CURB PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/12/archives/bolivians-denounce-us-birthcurb-plan.html,"LA PAZ, Bolivia, March 11 (AP) — The Roman Catholic Church charged today that the United States Agency for International Development was conducting “modern genocide” in Bolivia through birth‐control programs. Its 22 bishops, in a pastoral letter, called on the Government to “beat back international pressures.” The Government has opposed such programs. It said “increased use of contraceptives, sterilizations, legalized abortion and economic punishment of large families” was being planned, with most of the funds from an $8‐million American program for rural areas to be spent on birth control. The document said birth‐control programs “are an attempt to do away with the future of the poor nations, depriving them of the element vital for survival: their population.” The bishops said that “those programs, cloaked in an apparent altruistic desire to reduce the population so that people can reach a higher standard of living, cover selfish aims of international domination and tend to preserve the welfare of the developed countries.”"
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/13/archives/new-jersey-briefs-crabiel-to-get-juryless-trial.html,"Judge John A. Ackerman of Superior Court in Newark granted a request by J. Edward Crâbiel, the New Jersey Secretary of State, to stand trial before him without a jury. Mr. Crabiel is accused of rigging highway construction bids. In briefs supporting the appeal, Mr. Crabiel's lawyers contend that widespread pretrial publicity precluded a fair trial before a jury and that a judge would be more inclined to weigh only the facts of the case. The request by Mr. Crabiel, who is on leave from his state post, and his co‐defendants was made, according to officials close to the defense, because defense lawyers assume that no prominent public official in New Jersey can get a fair trial before a jury in the wake of recent political scandals in the state. Judge Ackerman approved the request in a brief order at a pretrial hearing, although expressed reservations in principle toward juryless trials. The trial is to begin April 7. Air Pollution Fine Total Declines The State Department of Environmental Protection announced that it had collected $184,000 in fines from air polluters in 1974 compared with $768,000 in 1973. The department contended that the drop in the total fines reflected greater compliance by industry in controlling pollution. Thomas Leonard, chief enforcement officer of the State Air Pollution Control Bureau, said, “we've taken care of our biggest polluters and most of our known polluters.” He asserted that in 1973 the record size of the imposed fines was attributable in a large part to four major cases in which fines ranged from $60,000 to $250,000. Abortion Study Panel Named Governor Byrne has asked the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey to form a commission to make recommendations about the state's role in regulating abortions. “The study group will not address itself to the social or moral issues of abortion,” said Dr. Stanley S. Bergen, the college's president. “It's deliberations and subsequent recommendations will provide the basis for legislation or regulations that will assure proper monitoring of New Jersey abortion facilities and the quality of services offered.” Dr. Bergen will be the commission's chairman. The other members will be Dr. Caterina A. Gregori, assistant director of the obstetrics and gynecology department at St. Barnabas Medical Center; Jane Zuckerman, assistant professor of law at Rutgers Law School; Dr. Irwin Perr, professor of psychiatry and community medicine at the college of medicine; Harold Kaminetzky, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the college, and Dr. Watson Neiman, deputy state health commissioner. Princeton U.

Report on Human Fetal Studies Finds Work Saved Thousands,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/15/archives/report-on-human-fetal-studies-finds-work-saved-thousands-research.html,"BETHESDA, Md., March 14—Research involving the human fetus has helped save thousands of lives that would have been lost had such research been banned decades ago, according to a study made public today. The study was none on contract for a national commission that is to make recommendations by May 1 defining the circumstances, if any, under which fetal research may be conducted or supported by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Pending the commission's report, a temporary ban is in effect. Although the ban is limited in scope, specialists say it Chas stifled most such research in the United States. Recently, fetal research has become a subject of much controversy. Some persons have attacked it on ethical grounds. Others have defended such research as important to medical progress. There has been a lack, however, of rigorous studies defining its role in past medical advances and the degree to which such advances would have been hampered without such research. The study made public today analysed the origins of four major developments in medicine of the last several decades and concluded that delays costing many thousands of lives would have been the probable price for total abstention from fetal research. Research on Animals Research on animals would not have been a totally satisfactory substitute, the report said. In one such development, treatment of Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn, the report said progress would have been immeasurably delayed. “This would have resulted in the stillbirth of approximately 450,000 fetuses over the period from 1930 to 1975,” the report said. “Even more devastating,” the report continued, “would be the medical, social and economic impace that would have resulted from the birth of tens of thousands of brain‐damaged individuals over this period.” Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn results from an incompatibility of blood types between the mother and the fetus in which the mother forms antibodies against the fetal red blood cells and destroys them. It usually does not affect a woman's first child but may be fatal or severely damaging to babies she bears thereafter. The problem arises when the woman's blood is Rh negative and her baby is Rh positive. It is estimated that 12 per cent of American couples potentially face the risk of this kind of problem. Since 1968 a vaccine has been available to prevent the Rh negative mother from becoming sensitized to her Rh positive baby's blood. Several years before that, medical scientists demonstrated that they could save some imperiled babies by transfusions while the fetus was still in the womb. The analysis of the origins of these treatments and other measures to deal with the same problem concluded that research concerning the fetus was a highly important factor. The analytic study was done by Battelle Columbus Laboratories, a private research institute in Columbus, Ohio, on contract for the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission is meeting today and tomorrow at the National Institutes of Health here. The four major medical developments anaylzed were chosen by the commission members. In addition to the problem of the Rh disease, the subjects studied were the development of vaccine against rubella, a virus infection; respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn, and amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is a technique for sampling fetus cells from the fluid surrounding the fetus in the womb, It was first tried 90 years ago, the report said, and even today no adequate “animal model” for this procedure has been developed. Many important uses have been developed for amniocentesis, primarily in diagnosis of fetal disorders and fetal distress. In recent years, its availability has allowed parents, by opting for abortion, to avoid the birth of babies doomed to some grave hereditary afflictions. Knowledge gained through amniocentesis has also been important in dealing with the three medical problems that were analyzed in the Battelle study. The inference of the report was that a ban on fetal research, if in force during the last 90 years, would have precluded human amniocentesis and the benefits it has produced. Rubella infection in a woman early in her pregnancy carries a serious risk of mental retardation, birth defects and possible death in her fetus. The report cited several ways in which modern safe use of rubella vaccine depended importantly on information developed through research that involved the human fetus or fetal tissue. Similar evidence was cited concerning respiratory distress syndrome a condition in which a newborn premature baby is in severe danger because its lung development has been incomplete in some respects."
Impact of Boston Verdict on Abortions Appears Slight,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/16/archives/impact-of-boston-verdict-on-abortions-appears-slight.html,"A few American medical centers have stopped performing second‐trimester abortions and many other hospitals are deliberating policy changes while adopting a wait‐and‐see attitude following the manslaughter conviction of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin in the death of a fetus after a legal abortion. But because most doctor: are convinced that a higher court will overturn the Bostor jury's verdict—Dr. Edelin war sentenced to a year's probation —most of the small number of hospitals that performed abortions between the 12th and the 24th week before the Edelin decision Feb. 15 are apparently continuing to do so after the customary consultations with other doctors. The reluctance of some hospital officials and doctors to comment about what they will or will not do about changes in policy underscores the cautious tone found in interviews with scores of health workers around the country. “The dots are afraid of becoming a test case,” said Bob Wilson, administrator of the Hinds County General Hospital in Jackson, Miss., where abortions are done infrequently. ‘A Horrible Position’ However, Dr. Ezra C. Davidson of the Martin Luther King Hospital in Los Angeles said “The obstetrician is caught in a horrible position as a result of this case because on one hand, it tells him that he must provide lots of life‐support systems for the fetus while on the other hand, all his medical training tells him that the fetus of less than 26 weeks is too immature to survive, and if it does, it probably will be brain‐damaged or have other abnormalities. Obstetricians don't want to get involved in this paradox in the delivery 300M. Doctors are particularly concerned about cases involving women that are very young, poor, mentally ill or those with genetic disorders, who could be most affected if secondtrimester abortions are widely curtailed, and about the possibility of a rise in back‐alley abortions. Discussion of the Edelin case has heightened Americans' appreciation of the complexities involved in a woman's decision to have an abortion and the diverse nature of attitudes toward the ethics of certain medical practices. Also, it has provided insights into how the practice of abortion affects all classes of society. The Young Cited Mrs. Dora Stevens, a social, worker at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said of those women requesting secondtrimester abortions: “We see the very young who are afraid of telling their parents until it becomes evident. Then there are the disturbed, psychotic or mentally ill who cannot cope with their pregnancy once it becomes apparent.” Judge John F. Dooling Jr. recently ruled in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that doctors at Nassau County Medical Center, who limited abortions to pregnancies in the first 12 weeks as a direct result of the Edelin decision, were justified in that policy decision because of fear of criminal prosecution for performing legal abortions in the second trimester. Judge Dooling ordered a trial in the case of three women who sued to force the Nassau center to rescind its restriction so they could have secondtrimester abortions. One of the women, an 18‐year‐old mother of two who is separated from her husband and living on welfare in Holtsvine, N.Y., told the court: “I am desperate. I cannot continue this pregnancy. It is a struggle living on the small amount of money welfare gives me and my children.” Delay Described A second woman said in an affidavit that though she had asked for an abortion during her ninth week of pregnancy, the Nassau doctors would not perform it because she was beyond 12 weeks by the time her appointment was honored. Judge Dooling expressed concern over the lack of reliable statistics on how many fetuses had been born alive after the first trimester. He also expressed dissatisfaction with the State Attorney General office's unwillingness to render an opinion on Whether homicide charges would be brought against doctors involved in live births. The judge's 19‐page ruling asserted that the New York health law was unclear about the issue of viability. Judge Dooling appointed John Short, head of the Mid‐Island Right to Life Committee, as legal guardian for “the class of live births involved” in the Nassau case. The judge noted that District Attorney Dennis Dillion of Nassau was investigating charges from the Long Island Right to Life coalition that doctors had allowed a live‐born fetus to go without care for 10 hours until it died at the center. Center officials have denied the allegation, stating that fetuses that showed signs of life after abortions “were rushed to the neo‐natal intensive care unit and were given every medical attention deemed necessary to sustain life outside the uterus.” “These uncertainties and the pending investigations by the District Attorney's office justify apprehension on the part of physicians asked to perform lawful abortional acts in the second trimester,” the judge said. “They may properly consider the risk that even when they detect no vital signs in the born fetus, other observers of the procedure, silent during the procedure, may later assert that vital signs were manifestly present.” Whatever the decision, “this case will certainly end in the United States Supreme Court,” the judge said. He added: “How we resolve these questions I don't know. We just blunder ahead as best we can.” Since the United States Supreme Court's decision in January, 1973, rendering most state abortion laws invalid, 31 states have passed at least 57 new laws relating to the regulation of abortion, according to the Family Planning—Population Reporter published by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Focus of Concern The Edelin verdict has not had any effect on laws implementing the court's ruling that during the first trimester the abortion decision must be left solely to the woman and her physician. The focus of concern is the second trimester when abortions are considered riskier and where the Court allowed states to regulate the type of facility in which abortions might be performed and licensing procedures for both the facility and medical personnel., Precise figures tabulating by trimester the number of abortions done in the United States are mostly lacking. In New York City, 85 per cent of the one million abortions done since 1970 were first trimester, 14 per cent second trimester, and one per cent third‐trimester procedures. In 1971 and 1972, when more than 200,000 abortions were done each year, about twothirds of those were nonresidents of New York City. However, last year, as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision, 70 per cent of the 122,639 abortions done in New York City were on city residents. The skills needed for secondtrimester abortions limit these abortions to a relatively small number of hospitals to which women are referred from other hospitals in the same city or from rural areas. Yet, second‐trimester abortions have rarely been done in some states despite the Supreme Court's ruling. Dr. John Hosmer of the Chesire Hospital in Keene, N.H., said that most of the state's obstetricians “kind of agreed that we just wouldn't do any second‐trimester abortions” because of complications associated with the procedure at that stage of pregnancy. Limits Set Even before Dr. Edelin's trial, the Cullen Women's Center in Houston, among other institutions, did second trimester abortions only in pregnancies of up to 20 weeks. Marcy Crowe, Cullen administrator, said the limit had been set “for reasons Edelin has run into—we wanted to avoid the problem of the chance of a live fetus.” Though Dr. Edelin's case received the widest publicity, he was not the first doctor to face charges for doing a legal abortion after the Supreme Court decision. Last November, a coroner's jury in Pittsburgh exonerated Dr. Leonard Laufle of West Penn Hospital of allegations that a 27‐week‐old fetus had been allowed to die on a hospital table after surviving an abortion. After seven days of testimony and one hour of deliberation, an Allegheny County jury ruled that because the child was stillborn, there was no homicide or criminal negligence. After Dr. Laufle's legal tangle, however, doctors at West Penn, one of Pittsburgh's largest abortion centers cut back on the procedure. Then just after Dr. Edelin's verdict was announced, West Penn doctors announced that they would do no more abortions after the third month of pregnancy unless the mother's health was endangered. Last week, security guards restrained 50 women representing the National Organization of Women from meeting with West Penn officials. Decision Assailed Deborah Erb, a spokesman for NOW, contended that the hospital's decision was in conflict with the Supreme Court's ruling. Mrs. Erb said the hospital's interest in limiting abortions was “to protect itself from malpractice suits at the expense of those women whose health care they have chosen to ignore.” In Bakersfield, Calif., in October, 1973, Dr. Xavier Hall Ramirez was found not guilty of charges that he had solicited to commit murder after he ordered that oxygen be withheld from a 4‐pound, 8‐ounce fetus that had survived an abortion attempt. Robert McCoy, director of the Meadowbrook Women's Clinic in St. Louis Park, Minn., said that we used to send women between 20 and 24 weeks' pregnant to the University of Wisconsin Hospital, which was the only hospital in the Midwest that would accept such referrals. A spokesman said that as a consequence of the Edelin case, the Madison hospital would no longer accept women fort abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. At the Hutzel Hospital in Detroit, where abortions had been done until the 20th week a 16‐week limit was imposed after the Edelin decision. It was the “major factor,” Dr. Robert E. Mack, the hospital's president said, adding: “Obviously, the conviction puts our staff in jeopardy.” One Doctor Protests However, at least one Hutzel obstetrician was apparently willing to take such a risk. When Dr. Tommy Evans, the hospital's chief obstetrician and head of Wayne State's Depart. ment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, learned about Dr. Mack's decision on his return from a trip, he urged a resumption of the 20‐week limit. But because the decision had been announced publicly, doctors decided at a Hutzel staff meeting to stay with the 16‐week limit. However, Dr. Clark Hinkley, a Houston obstetrician, called the Edelin decision “a tempest in a teapot.” “I think it was a biased state and biased jury and I feel the decision will be reversed,” Dr. Hinckley said. When Robert Blough laid he brought the Edelin matter up at an executive committee meeting of the Kinks County Medical Society in Seattle, “members felt it was not worth talking about.” But Dr. Davidson of the King Hospital in Los Angeles said: “This decision will have an over‐all adverse effect for some women, although the effect will be difficult to document. The changes won't be obvious or reflected in statistics and/or changes in rules and regulations. ‘Denied a Service’ “Physicians in hospitals are very subtle. They simply won't do abortions by hysterotomy as a back‐up for other methods of second‐trimester abortions. This will mean that many patients will be denied a service that they desperately need.” Dr. Davidson said that poor patients might be particularly hard hit by, the Edelin decision: “The poor will still have the same rights as a wealthy person to a safe, legal abortion,” he said, “but they won't be able to exercise these rights because the institutions that serve them will become more restrictive. Poor people might have to resort to back‐alley abortion again, which raises another set of ethical questions and questions about due process. Dr. Davidson's observations were supported by experience at the Detroit Memorial Hospital, one of the few institutions that has tabulated statistics on who gets second‐trimester abortions. Of 413 second‐trimester abortions at Detroit Memorial, 178 were performed on women 18 years old and under; 162 on women aged 19 to 25; 59 on women aged 26 to 35; 14 on women aged 36 to 45. About half the women were on Medicaid. Though abortions under such conditions are often labeled “social” to distinguish them from those done for specific medical considerations, Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, head obstetrician at the Boston Hospital for Womem, said, “Social reasons can have an impact on medicine and they can be quite compelling.” Dr. Ryan, who is also chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Harvard, observed that part of the problem reflected public misunderstanding of the nature of abortion practice. “The idea is that someone just waltzes in and says I want an abortion,” he said. “You know, things just don't happen that way in real life. What you see is a 12 or, 13 year old child that's frightened to death, for instance, with tremendous conflict between parents and child. There's tremendous pressure on a young child with a whole life ahead of her. Do you want to call it social because she's pregnant out‐of‐wedlock and she's a teen‐ager? Or do you want to call it medical? What's the dividing line? “I just don't think that the people dealing with this do so in terms of black and white. You don't know what kinds of agony and concern goes through the individual coming in seeking an abortion. “We advise patients that a stillbirth certificate has to be filled out and that if a baby is born alive for any reason, it goes to the nursery. Also, we advise that the patient must make arrangements for appropriate interment after the abortion because by law the fetus has to be buried or cremated.” Bill Seeks Election Holiday WASHINGTON, March 15 (AP)—Representative William F. Walsh, Republican of Upstate New York, has introduced a bill that would add Federal elections to the list of national holidays. Noting that in the last Congressional election only 44.7 per cent of the eligible voters voted, Mr. Walsh said that making election day a holiday would make it easier for voters to get to the polls."
"Behind the marble,",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/16/archives/behind-the-marble-beneath-the-robes-supreme-court.html,"WASHINGTON. It was Saturday, and the United States Supreme Court, like the rest of Washington's public buildings, looked lonely and deserted. But inside, five of the Justices were hard at work. A sixth had interrupted his routine to visit with a friend from out of town. The fire in the Justice's chambers crackled warmly as the two men talked. The visitor ventured the opinion that the Court's biggest case of that year would be a capital‐punishment decision and asked if the Justice had made up his mind yet. The Justice alan't answer. The visitor, suacienty aware that he had asked an improper question, started to apologize. But his voice caught in his throat at the sight of his old friend. The Justice was slumped ashen‐faced in his chair, eyes closed; his words seemed almost a whisper. “My God, all those lives.” The visitor was dismayed. He quickly changed the subject. But the moment of good cheer was gone. The Justice was preoccupied. There is probably no more secret society in America than the Supreme Court. Its nine Justices are among the most powerful, yet least visible, men in the United States. It is unheard‐of for a Justice to reveal anything specific about the Court's case work; law clerks, too, are sworn to secrecy. The Court's written decisions are supposed to speak for themselves. It is the least accountable branch of Government, and in the common under standing, its Justices are robed symbols of seriousness, wisdom and the majesty of the law. And yet to those who are familiar with the Court's daily functioning, the Justices are also people—nine men who work terribly hard and are sometimes very smart, men who constantly fight to overcome their own prejudices and backgrounds. men who sometimes win that battle and sometimes lose it, men who agonize, strain and manipulate to reach joint conclusions, and sometimes change their minds. “Judicial decision‐making,” wrote a former Supreme Court law clerk in a recent Harvard Law Review, “involves, at bottom, a choice between competing values by fallible, pragmatic and at times nonrational men engaged in a highly complex process in a very human setting.” What follows is an attempt to lift the Court's curtain of secrecy a bit so that the Justices and their work may be better understood, It does not pretend to be a definitive picture; rather, it is one reporter's attempt to put together in one place information gleaned from scores of interviews With Supreme Court law clerks, friends of the Justices, law professors, attorneys who practice regularly before the Court, and the Justices themselves. All of the facts reported here have been obtained from or yetiLed by at least two of these sources. The basic event in the Court's decision‐making process is a weekly conference, usually scheduled for Wednesday afternoon and all day Friday, at which cases are discussed. On Friday, the Justices arrive punctually at 9:30 A.M. Some, like William H. Rehnquist and Potter Stewart, are “night people” who look solemn‐faced as they fight the morning doldrums. Others, like Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who rises each morning at 5:30, cheerful and wide awake. In the center of the oakpaneled room is a massive mahogany table, surrounded by nine high‐backed chairs and about 25 carts. The carts, wheeled in from each Justice's office before the conference, are loaded with briefs, transscripts, memos from clerks, notebooks — everything the Justice thinks he will need for every case that may come up during the‐ exhausting all‐day session. The Justices pour themselves coffee from a silver urn. Then they shake hands, as has been the custom since 1888, and sit down to do The first function of the conference might be called deciding to decide. Each year roughly 5,000 cases come before the Court. The Justices sift through these cases and decide which ones are worthy. of their full consideration. Last year, for example, the Justices agreed to hear only 170 cases. Copies of each case go to every Justice. Justice Brennan is the only one of the nine men who reads virtually all the petitions asking for review. Three other Justices share this chore to varying extents with their three law clerks and have their clerks write summarizing memos. Still others—the four Nixon appointees plus Justice Bryon R. White—have in recent years created a rotating pool of their law clerks to write summary memos. Each Justice then makes an independent, tentative judgment as to whether the case provides a substantial Federal question that is ready to be resolved the nation's highest court. If a Justice thinks a case presents a substantial Federal question, he asks that it be put on the conference list for discussion. With the exception of a small fraction of cases that fall into a technical legal category, no case is put on the conference list unless at least one Justice requests that it be considered. The vast majority of cases, having aroused no Justice's interest, automatically go on what is known as “the dead list” and are denied further consideration. Once on the conference list, a case faces an even bigger hurdle, for it takes the votes of four Justices to grant it review. The votes to grant review are not always routine or trivial, and the arguing over them may turn out to be highly significant, as it was when the Court was asked to rule on whether President Nixon could refuse to release his tapes to those investigating his subordinates. When the case came to the Court, the legal question was whether the Justices should leapfrog the appeals process to expedite a crucial question. Justice Stewart is reported to have argued forcefully that it was up to the judiciary to settle quickly an issue that was so terribly paralyzing the other institutions of Government and so deeply affecting the national well‐being. Stewart was joined by Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William O. Douglas, and soon they had won over two more of their colleagues, leaving Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun and Justice White to dissent, in a vote that until now had been kept secret. (Justice Rehnquist had disqualified himself from the case.) This procedural vote, coming when it did, was pivotal in forcing the rapid resolution of Watergate and the impeachment process. Occasionally, when there are not enough votes to grant review, one Justice will write a dissent from the refusal to hear the case. And here the game gets really interesting, for it is not unusual for the dissent to be so persuasive that the other Justices change their minds. The briefs in a case are often so poor that the Justice's dissent provides the only available serious presentation of the case. For example, in 1968 the Justices voted not to hear the case of Representative Adam Clayton Powell who claimed he had been unconstitutionally barred from his seat in Congress. Powell had lost his case in the lower courts, and there were strong feelings on the Supreme Court that to grant review of the case might involve the Court in a potentially serious clash with Congress. But Justice Douglas disagreed and wrote a dissent that persuaded the Court to take the case. The Douglas dissent, of course, has never been made public (as it would have been had the Court held to its original position) for seven months later, the Justices overruled the lower court by a vote of 7 to 1. This kind of persuasive dissent is not seen much these days at the Court. According to Court sources, the liberal Justices have an “unwritten agreement” to try to keep many cases out of the hands of the Court so long as the conservatives have the fivevote majority needed to carry a decision. Thus, for example, if an important First Amendment case comes up on appeal, the liberals will vote not to hear it—even if it involves what they consider a horrendous lower ‐ court decision‐for fear a conservative majority would result in a Supreme Court decision restricting First Amendment rights. It is better to save final resolution of the issue for another day and a more liberal Court, they reason. In any event, once the Court agrees to hear a case, it is scheduled for oral arguments some months later. In the interim, lawyers for both sides file lengthy written briefs—usually 60 to 80 pages long—arguing the case. Sometimes as many as 10 or 20 other “friend of the court” briefs are filed by other parties who claim an interest in the case. Finally, the day for oral argument comes. Each side generally has a half‐hour to make its points. The Justices pepper the attorneys with questions. Oral argument is like verbal fencing; at its best, it can be a lawyer's virtuoso performance. At the end of the week, the following Friday, the case is back in conference, this time to be decided tentatively. Beginning with the Chief Justice and then in order of seniority, each Justice voices his views. They argue, cajole, persuade and finally they vote, this time with the junior Justice going first. Depending on the personalities and mood of the Justices, the conversation can get quite heated. It is said that in the days when Felix Frankfurter and Hugo Black were on the Court, the guards stationed outside the conference room could hear the Justices yelling at each other. The Burger Court, at least on the surface, is more civilized. Nobody except the Justices is permitted in the conference room. All the notes are taken by the Justices themselves. The Chief Justice, if he is on the majority side, assigns a Justice to write the opinion. The dissenters usually agree among themselves who will write their opinion. Then the negotiating begins. The Court has a tradition that up to the moment when an opinion is announced in public, any Justice can change his mind, and occasionally it takes less than an hour for a majority arranged in the conference to fall apart. “You can leave that conference room thinking you are to write the majority opinion, and one hour and one telephone call later you can be converting it into the minority opinion,” explains one Justice. Some capital‐punishment cases illustrate how the Court wrestles over a single subject in the face of shifting issues and events. In 1969, the Court had agreed to hear Maxwell v. Bishop, which presented a test of two key bap, ital‐punishment issues. the first question involved “splitverdict,” as opposed to “single‐verdict,” trials. In a singleverdict trial, the jury hears the evidence, then retires to determine both guilt and punishment. The defendant in the Maxwell case contended that this one‐step system forced him to choose between his right not to incriminate himself and his chance to explain his actions before he was sen‐. tented. He asserted that in capital cases the Constitution required a split‐verdict system under which the jury would first determine guilt and then return to hear the defendant's evidence in mitigation—insanity or intoxication, for example—before passing sentence. Defendant Maxwell's second argument was that he had been denied due process of law when the jurors condemned him to die without having been given detailed standards to guide them in their decision. The Supreme Court heard the case and, according to Court sources, voted 6 to 3 to require a split‐verdict system. Standardless discretion for juries was upheld. But the split verdict requirement would have knocked out death sentences in all but six states and required massive resentencings. The six‐man majority included Chief Justice Earl Warren, the conservative Justice John Harlan, and liberal Justices Abe Fortas, Thurgood Marshall, Brennan and Douglas. Justices Stewart, White and Black dissented. Justice Douglas was assigned to write the opinion. But he couldn't hold onto the majority. Later in the year, Fortas was forced to resign from the Court, leaving the case at a 5‐to‐3 vote. Then Justice Harlan said he wanted to write a concurring opinion, that he was not in complete agreement with the reasoning of the majority. In the process of writing his concurring opinHarlan changed his mind, deciding that the Constitution did not require split trials. The Court then found itself, locked in a 4‐4 tie and ordered the case reargued the following year, when it would have a full nine‐man court. The next year; however, Chief Justice Burger replaced Warren, and Blackmun replaced Fortas. Since Blackmun had served previously on a lower court that ruled on the Maxwell case, he was disqualified from ruling on it again. So, he Justices washed out the Maxwell case and took another set of cases that presented the same issues. The new cases, known as McGautha v. California, were finally decided in the spring of 1971. The High Court, by the same numerical vote of 6 to 3, this time rejected both the split‐verdict and the standards arguments. And Justice John Harlan wrote the opinion. Once the Court had disposed of these two issues, the problem the Justices faced was whether to grant a case testing the ultimate constitutionality of capital punishment in light of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against‐cruel and unusual punishment. In 1969, when they had voted to require split verdicts, the Justices had tentatively decided not to accept any more death cases for review. Warren, Black and Harlan firmly believed that the death penalty was constitutional. The majority who wanted split verdicts reasoned that they would make imposition of the death penalty as fair as possible and then leave the ultimate question of cruel and unusual punishment to be decided by another Court far, far in the future. By 1971, there were 600 people on death row, and the splitverdict ruling, as finally decided, would not require massive resentencings. The Justices were divided on the issue of whether to grant review of the ultimate capitalpunishment question. Justice Thurgood Marshall, at the time, voiced the private opinion that he, was the only vote on the Court for total abolition of the death penalty. And Justice Douglas proposed that the Court hear a rape case in which the death penalty was imposed. He reasoned that the Court could forbid capital punishment in cases where nobody was killed and the Court opinion at the same time could make clear that the death penalty was permissible in murder cases. But the Justices finally decided to grant review of a series of murder cases in which the death penalty was imposed. The Court was finally going to try to decide On June 29, 1972, the High Court ruled 5 to 4 that capital punishment as then administered in the United States was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Surprisingly, Justices White and Stewart, who had consistently voted to oppose a split‐verdict requirement, this time voted against the death penalty. And their reasoning was that it was imposed so arbitrarily as to be capricious. Of course, split verdicts and standards for imposition of the death penalty might have mitigated the arbitrary nature of the death penalty as it came to be administered. But, as a former Supreme Court law clerk observes, “the Court doesn't sit as a legislature—with a clean slate to write on. A legislature can do pretty much what it wants, but the Court has to take cases as they come up, and this sometimes forces the Justices to do things they wouldn't do if they had been able to choose the order in which issues arose.” The Court has reversed itself midstream on other issues as well. For example, in the 1967–68 term, the Court heard Shapiro v. Thompson, which tested the constitutionality of state residence requirements for welfare recipients. The Justices originally voted to uphold residence requirements, but the dissenting opinion changed a number of minds. The Court eventually struck down state residence requirements as unconstitutional. Another big switch occurred in Time Inc. v. Hill, in which Hill claimed that magazine photos of the Broadway play “Desperate Hours,” used to depict his family's ordeal at the hands of criminals, violated his constitutional rights. Hill was represented by attorney Richard Nixon, and the case pitted the right to privacy against freedom of the press. Initially, the Justices sided with Nixon, for the right to privacy. Justice Fortes, the man Nixon would later help push off the Court, was assigned to write the opinion. Justice Hugo Black, when he saw Fortas's opinion, said it was the worst First Amendment opinion he had seen in a dozen years. Indeed, Black was so outraged that he said it would take him all summer to write his dissent, that it would be the greatest dissent of his life. Black knew full well that no opinion is ever issued without its dissent and that any case not completed in a term is reargued the following year. Indeed, the Court did order the case reargued the following year. By then, Black had changed enough minds, and the case came out the opposite way, with Fortas writing the dissent. The shifts in votes are usually what most people assume them to be—changes of mind that result from the ongoing efforts of the Justices to apply their best judgment and knowledge of the law to their best understanding of subtle or ambiguous facts. But Court insiders say that judicial minds are sometimes changed for less elevated reasons. Most recently such criticism has focused on Chief Justice Burger. Critics of Burger cite his voting behavior in the Court's first big busing case—the 1971 Charlotte, N. C., case—in which he wrote the Court's unanimous decision ordering extensive busing to desegregate Southern schools. The first vote in conference was said to have been 6 to 3 against busing. In an unusual move, each Justice went back to his chambers and drafted an opinion. Justice Harlan's was said to have been the toughest pro‐busing opinion. Then several Justices had second thoughts and switched their votes. Soon the vote was 6 to 3 for busing, with Burger, Blackmun and Black dissenting. Eventually, the three capitulated — Black being the last holdout. And Burger, who had envisioned himself writing the opinion against bus ing, ended up writing the opinion for it and incorporating much of the language from the drafts of the more liberal Justices. Some who know the Chief Justice well contend that he changed his vote for personal and political reasons rather than reasons of legal judgment. At the time, they speculate, Burger did not wish to be a part of a small minority if that ctance would cause people to think of him as an automatic supporter of positions favored by then President Nixon. Critics point to other examples of Burger's fighting hard in conference to get a conservative position upheld, only to switch to the other side when he saw he had lost. This occurred, they say, in the Court's unanimous ruling in 1972 that the Government could not wiretap domestic radicals without first obtaining a court ‐ approved warrant—a stunning rebuff to the Nixon Administration. In that case, Bulger and Blackmun are said to have originally supported the view that no warrant was necessary, though they eventually switched their votes. And in the abortion case, Burger is said to have fought doggedly for the position that states have the right to prohibit abortions. But when it became clear that a majority would vote the other way, he voted with it. Burger has attracted further criticism in legal circles and, according to sources close to the Court, generated hostility among the other Justices because of the ways he has chosen to assign opinions. The power to assign the writing of opinions is tremendous. ly important, since the choice of an author often determines whether the opinion will be written on narrow or broad grounds, whether it will be cautious or sweeping. The assignments may also be made with an eye to enhancing the eventual impact of the decision — such as the national security wiretapping case, when Justice Douglas assigned the opinion to Lewis Powell. Powell, as a lawyer, had spoken out publicly for the Government's right to conduct warrantless wiretapping of domestic radicals. Thus, his judicial opinion to the contrary was perhaps doubly respected. Similarly, it was generally thought inside the Court that Chief Justice Burger would assign the Detroit busing opinion to Justice Stewart, who provided the swing vote giving the conservatives their first majority on busing. But Burger assigned the case to himself. The cases assigned to each Justice frequently determine whether that Justice feels happy and satisfied in his job. It is said that one of the ways Chief Justice Warren exerted such tremendous leadership over the Court was that he assigned the most tedious and difficult opinions to himself and tried to assign to other Justices the opinions he knew would interest them. Burger's assignments, however, have been criticized for the way they reflect personal or political conflict with other Justices. Law clerks and law professors say that his assignments have resulted in “the complete emasculation of Brennan and Stewart.” And it does appear that remarkably few “juicy” opinions—those that arise from big, controversial cases—are being assigned to them. There is perhaps some explanation for Brea. nan's getting fewer important opinions than he used to. He tends to be more in the liberal minority these days and agreed with Burger in only 45 per cent of the cases decided in the last term. But Stewart agreed with Burger 77 per cent of the time and he was assigned virtually nothing of major public importance. Indeed, a quick scanning of the record indicates that last term Burger assigned the most important cases to himself or to the two most junior Justices, Powell and Rehnquist, and to a lesser extent, to White. Burger's critics also charge that he has used his traditional power to assign opinions in ways that could be in terpreted as tactical. The abortion case, for example, was first decided in the 1971–72 Court term. The vote was 5 to 2, with Burger and White dissenting. (The vacancies re= suiting from the health‐related resignations of Justices Black and Harlan had not been filled). Burger, in disregard of tradition, assigned the opinion instead of letting the senior Justice in the majority—in this case, Douglas—do it. And he assigned the opinion to his old friend Blackmun, the most conservative Justice in the majority. Burger did this, his critics speculate, in the hope that Blackmun would write a very narrow opinion or perhaps even change his mind. Then, they assert, Burger persuaded Blackmun that the case should not be decided at all, that it should be reargued before a full, nineman Court the following year, when the vacancies were filled, a practice the court had followed on similar occasions. Blackmun agreed, and since the feelings of the man who is writing the opinion carry great weight, the full Court went along with the suggestion that the case should be reargued. But when Burger saw that the majority would hold and that Powell was joining it to make the majority 6 to 3, the Chief Justice changed his vote. The public saw only the final decision: 7 to 2, with Burger in favor of more liberal abortion laws and White and Rehnquist the only dissenters. The abortion case was the most flagrant example—so flagrant that it provoked Justice Douglas to write an in ternal protest memo—but according to those familiar with the Court's operations, it was not the first time Burger assigned a majority opinion when he was in the minority. Some Justices thought the assignments, which are posted a few days after the Friday conferences, were “just mistakes — inefficiency,” and since voting in these early deliberations may be tentative, and since the only records are those kept by the Justices themselves, the votes may in fact be subject to different interpretations. But others saw the apparently mistaken assignments as a part of a deliberate attempt by Burger to usurp traditional powers. Some Justices even believe that the Chief Justice has on occasion cast “phony votes” in conference—voting with the majority so that be can assign the opinion and then dissenting from it when it is finally written. Certainly other Courts and Chief Justices have had their personality difficulties. The late constitutional scholar Alexander Bickel, who was a law clerk when Fred Vinson was Chief Justice, once de, scribed that Court as “nine scorpions in a bottle.” But Vinson, whatever his shortcomings, was never accused of so serious a break with tradition as assigning opinions when he was in the minority. Burger, for his part, vehemently denies the critical allegations, calling them “utter absurdity.” He has told friends that anyone who says he ever made a mistaken assignment is “either stupid or lying.” However, these serious allegations about Burger began with the Justices themselves, not their clerks. Writing any sort of Supreme Court opinion—important or routine—is a iuug and arduous process. Each Justice runs his chambers differently. One Justice likens the Court to “nine sepafate law firms.” But each Justice has only three law clerks to assist him. Daniel J. Meador, who clerked for Justice Hugo Black in 1954, described in The Alabama Law Review the process of writing an opinion: “When ‘the Judge,’ as his clerks called him, is assigned a case for an opinion, he dives into reading the record and all the briefs. He absolutely masters the facts and the arguments. Then he moves into the relevant literature—cases, statutes, treatises and law reviews. The clerks often read along with him or dig out additional material and feed it to him. The issues will be discussed intermittently. After a while, Black will feel that he is ready to do a first draft.... The draft is then turned over to the clerks, and with all the confidence of youth, they work it over. Then the fun begins. The . . . clerks and Black gather around his large desk and start through the draft, word by word, line by line. This may go on for hours. When the Judge has an opinion in the mill, he does not drop it for anything else. The discussion often . . last[s] until midnight. Often revisions result; sometimes a clerk can get a word or comma accepted, but the substance and decision are never anything but Black's alone.” The Justices take their obligation to research opinions so seriously that in one area of law‐‐obscenity—the result has led to a lot of snickering both on and off the bench. Since 1957, the Court has tried repeatedly to define obscenity. The subject has be. come so familiar at the Supreme Court building that screening room has been set up in the basement for the Justices and their clerks to watch the dirty movies submitted as exhibits in obscenity cases. Justice Douglas never goes to the dirty movies because he thinks all expression —obscene or not—is protected by the First Amendment. And Chief Justice Burger rarely, if ever, goes because he is offended by the stuff. But everyone else shows up from time to time. Justice Blackmun watches in what clerks describe as “a near‐catatonic state.” Justice Marshall usually laughs his way through it all, occasionally nudging a colleague and wisecracking. Justice White rocks back and forth in a straight‐backed chair; on leawing, he has been heard to mutter about “filth.” Justice Powell, the aristocratic Virginian, was appalled by the first film he saw, “Without a Stitch,” which is quite mild by today's popular standards. Justice Brennan has gotten used to porn, though it is said that it took him more than a decade to overcome his upbringing on the subject. The late Justice Harlan used dutifully to attend the Court's porno flicks even though he was virtually blind; Justice Stewart would sit next to Harlan and narrate for him, explaining what was going on in each scene. Once every few minutes, Harlan would exclaim in his proper way, “By George, extraordinary!” The dirty movies have provided some of the Court's most funny, and most private, moments. For example, there was the time that the movie began with a psychiatrist telling the audience about the sad life of a nymphomaniac named Laura. The psychia, trist's voice continued to narrate while the film showed Laura engaged in various sex ual feats. At the end, the psychiatrist came back on the screen. By this time Justice Marshall was already out of his seat and walking toward the door. The psychiatrist lamented that Laura “is still not cured.” Marshall, hand on the door knob, declared, “And neither are you.” Then he opened the door, adding, “But I am,” and walked out. Most Justices begin their work on cases during the three‐month summer vacation that Congressmen annually complain about. Justice Powell, for example, reads through all the briefs in cases that have already been scheduled for argument in the coming term. He then dictates a lengthy memo on each case. In addition, he picks out 15 to 18 cases he thinks will be particularly important and has his clerks do extra research on them. Each case is assigned to a clerk. Then, during the Court term, shortly before the case is to be argued, Powell sits down with the clerk in charge of the case, and they discuss the issues presented. Once Powell is assigned an opinion, either he or his clerk roughs out a draft opinion. Who does the first draft depends on what the workload is in the office at the time. The opinion then goes back and forth between the Justice and his clerk like a shuttlecock, being worked and reworked, drafted and redrafted, until both are satisfied. Then the opinion is given to a second clerk, who goes over it like an editor, looking for mistakes, poor reasoning, unclear writing. Then the opinion is sent to the print shop the Court maintains inside the building. Then the third Powell clerk reads the opinion, acting as an editor‐proofreader. Once the opinion is written so that a Justice is satisfied with it, it is circulated to the other Justices. “You wait for the join memos from the peon pie who voted with you and pray,” one Justice says. And then the memos begin to fly. “It can be very difficult to get one Court opinion, even if people agree with the judgment,” explains one Justice. “To write a Court opinion you have to sew a big enough umbrella for five guys to get under, and that can require some pretty fancy sewing.” It's even harder to write a unanimous opinion, as evidenced in the Nixon tapes& case. By the time the tapes case was argued before the Court last July 9, the Justices had all done vast research on the issues at hand. Many had written lengthy memorandums on every conceivable position. Moreover, the Justices had completed all their work for the term and could devote full time to this single case. When the historic case went to conference, there was only one vote. According to Court sources, the Justices were in immediate agreement on all the basic issues. The Chief Justice assigned himself the opinion and received memorandums from each of his colleagues. However, when Burger circulated his first opinion draft, it met with a wholly negative response. For unknown reasons—some relating to its technical execution and some to its substance— the other Justices were completely dissatisfied with the opinion. The job then became one of getting Burger to accept language drafted by other Justices —principally Powell and Stewart. But the other Justices —sometimes alone and some times in groups of two or three produced new opinions almost every day. By a process of erosion, they finally got Burger to incorporate their language. The section that Burger is reported to have held to most strenuously, and successfully, acknowledges for the first time that there is a presumption of executive privilege in the Constitution. Negotiations in less important cases can be as tortured and involved. “You know, you work your brains out and you finally circulate something,” remarks one Justice. “Then one guy sends you a note saying, ‘I'll be happy to join with you in Smith v. Jones if you'll take out that paragraph on the top of page 5.’ And then you get a note from someone else saying he'll be happy to join you if you strengthen that paragraph at the top of page 5.” Or more frequently, one Justice requests a change, and another Justice objects to it when he sees the new draft of the opinion. In either event, negotiations then begin in earnest. Justice White is said to be a master at working the telephone. But some Justices feel it is improper to lobby their colleagues. And it is not unusual for a Justice to dispatch his clerks to “feel out the territory” among the clerks from another Justice's chambers. What happens when minor differences cannot be reconciled? As one former law clerk put it: “That's when you fudge it, and then the law professors complain that the Court doesn't write clear opinions. Or else you leave out the point altogether. And then the law professors complain that there is a step missing in the Court's logic.” Sometimes, notes one Justice, an opinion is circulated and someone has “a whole new concept he wants in, and if you've got only a five‐man majority, you have to listen to all suggestions very seriously or you might lose the whole thing.” (That problem was illustrated in Justice Blackmun's maiden opinion, Wyman v. James. He was severely criticized by many legal scholars because his opinion equated welfare with charity. In fact, this whole notion wasn't Blackmun's at all and was put in at the insistence of another Justice.) Each time a new draft of an opinion is circulated, all changes are marked in the margin with a black line. By the time a decision is announced, it has sometimes undergone as many as 10 drafts in a Justice's chambers and 17 or 18 more to satisfy other Justices. Each Justice writes between 13 and 18 opinions each year, plus nearly as many dissenting and concurring opinions. In addition, each Justice must review those thousands of cases that are appealed to the High Court each year in hopes of a hearing. So it is no wonder that most Justices work six or seven days a week, that Justice Brennan begins his work day with a walk at dawn, or that Justice Rehnquist doses his briefcase eac night at about midnight. Is the Court's workload too great for nine human beings to handle properly? Some believe that it is, and in fact the four Nixon appointees to the Court, led by chief Justice Burger, have protested lustily that the Court is overworked. A number of committees, one appointed by Burger, have recommended changes in the Court's structure to limit the number of cases the Court must review. But it is noteworthy that four of the more senior Justices — Douglas, Marshall, Brennan and Stewart—have spoken out against these proposals for change. Indeed, some Justices even object to Burger's hiring of additional administrative staff for the Court. They fear that enlarging the staff may make the Court into another Government bureaucracy. And if the alternative is for the Justices to cope with a superhuman workload, they declare, that is what the Justices will have to do. “Sure, it's hard and exhausting,” remarks one Justice, “but we weren't put here because we're lightweights.” Indeed, the Justices are deceptively ordinary looking people. As the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once observed, “We are very quiet here, but it is the quiet of a storm center.”■ ‘To write a Court opinion, you have to sew a big enough umbrella for five guys to get under, and that can require some pretty fancy sewing.’"
"In 1974, the Birth Rate Moved Up",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/16/archives/article-11-no-title-in-1974-the-birth-rate-moved-up.html,"The first Government statistics on population trends in 1974 provide bad news for advocates of zero population growth. The curve of births suddenly moved upward last year, while the curve of deaths moved equally suddenly downward. This year saw the lowest death rate in the nation's history. Only the new data on 1974 marriages and divorces provided any significant comfort for those who oppose population growth. Marriages declined significantly last year as compared with early years of the 1970's, while the number of divorces climbed sharply and approached the million mark. Births: Through last August, it looked as though 1974 was going to continue the 1970's trend of declining numbers of births each year. Then suddenly last September the number of live births exceeded those of a year earlier. The same thing happened in October, November and December. The result was that in 1974 the annual number of births was higher than that of a year earlier, reversing a trend that began five years ago. The absolute rise was relatively tiny—25,000 more babies born last year than in 1973 when the total was 3,141,000. But it was a change of trend in a period when the rising popularity of contraceptives and the universal legalization of abortions in this country had led many to expect that the steady fall in births since 1970 would continue, and perhaps decrease further. But in reporting the trend change, the National Center for Health Statistics of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare chose to emphasize a factor which will tend to increase births at least for the rest of the decade. The essence of the explanation by the department is not that the average woman is having more children, but that the number of women in the prime child‐bearing ages is rising rapidly because of birth trends in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. The number of women in the child bearing ages (officially taken as 15–44 years) rose 2 per cent between 1973 and 1974, and will rise 12 per cent more by 1980. This jump is particularly rapid among women aged 20–29 whose fertility rates are highest. Their number rose 3 per cent last year and will grow an additional 14 per cent by 1980. The Trouble With Prophecies Back in the 1960's, many demographers were predicting a baby boom for the 1970's, precisely because they knew there would be so many potential mothers available in prime child‐bearing ages. The demographers have had several years now in which their Prophecies have looked bad as births and birth rates have fallen. Now the new data suggest the old prophecies need to be taken out of storage and looked at again. A miniature baby boom could well be on the way, merely delayed. a few years by changes in the practice and law of contraception and abortion. Deaths: Equally striking was last year's decline in deaths. About 1,933,000 Americans died in 1974, 44,000 fewer than in 1973 and 31,000 fewer than in 1972. But because United States population recently has been increasing about 1,500,000 persons a year, the decline in death rates (deaths per thousand population) was startling to demographers. In 1974 there were only 9.1 deaths per thousand Americans, the lowest death rate in the nation's entire history. Moreover, there was almost a 7 per cent decline in infant mortality, another new record low rate: 16.5. deaths of babies 1 year old or less per each thousand babies born. Less than a decade ago, in 1965, the infant mortality rate was 50 per cent higher than it was in 1974. Marriages: There were 2,223,000 marriages last year, 54,000 fewer than in 1973. Taking population into account, last year's marriage rate—10.5 per thousand population—was somewhat lower than comparable figures for the 1970's, but still significantly higher than it was in much of the 1960's. The one clear trend evident in the historical data is that toward an older age at marriage; by 1973 half the new brides were 21 or older and half the new grooms were at least a month or two beyond their 23d birthdays. A 1974 extension, even slight, of that trend toward marriage at a later age would easily explain the drop in marriages last year, both absolutely and as a rate taking population into account. Divorces: Divorces continued their upward trend in 1974, reaching a total of 970,000 as against 913,000 in 1973. Divorces have roughly doubled since. 1965 when the number was 479,000. Clearly many factors are at work to produce this great jump in broken marriages. Changing social mores and changing expectations among husbands and wives are certainly involved in all this, but so, too, is the factthat the United States continues to have an ever more educated, more sophisticated and more affluent., population; that is, an ever increasing number of men and women who no longer are willing to accept unhappy marriages, but know about divorce and are able to resort to it when they wish."
Study Finds Premature Babies Are Surviving at Earlier Ages,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/16/archives/study-finds-premature-babies-are-surviving-at-earlier-ages.html,"BETHESDA, Md., March 15—Premature infants are surviving at earlier ages and lower birth weights than ever before, according to a study presented today to a national commission that is investigating research on the human fetus. The report indicated significant progress over the last 10 years in the ability of wellequipped centers with welltrained personnel to care for babies born in relatively extreme stages of prematurity. The data came from the United States and Canada, including figures from the Province of Quebec and the City of New York. The improvement appears to have been most marked for infants In the lower weight range and of an early gestational age. In New York, for example, there was a 68 per cent improvement from 1962 to 1971 in the survival rate of infants weighing less than 1,000 grams—a little more than two and one‐fifth pounds. On the other hand, the city's premature infant centers recorded no survivals of infants below 500 grams in that period. The figures for other regions studied were roughly comparable. Dr. Richard E. Behrman, who presented the study today attributed the improvements primarily to improved knowledge of how to care for premature infants and improved technology for doing so. Dr. Behrman is chairman of pediatrics at Columbia's College of physicians and surgeons. The co‐author of the report was Dr. Tove S. Rosen of the same institution. The study team had a large roster of consultants. Dr. Berkman said it was significant that the evidence showed that the increased survival of infants of low weight and gestational age was not accompanied by a higher rate of physical and mental handicaps. During the nineteenfifties, he said, pediatricians feared that increasing the ability to save the lives of very premature infants would mean an increase in the proportion of babies with s??vere handicaps among those who survived. This evidently has not happened, the report indicated. The evidence also shows, Dr. Berhman said, that babies of minority group parents, classified for medical reasons as “high risk,” have particularly been the beneficiaries of the trend toward increased survival. The report also gave rough estimates of probable survival for various weight classes. For example, it was estimated that a baby weighing between 601 and 650 grams would have roughly one chance in 276,000 of surviving. Dr. Berhman noted, however, that gestational age must also be taken into account in any estimate of survival probability. According to defense testimony at the trial of Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin in Boston, the fetus aborted in that case weighed 600 grams at birth. Dr. Edelin, former chief resident obstetrician at Boston City Hospital, was convicted of manslaughter a month ago in Boston in the death of a male fetus after a legal abortion in the sixth month of pregnancy. The Edelin case, however, did not figure in the discussion today before the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. It was on contract for that commission that Dr. Berhman and his colleagues did the study of fetal survival and death. The commission is to recommend to the Government by May 1 the conditions, if any, under which research on the human fetus should be conducted or supported by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Dr. Berhman said doctors today were in dilemma conzerning late abortions in which they may, through no fault of their own, miscalculate the chance for survival of the fetus and deliver a viable, although extremely premature infant, in the course of an abortion. If such an abortus survives, the doctor may be sued by the I parents who had decided on an abortion. If the baby is allowed to die, the doctor may (face criminal prosecution for homicide."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/19/archives/letters-to-the-editor-education-let-that-pendulum-swing-to-help-the.html,"To the Editor: Your March 7 editorial “Stop That Pendulum” expresses a fear that the current swing back to conservative, traditional classroom teaching will result in autocracy and rote learning. As a long‐time math teacher in the public schools of New York State, I give it as my fixed opinion that the real danger is that the conservative pendulum will not swing back far enough or quickly enough to eradicate and replace the slovenly, ineffective and worthless teaching practices of the so‐called progressive, open‐classroom approach to education. Certainly, a good teacher should give courteous consideration to each pupil as an individual; but this does not mean that minimum learning standards and behavior norms should be sacrificed. The theory that each pupil should be allowed to choose his own subject matter and work at his own rate is absurd. Given this opportunity, too many lazy little monsters opt for the easiest courses, and their industry in pursuing these disciplines is minimal. The only proper solution is a return to strict but fair discipline in an orderly classroom; regularly assigned graded homework for all; frequent blackboard recitations; weekly graded quizzes, and a stiff final exam—preferably the Regents'. Even rote learning of such things as the multiplication tables is still a valid educational procedure—did you ever see a kid adding up seven eights to find out what 7x8 is? In other words, it is essential to bring each pupil up to a certain minimum standard of achievement rather than to bend or lower the standards to meet the ability of the student. If an individual can't or won't meet the To Help the Rich To the Editor: President Ford has urged that greater tax cuts be given to the higherincome group on the ground that they will be more apt to spend that money in ways that will benefit the economy But is that the way they will spend it? On March 10 The Times reported that “millions of Americans have been indulging themselves at the nation's winter playgrounds....In record or near‐record numbers, they are gambling in Las Vegas, swimming and soaking up the sun in Florida and Hawaii, frolicking on the rides at Southern California's Disneyland or testing the Colorado ski slopes.” Just how is spending of this kind by the higher‐income group expected to stimulate the basic, broad‐range economy that depends on the need for vital necessities, such as food and clothing, or benefit such hard‐pressed sectors as the auto and home‐construction industries? EDWIN O. KENNEDY South Orange, N. J., March 11, 1975 Mrs. Thatcher's Predecessor To the Editor: You state that Margaret Thatcher is the first woman to lead a British party [editorial Feb. 13], but wasn't Violet Asquith Bonham Carter leader of the Liberal party? Her friend Winston Churchill once said—and wrote—that she might well have been Prime Minister had she not been a minimal course requirements, he should he transferred to basket weaving or to some other discipline more suited to his ability or effort. Today more and more parents are realizing that their children, by not being required in school to meet certain academic achievement standards, are graduating from secondary school without being able to read with understanding, to write coherently (or even legibly) or to perform simple arithmetic calculations. Is it any wonder then that many school systems across the land are heeding these parents' demands for the return of the oldfashioned traditional educational, practices? The educational pendulum is indeed at long, long last moving in the right direction, but it has a long way to swing back, and there is really little danger of its moving too far or too fast. PATRICK W. GUINEY Highland Falls, N. Y., March 9, 1975 woman. But the Liberals by that time had no such power. ELISE JERARD New York, March 4, 1975 The writer is correct —Editor, The Times. The Male‐Minded To the Editor: Your March 10 editorial “The 200 Years” reminded us that the American Bicentennial commemorates “a revolution based on insistence on an ‘aristocracy of talent’ rather than of privilege.” You cited several great American men who had regenerated this liberating drive, properly including Martin Luther King for his work on behalf of minority rights. But what of the notable women, past and present, who have fought to replace the “aristocracy of [male] privilege” with an “aristocracy of [male and female] talent”? Their efforts have resulted in the creation of official agencies at all levels of government—including New York City—working to secure for women an equal opportunity to demonstrate and utilize their tailent. Despite this forward movement, a narrow male‐mindedness still seems to dominate the thinking of some of our most influential institutions. How else can one explain a Times editorial that hails this country's revolutionary drive toward an “aristocracy of talent,” yet ignores completely the force exerted in that direction by advocates of equal opportunity for women? EDYTHE W. FIRST New York, March 11, 1975 The writer heads the City Commission on the Status of Women. On the Physician's Role In Population Control To the Editor: The recent decision in Boston regarding the actions of a physician performing an abortion serves to point up the dilemma of the medical profession in this and related fields. If our current mores place in the hands of any woman the right to dispose of her unborn and unwanted fetus, it should be a matter only between her conscience and the law. If, as is the case here, she involves a member of the medical profession in implementing her decision, a chain of events is started whose ending cannot be predieted. A logical extension of this thinking might at some future date suggest equal rights of the woman (or any member of society) to dispose of an unwanted newborn infant, a defective child or a bedridden relative, whether father, mother or husband. AU of these actions have been considered acceptable behavior in a number of past or present societies but not, to date, in ours. All would threaten to involve members of the medical profession in these decisions and in their implementation. Eventually, it may well be that our overpopulated world will require actions of this nature, and the medical profession may have to assume an aquiescent if not a leading role. Until this occurs, however, the profession should at least consider the alterna tives and make its position clear. Many of us regret the legalization of abortions, which has forced the physician into an active role in culling the population. As a result of subsequent changes in our country's legal and moral standards, physicians may find themselves involved in even less‐acceptable practices. The medical profession should have the moral courage to consider an suggested program of limiting population on its merits and, then to condone or reject physician‐participation openly and unequivocally. If we are to change centuries of tradition, as has already been done by legalizing abortions, we should do it because of considered response in balancing available world food supplies against a burgeoning population and resultant ecologic despoliation. We should not allow ourselves to be backed into a morally indefensible position by inactivity or default. JAMES I. WENDELL Jr., M.D. Pottstown, Pa., March 4, 1975 The Heroic Mothers To the Editor: Ned O'Gorman's “The Slaughter of Some. Innocents” (Op‐Ed March 8)—while no doubt well intended—is extraordinary for the class and racial bias it reveals. Generalizing from sortie truly heartbreaking incidents in the black community, Mr. O'Gorman proposes a “revolutionary” policy, namely, that state care be substituted for the families of poor children. As a sociologist who has followed the calvary of our children in state institutions and who has cheered the success of the civil rights lawyers in the Willowbrook case. as well as others like it, I wish to ask Mr. O'Gorman to point to one, just one, professional who has assumed or who is prepared to assume for approximately fourteen years the full burden of parental care, devotion, love and sacrifice for one, just one, poor child. If he could produce one, just one, many of us would be more inclined to take Mr. O'Gormans' proposal seriously. In the absence of this, Mr. O'Gormans' essay represents the most insufferably élitist assault upon the life of not only the minority communities but our whole society. The real heroes are those—and they are by far the overwhelming majority—who under the most extraordinary pressure persist in being mothers to their children. BRIGITTE BERGER Professor of Sociology Long Island University Brooklyn, March 8, 1975 Mr. Papp and the Squares To the Editor: It is good to hear that next season Mr. Papp will bring back to Lincoln Center plays “that have borne the test of time” with established American performers and international guest stars (news story March 8). The middle‐class audience that he so in suited as “square” and undeserving has been forgiven. Mr. Papp does not want to “alienate the audience,” as he has done for two seasons with poor productions of new playwrights. But wait, has Mr. Papp forgiven the “square” Lincoln Center audience? He goes on that he will destroy the Beaumont's thrust stage (the glory of the few successful Lincoln Center productions, such as the anniversary production of “A Streetcar Named Desire”). He needs a “beautiful proscenium stage”—the same kind of stage that has marked the dull pro ductions of Stratford, Conn. Shades” of the potato chip style haunt theatergoers. I am reminded of an old family saying, invoked when someone did deliberate harm to himself—and in this case, to the theater. Grandmother used to say, “All the damn fools aren't dead yet.” The $4 million so easily available to Mr. Papp from foundations to alter the Beaumont stage could be used for new productions and new playwrights, of which he says he is so fond. One can hardly wait for next year's announcement from Mr. Papp at Lincoln Center. It may well begin, “There shall not be left a stone upon a stone.” A. E. KELLY New York, March 9, 1975 Indochina Issue: Meany vs. the People To the Editor: Although George Meany has publicly acknowledged that he was wrong about Vietnam, his current powerful progressive leadership on domestic issues continues to suffer an unfortunate Jekyll‐Hyde transformation at the water's edge. It was therefore not surprising that the recent meeting of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. Executive Council was so sharply critical of the Ford Administration's dealing with unempldyment, inflation, taxation and energy. Nor was it surprising, although it was shocking, that the council gave full support to the Ford‐Kissinger efforts to get from Congress an additional half‐billion dollars to maintain the puppet regimes in Cambodia and South Vietnam. This is especially so because the Administration makes no bones about the fact that the only aid sought is military aid; none of it is to go for food, medicine or relief of the vast human suffering which the continued fighting is causing. The near‐unanimous vote of the council supporting the appropriation, with only Jerry Wurf dissenting, shows how very much out of tune George Meany is on this issue with the overwhelming majority of the American people. According to all the reliable polls, the sentiment, is four to one against continued military support. Even the Pentagon and our embassy in Cambodia are reported to doubt the wisdom or utility of bolstering the inept, corrupt and crumbling Lon No Government. Certainly the need of the people of Cambodia for food and medical aid is desperate, and we should extend it, especially as our policies are responsible for the present misery and torture of its unfortunate people. But money to prolong the killing would only intensify the suffering, and all the available evidence is that if nonmilitary aid is extended while Lon Nol continues to occupy his luxurious palace the aid will only be diverted to the black market to enrich his corrupt regime even more. In the face of the urgent domestic problems to which George Meany has been calling attention, it ought to be obvious that, quite apart from the immorality of it, Congress cannot and must not appropriate another penny to prolong the civil war in Cambodia. It therefore seems to me that despite Meany and COPE, a proper pro‐labor vote should oppose this appropriation; a true pro‐labor vote would support reconstruction and self‐determination for the people of Cambodia.

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/19/archives/books-of-the-times-poetry-has-a-flat-belly-talking-about-dialogue.html,"HERS. By A. Alvarez. 255 pages. Random House. $7.95. If I had not known that A. Alvarez was a highly regarded English poet and critic, I might have supposed, on the evidence of “Hers,” that he was just another run‐ofthe‐mill first novelist. It appears that his literary experience or sophistication is not transferable. No one has yet explained why a man who can distinguish a good line from a bad one in somebody else's book cannot do as much for his own. Is love really blind? One can imagine a competent critic writing a certain kind of bad novel, one which lacks the mysterious qualities that make a man a persuasive novelist It is difficult, though, to understand how Mr. Alvarez could have remained unaware of so many of the minor tricks of the novelist's craft Craft, after all, is what the critic is supposed to judge: it is his stock in trade. Talking About Dialogue In fact, everybody — not just critics —should have some sort of an ear for dialogue. Talk is what we do all our lives long, yet Mr. Alvarez seems to be a mere babe in the woods here. Take this scene, for example: Sam, who is 22 and a graduate student in literature, is walking with the beautiful 30‐year‐old wife of a professor of literature. He is already half in love with her and if she is going to love him back, it will depend largely on what he says. It begins to rain and he says: “Someone up there has turned the hose on.” A few pages later, watching a hawk hovering above them, he says; “It must be beautiful up there. Really free.” I refuse to believe that Julie, the professor's wife, can think herself in loveWith Sam after that. Nevertheless, that Is what the author asks us to do; She loves him, we are told, for his flat belly as well as for his literary sensibility. Her belly is flat and flat calls to flat. When Sam looks at Julie, he thinks: “I've never seen a real woman before.” If this is true, I can only say that he should be flunked out of school. For a literary man, Mr. Alvarez does not have a high opinion of those who study and profess his discipline. They are all reading the same “drab” books and envying “each other'stiny successes . . . ” Even the professor is haunted by “the obsequious hierarchies of power above him and below.” Apart from a preference for flat bellies, Julie doesn't seem to know her own mind. She married the professor who is now in his 50's when she was a starving German “waif” of 17, and at 30 she, is dissatisfied with him, her two children, and the university town where they live. She is always replying “icily” to his remarks. Yet Sam bores her, too: “She had had children and been hungry; she . . . had seen people die; she was impatient with his grand protestations of feeling.” Well, then, what is “Hers” all about? If Sam is a bore and the professor's a bore and life, too, where's our novel going to locate itself? Why, in Julie's search for identity, her thrust toward sexual relief, of course. Where else? I'm not saying that these are not natural or legitimate goals for a young woman — particularly in our self‐conscious, keenly “aware” times —but I do believe that the quality of these feelings has something to do with the quality of the novel. The quest qua quest is not enough. There are vestigial values complicating the picture. Julie Is not a heroine for sleeping with Sam. The professor is not a tragic figure because his wife's infidelity calls to his mind almost the entire text of “Othello.” The poor professor has been given a very stale role: that of the scholar who can no longer distinguish between literature and life. In all ray experience on the fringes of the literary world, I have yet to meet with this syndrome in the flesh. In any case wouldn't it be more interesting to see what a scholar can do beside passively suffer literature? Why is Mr. Alvarez so hostile to his prinicipal audience? Lesser‐Known Expressionists Sam is even worse. When Julie announces that she is dying and invites Sam to accompany her, without her husband, to a clinic in Germany, he is filled with a lover's pride: “He, not her husband, would be in at the death.” She is not dying, of course: she is only going back home to think about her father, who is run in “Hers” as a deus ex machina to crank up the plot. We read: “When they [the Nazis] had taken her father, she had gone. with them” and we wonder what it can mean. Fathers are such all‐purpose, symbols that it's hard to know. After Julio has an abortion, we learn that “her father had been laid to rest at last.” Faced with this line, I can only conjecture that, Julie has been reading some of the lesser known German expressionist dramatists in the clinic'S library. Feminists and all those others who keep up with our changing times will be interested to know what sort of lesson Julie distills from her vicissitudes. Mr. Alvarez has not forgotten his “seven types of ambiguity” and it may‐require all the reader's cunning to construe his conclusion. Here is: “My husband, she thought. Responsible, domestic, laborious,‐ immovable, flat. He'll do.”"
"In the South, Road to Equal Rights Is Rocky and Full of Detours",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/20/archives/in-the-south-road-to-equal-rights-is-rocky-and-full-of-detours.html,"NEW ORLEANS — The Southern belle still lives and she seems determined, to resist the nation's offer to liberate her. While her sisters in the North raise their consciousness, the Southern woman irons her husband's shirts. drinks tea and gin fizz at the country club, teaches Sunday school and, if she thinks about it at all, denounces the Equal Rights Amendment as the work of Satan. “E.R.A. is not God's way,” say the picket signs, outside Southern Legislatures. The signs are nearly all carried by women who believe that the amendment and its aggressive advocates are a threat to woman's traditional role. The women's movement has made a little headway in this region, mainly among the white middle class and particularly among those of that group who are under 30 years of age. The headway can be seen in more relaxed sexual practices, more casual dress and an increase in abortions. But the movement here is not as advanced as it is in the North and West. “Southern women are just breaking out of the shell,” said Mrs. Clifford Durr of Wetumpka, Ala., a 70‐year‐old feminist who still speaks with wonder of the powerful forces that have shaped Southern attitudes about women. The reason for the movement's lag in this region are many and murky. But the fundamental one seems to be the South's historical fascination with the romantic ideal: men are meant to wield power; women are made to be protected and idolized. Writing of the chivalric notion in “The Mind of the South,” W. J. Cash said, “she was the South's Palladium, this Southern woman—the shield‐bearing Athena gleaming whitely in the clouds, the standard for its rallying, the mystic symbol of its nationality in the face of the foe.” Manly Vortues The other side of the coin of chivalry was the virile male, the hard‐fighting, harddrinking master, the champion of the manly virtues. And while women were said to be kept on pedestals, some thought the metaphor was awry. They were actually kept in orbit around men, protected but powerless, forced to rely for their survival on flattery, fluttering eyes and the most artful, compelling and shameless manipulation. Some believed that the women's movement in the South will finally dash itself against the rock of chivalry. It has happened before. The 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote in 1920, was ratified by ?? three of the 11 states of the Confederacy. The Equal. Rights Amendment has been ratified by only two, Tennessee and Texas, and efforts have been made in both to rescind it. Whatever the outcome of flip women's movement, it is an article of faith in the South that there will always be more civility between the sexes here than in some other parts of the country. There is a widespread belief in the South that southern women are more feminine, more womanly. Even militant feminists here are disconcerted by some of the manner and rhetoric of the northern militants. A Southerner who considers herself a friend of Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York, and of several other northern feminists, talked recently of what happens when she tries to discuss something with the ebullient New Yorker. She said that by the time she says three or four words, Mrs. Abzug interrupts with her own thoughts or, thinking she knows what the sentence is going to say, finishes it herself. And if the Southerner complains, she said, Mrs. Abzug tells her, “You Southerners are too polite” or “You Southerners talk too slow.” Despite the occasional abrasiveness, no one among Southern leaders of the women's movement seems seriously to believe that it is more than an irritant. The real causes of the slowness of the Southern movement, they say, are Southerners themselves: Large numbers of them are jealous of their privileged position, powerless as it might be in the world of politics and economics. Free to Do What? A woman reared in the Southern tradition would probably prefer to be free, for instance, of such obligations as writing checks. Free to do what? Free to work in the church and charity drives, the junior league, the parent‐teacher association. Free to chauffeur the children to school, music lessons, Cub Scouts and dances. Free to play bridge and tennis. Free to go to lunch at the country club. There remains a compulsion to live up to the myth of Southern womanhood, or at least to the 20th‐century version of it. According to the myth, gainful employment except on a temporary basis is unladylike. Patricia Derian, the Democratic committeewoman from Mississippi and a woman's rights leader, described the stereotype in a speech last year at the University of Alabama. “They spring into being at 17,” she said, “as respectable Chi O's and Tri Delta, wrestling around on the third tee of every country club south of Maryland. They shimmer, pout, dance in rows, march at the front of bands, diet, make B's without any brains, sometimes if plied with whiskey submit and always marry. “They teach school till the babies come, belong to the junior auxiliary, a name brand church, stuff their children with rules and their guests with cheese grits until they're 40. At 40 they garden, play bridge, fall to drink and bore their husbands to death. Upon achieving widowhood, they travel around the world looking at castles, great gardens, art treasures and needlework through the ages. Why do Southern women so resist the changes that are occurring in the rest, of the country? Mrs. Derian mentioned several reasons, beginning with the way Southern children are raised. Boys are taught to wrestle, compete, talk tough and handle guns. Girls are taught to prepare themselves for marriage and family. “There's always been more of a to‐do made about daughters in the South,” she said. “We tell our little girls, ‘Don't you look precious?’ and ‘Give me sugar.’ Children try desperately to meet the expectations of the adults around them.” When such girls are grown, she said, they think they can get what they want simply by being “sweet and nice.” She said many Southern women who have joined the feminist movement think they can persuade men with power to share it by being sweet and reasonable. “They still have on their white gloves,” Mrs. Darien commented. Brownie Ledbetter of Little Rock, who is also a leader in the women's movement and is active in Democratic politics, pointed to other reasons. The South has always been more agricultural than other regions, she said, which means that many women still perform vital roles that are seen as inseparable from the roles of wife and mother: growing and canning food, raising chickens, making clothes, etc. A strong sense of duty to the family coupled with a deep religious sentiment has made Southerners work harder to protect the wife‐mother role, she said. The wife‐mother sees herself threatened by the Equal Rights Amendment and the women's movement. When the Arkansas Legislature recently considered the amendment (but never brought it to a vote), women opponents delivered fresh‐baked loaves of bread to every legislator. “From the bread‐makers to the bread‐winners,” the cards said. The Legislature heard a debate on the E.R.A. an Valentine's. Day. The proponent, Diane Kincaid of Fayetteville, went out of her way to assure the men in the Legislature that the amendment would not change the traditional sex roles. “Men can still be strong and brave,” she said. “Women can still be sweet and gentle.” The women's movement has found little support among Southern black women, partly because many seem to fear that an active feminism would drive a wedge between them and black men. Dr. Barbara Guillory, a black sociologist at Dillard University in New Orleans, said in a recent speech that the black woman “cannot emasculate his manhood and then expect him to show strength during crises. . . It may be that in the final analysis the role of the black woman can only be made specific and clear when the role of the black man is made specific and clear.” Others mention a further reason for black women's lack of interest. Sylvia Cook, wife of Samuel DuBois Cook, president of Dillard Uni versity, spoke in a recent interview of the traditional role of the Southern white woman as “decoration” for her husband, contrasted with the black woman's traditional role as servant and manual worker. “We've not been worshiped and put on a pedestal,” Mrs. Cook said, speaking of black women. “Personally, I feel that my husband has put me on one. And I like love and pampering. I think any woman would like it. We'd almost have to pass through that before becoming militant.” The movement also has had little support from working class white women in the South, many of whom are forced to work to support themselves or to help support their families. However, there is evidence of a beginning. Working women in the South are said to be filing more complaints of sex discrimination in employment. The Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has few figures but the regional administrator in Atlanta said recently that “women are coming on strong and are protesting just about everything.” Some Protests In some states, such as Louisiana, women are beginning to protest discrimination in obtaining credit. Many young women in Southern cities have quietly adopted the practice of their Northern sisters and have begun to live with men before marrying them, and in some cases instead of marrying them. Figures on abortion compiled by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and by the Alan Guttmacher Institute show that the practice has increased more in the South than in the nation as a whole. Abortions in 10 Southern states rose from 21,800 in 1972 to 68,900 in 1973; nationally they went up from 586,800 to 745,300 in the same period. However, more women began to get abortions in their home states as they became legal instead of going to New York, which legalized them in 1970. Some of the Southern white woman's old fears are fading, but Mrs., Durr re called how, during an incident in Montgomery in the mid‐1960's, the issue of “woman's honor” was dealt with. Several white and black church women met together at a black church to discuss the race problem. A segregationist journal published pictures of the white women leaving the meeting, along with their names, addresses and telephone numbers. Several of the women received threatening and obscene telephone calls from racists. The men of their families, who included some of the city's most prominent businessmen, bought advertising space in the Montgomery papers to say that they, the men, had never been to any integrated meetings and that they, the men, were stanch defenders of the Southern way of life. They repudiated their‐own wives, their own mothers, their own daughters, their own grandmothers,” Virginia Durr said. In spite of national pressures, vast numbers of Southern women cling to the old ways. Debuts and church weddings still take enormous amounts of the time and energy of the women here. Beauty parlors are packed. Partygoers still tend to drift into segregated groups of men and women. Men are still encouraged to open doors and light cigarettes. Nancy Pickard is 29 years old, divorced and a successful interior decorator at Montgomery. She considers herself liberated or, in her words, “a free spirit.” She takes long trips alone. She competes in the “man's world.” She talks of the freer sex habits of the people in her circle. About half of the single people she knows live with members of the opposite sex without marriage. If she feels like going to Atlanta for a weekend on the town, she gets in her car and goes. Not a Joiner How then does she feel about women's liberation? “I don't belong to any orgainizations like that,” she said. She spoke in a husky, south Alabama voice. She was sipping a drink at the Montgomery Country Club where she, as a member, was buying lunch for her male companion. “I have to be my own boss,” she said “I don't want to get on a street corner and beat a tambourine.” How does she feel about marriage? “In a marriage, the first thing should be your husband. That has to be first.” And children? “I think I would make a helluva a good mother. I think it would be great to have children.” And how does she feel about men? Miss Pickard grew thoughtful for a while. Finally she said, “I want a man to treat me like a woman.” Absent‐mindedly, she untied her long brown hair, which had been pulled into a bun, and shook it loose as she stood to leave. Then she looked up at her companion and slowly blinked her very large brown eyes. Her mouth opened in the bare beginning of smile. It was clear that the only man in the state of Alabama who meant anything to her at that moment was the one who stood looking into her eyes."
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/20/archives/metropolitan-briefs-connecticut-sales-tax-jumping-to-7-grant-sought.html,"Gov. Ella T. Grasso yesterday approved an increase in the Connecticut sales tax to 7 per cent, effective April 1, having delayed the signing as long as she constitutionally could to make a point of her reluctance to accept the measure. The General Assembly passed the tax increase of 1 percentage point last Thursday, ignoring the Governor's request that it, hold off until the start of the next fiscal year, on July 1. At 7 per cent, where the tax was in 1972 and 1973, it will again be the highest state sales tax in the country. In some other places, including New York City, the total of state and local or county sales taxes is more. Grant Sought for Shinworm Study The city has applied for a $50,000 Federal reserach grant to study ways to combat damage to piers and other waterfront facilities caused by shipworms, which bore into wooden pilings and have defied such traditional remedies as creosote treatment and sheathing with metal. Vito J. Fossella, Commissioner of Marine and Aviation, said the problem was growing as waters in the harbor became cleaner because of anti‐pollution efforts, increasing the oxygen content of the water and providing a more hospitable climate for the marine borers. The only known wood suitable for pier pilings that is immune to shipworms is “greenheart” lumber from Central America, the supply of which is rapidly running out. Contested L.I. Abortion Ruled Legal An investigation by the Nassau County District Attorney's office into allegations of a case of infanticide at the Nassau County Medical Center during an abortion disclosed “no evidence of any violation of law.” District Attorney Denis E. Dillon conducted the inquiry at the request of John Short of Farmingdale and James Ross of Melville, members of the Long Island Right to Life Coalition. They contended that a live fetus was permitted to die after the elective abortion last January. The 23‐page report by Mr. Dillon held that the infant “was afforded all reasonable medical care consistent with modern medical practice to preserve the life.” From the Police Blotter: Five men, including a former bank manager, were arrested in the Bronx in the theft of $250,000 from the Bankers Trust Company branch at 161st Street and Gerard Avenue over more than a year's time. District Attorney Mario Merola said the principal embezzling scheme involved falsified loan forms. . . Anthony Troumis, a messenger employed by the Geiger Corporation of 22 West 48th Street was robbed by two armed men of $25,000 in gems as he was delivering the gems to an office on the ninth floor of a building at 48 West 48th Street at 1 P.M. Mr. Troumis was not injured. . . . The police gun report for the 24‐hour period ended midnight Tuesday showed four homicides, eight assaults and 48 robberies committed with the use of guns and 23 court arraignments for possession or use of guns. The police seized 44 handguns, 10 shotguns and 10 rifles. Weapons voluntarily surrendered since March 1 under the dangerous‐weapons amnesty program totaled 236 handguns, 45 rifles, seven shotguns, a machine gun, an air pistol, five starter pistols and seven gas grenades."
The Kennedy Transcripts,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/20/archives/the-kennedy-transcripts.html,"WASHINGTON, March 19—Benjamin Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post, was a close personal friend of Prisident Kennedy. In “Conversations With Kennedy,” a book transcribing his notes that is previewed in this month's Playboy magazine, Mr. Bradlee makes a few revelations, not all of them intentional: On Kennedy's seduction of the press: As a Newsweek correspondent covering the 1960 Kennedy‐Nixon campaign, Mr. Bradlee admits that he “wanted Kennedy to win.” After his friend did win, Mr. Bradlee saw nothing improper in soliciting President Kennedy's advice—generously given—about which reporters to hire for Newsweek's Washington bureau. “If I was had,” says editor Bradlee in a related context, “so be it”; not all of Newsweek's trusting readers will be so philosophical. On Kennedy's use of language: Nothing we have read in other Presidential transcripts approaches the frequency and pungency of profanity that Mr. Bradlee unnecessarily ascribes to President Kennedy. Such lines as “they (deleted) us and we've got to try to (deleted) them,” with the word I have deleted filled in, may add verisimilitude to the conversations, but are they really a contribution to history? Antedating John Dean by one full decade, Mr. Bradlee quotes President Kennedy directly as saying of steelexecutive adversaries: “We're going to tuck it to them and (deleted) 'em.” On the abuse of power: Toasting Attorney General Robert Kennedy at a dinner party, the President referred to a telephone conversation with Tom Patton, president of Republic Steel: “Patton asked me, ‘Why is it that all the telephones of all the steel executives in the country are being tapped?’ And I told him that I thought he was being Wholly unfair to the Attorney General and that I was sure that it wasn't true. And he asked me, ‘Why is it that all the income‐tax returns of all the steel executives in the country are being scrutinized?’ And I told him that, too, was wholly unfair.... And then I called the Attorney General and asked him why he was tapping the telephones of all the steel executives and examining the tax returns of all the steel executives... and the Attorney General told me that was wholly untrue and unfair.” After what Mr. Bradlee describes as “another Stanislaysky pause,” President Kennedy added, “Of course, Patton was right.” On concern for history and tradition: When President Kennedy was told of a rumor that his Air Force aide's girlfriend “had taken a dip in the pool at midnight and had been seen later jumping on the bed in the Lincoln Room,” he directed Mrs. Kennedy to “get after” the aide, but not immediately. Mr. Bradlee found it “interesting” that the President did not question the rumor. On two profiles in courage: President Kennedy confided to Mr. Bradlee that billionaire J. Paul Getty had paid only $500 in income tax one year: Asked about tax reform to prevent this, the President's answer was “maybe after 1964.” On another politically sensitive subject, Mr. Bradlee writes: “He said he was all for people's solving their problems by abortion (and he specifically told me I could not use that for publication in Newsweek).” On insistence upon the rectitude of one's running mate: President Kennedy is quoted as saying he felt sure that Lyndon Johnson had not been “on the take since he was elected” Vice President. Before that, he said, “I'm not so sure.” ESSAY On “hardball” campaign tactics after quoting a Kennedy remark about Nelson Rockefeller that is unprintable here, Mr. Bradlee delicately drops a clue to the source of the vicious draftdodger attack on Hubert Humphrey in the West Virginia primary: “It is interesting how often Kennedy referred to the war records of political opponents. He had often mentioned Eddie McCormack and Hubert Humphrey in this connection....” Nowhere in these early selections from the Kennedy transcripts is there the idealistic uplift and intellectual stimulus that we have been led to associate with the late President. Deploring “kiss‐and‐tell journalism,” Mr. Bradlee says President Kennedy approved of his record of “intimate details,” but adds: “I was not convinced he knew how intimate those details might get—though I suspected Jackie did—but that's for another decade.” Think of it—only five more years to wait until the eighties, when Mr. Bradlee will give us names and measurements of all the girls in wet bathing suits who jumped on Mr. Lincoln's bed at midnight. “Conversations With Kennedy” proves that if you are President, you do not have to install a secret taping system in order to guarantee the besmearing of your reputation. One trusted confidant who wants to write a gossipy bestseller will do. John F. Kennedy did not need a journalistic “enemies list”; he had Ben Bradlee for a friend."
Jerome Nathanson Dead at 68; Headed Ethical Culture Society,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/22/archives/jerome-nathanson-dead-at-68-headed-ethical-culture-society-edited.html,"Jerome Nathanson, chairman of the board of leaders of the New York Society for Ethical Culture for 20 years until illness caused him to curb his activities last year, died yesterday, apparently of a heart attack, at his home, 145 Central Park West. He was 68 years old. Mr. Nathanson had continued as a member of the society's board of leaders and of the fraternity of leaders of the American Ethical Union. He was a noted philosopher and writer. An admirer of John Dewey, the philosopher, he wrote “John Dewey: The Reconstruction of the Democratic Life” in 1967. He also wrote “Forerunners of Freedom,” a standard work on the history of ideas, and more recently, he edited two volumes, “Morality and American Freedom” and “Individual Excellence and Social Responsibility.” He was the editor of “Science for Democracy,” a 1946 compilation of papers presented at the third annual Conference on the Scientific Spirit and Democratic Faith the year before. As chairman of the New York Committee to Abolish Capital Punishment, he was considered one of the most influential persons in the drive in this state. He was also a spokesman and member of the educational council of the Euthanasia Society of America and served as chairman of the Clergyman's Advisory Committee of Planned Parenthood of New York City and the Clergyman's Committee for the Study of Abortion. In 1952 he took part in the formation of an International Union of Humanist and Ethical Associations in Amsterdam. The group was designed to seek a new way out of “the present crisis of civilization.” Mr. Nathanson was named treasurer. One of his many interests was the curbing of noise—he called it “a 24‐hour sonic nightmare”—in this city. He and a group of like‐minded New Yorkers formed Citizens for a Quieter City, Inc., in 1967, with Mr. Nathanson as president and Dr. Samuel Rosen, a surgeon, as chairman. Edited Compilation “Very few people realize,” Mr. Nathanson said then, “that much of the noise in New York City is unnecessary; it can be eliminated or substantially reduced with some effort and relatively little cost.” The group addressed itself to a series of educational programs, including public demonstrations of the effects of noise and measures to curb it. Mr. Nathanson taught American history and culture at the United States Foreign Student Center at Bard College for five summers in the nineteen‐fifties. He also wrote regularly on subjects ranging from education to religion and philosophy, for such periodicals as Look, the New Republic, The Nation, American Scholar and the Journal of Philosophy. Mr. Nathanson was widely known, too, for his frequent Sunday morning talks over radio station WQXR. His closeness and admiration for John Dewey led to his performing a wedding ceremony in 1946 for the philosopher, then 87 and a widower, and Roberta Grant, a widow. Mr. Nathanson earned a B.A. degree at Cornell University in 1928 and an M.A. at Columbia in 1931. Mr. Nathanson's wife, the former Rosamond Tenney, who had been director of public relations at Roosevelt Hospital, died in April, 1968. He leaves a son, Tenney."
Abortion Argued Around the World,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/23/archives/abortion-argued-around-the-world-abortion-a-question-fiercely.html,"PARIS, March 22—The issue of abortion has unloosed stormy debates in much of the world.Whether abortion is legalized, as it was several months ago in Roman Catholic France, or declared criminal and unconstitutional, as it was last month by West Germany's highest court, the laws are widely flouted. French doctors and hospital directors en masse are defying the new law, turning away legitimate applicants for abortion on demand in the early weeks of pregnancy. The German court has struck down recently passed legislation liberalizing abortion laws, describing them as a call to murder. .But the combined total of abortions in West Germany and France will continue at a level of 800,000 a year. And that is the worldwide picture, too. Abortions continue, in rich and poor areas, done in comfortable clinics, or in the hack streets, by midwives or witch doctors. Overseas correspondents of The New York Times and experts on the subject were asked to report on how abortion stands in their areas. Their findings are summarized here: The French National Assembly, after a prolonged debate, voted on Nov. 29 to legalize abortion on demand at fixed prices during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. They thus ended 54 years of total prohibition of abortion in France, overturning a law that provided severe fines and prison sentences for any person performing an abortion and any woman who underwent abortion. The new law went into effect on Jan. 18. Health Minister Simone Veil, the most powerful and popular public defender of the new law, admitted the other day that many French doctors find it hard to accept the statute for reasons of professional ethics or personal belief. Despite the new law, the arch‐conservative Medical Association continues to brandish the threat of revoking the licenses of Physicians who perform abortions. In Melun, southeast of Paris, a woman doctor who heads the hospital gynecological department insulted and ordered from the building three women who presented themselves for abortions. They had been accompanied by 40 militants from the Movement for the Freedom of Abortion and Contracention. The doctor, unmarried and a Catholic. characterized the visit as a “commando” invasion and said she regretted “not a word I spoke.” Mrs. Veil told an interviewer that there are “at least a thousand Meluns” occuring all over France. “In country where abortion was considered a crime for decades, it will take more than a couple of months for physicians to change their deep‐rooted moral and intellectual hostility,” she said. The Government hopes to fix the fee for an abortion at about $150 in both public and private hospitals. West Germany The West German parliament passed last June a law permitting abortion on demand during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It was never put into force, and on Feb. 25, the German Supreme Court ruled that the law transgressed the constitutional principle that “everyone shall have the right to life and inviolability of person.” The verdict outraged many German voters, 59 per cent of whom had declared themselves for the change in the latest opinion polls, and it provoked big demonstrations in most German cities. Liselotte Funcke, a vice president of the Bundestag, said that German women “would not accept or abide by such a decision.” A lower court judge, Erich Weidler of Hanover, declared: “If a poor woman is convicted of abortion before me because the law is the way it is, I will seek the least possible punishment lets say 100 marks [$40] and I would pay it from my own pocket.” Italy This Roman Catholic nation is now in the throes of an abortion reform issue that promises to become even. more emotional than divorce was. Last month, Italy's constitutional court, unlike its German counterpart, recognized the possibility of conflict between the constitutional rights of an unborn child and those of its mother. The court decided that the mother's right to health and sanity must take precedence over the embryo, which is “not yet a person.” Three new proposals for abortion reform have been submitted to Parliament since January. They would amend an old Fascist law banhing all abortion as a “crime against propagation of the race.” No formal debate has yet taken place. Pro‐abortionists are quick to point out that in Italy as elsewhere, abortions are easily available to the rich. Gianfranco Spadaccia, secretary of a civil rights group, remarked: “Italy's hospitals are controlled mainly by Christian Democrats, and most of her clinics are run by the Church. But you can get abortions there. You can sin. But you have to pay plenty for it, both financially and emotionally.” Statistics on the number of abortions in Italy vary. The Ministry of Health says there are 800,000 annually. A 1968 convention of Italian gynecologists said there were up to 3 million. The World Health Organization estimates 1.5 million. Great Britain A 1967 act of Parliament permits abortion if continuation of the pregnancy involves a risk greater to the mother's physical or mental health than if the pregnancy were terminated. Two doctors are required to approve the operation, which must be carried out during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy. Controversy about it continues unabated and the House of Commons last month ordered a new inquiry into the working of the law. The appointment of an investigating committee is seen as an acknowledgment that the present legislation is being seriously abused, especially by private clinics operating outside the National Health Service.. Many doctors, in both state and private clinics, do provide abortion on demand and the 28‐week limitation is often disregarded. The decision to review abortion legislation stemmed from favorable reaction to a bill introduced in Parliament earlier this year. Its most radical proposal would remove the “greater than if terminated” phrase from the existing legislation and put on the doctor the onus of proving a risk of “serious injury” to the mother if the pregnancy were allowed to continue. With precedents such as the case of Dr. Kenneth Edelin, the Boston physician convicted of manslaughter for aborting a fetus 20 to 28 weeks old. British doctors might decide to avoid legal complications by refusing to perform abortions at all. Spain and Portugal Abortion is illegal in both countries. Public opinion is still heavily influenced by centuries of Catholic tradition; when the abortion law was approved in France, the reaction was widely one of horror here. There are frequent attacks on abortion in the press and on state‐run television. Even liberal clergy who adopt advanced attitudes on political rights draw the line at abortion. Switzerland Abortion here is an issue that sharply divides the nation. On March 7, the lower house of Parliament mirrored this by narrowly rejecting a Government bill that would have legalized for the first time abortions for other than medical reasons. But here again, reality and the law are far apart. Switzerland has a reputation as an accommodating asylum for women who can afford an abortion Sweden The ifs, ands and buts of a previous Swedish law were abolished in January. The new legislation stipulates that through the 12th week of pregnancy, decision on abortion is up to the woman. She can be denied an abortion only if the operation poses a serious risk to her life or health. Doctors ethically repelled by the practice may be exempted by the Board of Health. All others must comply. Soviet Union Abortion was legalized in the Soviet Union in 1920, then prohibited under Stalin except for grave medical reasons. A 1955 decree re‐established abortion, on demand through the 12th week. Today, while a woman has a right to abortion, the Government frowns on it, especially in the European areas of the Soviet Union where the population is shrinking. There is indirect but noticeable pressure on Russian women to have their babies. Women may get time off and money met with hostility by doctors, 70 per cent of whom are women. A Russian woman in her early 20's told recently of going to a clinic for prenatal care. She said the nurses and doctors treated her like a criminal and made her wait a long time to fill out forms. When they learned she wished to bear her child instead of wanting an abortion, the mood switched instantly to smiles and speedy care. Nonetheless, in Moscow alone there are 200.000 abortions a year, about twice the number of births. Women may get time off and money for legal abortions (less than $10 for working women, nothing for nonworking mothers) if they obtain a medical certificate and bring it to their employers. Middle East In the predominantly Moslem Arab countries, where private behavior the responsibility of religious, not civil courts, abortion remains strictly illegal. Even in Lebanon, the most sophisticated of the area's nations, no reason for abortion is accepted, including the saving of the mother's life. India An act in 1971 gave Indian women the right to obtain an abortion on demand in a hospital. It is estimated that five million women would undergo an abortion every year, with or without the law. In the villages where 80 per cent of Indian women live, most of the abortions are not handled by doctors and there are grave risks. Hospital facilities are available only in the cities. A female journalist commented: “It is highly doubtful if Indian women ever suffer from a feeling of guilt in this matter. Maybe a sense of loss and sadness. For the Indian has traditionally had a broad outlook on matters relating to one's person and has not considered anything related to it, including suicide, either criminal or sinful. Japan The Buddhist and Shintoist Japanese appear not to have religious restraints about abortion such as those that are debated in the Judeo‐Christian West. But public opinion surveys indicate that many Japanese are troubled by abortion on the same ground as those in the West—that it may be taking a human life. The Japanese once considered their country an “abortion paradise.” It was a title they did not relish. That form of population control, while still extensive in Japan, has been dropping in favor of contraception. Abortion has been legal almost on demand since 1948 through the seventh month of pregnancy. Argentina Abortion is legally permitted in cases where the woman's health is at stake or when her illness threatens the health of her unborn child. In practice, this loophole allows abortion for anybody who can afford a doctor willing to perform it. For the poor there are dangerous operations in the village homes of midwives or nurses. There is little likelihood of changes in the law in Argentina. The Peronist Government is intent on doubling the country's population to 50 million by the end of the century. As part of this effort, a decree has been issued restricting the sale of contraceptive pills and discouraging other forms of birth control. Brazil The number of abortions in Brazil, all illegal, has been estimated by family plann;ng specialists at between 2 million and 2.5 million yearly, half of the 5 million annual conceptions. Abortions are performed by so‐called “angel makers,” who include witch doctors, midwives, pharmacists and outlawed medical men. They operate in rural huts, shantytown shacks, apartments, “clinics” and private hospitals. Nigeria Laws banning abortion are strict. Such operations may not be performed legally without a doctor's certicate that the woman's life is in danger. Nevertheless, in major cities such as Lagos, illegal abortions can be easily obtained through doctors willing to break the law for fees ranging from less than $100 to several hundred dollars. It is expected that Nigeria's military government will soon issue a degree liberalizing abortion laws. East Africa The idea of abortion in this underpopulated area is seldom mentioned and then usually condemned. It goes against tradition. Except for white‐ruled South Africa, abortion reform has not become an important or impassioned issue on the. continent. In South Africa the four million whites monopolize privilege and power. Until this year, even therapeutic abortions had been difficult to obtain. This year the white Parliament passed a new abortion and sterilization bill after lengthy hearings before a Parliamentary commission on which no women sat. Helen Suzman, the single Progressive party member of Parliament called the bill “totally inadequate” and “narrow‐minded.” It provides that an abortion can only be obtained after a woman gets certificates of necessity from thred: different doctors, In a special South African touch, the bill stipulates that pregnancy may be terminated if it was a result ofbl a violation of the “immorality act,” which forbids intercourse between whites and nonwhites. The woman president of the Abortion Law Reform League called the bill a “tragedy” and urged renewed efforts to liberalize the law. How slim the chances are was Indicated when one member of Parliament. scolded Mrs. Suzman during the debate, saying there was a belief by some that a woman is “mistress of her soul and body,” He went on: “That is the opinion of a very small group in this country, I am happy to say:”"
Byrne Forms a Panel to Advise on Abortion Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/23/archives/byrne-forms-a-panel-to-advise-on-abortion-laws.html,"TRENTON—Governor Byrne has formed a panel of legal and medical specialists to advise him on the controversy surrounding the United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortions in the first three months of pregnancy. Named by the Governor to head the panel is Dr. Stanley S. Bergen Jr., president of the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry. Emphasizing that the group would be concerned cnly with the legal and medical aspects of abortion, Dr. Bergen said: “The study group will not address itself to the moral and social issues of abortion.” However, the panel is regarded here as a kind of “lightning rod” for the Governor, a group of experts needed to deflect political heat from the abortion issue by providing it with a medical and legal rationale. The first order of business, Dr. Bergen explained, would be to investigate the extent of the state's authority to regulate early abortion in out‐patient clinics. The clinics, which offer low‐cost abortions, have been a top priority of many women's groups; two are now functioning in the state and are in the process of obtaining state licenses. What Byrne Has Asked The Governor has asked the panel to decide whether the state has the right to impose on the abortion Clinics additional and special regulations that it does not require of any other medical facility. At present, the state's Health Department has been attemping to require the clinics to adhere to a number of regulations, including affiliation with nearby hospital, emergency back‐up service and detention of patients for specified periods of time. Such regulations, according to Dr. Watson E. Neiman, the Deputy Commissioner of Health and also a panel member, have been declared unconstitutional in several other states. Formation of the panel comes at a time when antiabortion forces have been particularly active in New Jersey, a state in which Roman Catholics predominate. Senator Joseph A. Maressa, Democrat of Burlington and Gloucester Counties, has charged that the Atlantic City Abortion Clinic is an “abortion mill for out‐ofstate residents,” an allegation denied by Health Department officials. And in Montclair, a citizens' group has been organized to oppose the opening of an abortion clinic there. On Jan. 22, 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that abortions in the first trimester were the sole discretion of the doctor and patient, and that the state could not interfere with the operation. In the 12th to 24th week, the court said, the state could impose health regulations; in the last trimes ter, the operation could be performed only to save the life of the mother. The court's decision, while considered a victory for proabortionists, left a host of unanswered legal questions that are slowly being untangled in the lower courts throughout the country. The New Jersey HealthPlanning Council has estimated that about 41,000 women in the state will request abortions this year. However, a preliminary survey by the Health Department revealed that only half of the state's hospitals were performing abortions; the remainder will perform them only to save the life of the mother. The hospitals' right to refuse is currently being tested in the state's lower courts. The Health Department survey data also indicated that more than 10,000 abortions were performed in New Jersey hospitals in 1974. It is known that thousands of other women are going out of the state for the operations, and that an undetermined number are being performed in doctors' offices. In addtition to Dr. Bergen and Dr. Neiman, the member of the Byrne panel are: ¶Dr. Caterina A. Gergori, assistant director of obstetrics and gynecology at St. Barnabas Hospital, Livingston. ¶Jane Zuckerman, assistant professor of law, Rutgers Law School, Newark. ¶Dr. Irwin Perr, a lawyer, psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry at Rutgers Medical School, Piscataway. ¶Dr. Harold Kaminetzky, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New Jersey Medical School, Newark. The panel is expected to begin its work following the appointment of three more members."
"8 Health Bills, Including a Plan For Flu, Are Offered by Carey",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/23/archives/8-health-bills-including-a-plan-for-flu-are-offered-by-carey.html,"ALBANY, March 22—Governor Carey today offered an eight‐bill package stressing preventive health care, including a measure to establish and enforce nutritional standards in nursing homes and other health‐care facilities regulated by the state. The measures, recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Health, headed by Dr. Kevin M. Cahill, would also require fluoridation of all public water supplies and would set up an influenza ‐ immunization program for the elderly and infirm. “These are the beginning steps in this administration's campaign to improve the quality of health and health care in New York State,” the Governor said in a statement released here. “These programs I submit today, while they are relatively inexpensive, would be of untold benefit to generations of New Yorkers.” ‘A Prudent Policy’ The Governor said that emphasizing preventive health care “is not only a humane policy but also a prudent policy” because “by working to prevent illness, we save the cost of expensive treatment.” Other measures proposed by the Governor would do the following: ¶Establish a 27‐member State Health Research Council to coordinate health research by public and private institutions, distribute state research funds, evaluate programs and develop a model state plan. ¶Include mumps in the state's universal immunization program for schoolchildren and provide for a $25 penalty for responsible school officials who permit any child to be admitted without a certificate showing immunization against poliomyelitis, mumps, measles, diphtheria and rubella. ¶Require insurance companies to include maternity‐care coverage under group or blanket accident and health‐insurance policies. These policies now pay for abortions but not for maternity. ¶Require insurance coverage of patient hospital care to include coverage for a second medical opinion prior to elective surgery. ¶Retain a maximum speed limit of 55 miles an hour on all highways in the state to help continue the reduction in the number of traffic deaths and injuries. ¶Require publication in the state bulletin of proposed programs or rules and regulations of the State Health Department at least 21 days before implementation in order for the public to react to them. Establish Priorities The creation of a State Health Council is designed to foster greater progress in health research while guarding against duplication and waste. It would establish priorities, coordinate and evaluate programs, award grants and fellowships and help municipalities and private persons and organizations in programs of health research. The fluoridation bill would extend the program to about five million persons, half of whom live on Long Island, who receive water from public water supplies that are not now fluoridated. Authorities attribute the reduction in traffic deaths, which fell to its lowest level in 13 years, to the 55‐mile‐an‐hour speed limit imposed during the energy crisis. The Governor's bill is designed to keep the speed limit even if Federal restrictions are lifted. Mr. Carey noted that nutritional standards for nursing homes, hospitals and other licensed health‐care facilities was of “vital concern” and that “the state must apply closer surveillance and more rigid enforcement of standards.” In addition to these measures, the Governor also endorsed a number of bills guaranteeing a place in New York medical schools to New Yorkers who attend out ‐ of ‐ state medical schools and who pass the entrance examinations for the schools in this state."
There's a schism in the world of the Grand Old Soap Opera.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/23/archives/theres-a-schism-in-the-world-of-the-grand-old-soap-opera-life-can.html,"Cathy Craig was a teen‐ager who experimented with drugs and was cured of her incipient habit at Odyssey House. She went on to become a reporter for her hometown newspaper, the Llanview Banner, and wrote a nationally syndicated article telling nice people what to do when they get venereal disease. She turned some of her newspaper experiences into a best‐selling book of short stories that won feminist praise. She has borne a child with‐ out a husband but is enthusiastic about being a “single parent” rather than an “unmarried mother.” On a national television talk show, she looked meaningfully down at her bulging belly and asked the interviewer, Melba Tolliver, to call her “Ms.” Cathy Craig is not a real‐life feminist but a character in a soap opera, ABC's “One Life Live.” Its recipe for dramatic entertainment includes a large dose of realism, ranging from reallife drug treatment centers like Odyssey House real‐life television personalities like Melba Tolliver. It makes quite a contrast with the classical canon Of daytime television drama embodied in CBS's “As the World Turns.” There, in the town of Oakdale, Kim Dixon is still punishing herself for one night of love years ago with her sister's husband, Bob. Their briet encounter made her pregnant and she married the devious Dr. John Dixon to give her baby a name. She lost the baby and tried to leave John, but he blackmailed her into staying by threatening to reveal the father's identity to her sister, Jennifer. Kim talks about it, not on national television but with her friendly minister, after praying for divine guidance. Finally Kim tells her sister and finds that Jennifer knew all along because Bob had babbled the secret in a delirium after being hit by a car. Jennifer, loving her sister and her husband, had forgiven both. Kim decides to leave John. When she tells him, he falls downstairs chasing her and has to be hospitalized for his injuries. Kim agrees to stay with him until he gets well, not knowing that he is delaying his recovery, consciously or unconsciously, in order to keep her. The contrast between the two programs shows that what James Thurber once called “Soapland,” like American society as a whole, is torn between the need to keep up with changing realities and the desire to stick to tried‐and‐true formulas that have never expressed reality—to tell it like it isn't. The search for relevance has led daytime drama to deal with social issues like drugs, venereal disease and the Vietnam war, to take feminist positions on questions like abortion and women working, and to bring blacks and ethnics into the WASP population of Soapland. Of course, only some soap operas make such efforts to keep abreast of change, and they do it only some of the time. Soapland as a whole has little resemblance to the America of the nineteen‐seventies. The old‐fashioned, classical canon, which is still dominant, sounds unreal even in terms of the America of the nineteen‐thirties, when the form was invented on radio, or the nineteenfifties, when it was translated to television. Some people believe that this never‐never land is truly the fantasy of American women, presuming that the fantasy of American men is the violent world of Kojak, Cannon and Harry O—the world of nighttime television. Victoria Wyndham, who plays Rachel on NBC's “Another World.” says, “The majority of letters I get are from women whose lives are simple to the point of dreariness. They are lonely. They want to see beautiful clothes and houses, the story of a girl who had nothing and gets everything, not a bunch of Archie Bunkers.” Other daytime TV people add that the fantasy includes an unbelievable number of handsome, available men who drop in at 2 in the afternoon to talk over their problems with the women they know. An actress who once quit a soap because she thought it refused to face reality has since been converted to the belief that audiences “really want petty intrigue, the titillation they can't find in real life. People's lives are so traumatic they don't want to turn on the TV and be preached to.” Change and constancy, realism and fantasy all testify that, soap operas make up one of the main currents of American culture. So does their appeal to some of the feminists who have done so much to start society on the road to change. Some like the new ideas in daytime drama and don't like to see anything that appeals to millions of women treated as a joke. Further testimony can be found in the soaps' appeal to college students, professors and psychiatrists, and in the employment and training that the soaps give to scores of actors who also do “serious” films and theater. The clinching evidence comes from the figures. There are 14 soaps now on the air, watched each weekday by 20 million to 30 million people. Although each soap has been half an hour long since 1956, “Another World” recently expanded to an hour and “Days of Our Lives” will follow suit next month—possibly initiating a trend the others will follow. The average program is 6.7 million viewers according to the A. C. Nielsen research organization, and the number is growing as recession keeps more and more unemployed people at home. More than 11 per cent of the viewers are men. The households break down economically and educationally in proportions similar to the population as I whole—51.4 per cent with household incomes under $10,000, for instance, and 23.9 per cent with incomes over $15,000. About 24.8 per cent of household heads have only an elementary school education, while 56.2 per cent have a high‐school education or better. The 14 serials cost more than $50‐million a year to produce; actors make a minimum of $211 per half‐hour show and go up to a maximum of $100,000 a year, while a writer makes a minimum of $310 a show, and a good head writer makes $3,000 a week after paying his subwriters. The programs gross more than $300‐million a year from the makers of soaps, deodorants, cake mixes and other household products, providing a disproportionate share of network profits though nighttime budgets are much larger. This money pays for an art form the prime goal of which is dramatic entertainment, whether it mixes realism in with its fantasy or keeps the fantasy pure. Paul Rauch, once a vice president at CBS and now producer of “Another World” at NBC, refuses to admit that classical soap opera is fantasy, however. He worked in the Midwest for 10 years—for Proctor & Gamble, which sponsors six daytime dramas—and insists that his program truly reflects middle‐class, Middle‐West culture. Its characters are realistic, believable, do things that a lot of the viewing public do.” In the reflection of reality on “Another World,” only four of the 14 women characters have jobs, only one of them because she needs the money she earns. Sex is frequent enough but seldom talked about, and social issues are seldom mentioned. The real Midwest has other dimensions. In Peoria, the stereotype of Middle America and a real town about the same size as the program's fictional Bay City, women have moved from secretarial to assembly‐line jobs at Caterpillar Tractor and have taken over the leadership of the airline clerks' union local. They have set up an abortion clinic despite determined opposition and have created an atmosphere in which an elementary schoolteacher can appear on television to talk about her abortion and her husband's vasectomy. Even the liberated characters on socially conscious soap operas don't go that far. Two have had legal abortions in order to pursue their careers —the kind of development that has become a symbol of the new relevance in Soapland. Erica Kane, the bitchcharacter of ABC's “All My Children,” had television's first legal abortion in May, 1971, so that her pregnancy would not interfere with her plans to work as a model. The writers presumed that Middle America would be shocked, and Erica was duly punishedby getting septicemia from the abortion. Susan Lucci, who plays the role, says her fan mail contradicted the presumption of shock; she got letters applauding her decision and urging Erica to take the modeling job despite the objections of her then husband. The Catholic Youth Organization, on the other hand, withdrew an invitation to Miss Lucci to preside at a prizegiving ceremony. Planned Parenthood activists expressed disappointment that the Soapland abortion trail was blazed by an unsympathetic character. They were placated when Cathy Phillips, the young heroine on “Search for Tomorrow,” had a legal abortion because a child would have interfered with her career as a lawyer. Then she quit her job in a small law firm because she was getting only menial legal tasks while her husband, with no better qualifications, was given more important work. Her husband was shocked at first but later came to approve her decisions in both cases. The most significant thing about this example of the new kind of soap opera may be that it occurred on “Search for Tomorrow,” which started 23 years ago and is the oldest soap opera on screen. The classical canon reasserted itself over Soapland feminism, however, when Cathy left her husband because he had had an affair with a woman he later defended on a murder charge, and because he refused to tell his client that the affair was over lest it send her off her mental rails while she was still in jail. “One Life to Live,” which seems the most consistently innovative soap opera, has a recurring feminist story line in the adventures of Cathy Craig. Dorrie Kavanaugh, who plays Cathy, feels that the program has not gone far enough, even though she regards it as the best on the air from the feminist view point. She says the best script she has been given was her childbirth sequence, alone in a snowbound resort cottage with a male newspaper colleague. When he sees her in pain, he says, “Be a brave girl.” Between deep contractions, she replies indignantly, “Don't call me a girl! I'm a woman.” Miss Kavanaugh is only half pleased that Cathy could go to bed with another male character, Joe Riley, without being in love with him. “Before, we couldn't say ‘Yes,’ now we can't say ‘No,’” she commented. “That has nothing to do with human liberation. play a character as though she's liberated, but she's 28, she lives with her parents, she went to bed with a man once in her life and got pregnant—is that liberated?” Illicit sex does not always result in pregnancy on today's soap operas, or even in the overpowering guilt and insanity that used to be the standard alternatives. Elizabeth Hubbard, who plays Dr. Althea Hamilton Davis Bellini Morrison on “The Doctors,” objected to that trio of classical consequences, and jokes that the writers gave Althea a different punishment for her sins: she had to undergo psychoanalysis twice. Paul Rauch, producer of “Another World,” interprets this change by saying his characters “are too intelligent to get knocked up.” The program is not so liberated that the characters mention contraceptives on the air, however. The word “contraceptives” was actually uttered last December on “How to Survive a Marriage.” A character who practices yoga and eats health foods was complaining that her husband insisted on her using contraceptives so she wouldn't have the baby that she wanted and he didn't. The word “intercourse” followed shortly thereafter on the same program, when gynecologist Max Cooper told a married character to stop having it because there were complications in her seven‐month Sex has even begun to be seen on screen as well as mentioned in the new kind of daytime drama. Last fall, Nick Davis and his former wife, Ann Tyler Davis Martin, reuniting after many vicissitudes on “All My Children,” fell into an embrace in which he unzipped the back of her dress down to her waist in a very convincing show of passion that was more heated in the final taping than it had been in rehearsal. It threw the network censor into a passion of another kind, but the ultimate decision was that it was not a grave enough violation to warrant the expense of retailing. All these changes add up to the fact that people are managing to have unmarried sex with minimal consequences on at least four soaps, a dozen years after the start of the sexual revolution in real life. Racial attitudes are also changing, a dozen years after the peak of the civil‐rights movement. Many programs have one or two black characters to put the networks' employment of actors in compliance with Federal law. “One Life to Live” has gone one step further by making its black characters really important in the story line. Ed Hall, a black police lieutenant, has been written out temporarily because the actor who played him, Al Freeman Jr., went to Hollywood. He will be replaced. Ellen Holly, who plays his wife, likes the Ed Hall role because it calls for a black who comes on like Cary Grant instead of the macho gangsters — like Superfly who have become models for black children. Miss Holly has been described as a mixture of three racial strains, and there was no doubt that she could pass for white when the story called for it. In the process of deciding to admit she was black, she had romantic involvements that required her to kiss first a white man and then a black, making a Southern red‐neck equally ndignant about both when he wrote in to protest. Usually, daytime drama shows only two or three blacks in an all‐white world, and their problems tend to be classified as human rather than racial. The amount of realism remains a matter of dispute. “One Life to Live” also tries for a greater degree of realism in having an important set of characters who are both bluecollar and ethnic, whereas most soap operas merely drop in an occasional Italian or Jewish name to add what is thought to be a desirable touch of the exotic. “One Life” also had a Jewish‐Christian marriage (until the Jewish husband “died”) with one‐liners about Christmas and Hanukkah. The blue‐collar couple on this program also provide something else that is a rarity in the old‐fashioned kind of soap‐opera humor. It tends toward slapstick, as In a scene in which they test a water bed when they set out to buy furniture for their new home. But even the middle‐class WASP's in “One Life” are capable of wit by Soapland standards. Joe Riley is painting the carriage house that he and Victoria Lord Riley Burke Riley are remodeling. When Vicki applauds his work, Joe says, “Michelangelo, eat your heart out!” She deadpans, “I thought he only did ceilings.” “One Life to Live” and “All My Children” were both created by a woman who cheerfully takes credit for much of daytime drama's new willingness to face social issues—Agnes Eckhardt Nixon. She attributes her penchant for realism to the fact that she is a Bryn Mawr, Pa., housewife who raised four children while pursuing her lucrative career at home, whereas other writers inhabit the fantasyprone worlds of New York and Hollywood. Mrs. Nixon's first effort to sneak a solid issue into the interstices of TV serials came more then 10 years ago, when she was working for Procter & Gamble on “The Guiding Light.” A friend of hers had died of cancer, so Mrs. Nixon sent a character, Bert Bauer, for her first checkup in years. She turned out to have uterine cancer, and the doctor gave her a very plausible lecture on the need for a semiannual Pap smear. Despite objections from P&G and CBS and orders not to use words like “cancer,” “uterus” or “hysterectomy,” the story went on for six months. Several viewers wrote to say they were alive thanks to hysterectomies following medical examinations they would never have had if they had not watched “Guiding Light.” Mrs. Nixon likes to introduce into her soaps not only such relevant issues but scenes and people from real life. One of her favorites was the Odyssey House sequence when Cathy Craig went for her drug cure on “One Life to Live.” Doris Quinlan, the producer of “One Life,” still speaks proudly of that story. The show spent five days on location at the real Odyssey House in 1970. The cameras shot Cathy with the black and Puerto Rican youths there, and the writers spread the footage over a summer's worth of episodes intended to deliver the message to young people home from school or college. Actors on the show speak of the excitement in the fan mail of that period, and the ratings went up slightly. (Ratings have actually gone down when other soaps showed less realistic drug sequences.) Amy Levitt, who then played Cathy, says the management thought the Odyssey House youngsters interfered with the entertainment values of the show. She resented what she regarded as a diversion of the story from the ghetto kids to a blue‐eyed, blond hero with whom Cathy was made to fall in love. Miss Quinlan says, however, the sequence lasted its natural life, ending at the same time as the summer and the Odyssey House footage.  A venereal‐disease sequence followed some time later. Dr. Larry Wolek spoke on the subject at Llanview High. which made it only natural for Cathy, his stepniece, to write an article on the subject for The Banner. wrote the “article” herself from research with William D. Schwartz of the Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service in Atlanta. Mrs. Nixon says that more than six thousand people wrote to ABC for copies of the article—an enormous response, especially considering the fact that “One Life” subordinated the V.D. theme to the continuing, disease‐free romances that are the living matter of all soap operas. There was another huge response to the first episode of a child‐abuse sequence that Mrs. Nixon introduced into the one serial she still controls, “All My Children.” She had Ann Tyler Davis Martin get involved with COPE, modeled on a real Philadelphia organization called CAPE, for Child Abuse Prevention Effort. The Philadelphia station carrying the program ran a “ribbon” across the bottom of the screen advising viewers to call CAPE for information. There were 46 responses, remarkable for a one‐station effort, including one from an abusing parent asking for help. Mrs. Nixon put the ultimate contemporary reality into “All My Children” with three sequences related to Vietnam. When the program went on the air five years ago, it generated publicity about a character called Amy who belonged to the peace movement. Some viewers thought the sequence was a cop‐out because tight budgets prevented the dramatizing of antiwar demonstrations, and there was little more than talk about Amy's activities. Rosemary Prinz, who played Amy, went off the show to fulfill other commitments and was not replaced, though replacement is a common practice. Mrs. Nixon bristles at the charge of copout. She followed Amy's departure with a sequence about the return of a Vietnam P.O.W., and she drafted Phillip sent him to Vietnam. Last year, “Children” reconstructed a Vietnamese village on the banks of the Connecticut River for a story line involving Phillip and two Vietnamese, a woman who cared for him and a man who had lost his legs in a bombing. Both Vietnamese characters were played by Vietnamese. “All My Children” and the other socially conscious soaps remain dramatic entertainment, of course, full of the romantic fantasy that keeps the audience coming back for more. Erica Kane of “Children” was recently carted off to be treated for the delusion that she was pregnant when in fact she had had a miscarriage (as all the audience saw). Erica's pregnancy had turned her from a bitch into a cloyingly happy housewife. Her return to Soapland “reality” may also mean a return to bitchery and a breakup husband. Soap operas can do such things because their action never ends, but runs on from day to day. They are serials, and in both the new liberated and the old classical soaps, the charac tern, like those in serials by Charles Dickens, are much more important than the plot. They live in their emotions, and their conflicts are more psychological than physical. They can succeed or fail. They can change jobs, spouses, personalities. They can develop. They can die. That gives them a family resemblance to the characters of “David Copperfield” and “Pickwick Papers.” It makes them different from the characters of nighttime television. Can Mannix die? Can Kojak take a bribe? Can Cannon sleep with one of those charming women for whom he meals? Alas, no. But equally unthinkable things do come to pass on daytime drama. Soapland is full of female villains. The nastiest and most celebrated in recent years has been Rachel Davis Matthews Clark Frame of “Another World.” She caused Stephen Frame's current wife, Alice, to flee Bay City twice rather than face the tactics by which Rachel sought to recapture Steve. Victoria Wyndham, who plays Rachel, has been adding dimensions to her character since she took the role three years ago. Rachel is no longer merely a girl who turned bitchy because she grew up poor and fatherless. She is now visibly capable of real affection and love, and her marto wealthy older man has impelled her to acquire tastes for Mozart, Matisse and Chateau Margaux. She will undoubtedly get nasty again the next time she is deprived of love. It will be a challenge to Miss Wyndham and to Harding Leay, the head writer of “Another World,” to keep the acting and the writing improving then as they have through Rachel's mellowing. Some of the improvement in daytime drama has no doubt been caused by the infusions of realism. It must be easier to write and act well when some of the more ridiculous contortions of classical soap opera are eliminated. Certainly “As the World Turns,” the least realistic of all soaps, is also the worst theater on the air despite the presence of such genuine acting talents as Henderson Forsythe and Eileen Fulton. Their abilities cannot overcome the show's lethal combination of woodenness and melodrama. The formula apparently works, however, because “As the World Turns” is the most popular daytime serial on the air, with more than 10 million viewers and a 37 per cent share of all television sets Watching “As the World Turns” provides a good view of the classical conventions of soap opera, which used to be as rigid as those that governed Greek tragedy. The prime convention is the centering of each soap on two or three families. As the Athenians knew the house of Atreus and the house of Laius, so the viewers of “As the World Turns” know the Hugheses and the Stewarts. Grandpa Hughes was a farmer, his son Chris is a lawyer, Chris's son Bob is a doctor, and Bob's son Tom is a young lawyer. Judge Lowell is the grandfather of Ellen Stewart, whose husband David is a doctor, as is their son, Dan. Dan Stewart has two daughters, so the audience has come to know five generations of Stewarts and four of Hugheses. (This is possible because soap‐opera time is flexible. Children can be written out for months and return years older, even while it takes half an hour to close a door in a particular episode.) Other characters are either related (Kim Dixon, remember, is the sister of Bob Hughes's wife, Jennifer); divorced (Lisa Miller Hughes Shea was married to Bob long enough to give birth to Tom), or involved (Grant Coleman is Chris Hughes's partner and Dan One result of this endogamy is that many women in Soapland almost practice polyandry, collecting one husband after another from each of the clans, or choosing a brotherin‐law for a lover instead of the new mailman. That's why so many women characters in this article have multiple family names, one for each husband. Concentrating on a few families helps keep the payroll down and saves the viewer from the strain of having to meet new people too often. On “As the World Turns,” as on many daytime serials, law and medicine are the most populous professions, in keeping with the fact that most of the people of Soapland are upper‐middle‐class WASP's. Of course, a character who started on the wrong side of the tracks helps show how truly middle‐class everybody is. (This does reflect reality: most people in America label themselves middle‐class.) On “As the World Turns,” this function is fulfilled by Jay Stallings, who grew up rough and now runs a construction company. Jay asks Carol Hughes to help him overcome his deficiencies of taste in furnishing his new office. She objects to a couch but he likes it because “you look at it and you know it's expensive. I want to overwhelm people . . . ” By the program's standards, Jay “World” follows the classical soap‐opera convention that says women are stronger than men. The women create and solve the majority of problems (like Kim Dixon's incestuous misdeed and her sister's forgiveness). They discern moral imperatives through the dramatic haze and forgive masculine sins. They also provide most of the villainy. Lisa Shea fulfilled this function for years on “World” but, as she grew older, she and the attitudes of the other characters toward her both grew mellower. The villain on the program is now Susan Stewart, Dan's ex‐wife and a doctor herself—and a mother who neglects her child to pursue both her work and her former Many viewers love to hate these sexually conscious manipulators, and the actresses who play them have been slapped and cursed by strange women in public places. Eileen Fulton, who plays Lisa Shea, was one. Sometimes the reactions are quieter. Susan Lucci, who plays Erica on “All My Children,” was saying her penance after her real‐life confession in a New York church just before Christmas when two fans noticed her alone in the pew. One said, “Good heavens, look! Erica's actually praying.”) Despite female strength and female villainy, the women are strangely submissive to the men when it comes to the fundamental questions of society, like a married woman's working. On “As the World Turns,” no woman who is living happily with her husband has a job. On “Another World,” Lenore Delaney gave up her job when her husband said she had to choose between the job and him. But the forces of change are at work: It is already obvious that Lenore is headed back to work and her marriage to a breakup, though not necessarily in that order. Paul Rauch, the producer, claims a personal interest in this story line because his marriage broke up partly over his wife's inability to work while they were conforming to Procter & Gamble norms in Cincinnati. ('As the World Turns” is also Procter & Gamble, and four of the six P&G soap operas seem to me to be the least realistic of the 14 on the air, with the least liberation for Just as the god issued from the machine to resolve crises in Greek drama, so trauma and catastrophe leap from the forehead of the writer to shift plots in soap opera. Soapland trauma no longer runs to epidemics of hysterical blindness infecting one serial after another, as it did in James Thurber's day, but the medical encyclopedia begins with accidents and amnesia and runs on through exotics like the real syringomyelia and the pseudonymous Ubanda fever. Soap writers love illness, partly because it is so full of dramatic potential for the characters and their friends and families, partly because the audience includes many people in hospitals or at home besick. Apart from illness, a single copulation on serials like “As the World Turns” usually leads to the trauma of instant pregnancy, as it did with Bob Hughes and Kim Dixon. The rate of illegitimacy in this part of Soapland is still astonishingly high. Abortion is unwelcome. When Lisa Shea was just considering one, actress Eileen Fulton received a letter from an Iowa woman saying, “Don't you dare! If you must lose the baby, fall down the stairs or have a car accident.” In this case, it turned out to be a hysterical pregnancy, and no abortion was necessary. Crime is another common trauma, usually committed in such a way that an innocent person is charged and must be tried and cleared, as happened last year in “Search for Tomorrow.” The only evils that seldom befall soap characters are those caused by war, politics and economic crisis, but several soaps—including “As the World Turns” —have been making one‐line references recently to high prices and bad business conditions. “World” also provides some of the best examples of a convention common to both the classical and the modern varieties of serial—the high rate of lies and concealment. Lies can, of course, provide a basic vehicle for conflict. It's just that so many lies on TV seem silly and unnecessary, and are far too easily discovered. Why did Susan Stewart tell her boy friend, for instance, that she was going to do night work in the lab when she was really talking to her ex‐husband about their child? It was hardly an illicit errand, and the lie was discovered in the same half‐hour episode in which it was told—unusually fast action for a soap. Concealment, like Kim's and Jennifer's mutual attempt to hide knowledge of Kim's affair with Jennifer's husband, makes dramatic irony one of the principal techniques of soap opera: the audience knows something that most of the characters don't. The tortuous ways they find out are major ingredients in maintaining suspense from day to day. If lies and concealment are much more frequent than in real life, the time devoted to work and housework is much less. Nobody goes hungry for lack of money, but you seldom see people really at work, as distinct from talking about work. Doctors carry stethoscopes on “As the World Turns,” but hardly ever use them. Similarly, homes are so clean and neat that a viewer might think every family has a maid—but one never sees anyone make a bed. Exceptions usually provide a motif for a character. Nancy Hughes, the good wife and mother on “As the World Turns,” frequently bakes as she disadvice. These characteristics may explain why “World” has a much larger proportion of older people in its audience than the average soap opera, and a smaller proportion of young people. Producer Joe Willmore says the demographics are changing, but despite its overall popularity, “World” has a long way to go before it can catch up with “All My Children” and “The Young and the Restless” with younger viewers. “All My Children” has apparently become the favorite soap opera of college students —despite its realism, rather than because of it. George Forgie taught a seminar on the history of pop culture at Princeton a year ago. At the start, he asked the students what they thought about the syllabus. They told him he had devoted too much of it to “kid culture” and suggested that he include a soap opera because of its mass audience. They voted overwhelmingly for “Children.” Forgie says their motivation turned out to be the appeal of gossip, the desire to get involved with the lives and emotions of people close to their own age and outlook—without having responsibility for them. Susan Lucci, who went down for a session of the seminar, called it “a way of going home again without the pressure of really going home.” Forgie says that the students expressed a dislike of the social issues on the program, except for women students concerned with women's issues. Yet most were activists concerned with social issues in real life, not victims of the passivity and privatism reportedly widespread on today's campuses. Similar reactions to “Children:’ have been reported from as far afield as Northern Illinois University and U.C.L.A. University interest, in any case, is part of the evidence that soap opera has achieved a secure place in American culture. Henry F. Schwarz III, an anthropologist at Ohio State University, is sponsoring a conference on “All My Children” jointly with colleagues from the departments of theater and comparative literature in the belief that soap operas may fulfill the same functions for Americans that folk tales do for other peoples—providing models of problem‐solving and behavioral norms. Professors at M.I.T. and Stanford have confessed to being scheduling their classes around it. This may only be proof of the addictive nature of the art, of course—a possibility noted by adults in various professions who claim that soap opera is mind‐rotting even as they tune in regularly. Dan Wakefield is returning to nonfiction after two best‐selling novels to write a book about “All My Children.” “The best thing about it,” he confesses with a small grin, “is that it makes it legitimate for me to do something I would do anyway.” Even addictive fantasy has a kind of realism, according to Dr. John R. Lion, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland Medical School. He includes daytime TV drama among the techniques he uses with his patients, along with psychotherapy and psychodrama in which the patients can see themselves afterward on videotape. He believes that soaps enable viewers to see human beings “in a very emotional way, the way they really are,” and recommends them to patients with an “overglamorized view of the The viewers, of course, have no doubts about the central place of soap operas in their lives. Most of the mail that actors and producers talk about comes from people who have nobody to talk to except the characters they see on the screen. They tend to prefer the old‐fashioned morality of the classical soap and object, for instance, if a character who is a minister drinks a glass of beer on screen. They give high rankings to dramas that stick close to the classical canon, so that “As the World Turns” and “Another World” top the Nielson ratings. The three soaps with the highest proportion of realism in their fantasy ranked fifth, 10th and last on the list of 14 at the end of 1974. But there is another audience, one that stimulates Soapland to change as American society changes. A poll taken by the Screen Actors Guild in 22 daily newspapers in different parts of the country drew 10,079 responses. More than 86 per cent who responded said they would like to see actresses portraying women in professions. More than 68 per cent said they did not think that the images of women presented on TV were truthful and believable, and more than 85 per cent said they did not identify with women on soap operas. They wanted more realism. So did the Harlem widow who wrote Lin Bolen, NBC vice president for daytime programs, asking her to keep “How to Survive a Marriage” and “Somerset” on the air despite ratings difficulties ('How to Survive” will be dropped when “Days of Oul Lives” becomes an hour‐long show). Both shows have characters who are widows, and this woman wrote, “Widowhood is one of life's realities. I believe serials must become more contemporary and deal with today's world.” So do a lot of other people, from Agnes Nixon and Dorrie Kavanaugh out to the viewers raising their consciousness in Peoria. They are all ready to keep on bucking the soapopera tradition. ■ ‘I play a character as though she's liberated,’ says Dorrie Kavanaugh. ‘But she's 28 and lives with her parents.’"

Jesuit Scans Origin of Hitler Killings,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/25/archives/jesuit-scans-origin-of-hitler-killings.html,"ROME, March 24—A Roman Catholic theologian may have helped to foster the Nazi “mass‐murder ethics” that led from forced euthanasia to the mass killing of Jews in Hitler's extermination camps, according to a Jesuit historian. The scholar, the Rev. Robert A. Graham, traced the ideological roots of the gas chamber horrors in a study entitled “The ‘Right to Kill’ in the Third Reich—Prelude to Genocide.” The study was published in the latest issue of Civilta Cattolica, the leading magazine of the Society of Jesus, which appeared recently. Father Graham, an American specialist in World War II history, identified the theologian who apparently encouraged Nazi practices as Prof. Josef Mayer, a teacher of moral theology at the theological academy in Paderborn, Germany. The 20‐page article by the Jesuit scholar, who has access to the Vatican's secret archives, struck some readers as more than just a footnote to history. The study was published by Civilta Cattolica at a time when the church in several countries is fighting movements to liberalize laws regulating abortion and euthanasia. Gas Chambers Recalled Research by Father Graham yielded evidence that the Paderborn theologian wrote a report that may have prompted Hitler to go ahead with the elimination of the inmates of institutions for the mentally ill. More than 80,000, perhaps 100,000, Germans and Austrians—mental patients, epileptics and feeble‐minded or deformed persons—were killed in gas chambers, which were then and new, mostly in 1940 and 1941, the Jesuit historian wrote. “After 1941, the gas chambers and the crematoria were dismantled and sent to the east,” he said. “With them went the mad doctors and the graduates of the most sinister ‘medical schools’ in the history of humanity. It was an easy transition from mental and physical defectives to ailing concentration camp inmates and from them to other healthy but undesirable persons, with the crescendo at Auschwitz and its Jews.” If it was philosophically permissible to kill in the Nazi system, Father Graham asked, “why not take the occasion for ‘scientific’ experiments on even healthy bodies—young Russians, Jews, men, women, boys and girls?” The Jesuit scholar quoted Simon Wiesenthal, who tracks Nazi criminals from his private research center in Vienna, as describing the forcible mass euthanasia of Germans and Austrians under Hitler as “schools of genocide.” Many Doctors Punished Father Graham recalled that retribution eventually came for many of the persons most responsible for “this medical horror.” Hitler's personal physician, Karl Brandt, and other Nazi doctors were hanged. Hitler's euthanasia order was issued in October, 1939, after the successful end of the Polish military campaign, the Jesuit historian said, but it was predated to Sept. 1, the first day of World War II, “as though to indicate that it was connected with the war issues.” Investigating the preparation for the mass euthanasia program, Father Graham discovered testimony given by the former chief of the Roman Catholic section of the Nazi secret police, Karl Hard, at a war crimes trial in Limburg, West Germany, in 1967. The former Nazi official said that, on Hitler's order, he had asked the Paderborn theologian, Professor Mayer, for an expert opinion on the euthanasia question from the Catholic viewpoint. The theologian, the witness said, anticipated no fundamental objection from the church. According to the Nazi official, Hitler only then decided to start the euthanasia program. Earlier Writings Cited Earlier published views of the Paderborn theologian on sterilization and abortion, stressing eugenic considerations, the Jesuit wrote, leave little doubt that he could have given an opinion favorable to mass euthanasia. Father Graham expresses strong suspivion that Professor Mayer served as a Nazi informer throughout the war. The Jesuit said that the Paderborn theologian “misled the Nazi leaders” in his assessment of the foreseeable church reaction, and quoted Pope Pius XII, many German Catholic bishops and German Protestant leaders as condemming the euthanasia program. “The text of the alleged Mayer report has never been found,” Father Graham wrote. “It probably abounded, like his earlier sterilization and abortion, papers, with general references to St. Thomas Aquinas and oddities out of past history. We would like to think that the Paderborn paper had no real effect to encourage the doctors—all blue‐blood party members—to do what they might not otherwise have felt in conscience able to do.” Professor Mayer died in obscurity in southern Germany after World War II, The reasons why he left the Paderborn acacen??y are unclear, the Jesuit historian said."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/26/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor After seeing the results of the preliminary efforts of Congress to structure a tax‐rebate system to stimulate our recessionary economy, I see that Congress again is attempting to force discriminatory legislation upon the moderate‐ and high‐income families in the U.S. (in 1972, 14 per cent of U.S. families earned $20,000 a year or more and 30 per cent earned more than $15,000). Legislated economic discrimination is no more acceptable than the racial discrimination that has disrupted this democracy over the past twenty years. The moderate and upper income group is probably the largest unrepresented or misrepresented group in the U.S. today. We have seen in recent years that if you are organized or threaten social disruption the American political system responds via its philosophy of the path of least resistance. I believe the time is past due for the moderate‐ and upperincome groups to establish some leverage in this society. We must keep Congress from legislating the middle class out of existence and from removing the economic and social rewards of middle class. I recommend that we unite and inundate our Congressmen with demands for a fair rebate system. If these pleas are not heeded, I recommend, as a last resort, that we convince the Congress that we will place a greater percentage of our salaries in savings, which will effectively negate the expected economic benefit of the tax‐rebate system now under consideration. We must encourage and even force reconsideration of the discriminatory nature of this rebate plan Disparate Boycotts To the Editor: In a March 4 news article you quoted a frequently repeated Arab reference to the United States' boycott of Cuban goods in this country as the Arabs' justification for the blacklisting of companies which do business in Israel. The two are not comparable, and it seems to me that the use of comparisons which are not comparable reflect the kind of insincerity which troubles many people about the Arabs and their intentions. We do not, for example, boycott European or Arab companies which do business in Cuba. If the Arabs want to keep Israeli goods out of Arab countries, that is their business. What outrages decent people everywhere is their blacklist of American or European firms which are not themselves involved in hostilities against Arab nations. This is economic extortion, pure and simple, the kind of arrogant and irresponsible use of power which should cause grave concern to any thoughtful person contemplating the growth of Arab wealth through another form of extortion directed against the oil‐consuming world. MIKE STEIN Great Neck, L. I., March 15, 1975 • ‘Arbiters of Mediocrity’ To the Editor: I cannot help but be awed by men capable of conjuring the notion of erecting a studio‐apartment tower on Dangerous Marijuana To the Editor: Opponents of present marijuana laws are gaining ground by citing studies that appear to refute the mass of evidence against the drug, but these studies invariably miss either or both of two points: The effects of marijuana take time to accumulate, and selected groups of subjects may not experience the effects that occur in most users. The active ingredient, THC, lingers in the body; 40 to 45 per cent of it remains after four days; 30 to 35 per cent after seven days, with slow elimination thereafter. Persisting brain burdens of THC account for impaired brain functions. Several investigators have observed chromosome breakage from exposure to marijuana smoke. One study reported no such effect, but its method was faulty. The effect was observed after months or years of even occasional marijuana use; the negative result was reported when blood cells were collected 2½ hours after a group of marijuana users increased their usage for a few days. Naturally, no increase in chromosome breakage appeared so promptly. Most men who use marijuana show reduced male hormone levels and lowered sexuality. Defenders of marijuana cite the one study that found normal levels in a group of 27 men chosen for their “good health” from more than 300 applicants. Selection of the healthiest 9 per cent invalidated the and encourage an equitable and productive tax‐rebate plan from Con. gress. After all, we did pay a large percentage of the taxes in question. This is not an unpatriotic effort to foil the efforts to shore up the economy, which we all support, but rather an attempt to bring to the attention of Congress our dissatisfaction in having a specific income group bearing a continually increasing burden of the economic and social problems of our country. Congress must be discouraged from taking advantage of any group because it merely lacks the organized political, social or economic impact to protect itself. No one in the U.S., not even the middle class, should have to protect himself from his own Government. R. T. McCoox Hewitt, N. J., March 19, 1975 Fifth and 82d [news story March 17]. True arbiters of mediocrity, their kind are the money‐lenders near the temples of our time. I wonder on which project they will next embark—a McDonald's next to Cartier, perhaps? FRANK M. CANOSA New York, March 17, 1975 • Amtrak Penalty To the Editor: A practice of which your readers may be unaware came to my attention yesterday as I rode the Amtrak Metroliner to Philadelphia. The seat in front of me was occupied by a student in jeans. When the conductor looked at his ticket, he said, “Oh, oh. This is for the train that left an hour earlier. Did you cancel and make a new reservation?” When the student said no, the conduc. for said, “I have to charge you $5.” There was a good deal of talk about this, including the student's remark that it was his last $5, but the conductor finally got it, and I watched this rip‐off with much sympathy for the victim. It was not, of course, the conductor's fault. He was simply enforcing the rule imposed on him. But the train was not full, and since the student had paid his full fare, it could not in this case have been a matter of inconvenience to the line to have him occupying a seat. Wouldn't a fine of, say, $2.50 make the point sufficiently? JOHN PHILLIPS New York, March 14, 1975 result. Brain damage from persistent use has been reported by several investigators but denied by marijuana users. The problem is that impairment prevents recognition of the impairment. Only after several months of abstinence do users recognize their previous loss. A study of marijuana (ganja) use in Jamaica that claimed to prove no harmful effects has been thoroughly discredited by Dr. John A. S. Hall, chairman of the Department of Medicine at Kingston Hospital, Jamaica, who found that the selection with which the study was done was faulty. He observed “20 per cent impotence . . . among males who have smoked ganja for five or more years” and reported that “personality changes among ganja smokers . .. are a matter of common observation in Jamaica.” Among the symptoms were apathy, retreat from reality and the incapacity or unwillingness for sustained concen A much more extensive and scientific study in Egypt clearly showed a wide range of adverse effects. Defenders of marijuana choose to ignore this study. Legislators should weigh these facts before weakening laws that have deterred some young people from endangering their future. (Prof.) HARDIN B. JONES Medical Physics and Physiology University of California Berkeley, Calif., March 18, 1975 ‘We Must Stockpile Rail Rights‐of‐Way’ To the Editor: The U.S.RA. railway reorganization plan published Feb. 26 proposes a massive abandonment of thousands of miles of rail line in the Northeast. Doubtless, all of this trackage earns no profits today, and probably the public has no need for most of it to route current traffic. However, the handwriting of energy scarcity is on the wall. We will be fools not to foresee the future need to transfer much highway and air traffic to the steel wheel the steel rail. We can't predict how much freight tonnage and passenger‐seat mileage must thus transfer, or when the rerouting must occur, or exactly which of our now underused or nonused rail traffic lanes we must reactivate. But we can predict the enormous trouble and cost we will meet if we must recreate these traffic lanes; if we must hack them out anew from the jungle of urban sprawl and population growth which will obliterate them once the rights‐of‐way are abandoned and the. underlying land is sold for nontransportation use. Think of the decades of condemnation proceedings, public hearings, neighborhood protests and political debates which had to precede the interstate highways. Think also of the billions of dollars for man‐hours these preliminaries cost the taxpayers. Do we want to repeat this waste when we come to reactivate the dormant lanes in our Northeastern rail system? The answer must be a Federal rail system land bank. Just as we stockpile other scarce and necessary items in our national economy, we must stockpile unused rail rights‐of‐way Such a Federal land bank can lend its assets, in the form of short‐term land leases, in the interim when we don't need these rights‐of‐way. At the same time, such a land bank can assure us of the immediate and inexpensive retrieval of these traffic lanes when the logic of energy scarcity compels us to rebuild the rail system. If we buy these rights‐of‐way today we can purchase cheap and sell dear for today their owners must concede that this land has no capacity to earn. a net transportation dollar, but we know it will be invaluable tomorrow. WILLIAM. Q. KEENAN New York, March 18, 1976 • Abortion and Medicaid To the Editor: In an upcoming vote on S.66, a major health bill, the U.S. Senate will be asked to consider an amendment introduced by Senator Bartlett of Oklahoma that would prohibit the direct or indirect use of Federal money for abortion services except when a wow an's life is endangered. The Bartlett amendment would eliminate Medicaid payments to low‐income women seeking abortions. Between 220,000 and 280,000 women annually now receive Medicaid reimbursements for abortions The amendment also would bring up some complex administrative issues, since many hospitals, health centers, medical schools and universities receive Government funds. It is not clear whether abortions could be performed in hospitals receiving Federal funds or whether medical students could be trained in abortion techniques. Not only would the amendment establish a two‐class system of medical care, it would deny women their constitutional right to abortion. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that women have a right to abortion as a right of privacy. An official report of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued in December 1974 found that implementation of the Bartlett amendment would result in 125 to 250 deaths annually from self‐induced abortions and the hospitalization of approximately 25,000 women due to self= induced abortions. The report also noted that forcing women to carry their pregnancies to term would cost the Federal Government between $450‐million and $565 million for medical care and public assistance in the first year after birth. The Federal Govern ment now spends $50 million on Medicaid reimbursements for abortions. Passage of the Bartlett amendment would not eliminate abortions, but it would prevent poor women from having safe and medically sound abo?? tions. Congress should vote to make all women equal under the law by voting to defeat the Bartlett amendment. WERNER FORNQS Exec. Dir., Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Inc.

Lady Violet Bonham Carter became a leading figure in the Liberal party and from 1945 to 1947 served as president of the Liberal party organization but was never leader of the party. The holder of that office is chosen from among the members of either house of Parliament—today always a member of the House of Commons. Lady Violet sought election to the House of Commons more than ones but without success, and when she became a member of the House of Lords she was past eligibility for the leadership.

Canadian Court Upholds Abortion Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/27/archives/canadian-court-upholds-abortion-curb.html,"MONTREAL, March 26—The Supreme Court of Canada, in a landmark decision regarded as a defeat for women's rights groups, today upheld the couninterpretation of the country's five‐year‐old abortion law. The law which represented is substantial liberalization at the time of its enactment in late 1969, permits a doctor to perform an abortion only in a licensed hospital and only after a special committee of doctors at the hospital has agreed that “the continuation of the pregnancy would be likely to endanger” the woman's “life or health.” The court's ruling ended more than a year of litigation in the case of Dr. Henry Morgentaler, a Montreal physician who has become the hero of the abortion‐on‐demand movement. The case has prompted a national debate reaching onto the floor of the House of Commons in Ottawa. Dr. Morgentaler, who said before his arrest in 1973 that he had performed 5,000 abortions, is expected now to begin serving an 18‐month prison sentence. But the court'' split decision votes to 3, with Chief Justice Bora Laskin among the dissenters—reflected the continuing disagreement on the emotional issue, and opponents of the law said that the battle was far from over. “Dr. Morgentaler in jail is a lot more dangerous than Dr. Morgentaler free.” declared Claude Sheppard, his lawyer, predicting that a “wave of indignation at Parliament and the criminal code” would force liberalization of the law. Among the opponents of the rules as they are presently applied is the president of the Canadian Medical Association, who has accused the Federal Minister of Justice, a Roman Catholic father of seven children, of allowing his personal views on abortion to color his administration of the law. Interpretation of the meaning of the term “health”—physical. mental, emotional—in the abortion law is at the heart of the dispute between Dr. Bette Stephenson, the head of the medical association, and Justice Minister Otto E. Lang. Dr. Stepenson favors a broad definition of the term which would permit more legal, therapeutic abortions. She charges that Mr. Lang is taking advantage of the law's vagueness to make “veiled threats of legal action” against doctors. Mr. Lang who considers his religion and the size of his family irrelevant to the issue, has declared that “the decision should not be made solely in relation to social and economic wellbeing.” Dr. Morgentaler, a Polishborn general practitioner who spent part of his youth as an inmate at the Auschwitz concentration camp, ran an abortion clinic in a workingclass neighborhood of Montreat, taking referrals from scores of other doctors. “The only moral course was to disregard the law,” he once explained. “There is nothing that will ever convince me that this is a crime.” The abortion for which he was convicted was performed lin September, 1973, on an unmarried 26‐ year ‐ old student from Sierra Leone. In his first round in court. Dr. Morgentaler was acquitted but the Quebec Court of Appeals reversed that decision and the Supreme Court today upheld the reversal."
Law Parley Finds Women Lagging in Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/27/archives/law-parley-finds-women-lagging-in-rights.html,"PALO ALTO, Calif., March 4—Courts and legislatures have dramatically changed the legal status of women in recent years, bringing it far closer to that of men. But a substantial gap remains, with women around the country sometimes denied rights that men have, other times given different rights. A thousand lawyers and law students, nearly all of them “omen, reviewed the progress to date and the problems remaining during the National Conference on Women and the Law here this weekend. They found both gains and gaps in areas as diverse as employment and taxation, in situations ranging from that of women as parents and women as victims of crime. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Colurnbia Law School professor who has argued most of the recent major sex discrimination cases before the Supreme Court, put it this way: “Realizing the equality principle will require a long and persistent effort, after the adjficial barriers are removed, to prevent perpetuation of the effects of past discrimination long into the future.” Among the major areas covered were the following: THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYS‐TEM Last week the Supreme Court handed the women's movement one of its most significant court victories to date; a unamimous ruling that the Social Security law's system of denying child care benefits to the spouse of a deceased female wage earner, while providing those benefits to the spouse of a deceased male wage earner, was unconstitutional. Most of the Supreme Court Justices, according to Professor Ginsburg, who argued the case, appeared to base their decision largely on the fact that the law denigrated the work of women—Providing less protection for the families of women wage earners than for the families of men wage earners. The Social Security law has other features, however, which also treat women workers differently from men workers. One of those, in the view of women's rights proponents, is the Social Security System's failure to provide any independent coverage for women who work in the home, as ho usewives, as opposed to in the market place. Another is the effect of provisions covering two‐earner families, with both husband and wife contributing through Social Security payments during their working lives. A husband and wife “who work through their lives might have less money on retirement than a one earner family with the same income” as a result of those provisions, Margaret Gates, director of the center for women's policy studies in Washington told participants the conference. Still another feature of the Social Security System pro vides that people who leave the work force for five years are not entitled to receive disability benefits until they have re‐entered the work force and worked another five years. Said Professor Ginsburg, this “ignores the fact' that most women have intervals in their working careers when they drop out of full‐time work in order to bear and rear children.  The Advisory Council on Soial Security, appointed last year and required to report regularly on the system to both Congress and the President, has recommended removing some but not all of the features that critics consider discriminatory. TAXATION According to Susan Spivack, a visiting professor at Stanford and a panelist at the conference here, several aspects of the tax system “operate to make it disadvantageous for the secondary wage earner to work” —and the secondary wage earner, the one who earns less than the wage earner in the family, is most often the wife. Among other things, there are strict limitations on deductions for the costs of child care incurred when a mother goes to work outside the home, and the progressive tax rate, when combined with the system of aggregating the incomes of the husband and wife, can also work to create what Professor Spivak called a “disincentive” to women would‐be workers. THE JURY SYSTEM Women are now entitled to serve on juries in Federal as well as state courts. This is a relatively new right, in that a few states continued to exclude women from their courts' juries even into the nineteen‐sixties, and that until 1957, the right to serve on a jury in a Federal District Court depended on the law of the state in which the court sat. Last January, the Supreme Court, in the case of Tawlor v. Louisiana, struck down Louisiana's system of reouiring women, but not men, to “affirmatively register” if they wanted to serve as jurors. The Court said that exempting women from jury service solely because of their sex violated a defendant's right under the Sixth Amendment to have a jury drawn from a cross‐section of the community. However, according to one of the panelists at the conference—Liz Schneider of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York—the Tay lor case may not have as broad an effect as women's rights advocates would like. The facts in the Taylor case were particularly strong, she said, with no women at all in the jury pool used in the case involved in the court's decisions; it is thus possible that the decision wilt not be applied in cases where at least some women are in the pool. Even if all affirmative registration systems are struck down, moreover, according to Rhonda Copelon, another lawyer at the center, other discriminatory features of the jury system remain. Among them: laws in four states that grant an absolute exemption to women, which they can claim if they wish; exemptions in many Federal courts and some state courts for women with children, regradless of whether or not the woman actually needs to be at home to take care of the children. EMPLOYMENT Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment opportunity covered by the act and a number of suits have been brought and either won or successfully settled under the act, often with affirmative action programs. But the recession is threatening some of those gains — particularly through the so‐called “LIFO” system, or “last in first out,” provided for in some labor contracts. PREGNANCY The law relating to pregnancy has likewise seen some changes, but nowhere near as many as women's rights leaders would like. The Supreme Court's rulings invalidating anti‐abortion laws were one major gain. Another was the Court's invalidation of a required maternity leave at four months of pregnancy for public school teachers in Cleveland. However, the Court in another case refused to strike down a provision of California's disability insurance system that denied payments for disabilities of normal pregnancies. A similar pattern is seen in other areas as well. Marilyn G. Haft, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's sexual privacy project, noted during the conference that the courts in a few states have found that prostitution laws are unconstitutional to the extent that they provide only for the prosecution of women prostitutes, not of male prostitutes or customers of prostitutes. Judge Lisa Richette of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, noted that some jurisdictions are easing the burden of proof required in rape cases, a burden that has traditionally been higher than in other types of cases. EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT The rights amendment, if passed, is expected to do much to change this pattern of scattered gains and lingering discrimination. As for the reasons underlying the pattern, lawyers suggest that at least some of the gains to date have come because the various laws involved have been so blatantly discriminatory—“easy cases,” in lawyers' terminology. Professor Ginsburg suggested an additional reason: There is a certain ambivalence in the society, she said, and courts, including the Supreme Court reflect it: “Conditions of contemporary life demand recognition that distinct roles for men and women coerced or steered by law are antithetical to the American ideal of freedom of choice for the individual. But action based on that recognition is deterred by fear—fear of unsettling familiar and, for many men and women, comfortable patterns.”"

The tour was called off Thursday because the program included a song expressing determination “to liberate Taiwan.” At a Washington news conference, William Hinton, chairman of the United States‐China People's Friendship Association, said the United States had recognized in the Shanghai communiqué that Taiwan was a part of China. Mr. Hinton said his organization had 45 local branches, seeking full diplomatic and trade relations with China and was newer than the National Committee nn United States China Relations, sponsors of the tour, but had helped sell tickets for it. The group was to appear at the Brooklyn Acadof Music, April 16–19. • John W.

The former White House counsel and Watergate witness made the statement at Santa Ana College in California. A spokesman for his hooking agency, the American Program Bureau, said yesterday the Coast engagement merely ended a segment of the tour, with a hiatus to allow Mr. Dean to work on his book. At Georgia State University yesterday, a coalition of civilliberties groups said the student government should “sponsor the victims, not the architects, of Watergate.” Marshall Trawick, speakers' chairman, disagreed. “We pay rock ‘n’ roll groups $10,000 and draw smaller crowds than we'll get for Dean,” he said. • Former Gov.

The Sentence,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/30/archives/the-sentence.html,"Dr. Henry Morgentaler is a Montreal physician who says he has performed more than 5,000 abortions at his own clinic. Under Canada's abortion law, abortions may be performed only at a licensed hospital, and then only when a committee of doctors has agreed that the pregnancy is “likely to endanger life or health.” Dr. Morgentaler was arrested for violating the law in 1973, and began a two‐year legal fight which eventually went to the Supreme Court of Canada. Now the Court has upheld his conviction, opting for a strict interpretation of the abortion statute. Though Dr. Morgentaler must now serve an 18‐month prison term, his supporters vow to intensify their struggle for further liberalized legislation. “Dr. Morgentaler in jail,” said his lawyers, “is a lot more dangerous than Dr. Morgentaler free.”"
Hospital in Brooklyn Open Despite Accreditation Loss,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/hospital-in-brooklyn-open-despite-accreditation-loss-linden.html,"Linden General Hospital, a 78‐bed private health facility in a rundown part of Brooklyn's East New York section, has lost its accreditation and been declared hazardous, unneeded and irremediably obsolete by government inspectors. But the hospital continues to function because of an unabated flow of Government Medicaid payments that are its main source of support. The proprietary, or profitmaking, hospital receives as much as 75 per cent of its income from Medicaid, which pays for health care of the poor. Last year $1,039,910.30 in Medicaid funds went to Linden General. In addition, the hospital also received $193,600 from Medicare, which pays for the health care of the aged, in 1974. Art investigation by The New York Times of official files, and interviews with city, state and Federal officials indicate that not only has there been uncertainty in government about who should act about the situation at Linden General, but also that there is uncertainty even about which agency is responsible for passing information on to those who are supposed to act. Government handling of the Linden General case “indicates a total breakdown of the inspection process,” said Donald Rubin, president of a consumer watchdog group called the Consumer Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals. “Government money is being paid to unapproved institutions. The expenditure of Federal funds requires public safeguards.” On Feb. 8, 1974, inspectors from the State Department of Health reported after a visit to the two‐story brick Linden General building at 501 New Lots Avenue that the hospital had serious fire safety violations, inadequate toilet facilities and poor sanitation. “Patients are wheeled out from the O.R. [operating room] right past dirty linen collection bags and trash containers,” the inspectors said. Their report concluded: “The building is not amenable to correction . . . even if funds were available to do so.” On May 14, 1974, after another inspection, Dr. Leon R. Lezer, a Health Department inspector, reported: “There is a nonfunctioning medical staff at this hospital. . . . The hospital is surviving currently through apparent excessive hospitalization for tonsillectomy and through abortions on a demand basis.” Dr. Lezer's report said the conditions at Linden General created a situation “that is not only a serious one with the respect to the protection of the public health, but is virtually an irremediable situation.” “It is recommended,” Dr. Lezer concluded, “that this facility be closed with all deliberate speed.” Instead of being closed by the State Health Department, however, Linden General routinely was given a full twoyear renewal of its operating certificate on Aug. 1, 1974. Why? An internal State Health Department memorandum dated Aug. 20, 1974, from Robert Dougherty, project review coordinator in the state agency's New York City office, said the certificate had been issued “due to lack of information available to me on the actual status of affairs at this facility.” After the Linden General certificate slipped though routinely, Mr. Dougherty set up a new system of checking with other parts of the Health Department before issuing certificates. But no effort was made to revoke the Linden General certificate even after the conditions there were known. Asked why, Mr. Dougherty said in an interview the other day, “It really doesn't make that much difference.” He said there would have to be a long hearing before the certificate could be revoked and then the hospital could go On through court proceedings that could easily eat up the two years. That attitude has been challenged by Donald Rubin's consumer watchdog group. Most nongovernment hospitals in the nation are surveyed for accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, a private, Chicago‐based concern that is supported by the fees that it charges the hospitals it surveys. By law a hospital is deemed; to be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid funds if it is accredited by the Joint Commission.; Because of deficiencies, Linden General was declared nonaccredited after a joint Commission survey on March 6, 1973. The Joint Commission will not disclose what specific deficiencies it finds, however, declaring that to be a private matter between itself and the hospital. Because government funds are disbursed on the basis of the Joint Commission's findings, the commission is supposed to notify government officials when a hospital is not up to standard. But because Linden General requested a review of the findings, the Joint Commission considered the hospital “administratively accredited” pending the outcome of the review. Joint Commission officials declined, however, to disclose if they notified the government of the move to “administrative accreditation.” Government officials interviewed were uncertain how or when they heard of the nonaccreditation. Apparently the government learned of the nonaccreditation only inadvertently. A City Department of Health inspector making a routine visit to Linden General in July, 1973,—shortly before the state took over inspections of private hospitals—found records to indicate that the Joint Commission accreditation was denied after the March survey. The city inspector noted that it was a violation of the Hospital Code not to notify the Health Department when the Joint Commission accreditation was denied. Perhaps because the state was about to take over the private hospital inspections—the state took over in Septem ber—the city took no further action on the loss of accreditation beyond telling Linden General that failing to report was a violation. “I really can't remember at all when I found out about Linden General,” Douglas R. Eitel, director of the State Health Department's bureau of hospital certification, said in an interview. “We had heard that this hospital had lost its accreditation. I'm not sure from where, but I believe it was Baltimore.” Baltimore is the headquarters of the Federal Government's Bureau of Health Insurance, which disburses Medicare funds. If it is notified that a hospital has been nonaccredited by the Joint Commission it requests a full survey by the State Health Department to validate those findings and to determine whether Government funds should be withheld. On April 19, after going through the city files and finding the report that Linden General had been nonaccredited. Mr. Rubin, the president of the consumer watchdog group, wrote the Bureau of Health Insurance requesting a validation survey. The bureau passed the request on to the State Health. Department where there was some apparent confusion about Linden General's status. An internal Health Department memorandum to Dr. Donald Dickson, then the deputy commissioner in charge of preventive services and medical care, from Dr. Richard Nauen, the associate commissioner in charge of the agency's office of New York City affairs, said that a letter from the Joint Commission to Linden General indicated the facility was “administrativelty accredited.” The memo continued: “However, we were advised by Mr. Eitel [of the Department's Albany office] who also talked, with Chicago, that they are nonaccredited . . . It is still not clear in our minds . . . as to whether or not Linden General Hospital is accredited or nonaccredited. To date, we have not received official notice.” Dr. Nauen said in an interview that he soon received word from the Bureau of Elealth Insurance on the hospital's nonaccreditation, apparently after Mr. Rubin's letter. Linden General, according to Elealth Department files, was started about 40 years ago. From 1950 to 1970 it was operated by Benjamin Scharfstein. Mr. Scharfstein sold out his controlling interest in the hospital to a dentist in 1970, who, in turn, sold his interest to two doctors in 1973, who put themselves on the payroll at $1,000 a week each. Prior – approval of hospital transfers is required by the State Health Department. But no such approval appears to have been given here. On Sept. 12, 1973, Judge Orrin G. Judd in Federal Court ruled the sale illegal and ordered control of the hospital returned to Mr. Scharfstein. Although Mr. Scharfstein had regained control he said the hospital was in bad shape economically and in December he filed for bankruptcy. He said he could not meet the demands of his creditors, which included drug houses, the union pension fund, a guard service and even a company that piped in music for the patients. In testimony before Bankruptcy Judge Manuel J. Price in Brooklyn Federal Court Mr. Scharfstein pleaded for time to work out a settlement. “It's difficult to operate a hospital,” he testified on Jan. 17, 1974, “when you answer every phone call and it's a creditor.” Mr. Scharfstein was ordered by the court to set up two separate bank accounts, one for the taxes he deducted from employes' paychecks and another for general operating expenses. He was directed not to use the money in the tax account for any other purpose. At least once Judge Price had to reprimand the hospital for using the tax money for general purposes. The judge threatened to shut down the hospital immediately if the practice recurred. The bankruptcy case is still open in Federal court and Linden General still has not offered a plan on how to deal with its creditors. The hospital has pleaded for more time and early this year Jay S. Zimmet, Linden General's accountant, testified that there were encouraging signs. He urged the judge not to close down Linden General because he said he had been assured a new rate from Blue Cross for the patients covered by the insurance plan. The new rate would be $100.88 per inpatient day, Mr. Zimmet testified, up from $81 in 1974. Blue Cross last year paid $266,196.29 to Linden General. In addition, Mr. Zimmet testified, he is expecting a Medicaid rate of $110 a patient day. “Medicaid is the key,” Mr. Zimmet said because it is responsible for most of Linden General's income. Judge Price said in an interview that he was not pressing the hospital too hard for a plan on how to pay the creditors because they themselves were not pushing for their money. Creditors have been reluctant to strive too hard for fear of closing the hospital, which would be worth little if it were not an operating institution with Government funds flowing into it. Judge Price said that from the testimony the hospital seemed to be having success in getting more money from the Government. The “key” Medicaid rate that was expected in testimony at $110, however, has turned out to be $95.84. Blue Cross officials said the rate they actually were paying at Linden General was $95.64 and not the $100.88, as testified. Although not quite as impressive as depicted in the bankruptcy testimony, the payments to Linden General have continued to climb based on the hospital's operating costs. In 1973 Blue Cross was paying Linden General only $73 a patient day and Medicaid was paying $80.14. Last June another complete survey of Linden General was made by the Joint Commission at Mr. Scharfstein's request. The hospital failed that resurvey. according to Miss Nora C. O'Malley, assistant program director of the Joint Commission. In August the Joint Commission's accreditation committee voted nonaccreditation for Linden General. The hospital was told of that decision on Aug. 28 and given 20 days to appeal. No appeal was made, Miss O'Malley said, and on Nov. 15 notification that Linden General was nonac credited went out to the Federal Bureau of Health Insurance and the State Health Department. There is no requirement that accreditation be made part of a bankruptcy trial. Judge Price said he had no idea the hospital was not accredited. The issue had not come up in the testimony that has gone on for over a year. Last Dec. 4, Dr. Frank T. Cicero, the acting deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Health wrote the Federal Bureau of Health Insurance recommending that Linden General no longer be approved for Medicare payments. That action would also make it ineligible for Medicaid payments because the Medicaid people rely on the recommendations to Medicare rather than institute their own duplicating surveys. Dr. Cicero wrote again to the Bureau of Health Insurance on Feb. 28, saying that the hospital had offered a plan for reconstruction to correct some of the building deficiencies, but that the other difficulties “result in our continued recommendation for [not acceptable] classification.” Although the hospital offered a plan for rehabilitating its aging building, it gave no indication how much the rehabilitation would cost or where the money would come from in an institution in bankruptcy proceedings. Any such plan of hospital construction must be approved by the state. Approval must first come from another arm of the health network, the Health and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New York. Inc. The council Is a quasipublic group—made up of representatives of physicians, hospitals, philanthropies, insurance carriers, community; labor and management groups—that was set up by law to advise the Health Commissioner on the hospital needs of the area. In a report last June the council said that Linden General and 10 other “small obsolete Hospitals” in Brooklyn should be closed because there was an oversupply of beds in the borough. The council's report said that keeping Linden General and other inefficient institutions open could waste limited health care funds. Despite the deficiencies and the lack of need for hospital beds the money has not stopped flowing into Linden General. Blue Cross said in a statement that it was “continuing this hospital's membership [in Blue Cross] in the same fashion as the State Health Department has been continuing its operating certificate.” Bureau of Health Insurance officials say that cutting off Government funds now with hospitals so dependent on that money would be tantamount to closing a hospital. Asked about Government funds continuing to go to Linden General when deficiencies have been reported for such a long period, Milton Webber, regional program officer for the bureau, said: “We don't want to do anything prematurely. We have never closed a hospital.” Linden General is built on a trapezoid‐shaped lot bounded by Bradford Street and New Lots, Miller and Riverdale Avenues. The area around the hospital has many abandoned buildings. Patients can look out the windows across New Lots Avenue into a whole row of abandoned and vandalized stores. On the outside Linden General has window sashes where the paint is almost completely peeled off and some of the sashes are so rotted they are propped up in place with sticks. There has been an attempt to modernize the new entrance with large white plastic letters spelling out the hospital's name. The plastic D already is missing. One of the arguments for keeping Linden General open is that the hospital provides jobs in a depressed area where there is little other employment. One of the creditors to Linden General is Local 144 of the Hotel, Hospital, Nursing Home and Allied Health Services Union, whose members have not been getting the wages their contract entitles them to. Frank Perez, a Local 144 business agent, says some 60 members, mostly from the neighborhood, who do nonmedical and housekeeping jobs, are being paid only an average of $150 a week at Linden General although they have been entitled under the contract to $171 since last July. “We'd like to see the hospital stay open to provide jobs, but not if our members aren't paid,” Mr. Perez said in an interview. “It seems like a lost cause now at Linden General.” Reached at his home in Hollywood, Fla., Mr. Scharfstein angrily declined to discuss anything about Linden General on the telephone. “I don't have to give you any answers,” he told a reporter. “It's none of your business.” He said he might discuss the hospital's situation sometime when he returned to New York, but he declined to set a date."
Reagan vs. ‘McGovernment’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/reagan-vs-mcgovernment.html,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.—Many of the people in this retirement capital believe that the policies and the candidates so overwhelmingly rejected by the American electorate in 1972 have now taken control in Washington. “McGovernment” is upon us. The President Is under the control of Congress; the Congress is under the control of the Democratic majority; the Democratic majority is under the control of “King Caucus”; and the caucus is—if not under the control of —at least heavily influenced by the liberal freshmen Congressmen and the few pros who exploit them. Thus, government seems to be dominated by a Watergate‐backlash faction against the majority opinion as expressed in the most recent Presidential election. Such a separation between governing and governed is rarely acknowledged in Washington. But in this un‐Southern state of Florida, more than a little resentment runs against the consequences of withdrawal and weakness in Southeast Asia. More directly, the people who voted against the redistribution of income promised by McGovernment are now angry at seeing it come to pass. Instead of a one‐shot tax‐cut stimulus to the economy, there is justified suspicion that we are warring on poverty again by introducing poverty to the lower middle class. More directly, unemployment may get the media attention, but inflation is still the villain with older Americans; at long last, inflation has begun to slow down, and if it is re‐ignited by a budget deficit that can be blamed on McGovernment, there will be political hell to pay. Such resentment always presents a political opportunity, which is what is causing the thunder on the political right. Conventional wisdom has been that conservatives are upset with President Ford's attempt to compromise and therefore are thinking of bolting into a third party, or rising up to unseat him at the next convention of the Republican Party. That misreads the fundamental conflict. The real argument is not whether the Republican Party should be centrist, with the widest “me‐too” appeal, versus rightist, “standing up for principle.” That is what some right‐wing ideologues claim, and some liberal commentators give them serious coverage, hoping the Goldwater debacle of 1964 will happen again. Today's difference of opinion on the political right is not whether or not to be a purist minority, but how best to construct—or reconstruct— a hew majority. One body of conservative opinion—best reflected by President Ford and the men around him—takes the middleof‐the‐spectrum approach to gaining majority, which worked for President Eisenhower. For Republicans, however, this requires a popular hero, which President Ford is not. The other conservative opinion—being led by, or using as its leader, Ronald Reagan—takes the approach to building a majority which worked in the last Presidential election. In public speeches, Governor Reagan may toss out the red meat of principle, denouncing “blurred images,” which whips up his audience and guarantees attention from all who want to see him clash with President Ford. But in all those speeches, and especially in private conversation, he argues that “the mandate of 1972 still stands.” “Yes, we must broaden our base,” Mr. Reagan says, always adding, “as we broadened it in 1972.” He never fails to remind his audiences that he was once a Democrat himself, that dissatisfaction with “Big Govern ESSAY ment” caused him to switch, that redink budgets cause the hated inflation. His message is not a purist “come over to the conservative side”; rather it is “I'm the one talking your language.” On St. Patrick's Day, for example, the newspaper column that appeared under the Reagan byline blasted abortion and praised the jury that convicted Boston's Dr. Kenneth Edelin. Abortion is a vote‐switching issue, and Mr. Reagan's stand will make inroads into a group that pollsters identify as conservative Democrats. Too many kooks could spoil Mr. Reagan's broth, just as the undercurrent of racism spoils Mr. Wallace's Mom‐and‐Populism. But personal, economic and social issues could once again upset traditional political alignments. Enter the useful villain of McGovernment. If Mr. Ford's conciliatory efforts to win centrist support avail him naught, he will look for a natural point of entry to signal an all‐out attack on isolationism and inflationary spending. That might be at the 1976 Republican Convention, which he could “throw open”—to let the delegates choose their own “New Majority” candidate for Vice President."
Powerful and Effective,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/powerful-and-effective.html,"Earl William Brydges was one of the most powerful and effective leaders of the State Legislature in the years before. his retirement as Senate majority leader in 1972. In seven years in the Republican leadership post he had directed the fate—death, delay or passage—of innumerable bills while managing to maintain a reputation of fairness among friends and political foes alike. When he announced his retirement for reasons of health, after 24 years in the Senate, colleagues accorded him an emotional bipartisan farewell. A key to his power had beea in his control of large sums of money to the 31 standing committees of the Senate, and his right to appoint the standing committee chairmen. But his main hold on Republican lawmakers was, as former Senator Joseph Zaretzki, the Democrat leader, once said, “simply through affection.” Another was his sparing use of the prerogatives of position of majority leader and president pro tern of the Senate. Rather than speak on each major bill up for a vote, Mr. Brydges frequently delegated the summation speech to a Senator who had some connection with the legislation. His flashes of wit and colorful quotations often delighted his colleagues. Once, in the midnineteen‐sixties, after Democrats had taken control of the Legislature after three decades and were basking in their power, he taunted them with the words of Kipling: If the Aunt of the Vicar Has never touched Iiquor Beware when she tastes champagne. A Succesful Lawyer Mr. Brydges never held any other political job. He was a successful lawyer‐from Niagara Falls when elected to the State Senate in 1948. He withstood the electoral landslide for President Johnson that toppled many of the upstate colleagues in 1964 when many Johnson voters split their tickets to vote for him. That victory followed a heart attack suffered by the Senator two years before, from which he recovered to fight for the seat. Mr. Brydges had first gained prominence in Albany in the fifties as a member of the commission that revised the State Education Law, a field in which he was an acknowledged authority. As Majority Leader he defended former Governor Rockefeller's budgets, sometimes in the face of opposition among, conservatives in his own party, although Republicans contended that he was one of the few close to Mr. Rockefeller who was not afraid to disagree with him. Mr. Brydges was a foe of legislation that created offtrack betting in New York City, divorce reform and revision of the former abortion law. Some of his reputation for fairness'. stemmed from his decision in 1970 to allow a bill liberalizing, the abortion law to come to the floor for debate, although he was vehemently opposed to it. A Roman Catholic, Mr. Brydges had been a leader in the effort to find constitutional ways to give state aid to nonpublic schools. He was occasionally rankled by criticism from New York City politicians, and editorial writers who regarded him, as he put it, as “some sort of NeanderthaI.” Accusation of Nepotism An accusation of nepotism followed him out of office, after he named a son, Earl Jr., as a $30,000‐a‐year member of they State Commission of Investigation a few days before his retirement. Mr. Brydges was born in Niagara Falls on May 25, 1905, and was educated in the public and parochial schools of that city. He attended Niagara University and graduated from the University of Buffalo Law School in 1926. A man of medium height)) and weight, Mr. Brydges had a penchant for sartorial correctness and an ever‐present, cigarette held like a teacher's pointer in his left hand. He spoke slowly, with a gravelly quality to his voice, and his blue eyes could turn quickly from frostiness to a twinkle. He rarely gestured during speeches. Mr. Brydges was a minority leader at the state's Constitutional Convention in 1967. He was a former chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Mental Retardation and was a sponsor of programs to aid the retarded. During his Senate farewell tribute in 1972, his was the most controlled speech. “The individual who serves here doesn't matter,” he said. “Time proves that.

Hospital in Brooklyn Open Despite Accreditation Loss,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/hospital-in-brooklyn-open-despite-accreditation-loss.html,"Linden General Hospital, a 78‐bed private health facility in a rundown part of Brooklyn's East New York section, has lost its accreditation and been declared hazardous, unneeded and irremediably obsolete by government inspectors. But the hospital continues to function because of an unabated flow of Government Medicaid payments that are its main source of support. The proprietary, or profitmaking, hospital receives as much as 75 per cent of its income from Medicaid, which pays for health care of the poor. Last year $1,039,910.30 in Medicaid funds went to Linden General. In addition, the hospital also received $193,600 from Medicare, which pays for the health care of the aged, in 1974. An investigation by The New York Times of official files, and interviews with city, state and Federal officials indicate that not only has there been uncertainty in government about who should act about the situation at Linden General, but also that there is uncertainty even about which agency is responsible for passing information on to those who are supposed to act. Government handling of the Linden General case “indicates a total breakdown of the inspection process,” said Donald Rubin, president of a consumer watchdog group called the Consumer Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals. “Government money is being paid to unapproved institutions. The expenditure of Federal funds requires public safeguards.” On Feb. 8, 1974, inspectors from the State Department of Health reported after a visit to the two‐story brick Linden General building at 501 New Lots Avenue that the hospital had serious fire safety violations, inadequate toilet facilities and poor sanitation. “Patients are wheeled out from the O.R. [operating room] right past dirty linen collection bags and trash containers,” the inspectors said. Their report concluded: “The building is not amenable to correction . . even if funds were available to do so.” On May 14, 1974, after another inspection, Dr. Leon R. Lezer, a Health Department inspector, reported: “There is a nonfunctioning medical staff at this hospital. . . . The hospital is surviving currently through apparent excessive hospitalization for tonsillectomy and through abortions on a demand basis.” Dr. Lezer's report said the conditions at Linden General created a situation “that is not only a serious one with the respect to the protection of the public health, but is virtually an irremediable situation.” “It is recommended,” Dr. Lezer concluded, “that this facility be closed with all deliberate speed.” Instead of being closed by the State Health Department, however, Linden General routinely was given a full twoyear renewal of its operating certificate on Aug. 1, 1974. Why? An internal State Health Department memorandum dated Aug. 20, 1974, from Robert Dougherty, project review coordinator in the state agency's New York City office, said the certificate had been issued “due to lack of information available to me on the actual status of affairs at this facility.” After the Linden General certificate slipped though routinely, Mr. Dougherty set up new system of checking with other parts of the Health Department before issuing certificates. But no effort was made to revoke the Linden General certificate even after the conditions there were known. Asked why, Mr. Dougherty said in an interview the other day, “It really doesn't make that much difference.” He said there would have to be a long hearing before the certificate could be revoked and then the hospital could go On through court proceedings that could easily eat up the two years. That attitude has been challenged by Donald Rubin's consumer watchdog group. Most nongovernment hospitals in the nation are surveyed for accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, a private,, Chicago‐based concern that is, supported by the fees that it charges the hospitals it surveys. By law a hospital is deemed; to be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid funds if it is accredited by the Joint Commission. Because of deficiencies, Linden General was declared nonaccredited after a joint Commission survey on March 6, 1973. The Joint Commission will not disclose what specific deficiencies it finds, however, declaring that to be a private matter between itself and the hospital. Because government funds are disbursed on the basis of the Joint Commission's findings, the commission is supposed to notify government officials when a hospital is not, up to standard. But because Linden General requested a review of the findings, the Joint Commission considered the hospital “administratively accredited” pending the outcome of the review. Joint Commission officials declined, however, to disclose if they notified the government of the move to “administrative accreditation.” Government officials interviewed were uncertain how or when they heard of the nonaccreditation. Apparently the government learned of the nonaccreditation only inadvertently. A City Department of Health inspector making a routine visit to Linden General in July, 1973,—shortly before the state took over inspections of private hospitals—found records to indicate that the Joint Commission accreditation was denied after the March survey. The city inspector noted that it was a violation of the Hospital Code not to notify the Health Department when the Joint Commission accreditation was denied. Perhaps because the state was about to take over the private hospital inspections—the state took over in Septem ber—the city took no further action on the loss of accreditation beyond telling Linden General that failing to report was a violation. “I really can't remember at all when I found out about Linden General,” Douglas R. Eitel, director of the State Health Department's bureau of hospital certification, said in an interview. “We had heard that this hospital had lost its accreditation. I'm not sure from where, but I believe it was Baltimore.” Baltimore is the headquarters of the Federal Government's Bureau of Health Insurance, which disburses Medicare funds. If it is notified that a hospital has been nonaccredited by the Joint Commission it requests a full survey by the State Health Department to validate those findings and to determine whether Government Funds should be withheld. On April 19, after going through the city files and finding the report that Linden General had been nonaccredited, Mr. Rubin, the president of the consumer watchdog group, wrote the Bureau of Health Insurance requesting a validation survey. The bureau passed the request on to the State Health. Department where there was some apparent confusion about Linden General's status. An internal Health Departnent memorandum to Dr. Donild Dickson, then the deputy commissioner in charge of preventive services and medical care, from Dr. Richard Nauen, the associate commissioner in charge of the agency's office )f New York City affairs, said that a letter from the Joint Zommission to Linden General Indicated the facility was “adninistratively accredited.” The memo continued: However, we were advised by Mr. Eitel [of the Department's Albany office] who also talked, with Chicago, that they are nonaccredited . . . It is still lot clear in our minds . . . as to whether or not Linden General Hospital is accredited ar nonaccredited. To date, wel have not received official notice.” Dr. Nauen said in an interview that he soon received word from the Bureau of Flealth Insurance on the hospital's nonaccreditation, apparently after Mr. Rubin's letter. Linden General, according to Elealth Department files, was started about 40 years ago. From 1950 to 1970 it was operated by Benjamin Scharfstein. Mr. Scharfstein sold out his controlling interest in the hospital to a dentist in 1970, who, in turn, sold his interest to two doctors in 1973, who put themselves on the payroll at $1,000 a week each. Prior – approval of hospital transfers is required by the State Health Department. But no such approval appears to have been given here. On Sept. 12, 1973, Judge Orrin G. Judd in Federal Court ruled the sale illegal and ordered control of the hospital returned to Mr. Scharfstein. Although Mr. Scharfstein had regained control he said the hospital was in bad shape economically and in December he filed for bankruptcy. He said he could not meet the demands of his creditors, which included drug houses, the union pension fund, a guard service and even a company that piped in music for the patients. In testimony before Bankruptcy Judge Manuel J. Price in Brooklyn Federal Court Mr. Scharfstein pleaded for time to work out a settlement. “It's difficult to operate a hospital,” he testified on Jan. 17, 1974, “when you answer every phone call and it's a creditor.” Mr. Scharfstein was ordered by the court to set up two separate bank accounts, one for the taxes he deducted from employes' paychecks and another for general operating expenses. He was directed not to use the money in the tax account for any other purpose. At least once Judge Price had to reprimand the hospital for using the Lax money for general purposes. The judge threatened to shut down the hospital immediately if the practice recurred. The bankruptcy case is still open in Federal court and Linden General still has not offered a plan on how to deal with its creditors. The hospital has pleaded for more time and early this year Jay S. Zimmet, Linden General's accountant, testified that there were encouraging signs. He urged the judge not to close down Linden General because he said he had been assured a new rate from Blue Cross for the patients covered by the insurance plan. The new rate would be $100.88 per inpatient day, Mr. Zimmet testified, up from $81 in 1974. Blue Cross last year paid $266,196.29 to Linden General. In addition, Mr. Zimmet testified, he is expecting a Medicaid rate of $110 a patient day. “Medicaid is the key,” Mr. Zimmet said because it is responsible for most of Linden General's income. Judge Price said in an interview that he was not pressing the hospital too hard for a plan on how to pay the creditors because they themselves were not pushing for their money. Creditors have been reluctant to strive too hard for fear of closing the hospital, which would be worth little if it were not an operating institution with Government funds flowing into it.. Judge Price said that from the testimony the hospital seemed to be having success in getting more money from the Government. The “key” Medicaid rate that was expected in testimony at $110, however, has turned out to be $95.84. Blue Cross officials said the rate they actually were paying at Linden General was $95.64 and not the $100.88, as testified. Although not quite as impressive as depicted in the bankruptcy testimony, the payments to Linden General have continued to climb based on the hospital's operating costs. In 1973 Blue Cross was paying Linden General only $73 a patient day and Medicaid was paying $80.14. Last June another complete survey of Linden General was made by the Joint Commission at Mr. Scharfstein's request. The hospital failed that resurvey. according to Miss Nora C. O'Malley, assistant program director of the Joint Commission. In August the Joint Commission's accreditation committee voted nonaccreditation for Linden General. The hospital was told of that decision on Aug. 28 and given 20 days to appeal. No appeal was made, Miss O'Malley said, and on Nov. 15 notification that Linden General was nonac credited went out to the Federal Bureau of Health Insurance and the State Health Department. There is no requirement that accreditation be made part of a bankruptcy trial. Judge Price said he had no idea the hospital was not accredited. The issue had not come up in the testimony that has gone on for over a year. Last Dec. 4, Dr. Frank T. Cicero, the acting deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Health wrote the Federal Bureau of Health Insurance recommending that Linden General no longer be approved for Medicare payments. That action would also make it ineligible for Medicaid payments because the Medicaid people rely on the recommendations to Medicare rather than institute their own duplicating surveys. Dr. Cicero wrote again to the Bureau of Health Insurance on Feb. 28, saying that the hospital had offered a plan for reconstruction to correct some of the building deficiencies, but that the other difficulties “result in our continued recommendation for [not acceptable] classification.” Although the hospital offered a plan for rehabilitating its aging building, it gave no indication how much the rehabilitation would cost or where the money would come from in an institution in bankruptcy proceedings. Any such plan of hospital !construction must be approved by the state. Approval must first come from another arm of the health network, the Health and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New York. Inc. The council Is a quasipublic group—made up of representatives of physicians, hospitals, philanthropies, insurance carViers, community, labor and management groups—that was set up by law to advise the Health Commissioner on the hospital needs of the area. In a report last June the council said that Linden General and 10 other “small obsolete Hospitals” in Brooklyn should be closed because there was an oversupply of beds in the borough. The council's report said that keeping Linden General and other inefficient institutions open could waste limited health care funds. Despite the deficiencies and the lack of need for hospital beds the money has not stopped flowing into Linden General. Blue Cross said in a statement that it was “continuing this hospital's membership [in Blue Cross] in the same fashion as the State Health Department has been continuing its operating certificate.” Bureau of Health Insurance officials say that cutting off Government funds now with hospitals so dependent on that money would be tantamount to closing a hospital. Asked about Government funds continuing to go to Linden General when deficiencies have been reported for such a long period, Milton Webber, regional program officer for the bureau, said: “We don't want to do anything prematurely. We have never closed hospital.” Linden General is built on a trapezoid‐shaped lot bounded by Bradford Street and New Lots, Miller and Riverdale Avenues. The area around the hospital has many abandoned buildings. Patients can look out the windows across New Lots Avenue into a whole row of abandoned and vandalized stores. On the outside Linden General has window sashes wherg the paint is almost completely peeled off and some of the sashes are so rotted they are propped up in place with sticks. There has been an attempt to modernize the new entrance with large white plastic letters spelling out the hospital's name. The plastic D already is missing. One of the arguments for keeping Linden General open is that the hospital provides jobs in a depressed area where there is little other employment. One of the creditors to Linden General is Local 144 of the Hotel, Hospital, Nursing Home and Allied Health Services Union, whose members have not been getting the wages their contract entitles them to. Frank Perez, a Local 144 business agent, says some 60 members, mostly from the neighborhood, who do nonmedical and housekeeping jobs, are being paid only an average of $150 a week at Linden General although they have been entitled under the contract to $171 since last July. “We'd like to see the hospital stay open to provide jobs, but not if our members aren't paid,” Mr. Perez said in an interview. “It seems like a lost cause now at Linden General.” Reached at his home in Hollywood, Fla., Mr. Scharfstein angrily declined to discuss anything about Linden General on the telephone. “I don't have to give you any answers,” he told a reporter. “It's none of your business.” He said he might discuss the hospital's situation sometime when he returned to New York, but he declined to set a date."
"Men Vote, Women Die",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/03/archives/men-vote-women-die.html,"In a few days 100 men are to decide whether to cause the suffering and death of thousands of American women. Last year the Senate passed such legislation, but fortunately it died in conference committee. When the Nurses Training Act and the Health Revenue Sharing and Health Services Act comes to the Senate floor for a vote, it will carry an amendment filed by Senator Dewey F. Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma, which would disallow funds for abortion under this or “any other act.” Co‐sponsors are Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. Before the United States Supreme Court abortion decisions of Jan. 22, 1973, which said abortion is a decision to be made solely between a woman and her doctor in the first trimester, illegal abortion was a leading cause of maternal mortality. Since then, the rate of 300 deaths per year dropped to 47 last year; of these, 25 were from illegal procedures. Unfortunately, in spite of the Supreme Court decisions, in some parts of the country people who oppose freedom of choice are still able to deny safe medical care for abortions to many women. Even more dramatic has been the decline in septicemia, a common result of botched abortions. Hospital wards that used to he filled with women suffering the effects of illegal procedures are now virtually devoid of such patients. Before the decisions, It was the poor who in desperation sought out quacks or mutilated themselves. Rich women could afford to pay for safe care or to travel to find it. The Bartlett amendment will return women to this era of medical discrimination, for it will affect only women who depend on Medicaid or similar federally funded programs for health care. Such unwilling pregnant women will face only two alternatives: To risk suffering and death, or to bear an unwanted child. Another injustice here is the procedure being followed. The amendment is being tacked on as the bill comes to the Senate floor for a vote. It thereby avoids committee hearings, a rigorous testing process that almost all other legislation undergoes. Whatever a Senator's viewpoint, to vote on this important matter without thorough investigation is certainly an abuse of normal legislative procedures. A Senator would be justified in voting against the Bartlett amendment for this alone. In fact, hearings are being held in a Senate judiciary subcommittee on several proposed constitutional amendments that would ban virtually all abortions for everyone. One proposed by Senator Helms would also apparently ban the Intrauterine device, a widely used contraceptive; some forms of the pill; and the “morning‐after” pill, a medication particularly useful in cases of rape. Senator Bartlett's amendment could be interpreted to outlaw funds for these contraceptives as well. A zealous, well‐organized, wellfinanced minority is responsible for the enormous political pressure that is causing many politicians to vote as they do on this issue. The impetus comes from the Roman Catholic Church. For example, the Diocese of Pittsburgh alone contributed $60,101 for “pro‐life” programs last year. The adoption of this amendment will impose the religious beliefs of one group on others who hold differing, but equally valid, moral principles. Most major Protestant and Jewish denominations, as well as many individual Catholics, believe that the decision to have an abortion can be a morally responsible one. Every abortion represents a failure. It can be the failure of one of the more reliable contraceptives used by a wellmotivated couple or the failure of a society to teach its young about their sexuality and its responsible use. Are we going to allow the men in the Senate to force only the women—in this case only the poor women—to bear the sole burden of this failure?"
"The Right‐Wing ‘Life Line’ Program, Lacking H. L. Hunt's Aid, Has Lost Radio Outlets and Revenues",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/03/archives/the-rightwing-life-line-program-lacking-hl-hunts-aid-has-lost-radio.html,"DALLAS—“Life Line,” whose right‐wing advocacy of “traditional American values,” boomed forth daily from more than 500 radio stations fivel years ago under the aegis of, H. L. Hunt, the oil billionaire, has fallen on hard times. Last week the 16‐year‐old anti‐Communist radio program was being carried by fewer than 100 stations, and “Life Line's” executive director and Commentator, Melvin T. Munn, was searching for financial resources to keep it going. Scratching about in his ashtray for a cigarette butt long enough to light, during a recent interview, at the Life Line Building here, Mr. Munn said that the program “came mighty close to going out of business last fall, but now, it looks like we'll make it.” He refused an offer of a cigarette, and lighted up a short butt that he had fished out of the ashtray. Optimistic on Future “I feel our best years are ahead of us,” he said. Mr. Munn is tall and heavily built and has a jutting jaw and cold, pale‐gray eyes. He says he is an absolute believer in old‐time Americanism—a balanced Federal budget, God, country and family. These homilies provide the basis for the 15‐minute sermontype radio speeches he has recorded for “Life Line” for 10 years. Although much of what Mr. Munn says on the radio is ordinary enough, his delivery makes it seem as if he is pronouncing that tomorrow has been canceled. The current slump in the “Life Line” program is not because there is no longer an audience for his viewpoint, Mr. Munn said recently, but is a result of a decision by Mr. Hunt to get out of the food business. One of the most prosperous of the conservative programs pouring from radio stations during the nineteen – sixties, “Life Line” began having troubyes in 1971 when Mr. Hunt decided that his food‐canning business was not making any money, and sold his facilities. Mr. Hunt's canned food products, H.L.H. and Alma Brands, had been “Life Line's” biggest sponsors and accounted for probably two‐thirds of the program's income. Products and Program Linked Mr. Hunt's company supported “Life Line” on so many stations that the names became more or less synonymous to the general public. “Actually,” Mr. Munn said, “Mr. Hunt was lust one of the members of the board of directors of Life Line Foundation. Many people believed that Mr. Hunt decided what was to be broadcast, but that was not true. The elderly oilman, who died last November, very seldom saw advance copies of “Freedom Talks”—the name “Life Line” programs are known by —Mr. Munn said. And he added, Mr. Hunt never wrote one. Mr. Munn said that he alone had decided what would be broadcast on the more than 3,000 programs he has made. “And Mr. Hunt didn't always agree with me,” Mr. Munn said. Once, Mr. Hunt got “hopping mad” when “Life Line” criticized one of Mr. Hunt's books, he said. Mr. Hunt and his published Works advocated a world in which rich people had more legal rights than poor people, a position Mr. Munn said he opposed. None of the Hunts are now on “Life Line's” board of directors: The “Life Line” program started on radio on Nov. 10, 1958. Mr. Munn said that the idea for the Program had apparently came from a Florida woman, “whose name escapes me right now.” Mr. Hunt, who had been searching for a substitute for his defunct “Facts Forum” program, agreed to sponsor “Life Line” on radio. The Rev. Wayne Poucher, a Church of Christ minister, was the program's first commentator and began the delivery of the self‐styled anti‐Communist, pro‐American business messages. He did so until May, 1963. Mr. Poucher had a falling out with Mr. Hunt over the use of old “Life Line” programs at food fairs and conventions, and sued Mr. Hunt for $60,000, Mr. Munn said. The Life Line Foundation then dismissed Mr. Poucher, Mr. Munn said. During the next seven months, several commentators alternated in delivering the message, before Bob White of Minneapolis, a pseudonym, became the commentator for 13 months. “I came aboard on Jan. 1, 1965, and went on the air Feb. 8, 1965,” Mr. Munn said. “I haven't missed a day since.” The 15‐minute‐long programs are written weeks in advance and shipped to radio stations on long‐playing records. Mr Munn said that he records on Wednesdays, doing seven programs—a week's supply—at a time. “I write 65 per cent of them,” he said. “Most of the Sunday programs are written by Mrs. Edith Smith, our director of research. The others are written by an out‐of‐state editor whose name I won't say be cause he's moonlighting.” Although many of the rightwing‐oriented programs from other organizations are donated free to radio stations that, will use them, “Life Line” charged for its programs, Mr. Munn said. “Life Line.” he said, gets 20 per cent of the money paid the stations for commercials. “There is a minimum charge of $1 a day,” he said. In the days when H.L.H. and Alma foods were sponsoring the “Freedom Talks,” “Life Line” had an income of $320,000 a year. This year, Mr. Munn said, “Life Line” is operating on a budget of $240,000 and should get by because many of its staff members have been laid off. In 1970, “Life Line” could be heard coast to coast on 532 radio stations. Mr. Munn said that some stations broadcast programs twice each day. Currently, the program is heard in 30 states, with most of the stations situated in the South and Southwest. However, “Life Line” does have outlets in the New York City and the District of Columbia areas. It has about a dozen stations in the Northeast. Mr. Munn, who is 58 years old, is a native Texan who has worked as the religious director of a Longview, Tex., Methodist church, as the manager of the new accounts department, of a Dallas bank, as a radio and television announcer, as 2 public relations director for Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and as a public relations consultant for Representatives and Senators in Washington. Mr. Munn said that “Life Line's” efforts to strengthen “traditional values in politics, education, economy, religious areas, families, marriage and other basic institutions” have not met with universal approval. “Freedom Talks” programs in opposition to legalized abortions, mandatory school busing, the Equal Rights Amendment for women, legalization of marijuana, modernist school books, experimental education and credit buying have drawn criticism and sometimes hate mail, Mr. Munn said. Once, fie said, he was under such threats that the Dallas and state police protected his family for several days after a plot to kill him was uncovered. “Life Line” radio programs also dabble in politics, with Mr. Munn pointing out the virtues of such figures as Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California, while questioning the suitability of Vice President Rockefeller and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts to be President. Mr. Munn said that while “Life Line” programs were heard mostly by people who agreed with his viewpoint—“After all, everybody likes to have his prejudices reinforced” he said—the program drew a “surprising amount” of mail from liberals who praised him for drawing attention to current problems."
3 Orphans Land Here Amid Grief Over Saigon Crash,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/05/archives/3-orphans-land-here-amid-grief-over-saigon-crash.html,"Months of anxious waiting ended early today at La Guardia Airport as three orphaned Vietnamese girls were embraced by their new American families. It was an emotional scene, made more poignant because of earlier reports that a C‐5A Galaxy carrying hundreds of other orphans had crashed outside Saigon, killing more than 100. One of the new mothers, Adell Kolinsky, wept when she heard the news. For Ronnie Starr, who had waited two years for her child, anxiety briefly turned to sorrow “for those children and those people waiting for them.” A few hours later, as Mrs. Kolinsky embraced Nguyen Thi My Huong, whom she renamed Robyn Lan, she murmured: “We love her so. It's so good to save one.” The children blinked and gazed from face to face as they were carried from the plane, an Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles. The youngsters seemed confused and weary after a series of flights that began in Qui Nhon and Diem Phuc and ended in Spring Valley and Mahopac Falls, N.Y. For some the arrival of the children represented a surprise. The Kolinsky's, who have three sons—Jeffrey, 16; Steven, 14, and Gary, 10—had expected a 5‐year‐old girl, but Robyn is 2 or 3. A few hours later, at the Kolinsky's Spring Valley home, Robyn was sitting on a bed decorated in pink, surrounded by her brothers, laughing and clapping “like she's been here forever,” Mrs. Kolinsky said. During the day, Gary was seen racing across the lawn to the house next door. “I've got to borrow some Pampers,” he shouted over his, shoulder. “She's still in diapers. And we don't have a crib, either.” The Kolinskys' neighbor, Mary Ellen Kerpoff, adopted a 21‐month‐old Korean child, six weeks ago. The two other orphans on the flight were Nguyen Thi Thu Cuc, 3, renamed Kathleen Marie by the Robert Flanigan family of Edison, N. J., and Tham Thi Thu Huong, who will be 3 in October, renamed Shalli Naté by Ronnie Starr of Mahopac Falls. Airline officials emptied the plane of regular passengers and then, one by one, stewardesses carrying the children read the name tags, linking them finally to their adoptive families. The first was handed to Miss Starr, who lives with her mother and is a dog groomer. “Life is beautiful,” she said as she was handed her new daughter. Later, she spoke of herself and her motivation in adopting a Vietnamese child. “I can remember wanting to do this since I was 10,” she said. “I came from a home with a mother who worked hard to raise my brother and sister and myself. She was a mother who cared and I felt everyone should have someone who cares.” Miss Starr, who is 28, said, she had completed arrangements ments for the adoption of another child last year, “but she died before we could get her here.” She praised the Denver‐based Friends of Children in Vietnam, which handled the adoption, “especially because singleparent adoption can be so difficult.” The same agency helped the Flanigans, whose girl was the second to be carried from the plane. Mr. Flanigan, a grocer, was accompanied by his wife, Josepha, and three adopted children, Caroline, 9, Robert, 7, and James, 5, all of whom came to the Flanigans through the Catholic Welfare Bureau in Trenton. “We wanted more children,” Mr. Flanigan said, “but there seems so few available in this country now, what with the pill and abortion. We tried more than 100 agencies, and even when a child was available, we had a low priority because we already had three.” Mrs. Flanigan wept as she was handed Kathleen Marie, who also cried a few minutes later, but more from fright than joy. Caroline kept offering her new sister a doll, but the lights and confusion were overwhelming. Mrs. Kolinsky, who is 37, could scarcely contain herself when she was handed Robyn, the last off the plane. “I love the world and I love Robyn,” she said. “She's precious and she's mine. Look at her. She's not just a picture any more. She's a person. Do it—adopt a child. It's beautiful.” Benjamin Kolinsky is a pharmacist and his wife a supervising nurse who specializes in pediatrics at Letchworth Village in Rockland County. Mr. Kolinsky, who also praised the Friends of Children in Vietnam, said his efforts began last year when the family's contributions to a Vietnamese orphanage developed into discussion of adoption. “We wanted a girl,” Mr. Kolinsky said, “and after all, the surest way to get one is to adopt her.” They began the long process of filling out forms and writing letters. Events moved slowly, how ever, until the military situation in Vietnam worsened. On Tuesday, Mr. Kolinsky said, the State Department loosened resirictions and the departures began in earnest. As the families separated at the airport this morning, each child seemed destined for vastly different experiences. Kathleen Marie, for example, Will share a Roman Catholic environment, and Robyn Lan will enter a Jewish home. “Until recently Ben could never get Friday night off,” Mrs, Kolinsky said. “So we didn't do the ritual Sabbath ceremony. Now he's got Fridays off and we are starting to observe it, with the wine and the challah and everything. As soon as I can, I will begin teaching Robyn how to light the candles and what it is to be a Jewish mother. I think it's time, we had a girl in this family.” Later, as they waited for a friend to get the car, Mrs. Kolinsky said to her husband: “You know, I think she looks like you.” They laughed, and Robyn grinned. “Now we are six,” Mrs. Kolinsky said."
Income Tax Plus Austerity Urged to Meet State Deficit,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/05/archives/income-tax-plus-austerity-urged-to-meet-state-deficit.html,"TRENTON, April 4—The Joint Legislative Appropriations Committee, in a final public hearing, today heard appeals for State economy and enactment of an income tax as it prepared for the return of the State Legislature on Monday. The Senator headed by State Senator Joseph P. Merlino, Democrat of Mercer County, is faced with the task shaping state expenditures Governor Byrne's proposed $2.8‐billion budget, which the Governor says will have a $487‐million deficit if new taxes are not provided. The State Constitution forbids a deficit, so the budget will have to be pared to $2.3‐billion or a new tax program will have to be enacted to cover the deficit. Opposition to some budget cuts has come from the New Jersey State Employes Association, Which is seeking a 20 per cent pay raise. A. Joseph Rosena, president of the organization, urged the committee today to reject Governor Byrne's “hold‐the‐line” proposal, which denied the raise, and to grant the pay increase. He said economies in state government would pay for the increase “without added cost to the state or the taxpayers.” A new tax program will be the major concern of the Legislature when it reconvenes, with significant economies in state, expenditures expected even if some form of Governor Byrne's requested income tax is approved. The Governor and the Democratic majority leaders of the Legislature agreed at a meeting last Tuesday that some kind of income tax was needed to meet the state's fiscal crisis. But they have failed so far to agree on the form of the tax or the revenues it should prodtice. The two principal porposals that will come before the Legislature are a graduated income tax that could bring up to $1‐billion in revenues, or a 5 per cent surcharge on the Federal income taxes of New Jersey residents, which could produce a total of $500‐million. The Appropriations Committee heard pleas for an income tax today from the 81,000‐member New Jersey Education Association and the Legislative Action Committee of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors, which was represented by Arthur J. Holland, Mayor of Trenton. The education association was especially critical of cuts in the proposed budget that would affect state assistance for local school districts and state colleges, and would eliminate grants for innovative teaching programs. The association reiterated in a statement that it favored “new state taxes, preferably those most proportional to the ability to pay, that adjust automatically to provide additional revenue to meet high‐school costs whenever there are increases in income levels and the cost of living.” Mayor Holland appeared before the Appropriations Committee both as the executive. of a financially troubled state capital that seeks more state aid and as a representative of similar municipalities throughout the state. Any reduction in state aid for local governments, he said, will result in “a shifting of fiscal burden to the property tax ‐ paying citizens of this state.” He called for “a substantial income tax as a means of meeting equitably the needs of this state at all levels.” In addition to the proposed income tax, which will be pressed by the Democratic leadership of both the State Senate and the Assembly, the Legislature will consider several bills on key public issues before it adjourns next month. Among them, according to the Assembly Speaker, S. Howard Woodson Jr., Democrat of Trenton, will be a measure to bar state Medicaid funds for abortions not required unless the mother's life is in danger."
3 Orphans Land Here Amid Grief Over Saigon Crash,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/05/archives/3-orphans-land-here-amid-grief-over-saigon-crash-orphans-land-amid.html,"Months of anxious waiting ended early today at La Guardia Airport as three orphaned Vietnamese girls were embraced by their new American families. It was an emotional scene, made more poignant because of earlier reports that a C‐5A Galaxy carrying hundreds of other orphans had crashed outside Saigon, killing more than 100. One of the new mothers, Adell Kolinsky, wept when she heard the news. For Ronnie Starr, who had waited two years for her child, anxiety briefly turned to sorrow “for those children and those people waiting for them.” A few hours later, as Mrs. Kolinsky embraced Nguyen Thi My Huong, whom she renamed Robyn Lan, she murmured: “We love her so. It's so good to save one.” The children blinked and gazed from face to face as they were carried from the plane, an Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles. The youngsters seemed confused and weary after a series of flights that began in Qui Nhon and Diem Phuc and ended in Spring Valley and Mahopac Falls, N.Y. For some the arrival of the children represented a surprise. The Kolinsky's, who have three sons—Jeffrey, 16; Steven, 14, and Gary, 10—had expected a 5‐year‐old girl, but Robyn is 2 or 3. A few hours later, at the Kolinsky's Spring Valley home, Robyn was sitting on a bed decorated in pink, surrounded by her brothers, laughing and clapping “like she's been here forever,” Mrs. Kolinsky said. During the day, Gary was seen racing across the lawn to the house next door. “I've got to borrow some Pampers,” he shouted over his, shoulder. “She's still in diapers. And we don't have a crib, either.” The Kolinskys' neighbor, Mary Ellen Kerpoff, adopted a 21‐month‐old Korean child, six weeks ago. The two other orphans on the flight were Nguyen Thi Thu Cuc, 3, renamed Kathleen Marie by the Robert Flanigan family of Edison, N. J., and Tham Thi Thu Huong, who will be 3 in October, renamed Shalli Naté by Ronnie Starr of Mahopac Falls. Airline officials emptied the plane of regular passengers and then, one by one, stewardesses carrying the children read the name tags, linking them finally to their adoptive families. The first was handed to Miss Starr, who lives with her mother and is a dog groomer. “Life is beautiful,” she said as she was handed her new daughter. Later, she spoke of herself and her motivation in adopting a Vietnamese child. “I can remember wanting to do this since I was 10,” she said. “I came from a home with a mother who worked hard to raise my brother and sister and myself. She was a mother who cared and I felt everyone should have someone who cares.” Miss Starr, who is 28, said, she had completed arrangements ments for the adoption of another child last year, “but she died before we could get her here.” She praised the Denver‐based Friends of Children in Vietnam, which handled the adoption, “especially because singleparent adoption can be so difficult.” The same agency helped the Flanigans, whose girl was the second to be carried from the plane. Mr. Flanigan, a grocer, was accompanied by his wife, Josepha, and three adopted children, Caroline, 9, Robert, 7, and James, 5, all of whom came to the Flanigans through the Catholic Welfare Bureau in Trenton. “We wanted more children,” Mr. Flanigan said, “but there seems so few available in this country now, what with the pill and abortion. We tried more than 100 agencies, and even when a child was available, we had a low priority because we already had three.” Mrs. Flanigan wept as she was handed Kathleen Marie, who also cried a few minutes later, but more from fright than joy. Caroline kept offering her new sister a doll, but the lights and confusion were overwhelming. Mrs. Kolinsky, who is 37, could scarcely contain herself when she was handed Robyn, the last off the plane. “I love the world and I love Robyn,” she said. “She's precious and she's mine. Look at her. She's not just a picture any more. She's a person. Do it—adopt a child. It's beautiful.” Benjamin Kolinsky is a pharmacist and his wife a supervising nurse who specializes in pediatrics at Letchworth Village in Rockland County. Mr. Kolinsky, who also praised the Friends of Children in Vietnam, said his efforts began last year when the family's contributions to a Vietnamese orphanage developed into discussion of adoption. “We wanted a girl,” Mr. Kolinsky said, “and after all, the surest way to get one is to adopt her.” They began the long process of filling out forms and writing letters. Events moved slowly, how ever, until the military situation in Vietnam worsened. On Tuesday, Mr. Kolinsky said, the State Department loosened resirictions and the departures began in earnest. As the families separated at the airport this morning, each child seemed destined for vastly different experiences. Kathleen Marie, for example, Will share a Roman Catholic environment, and Robyn Lan will enter a Jewish home. “Until recently Ben could never get Friday night off,” Mrs, Kolinsky said. “So we didn't do the ritual Sabbath ceremony. Now he's got Fridays off and we are starting to observe it, with the wine and the challah and everything. As soon as I can, I will begin teaching Robyn how to light the candles and what it is to be a Jewish mother. I think it's time, we had a girl in this family.” Later, as they waited for a friend to get the car, Mrs. Kolinsky said to her husband: “You know, I think she looks like you.” They laughed, and Robyn grinned. “Now we are six,” Mrs. Kolinsky said."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/05/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Strikes are always regrettable, but especially in health‐care institutions, where the sick and infirm are the real victims. Yet sometimes even in hospitals a strike can have positive aspects. The outcome of the recent New York City doctors' strike has proven that collective bargaining can work to bring about a reasonable and rational settlement. And the fact that it was a voluntary settlement makes it infinitely better for the parties than a similar settlement imposed by compulsory arbitration. The agreement was possibly not achievable without a strike, for each side had to learn certain lessons. The strike demonstrated to the hospital administrators and the city that a strike of internes and residents need not create an instantaneous and intolerable emergency. But it also proved to administrators that any thought they may have harbored about “busting” the union was unrealistic. It also showed the C.I.R. that they can mount a successful strike and achieve reasonable results on legitimate objectives. The Times seems to feel that compulsory arbitration—as was required under the defunct state law affecting private health‐care institutions — is preferable to strikes in public‐ and quasi‐public‐sector labor disputes [editorial March 22]. Perhaps so, but the doctors' strike is hardly proof positive of this position. Indeed, I would assert A Flawed Remedy To the Editor: The tax bill just signed by the President will not accomplish its purpose. We live in a multinational world. A park‐bench acquaintance told me that since Christmas he bought an overcoat made in Austria, a topcoat made in Ireland, shoes made in Brazil, shirts made in Vietnam, a raincoat made in South Korea and handkerchiefs made in Hong Kong. This man is not rich. He lives alone on Social Security plus a union pension of less than $80 a month. He is on the constant lookout for bargains. He figures that if his gross monthly income were divided by 160 hours per month, he'd average about $2.10 per hour. He asks, how can a man whose that the right to strike, which is an essential part of the collective‐bargaining process, should be permitted in all instances of public‐ and quasi‐public‐sector bargaining — excepting police and fire‐fighters. If such a strike does at some point endanger public health and safety, as might have been the case if the doctors' strike had continued, then a limited‐term injunction should be available through a procedure similar to that for obtaining Taft‐Hartley injunctions. I believe that the Taylor Act should be amended accordingly, as well as the Taft‐Hartley provision dealing with private health‐care institutions. And if later this year there is Federal action to bring all non‐Federal public employes under Taft‐Hartley, it too should include provisions for injunctive relief. If the dispute remains unresolved when the injunction expires, then last‐offer binding arbitration might be imposed. In short, let's give collective bargaining a chance to demonstrate that it can work without endangering public well‐being even where the public is immediately involved, but let us alio be certain to protect quickly the public health and safety when necessary. IRVING H. SABGHIR Albany, March 23, 1975 The writer is professor of industrial relations at the State University of New York at Albany. income is $2.10 per hour buy the products and services of workers paid from $4 to $11 per hour? He therefore must look to the products of people paid closer to $2.10 per hour. If his foregoing analysis is even partially correct, he'd suggest a 20 per cent cut in wages of everyone connected with the trucking and building construction industries and a 15 per cent cut in wages of every other type of worker and welfare client in this country. Then and only then will we have a return to fuller employment. ISIDORE L. PULVER New York, March 30, 1975 • ‘One‐Sided’ Liberals To the Editor: The suggestion by six Democratic Senators that Secretary Kissinger not visit Chile on his South American trip is just one more case of the narrowminded one‐sidedness of the liberals. This group, which included some Presidential hopefuls, said that Kissinger should not stop in Chile because that Government has policies which “violate American values and beliefs” (news story March 28). How is it that this condemnation is reserved only for rightist dictator. ships, which the liberals disapprove of, but never for the Marxist‐Leninist dictatorships, which are much more repressive than most of the rightist regimes? If Mr. Kissinger went to Peking, Havana or Pyongyang, there would be nothing but praise. By what twisted logic do the liberals make this distinction between rightist dictatorships which are only worthy of contempt and leftist totalitarian regimes which must be reached out to but not condemned? JOSEPH C. KUHNS East Orange, N. J., March 28, 1975 A View of Abortion To the Editor: I write in response to Werner Fronos' letter of March 26, which attacked Senator Bartlett's proposal to prohibit the direct or indirect use of Federal money for abortion, except when a woman's life is endangered. I concede that abortion is constitutional—even as slavery once was. Yet, although I have a constitutional right to own property, I certainly have no right to force others to pay for any property which I might care to buy. Similarly, one who has a right to an abortion has no right to make others pay for it, especially if their objections to paying are based on moral grounds. A woman's right over her body gives her no right over my pocketbook. It will be argued against me that pacifists must pay taxes for the military establishment. Quite so; but then, war has not been constitutionally justified on grounds of “freedom of choice” or “privacy.” And, while were on the subject, whatever became of the freedom of those who have no taste for subsidizing feticide? Mr. Fronos also argues that government financing of abortion will save taxpayers some $500 million. What he neglects to mention is that compulsory abortion for welfare mothers would save even more. And why stop there? Why not kill off all those who, in Justice Blackmun's words, “lack the capacity for meaningful life”? God knows how many billions such a reform would lop off the Federal budget. Of course, I will be told that abortion is “different.” But wherein lies the difference? Do human beings have a right to live; or do they not? Can they be killed if their continued existence is an “inconvenience” to someone? Or isn't a fetus human after all? And if it's not, then what is it? These are the questions which must be faced before one can come to a morally defensible conclusion of abortion. Yet it is these very issues which proponents of abortion have evaded, preferring instead to launch ad hominem attacks on “sexists,” “religionists” and other such straw men. One can argue about moral issues as if morality did not exist, but the time shall come when the hard questions can no longer be avoided. PAUL STROHL Jr. Cambridge, Mass., March 27, 1975 • The Dreaded ‘Liberators’ To the Editor: According to Jane Fonda and her friends, the South Vietnam Government of Premier Thieu is a cruel hoax perpetrated by ruthless capitalistic Western powers on the hapless native population, and the Vietcong and its allies from Hanoi are the liberators who will free them from their oppressors. If this be the case, why are hundreds of thousands fleeing the Northern provinces at this moment in abject terror of their “liberators”? ADOLF C. ROBISON Teaneck, N.J., March 27, 1975 • The Post‐Canaanite Era To the Editor: Were it true that the ancient IsraeliteS stole the culture of the. Canaanites (as alleged by Mr. Rawjii in his March 30 letter) we might still be burning our children upon altars to stone gods rather than possessing the Ten Commandments and the Biblical principles of justice and righteousness. ROCHELLE TEMPLEMAN Brooklyn, March 31, 1975 British Referendum on the Common Market To the Editor: In your March 19 editorial “Another British Step” you suggest that the referendum on the Common Market scheduled for late June is “of dubious constitutionality in Britain's parliamentary system.” More tacitly, you suggest that Harold Wilson and the Labor party are the principal, if not sole, violators of the system. Neither suggestion can stand. At the turn of the century, Liberals were inclined to favor the referendum as a means of getting around the House of Lords. Later, when the Liberals held office, Conservatives took up the cry. In 1910–11, Conservatives demanded a referendum on the Government's proposals for reforming the Lords. Their leader, Arthur Balfour, also promised that, if elected, they would submit the question of tariff reform to the country. His successor reiterated this promise in 1913; ten years later Stanley Baldwin called an election for the sole purpose of obtaining a mandate on tariffs. In Britain, where governments can dissolve midterm, elections are an alternative to referendums, particularly when they are fought on one clear‐cut issue, such as tariffs or the House of Lords or—what is more to the point—on membership in the Common Market. On this issue, Harold Wilson could dissolve Parliament with the formal consent of the Queen and go to the country. An election, however, would be more wasteful, more costly and more disruptive than a referendum; more risky, too, for the Government. In any case, why not hold a referendum? Far from being of “dubious constitutionality,” whatever that means in Britain; a referendum is the ultimate expression of the delegate theory of representation now accepted by all parties. Though any government commanding the support of a majority in the House of Commons may be said to have a general mandate to govern, the principle of cabinet responsibility has been modified by the delegate theory. No longer is it assumed that governments, even with the support of the House, can undertake controversial or fundamental reforms without a specific mandate from the people. Such a mandate is usually obtained prior to the event, at the polls when all parties submit detailed programs from among which the people must choose. At the last election, Harold Wilson sought and obtained a specific mandate to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the Common Market, promising, when the time came, to submit the new terms to the electorate by means of a referendum. If anything, it would be “unconstitutional” for Wilson not to do so now. (Asst. Prof.) BARBARA C. MALAMENT Dept. of History, Queens College Flushing, N.Y., March 20, 1975 • Prisoners in Israel To the Editor: Professor Dershowitz does not have to go as far as Moscow in search of hypocrisy [letter March 18]. The smell of hypocrisy and deceit emanate potently from his letter. First, justifying the imprisonment of Archbishop Capucci in the name of international law by describing him as a “foreigner” who “committed a crime in Israeli territory” is ludicrous to anyone who knows the modern history of Palestine. Only if the Palestinians—among them Capucci—could be considered foreigners in their own home and if resistance to occupation were a crime could his justification be founded. By any humane and civilized standards this is not so. Second, while stating, “Soviet dissidents are often tried in closed proceedings,” etc., Professor Dershowitz failed to tell his readers about the Defense Regulations Laws which the Arabs under Israeli occupation are subject to. Those laws—the crucial legal tool which facilitates the confiscation of Arab land and expulsion of Palestinians—were inherited from the British mandate. They were described by Y. S. Shapira in 1946 at a Jewish lawyers' conference as having “no parallel in any civilized nation.” Ironically, Shapira was later appointed Minister of Justice in charge of enforcing the very laws he condemned when they were applied by the British in Palestine. Article 111, a tiny element in those Defense Laws, enables the Israeli Government to detain any person for an unlimited period without trial and without declaring the charges. Thousands of Palestinians have been and continue to be detained under the stipulations of this article. Where is “justice and due process”? A teacher of law like Mr. Dershowitz, who claims concern “for the plight of the unjustly imprisoned wherever they may be,” would be expected to be, in the least, indignant about such laws. Instead he condoned and bestowed his blessings on the Israeli authorities. KAMAL SHAHEED Secretary, Committee of Palestinians in New England Cambridge Mass., March 19, 1975"
Methodist Bishops Will Battle Proposed Outlawing of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/05/archives/methodist-bishops-will-battle-proposed-outlawing-of-abortion.html,"MINNEAPOLIS, April 4—Members of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church voted here today to oppose an amendment to the United States Constitution that would outlaw abortion. The resolution, which had been revised earlier to remove an implied critical reference to Roman Catholic activity in behalf of such an amendment received unanimous approval. The deleted section said that the Methodist bishops “do not believe that the philosophical and/or moral values of one segment of the American religious community should become the law of the land.” Bishop James W. Armstrong, of Aberdeen, S.D., who had written the original draft, agreed to help revise it after other bishops expressed concern over its impact on interfaith relations. Bishop Armstrong told his fellow bishops that he was “weary of bulldozer tactics” by members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in behalf of the amendment. As adopted, the resolution said that the bishops “while upholding the sanctity of human life, stand opposed to an amendment to the United States Constitution that would presume to define the ‘personhood’ of the fetus and that would outlaw abortion.” The resolution continued that the bishops hoped that “sharp differences of opinion existent between and within American religious communities on this matter” would not hinder “ecumenical dialogue.” The United Methodist Church, with some ten million members, is the nation's second largest Protestant denomination. Its Council of Bishops has about 100 active and retired members, of whom 68 attended the five‐day meeting that ended here today. The meeting, held at the Sheraton‐Ritz Hotel, concluded with the installation of Bishop W. Ralph Ward, of Rye, N. Y., as the new president of the council to succeed Bishop Dwight W. Loder, Detroit, Mich. In an action yesterday, the bishops, including eight from overseas, took note of “the great tragedy of the war in Indochina” and urged all governments concerned to grant freedom of movement for uprooted peoples, to provide for their resettlement and repatriation and to release political prisoners. Bishops from the United States, in a separate action, appealed to their Government to cease military intervention in Southeast Asia, declaring that “continued intervention will only prolong the agony and death.” In another development the bishops received but took no action on a paper with several recommendations presented by the Black United Methodists for Church Renewal. One of its proposals called on the denomination, which has an estimated 415,000 black members, to create an/or strengthen 100 black churches by December, 1980. In connection with the meeting; the Minnesota United Methodist Conference sponsored “an evening of celebration and sharing” Wednesday night that drew 4,500 persons and resulted in an offering of $80,000 for world hunger relief. The main speaker was United States Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a United Methodist, who said that the nation was confused about its goals and floundering morally. He appealed for a return to Christian principles."

A Quarter Of Poetry,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/06/archives/a-quarter-of-poetry-poetry.html,"There is something of the letter, as Emily Dickinson and Thoreau knew, about every book sent out into a silent world. Reading the books of poetry published during one quarter of a given year is like opening the mailbox daily to a flood of letters, impassioned, reticent, wry, awkward, pompous, timid, arrogant, cheerful, touching, gifted, even stunning. It is everyone's Hope to open one of these letters and feel like George Keats in Kentucky getting the ode “To Autumn” in the mail. Sometimes, in the society of so many books, I feel pressed in on by too many voices, each, like the Ancient Mariner, with “strange power of speech,” until I recall What a pitifully small fraction of all lived life is written down, how mutely most life goes to the grave. And then these poems seem precious shards, as Adrienne Rich once said in a poem, full of pathos—a fragment here, a glimpse there, a breath escaped from the tomb. There are two interesting pieces of past life preserved in autobiographical volumes from England, the more problematic the new Tomlinson book. Tomlinson, the poet of slants of light and eloquent natural forms, has decided, in the first part (“Manscapes”) of this collection, to be openly self‐revelatory. The cover of the paperback shows a vacant and unrelieved Midland street—not a flower, not a tree, not even a blade of grass, only unforgiving stone and blank brick. Under a gray sky, a child with a toy shovel is pushing ashes and dirty snow into the gutter: This child, shovelling away what remains of snow—a batter of ash and crystals—knows nothing of the pattern his bent back lifts above his own reflection. The poet asserts a pattern of unconscious human beauty and organic form defying and transfiguring the inhuman street: there in its topmost air and eyrie rears that tree his bending sends up from a treeless street, its roots in the eye and in the net the shining flagstones spread at his feet. That is Tomlinson at an unconvincing moment, while the record of the street itself in the middle of the poem—“gutter, gable, slates/and chimney crowns to the high/pillar of a mill chimney/on a colourless damp sky”—is wholly believable, with just the discreet exquisiteness of sound in “pillar of a mill chimley” to do for the lines what the arch punning “air and eyrie” cannot do for the earlier putative transfiguration. The impulse to record the vanished past presses Tomlinson to his visual reconstructions: It took time to convince me that I cared For more than beauty: I write to rescue What is no longer there—absurd A place should he more fragile than a book. The history of most great poets records their discovery that they “cared for more than beauty,” and Tomlinson has said out loud what the central crux is for both poets and their critics—to do violence to their earlier selves, to make and recognize the less “beautiful,” but in some mysterious way more beautiful, poems of their later phases. Milton called it writing of “things invisible to mortal sight,” Herbert called it writing of virtue rather than of roses, Wordsworth called it writing of the human heart, “its tenderness, its joys, its fears,” instead of writing of the “aching joys and dizzy raptures,” of the despotic eye, Stevens called it writing of “the thing itself.” So this new departure for Tomlinson is one bound to win our respect; on the other hand, for an American taste at least, many of these poems are too self‐conscious (notably the title poem)” and too complacently rhymed: This place, the first to seize on my heart and eye, Has been their hornbook and their history. It is the landscape, as always in Tomlinson, that is most satisfying and most truly seen: It straggles A haggard valley and lets through Discouraged greennesses Back‐yards ran sheer To the factory wall, warm, black, pulsating, A tong, comforting, brick beast. One short brilliant quatrain is called “In December': Cattle are crowding the salt‐tich, The gruel of mud icily thickens. On the farm‐boy's Honda a sweat of fog drops. They are logging the woodland, the sole standing crop. If only Tomlinson would rest content with his instinct; but his intellect keeps breaking in, asking him to do the well‐made thought, the conclusive conclusion, the rhymed couplet, the satisfied wrap‐up. It is, I suppose, no crime in itself to be explicit: but in a poet of the implicit, explicitness seems a desperate violation, a sob of Puccini in a moment of Mozart. Tomlinson's scenes—all glinting surface and shimmering suggestion—can bear autobiographical statement well enough: but what they positively can't endure, what becomes, I think, a blasphemy of their particular realm of the sacred, is tidily helpful alle gorical explaining‐to‐the‐obtuse. And that tidiness mars the best poems of this revealing book. For the best at its best and the worst at its worst I quote the fine ars poetica marred by its final couplet, “The Marl Pits”: It was a language of water, light and air I sought—to speak myself free of a world Whose stoic lethargy seemed the one reply To horizons and to streets that blocked them back In a monotone fume, a bloom of grey. I found my speech. The years return me To tell of all that seasoned and imprisoned: I breathe familiar, sedimented air From a landscape of disembowellings, underworlds Unearthed among the clay. Digging The marl, they dug a second nature And water, seeping up to fill their pits, Sheeted them to lakes that wink and shine Between tips and steeples, streets and waste In slow reclaimings, shimmers, balancings, As if kindling Eden rescinded its own loss And words and water came of the same source. A lesser English book, but a grimly entertaining one, is D. J. Enright's “The Terrible Shears.” Enright is really a writer of light. verse, and he tells the quite horrible events of his childhood in a jaunty tone not devoid of its own brisk gruesomeness. Odd, but distinctive, owing a good deal to Lawrence, but with an enabling, and also disabling, common sense, Enright's verse admits that by the standards of world suffering, his “wasn't a bad life”:. No one was dragged out of bed by Armed men. Children weren't speared Or their brains dashed out. I don't Remember seeing a man starve to death. True, but at the same time, to the truest poetry, which must be the poetry of the single soul, irrelevant. Enright's baby sister was seen to “quietly disgorge a lot of blood” and disappear, his father's death certificate remarked that “a Contributory Cause of Death was Septic Teeth,” and his grandmother, after being “pushed into” a car, shouted “with a dreadful new voice: /'I know where you're sending me,/You're sending me to the Workhouse!'” Enright's tone of the worst‐below‐the‐worst polishes off the poem (“Geriatrics”) about his grandmother: She was found to be deranged on arrival, And they sent her on to another place. So she didn't go to the Workhouse after all. She died soon after. The banality of suffering suggests that none of us can write any longer about our own versions of it without irony. If the only alternatives to irony are bathos or false heroics, as Enright's poems imply, we have lost a great deal. Some brave attempts by Jane Cooper and Hayden Carruth to write about personal hard times are among the current batch of books. Jane Cooper''s prose, more eloquent than her verse, recounts the bafflement of her blocked poetic career, stopped not by marriage and children but by—who knows? Cooper tells a rather guarded and oblique story of her long silence after an early phase of writing, and then her recent resumption of poetry: “Is this primarily a political story? Is it a tale of personal neurosis? Or is it simply the history of one individual woman probably more twisted than I've allowed here, by lovers' claims and family ambitions?” Or it is lack of a compelling talent? Men, after all stop writing too. Even great poets stop, as the example of Rimbaud reminds us. Cooper's latest poems (1961‐73) are either bald, running to the obvious, or incomplete and cryptic. For the first, I quote the beginning and end of “Waiting” My body knows it will never bear children. What can I say to my body now, this used violin? ... Let compassion breathe in and out of you filling you with poems. For the second, the beginning and end of a 1967 poem: As a boy he was so silent She raged like a gnat . . No one could tell such stories; but he never cried, not once. What comes in between beginnings and ends doesn't help the sentimentality of self‐reference in the first instance nor the unexplained taciturnity in the second. Habits of a certain rationality and reticence undermine these poems, poems of a woman who, to judge by the testimony of the personal struggle retold in the prose memoir at the center of the book, is fine‐grained, intelligent, and a writer. Hayden Carruth's “Bloomingdale Papers,” is being issued 20 years after its composition. This long poem, written in the fifties, was composed during Carruth's confinement in a mental hospital. After a short prefatory explanation, we are given 75 pages of verse and prose of all mixed sorts—narration, reflection, comedy, bleakness, bland irony, sentiment, dryness, rage. The extremities of panic, tension, and madness are not concealed: One swirls away The hand moves, leaving Nothing to grasp. To be going, Slipping, sprawling, wallowing, Sinking, that is the panic. . . How tension grips me, Violence without and within, Heart hammers, heaves. These hurrying meters work better than the Audenesque lyrics, the somewhat stilted blank verse, or the attempts at mimicry of other patients. Carruth's diary of incarceration is a rare documentary, however ragged its edges. It never loses individuality for long; in spite of the often derivative verse, the personal note often shatters convention: I am crazy, I am not, I said, plucking the daisy Petals of my anxiety . . . Our faces are a cloud, Shifting. dispersing, vacuous, blown over the world. The mood is recognizably that of the fifties, and generality plagues the love poems, but a good deal of “The Bloomingdale Papers” survives as an honest record of an inexplicable and crippling affliction. “Love,” “grace,” “mystery,” “survive,” “strong,” “good” and “wise”—these almost ineffectual words blur too much of Lucille Clifton's new book with the endearing title “An Ordinary Woman”; but when this “ordinary woman” turns to Kali, who presides over the bloodier poems, the words rise and tug at their subjects, here “Cutting Greens”: just for a minute the greens roll black under the knife, and the kitchen twists dark on its spine. Clifton's poems on herself and her mother are items from a continuing story of mothers and daughters that is only now just beginning to be told in verse The Way In By Charles Tomlinson. 46 pp. New York: Oxford University Press.

As Clifton makes the rounds at night checking on her children. checking on strange night noises, she sees her mother in the same act: i go through my rooms like a witch watchman mad as my mother was for rattling knobs and tapping glass. Memories rise up of a conflict no less strong for being gently told—the wayward poet‐daughter making “lucysong rolled in the/corners like lint/exotic webs of lucysighs/long lucy spiders explaining/to obscure gods.” Faced with the lint and the spider‐webs, “if mama/ could talk/she would talk/ good girl/good girl/good girl/ clean up your room.” More bluntly than other recent poets, Clifton puts into raw lines the peculiar body and feeling of daily female life, so inimical to ideology, “ideas,” social “thought” and even the art of words: Sometimes the whole world of women seems a landscape of red blood and things that need healing, the fears all fears of the flesh; will it open or close will it scar or keep bleeding will it live will it live will it live and will he murder it or marry it. These surgical alternatives, repelling embellishment, are yet undeniable. But they are hostile to the whole impulse of elaboration which is the launching of a work of art (however it may utlimately choose the spare and the plain). Will it live? Will he marry me? He loves me, he loves me not. Impaled on the basic, Clifton recalls for us those bare places we have all waited as “ordinary women,” with no choices but yes or no, no art, no grace, no words, no reprieve. At the other extreme from Clifton, John Hollander writes poems that are all mostly panoplied, at their best not at their most hermetic (“The Head of the Bed,” reprinted here, breathes too much the exhalations of Stevens) but rather at their most graceful, in the poetry of compliment, like the poem given with a gold chain: Finite, but unended, Too narrow, like all our circles, To seem an eternal one. . . . Gold, like the touch of hands Clasping, but unchained. Something apparently momentous but too often unintelligible is presumed in these poems—portents, allegories, hints. A sequence of uneven poems, “Something About It,” contains the poem I liked best on rereading, a poem about a man (called “It”) contemplating his own writing: It sat gazing through the heat of Manhattan Not at that heat but beyond At Its own dim pages, from which gray words dripped Not unlike tears, or dried to Unsuspicious stains, ghosts of ghosts of scribbles. There is an elegy for Auden (written in fact for his 65th birthday) in which, in a courtly bow to convention, Hollander turns the dead into a constellation: And now the constellation . . . Rises: Der Dichter—if not seasonal. then all the more Present continuingly, and Alpha Poetae, the brightest Star, the one whose name everyone always recalls, Burns away knowingly. It is an elegy stylized and stylish, fulfilling Milton's command to poets, that they should “with lucky words favor [each other's] destined Urn,/And bid fair peace be to [the] sable shroud.” In this elegy and the one for Mark Van Doren, Hollander shows how his gifts, too easily veering by themselves into complication for complication's sake, can be saved by a given occasion. First books of more than usual individuality have been written by James Reiss, Betsy Sholl and Carl Dennis. Reiss, unlike most young poets, has found an authentic subject—a curiously flat sense of disaster and death. It is no accident that one of the poems is about Edward Hopper, that painter of flat emptiness, nor that he speaks of freezing a frame in a film of life on its way to death, nor that he shows us himselt as a child tranced by the X‐ray view of his feet in a shoe‐store machine. In Reiss, poems are laid in drawers, folded in books; memories arc like pictures cut out of magazines, inertia and insomnia are the two forms of life. Pursued by the same phantoms, which reappear on the telephone, in sequential rooms, in snapshots, in slides, Reiss writes them down in an accomplished plain style, with a momentum carrying whole poems along on the humming acceleration of a single sentence. Transfixed as a child of two by the rhythm of a swing in a park, Reiss would, according to his mother, “sit for hours pumping furiously,/ my mouth at last jammed shut, my huge eyes blank/and glassy as if an idiot/of motion bounced me on his toenail/high over the park, higher and higher.” (It would be nice to have more or these childhood portraits of the artist; the most memorable recent one besides this child‐poet enslaved to the rhythmic swing is Roth's wonderful childish fiction‐making out of mathematical problems retold in “My Life as a Man.”) The last poem in Reiss's book is about someone making his crystal watergiass “sing” by rubbing it with a wet finger, a metaphor for all self‐propelling song: And now he strokes it clockwise, slowly, stopping to wet his finger again and again, like an old man paging through a book—until the glass comes to life with a thin, high whine like nothing he has ever heard, and the others look up in amazement, catching on, holding up their glasses too, wetting and stroking them clockwise like ice skaters in unison. Reiss has the indispensable gift of rhythm, and that, combined with his compulsive subject, makes a very good beginning. Betsy Sholl keeps a species of war diary, jottings, noteson‐the‐run of the war between the generations, between the sexes, past and present. For all her edgy premonitions and terse warnings, she hopes for the best. In “Coexistence,” a good poem about a couple jockeying for positions of advantage, splitting up and coming back together, she registhe present mode of love: You want to ban me. I'm stalling for time. We circle your house in your mother's car, hungry and furious words like shrieks. In the reunion after the separation, there is a wary alliance: Becoming allies takes time. Secret meetings in Rochester Boston Montreal, sitting across tables trading my words for your silence . . . we lie down and begin to listen still wondering what we are feeling—what was it like before the war? Another style appears in Sholl's reflective poems, where she succeeds rather surprisingly in metaphysical puns and allegory: I dream of a terrible journey with rivers named parentsdesertchildren or children‐desertparents. . . I dream of a terrible journey with roads named end‐ofabilityto‐choose, with roads named ability‐to‐choose‐end forhing out in every direction. Finally, among the first books, a good natured, personal, social volume from Carl Dennis. Charming at first glance, the poems on second reading seem a little too simple, a little too planned; in one poem Dennis refutes a lecturer (who tells us that we are relatives of the wolf, that the law of the world is the law of the jungle) by reminding us first of the innocence of many animals (crows tumbling, dogs racing, whales singing) and then by recalling the evolutionary aspiration of all species: Remember your old cousins, Those fish who crawled from the sea When the seafood was plentiful And the land bare. Think of the voices they strained to hear As they chose to hobble on tender fins Painfully in the sun's glare. A cheerful thought, a cheerful parable. Dennis's disarming advice is eminently readable, and even his bad moments have an open possibility for remedy hiding ready to blossom. Life is seen as something to he encouraged, style as a happy labor, and solitude as an exercise in comforting oneself against the had judgment of others: Feeling lonely, I scan the divorce listings For the names of friends. Another couple foolishly trying to drive On terrible roads in the same direction Has met with a bad accident. It is typical that Dennis can find something consoling in his own unmarried situation: “This house holds no woman who's wasted her youth/These woods are free of children hurt by my negligence.” Dennis makes abstinence sound like achievement, so much does he look on the good side of things: the question is whether his speech, so full of sanguine enterprise, can deepen and take on more of life's tones. Three well‐known women poets—Diane Wakoski, Josephine Miles, and Margaret Atwood—have published new volumes. Wakoski's marks, I think, something of a plateau in her work. Her biting poems on men and her touching poems on her childhood and adolescence have by now earned her a place in all the anthologies, and she has every right to pause and think about her own writing. Most of the poems here concern art, but art seems less amenable to Wakoski's discursive and meandering meditations than past anecdotes. Her descriptions here of flowers, landscapes and birds bear traces, perhaps inevitably, of Lawrence (as did Sylvia Plath's flower poems), and some of Lawrence's de liberate autobiographical flatness recurs in her, but, where his language is driven and his pacing relentless, hers is nerveless and weak: I am myself moved, in retrospect, by how little I've had, and how not understanding the extreme poverty of my life left me innocent of the worst thing poverty does to people/ bitterness. We do react poetry with preconceptions, still—that it will be, as Hopkins put it, “the current language heightened,” with concentration, pressure and intensity. But Wakoski decides to combat this expectation of compactness in poetic language. Where letters were, there telephone calls shall be; where embarrassment, concealment, symbols were, there talk, confidences, open pain shall be; where line was, there fragment shall be. It's an esthetic one can't condemn in principle, but Wakoski has yet to make it work in her new reflective subject‐matter, perhaps because in her new morality of “understanding” she loses much of the force of pain and protest of her best‐known poems: “my final understanding,” she says of a love affair, “[is] that the pain of losing him is an image that itself must be a structure in my life, and that a myth is a set of beautiful memorable images.” True, possibly, but tepid. Wakoski's private chagrin and rage are still her more compelling/notes. Josephine Miles's new and selected poems show a quirky commenting mind still finding things of interest in the American scene, reliving in verse the Berkeley riots: Gassed going between classes Students said little, Huddled their books and ran. As helicopter crews waved down low at them They were silent Yelled and were silent. Now the trees speak, not running or reading But with cast leaves tallying The cost of a gas deterrent. My throat alive still cries But how to tell without dying Is not told by the dying trees. There is a need for more poems of this sort, poems, so to speak, of the day's news, now largely a preserve of interested propagandists. But Miles can also be metaphysical, as in her fine poem on teaching, “Paths,” about “going out into the fields of learning”: Ant labors, hopper leaps away; too early for the bee, The spider's silk hypotheses unfold Tenacious, tenable. “The spider's silk hypotheses” is worthy of Emily Dickinson, whose voice, in its dryer tone, has entered Miles's voice as well; but Miles is more humane than Dickinson in her parables, of which my favorite is about the drowning man (in poem called “Family”) who hollers “help,” caught in the undertow, while his unconscious family reply blandly: Hello, they will say, Come hack here for some potato salad. It is then that a seventeen year old cub Cruising in a helicopter from Antigua A jackstraw expert speaking only Swedish And remote from this area as a camel, says Look down there, there is somebody drowning. And it is you. You say, yes, yes, And he throws you a line. This is what is called the brotherhood of man. For all its comedy and factuality (two qualities present in all Miles's verse) the poem has the ring of moral truth, told by the survivor. Abstract help, when family is of no use at all, has rescued most of us at some time or other: in its stern impersonality, that help seems more sacred than any sponsored by blood ties. Miles has strict expectations of the world, a comic sense of her own unrealistic hopes, a stern judgment of her own failings, and an observant birdlike interest in classes of people unlike herself. She lacks the sweeter side of verse (or when it comes, it has an uncertainty about it) but her enterprise and sense of art are sure. Her early poem about poetry shares the satisfaction of the reader in the well‐made thing, but ends in the uncertainty of the author as he looks for that satisfying shape. Familiar to our readers In all its special vein Is the form of the tale in the author's careful form . . The palpitant unfoldment And dear and sudden end. The shape of the tale in the author's burning hope Familiar to our readers, But not the blind Looking around of the mind for the shape. Not enough of that “blind looking around” survives in Miles's poems, I think: they are almost too well‐wrought, without yet having the inevitability of the best‐wrought, but they never lack intelligence or feeling. Margaret Atwood continues to construct her guided missiles which have a deadly force of their own, poems so neat and silent that they move in space like an invisible invasion, de scend, pierce the mind and leave a wound. And yet in spite of her sense of life as mostly wounds given and received (expressed in this volume in a long series of Circe poems, no small boldness in the act of taking a myth so sacrosanct and doing it anew), Atwood attempts here both a new indifference and a new humility in her chronicle of the relations between man and woman (the chronicle as spiky and lethal in “Power Politics,” her last book). Her prayerpoem towards the end of this collection shows both the detachment and the humanity of the book: To be the sun, moving through space distant and indifferent, giving light of a hind for those watching To learn how to live this way. So much for the first half: “The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,/Though to itself it only live and die.” Atwood shares Shakespeare's distrust of this as the only mode, and the poem continues immediately: ... how to live this way. or not. to choose to be also human, the body mortal and faded, incapable of saving itself, praying as it falls. in its own way. We recall that Stevens wanted to write a fourth section of his “Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,” to be called “It Must Be Human,” and could not. To be human, Atwood daringly reminds us in the quotation from the gospel of the taunt addressed to Jesus by the mockers at the crucifixion, is to be “incapable of saving” oneself. I must not leave this volume, which has virtues on every page, without mentioning Atwood's comic sense, beautifully visible in the poem from the Circe sequence, “Siren Song,” where we learn the secret of the one song everyone would like to learn: the song that is irresistible: the song that forces men to leap overboard in squadrons even though they see the bleached skulls. The siren continues, luring the man closer and closer: Come closer. This song is a cry for help: Help me! Only you, only you can, you are unique at last. Alas it is a boring song but it works every time. This light side (with its own tight‐lipped truth behind it) engenders the various songs of transformations of the menturned‐to‐animals in the Circe sequence, which, though they have good lines, seem more often the work of the fancy than of the imagination, and are occasionally willed into being. Nonetheless, Atwood lets very little dross into her volumes, and she always repays rereading. David Ray's collection of new and selected poems, “Gathering Firewood,” stands at the opposite pole from Atwoud's sleek and seamless verse. Ray's stance is that of the clumsy truthteller, his honesty guaranteed by a stammer here, a childish phrase there, embarrassment somewhere else, his aim “The Touched Life,” as one poem calls it, a “spirit pure as the baby rabbit.” The touched life mostly isn't wanted, is victim to anything . . . can stand in the doorway and gawk, weeps at hikes leaning together, scrawls notes madly, shoves them into hooks, is lunatic, wonders which will come first, the collapse of capitalism or the emancipation of man The presence of Williams, who, in the poem named after him, “knew a poet/doesn't have to be on/his best behavior/all the time, has/many bad/poems, very/lifelike, very/relaxed,” stands behind not only the poems of sancta simpticitas and Franciscan concern, but also the poems, which I prefer, where Ray allows a purer descriptive sense its own unsentimental power, as it takes us through “grim warehouses, defeated fields,” “MacDonald fine orange wickets,” “message on dimestore crocks or brocade pillows,” “trailer parks, the sad young marrieds inside watching TV,” and a store with “lunch meat, right next to Shell NoPest.” When, in Ray, the deprived becomes the archaic, his tones are strongest: his mother, after his father dug a cellar, bearing “jars into the damp earth/Like a Cretan girl”; his grandfather “linked to the sea” by the pitchfork unearthed by the searching grandson. In the poem “The Archaic” Ray offers the definition which casts light on all the poems in this volume: To he archaic is to exist in a state of transition betveen a silent life and a whispering death. The poems that manage this transition from Ray's grandparents in Oklahoma to his children in Missouri, neither denying the rural nor omitting the sophisticated, prove the fullest repository of Ray's sensibility. An enterprising new venture, Black Box, a cassette‐journal, has just published Black Box 3, half Robert Bly, halt Sonia Sanchez, reading their own poems. I listened to that and to Black Boxes 1 and 2, all sternly unaccompanied by texts, so that the car is left to its own resources, and the poem left to its own evanescent sounds. I'm not sure how well it works for someone like me, for whom the poem is primarily the shock of beautiful printed collocations, which enter “that inward eye” that Wordsworth named for us, and cause those “more endeared” unheard melodies that Keats said addressed themselves to the spirit rather than to the “sensual car.” And yet every poem is enhanced by being read aloud: meanings and implications that have evaded the eye enter the ear. Though public readings of poetry arc still popular with certain audiences, thay have the charisma of the performing author; these cassettes, like the records by Caedmon and the Library of Congress among others, lack that power. In various ways (a group of musicians with Sanchez, a liveaudience‐tape of Bly reading “The Teeth‐Mother Naked at Last,” self‐accompaniment on a guitar) Black Box attempts to get some of the zest of performance into the recordings. But it is still radio, and radio is a poor second to the book or the live reading. I'd rather think of Black Box not as independent (as its brave propaganda makes it out to be, talking about “inventing a whole new medium for literary art from scratch”) but rather as co‐ordinate to books. In its wish to give equal time to blacks and whites, Black Box is most useful, since white readers aren't yet so able to translate words on the page into sounds in the ear in the case of poems written in black colloquial speech: in that sense, the editor is right in saying that black poetry “literally has to be heard to be believed.” Etheridge Knight is here as well as Sanchez; song writers are here as well as poets; and (most brave but also most problematic) foreign poets (including Third World ones) as well as native writers. The foreign poems are read simultaneously in the original and in English, in two stereo channels. Respectful; I like being able to hear the original. But I'd rather hear it before or after than simultaneously, especially with no texts provided. Though I don't believe, as the handout has it, that “during the sixties, the silly distinction between songs and poems lost all meaning,” I do think that things meant to be “chanted or sung” need recording, and the liveliness of Black Box in all its selections, ranging from well‐known poets like Bly and Clifton and Tate and Piercy to names wholly new to me (including something coming in Black Box 4 called the Witchdoctor Thea tre), meant I was never bored listening to the tapes. It's also nice not to be able to look up what's coming next (the virtue of no texts): everything on the tape comes as a surprise, and you listen hard so as not to miss a word. It's rather like a happening, with all the virtues and defects of that modern art form. The fidelity of the live recordings is sometimes deplorable, but there is something to be said for preserving what might turn out to be historic readings. I have left till last the new poet, Louise Gluck, who gave me most pleasure in the reading. I had not seen her first volume till I read this latest one, “The House on Marshland,” and the advance between 1968 (“Firstborn”) and 1975 is phenomenal. Just as the most depressing thing about ordinary well‐meaning verse is its predictability—in logic, emotional “curve,” and choice of language, so the most profound source of elation in reading a new species of poet is the surprise in every line as a new voice and a new sensibility declares itself. Gliick no longer sounds at all like Hart Crane, Lowell, or Lawrence; she sounds only like herself. The few poems from this collection that I had seen earlier in journals rise from the page wholly remembered, still entire as pure glimpse, refusing to divulge their secret, though one senses how extremely well‐made they are. Gltick's poems bear almost no relation to the “real” world, realistically perceived. Even the poems about abortion in the first volume are, except for occasional collapses into poverty of statement, remarkably free of journalism; instead, they draw landscapes of visionary dreariness, to borrow a term from Wordsworth: Husks, husks. Moons Whistle in their mouths, Through gaping mussels. Pried fish. And flies Like planets, clamped shells Clink blindly. Now, though a violent perception has not ceased, violent language has. Gliick's poems are almost dreamy; they drift in a reflection like the moon in a pool (the moon and the pool recur as powerful counters in her private language): Night covers the pond with its wing. Under the ringed moon I can make out your face swimming among minnows and the small echoing stars. In the night air the surface of the pond is metal. The world is trembling with significance: The moon is stationed in the beach tree, round and white among the small tin markers of the stars: Thirty years. A marsh grows up around the house. schools of spores circulate behind the shades, drift through gauze flutterings of vegetation. This is a poem about the author's being 30, but not really or exactly, since it is a poem entitled “For My Mother,” and the ending (quoted above) is more the source of its “meaning” than the brief glimpses of the unborn poet (with “the absolute/knowledge of the unborn”) of her mother (“the brick stoop/where you stand, shading/your eyes”) and of her father (“He closed/your eyelids with/two kisses”). In spite of the perilous echo of Keats in the line about the father, the poem survives, and eddies to its beautiful ending, where the vegetation is a sort of window‐curtain, the spores, the dormant life of the house, gone under till activated by a new life‐force, the stars the gravestones of the past, and the moon the surveying poetic mind. There is nothing diffident about a poet who dares to call one poem “The Magi,” and another “To Autumn,” recalling the immortal poems of those titles by Yeats and Keats. As it happens, neither of these is among the best poems of the volume, but they indicate Gllick's tacit defiance and selfassertion. I find the family poems unforgettable, like the one called simply “Poem,” about the parents' marriage as seen by the observant, uncomprehending, helpless child‐to‐bepoet: In the early evening, as now, a man is bending over his writing table. Slowly he lifts his head; a woman appears, carrying roses. Her face floats to the surface of the mirror, marked with the green spokes of rose sterns. It is a form of suffering: then always the transparent page raised to the window until its veins emerge as words finally filled with ink. And I am meant to understand what binds them together or to the gray house held firmly in place by dusk because I must enter their lives: it is spring, the pear tree filming with weak, white blossoms. No poet at 32 can he expected to reach this preternatural equilibrium in every poem, but the poems in the first half of this collection (the most recent?) almost always do. These reticent equivalents of the inner life seem like moments of experience transposed into a key almost out of our hearing‐range, so that we strain a little to hear a music almost escaping its moorings to the mortal. They float on a parallel plane, these poems, and send down filaments to hearers below, tantalizing threads which require of us an almost disembodied attention. A very peculiar power, and a new style, commanding in its indifference to current modes. ■"

Cross Hairs on Connally,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/07/archives/cross-hairs-on-connally.html,"WASHINGTON—“Ah wouldn't trust that feller,” John Connally used to say about untrustworthy characters, “any further than I could throw a chimney by its smoke.” Today, a jury will listen to Jake Jacobsen, a former Lyndon Johnson aide, being cross‐examined by Defense Counsel Edward Bennett Williams, and will form its impression about whether to trust Mr. Jacobsen's accusation that he bribed John Connally. Leaks from the Special Prosecutor's office for the past year have hinted at additional circumstantial evidence that would clinch the case; no such “smoking gun” has been produced so far, however, and now we are being told that the case boils down to which man is to be believed—the accuser or the accused. That is not strictly true. Put yourself in the jury box. You are not merely asked to believe Mr. Jacobsen, a confessed perjurer who is testifying in order to escape prosecution for alleged felonies in Texas. You are also asked to believe The Good Guys—the Watergate Special Prosecution force—who have been hailed and sanctified over the past two years as avenging angels combating the Forces of Evil. Now put yourself in the shoes of the typical juror. You are a black and poor Washingtonian, being asked to overcome natural prejudices in judging a rich and white Texan. You do your best to set aside ingrained animosities, just as a Catholic juror tries to do in an abortion case, or a Jewish Amor in a case involving an Arab terrorist, or a white juror in a case involving a black defendant. But that is not easy to do, which is why the Special Prosecutor likes to try, big cases strictly within the District of Columbia. It is no coincidence that every Watergate case brought to trial in Washington, D.C., has resulted in a conviction, and the only Watergaterelated case tried before a non‐D.C. jury—in New York—resulted in an acquittal. The prosecution's “edge” here is so enormous as to be scandalous. In this recession‐proof, political capital, the local media has devoted far more attention to Watergate than anywhere else; Mr. Nixon “and his henchmen” are hated here with an intensity unmatched elsewhere in the nation; and any fair‐minded observer would list this city at the very bottom of a list of a thousand places where a trial should be held in order to be fair. Serves 'em right, people say; a taste of their own medicine; what did those Nixon men care about individual rights when they were in the saddle? Thus, prosecutions soaked in prejudicial publicity before partisan juries are accepted as a kind of poetic justice at a time when our law courts could use more justice and less poetry. Of course, this jury could upset the odds and find Mr. Connally innocent. If the charge‐dropping bribe paid to Mr. Jacobsen by the prosecution is too galling; if the jurors are not shown incontrovertible evidence to corroborate the central part of the accuser's story; and if—above all—Ed Williams can separate John Connally from the guilt‐by‐association aura of Watergate, then perhaps conviction of former Nixon officials in the District of Co lumbia will prove to be non‐automatic. One antidote does exist to counter the poison of Nixon association, which is why Mr. Connally has a slim chance. His attorney, the Clarence Darrow of this generation, needs no instruction from the sidelines, but he would stand a better chance if he could counter the Nixon tape with the Zapruder film. John Connally has been the target of two different kinds of assassins. One took aim from the Texas School Book Depository on Nov. 22, 1963, and drilled a bullet into his back while he was accompanying President John F. Kennedy. Lee Harvey Oswald nearly succeeded in assassinating Governor John Connally as well. Whether or not a different kind of assassin—a character assassin, if such he be—will succeed in terminating Mr. Connally's political life is up to the jury. The analogy is not all that farfetched. At least Mr. Jacobsen has a rational purpose for seeking to strike down Mr. Connally: The accuser is freed from prosecution of criminal fraud in an unrelated case. Mr. Connally's tragic association with President Kennedy may balance the local antipathy to President Nixon; his counsel's reputation may compete with the never‐miss‐in‐D.C. luster of a prosecution that will dwell on the word “Watergate” at every chance. Whichever way it goes, it's jake with Jake. Thanks to the Special Prosecutor, Mr. Jacobsen is out of his big Texas fraud trouble, and has pleaded guilty only to giving a bribe. If the jury does not believe that he bribed Mr. Connally, and sees.him as a false accuser—then no bribe was given, and Mr. Jacobsen has his freedom and a good, long laugh."
New Episcopal Bishop Named on L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/08/archives/new-episcopal-bishop-named-on-li.html,"GARDEN CITY, L.I., April 7—A Louisiana‐born priest who opposes the ordination of women and looks with some reservation at efforts to achieve Christian unity was consecrated here as Coadjutor Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island in a liturgically colorful ceremony at the Cathedral of the Incarnation. I The prelate, the Right Rev. Robert Campbell Witcher, former rector of St. James Church in Baton Rouae, will automatically succeed the Right Rev. Jonathan G. Sherman. Bishop; of Long Island since 1966. A coadjutor is elected to assist the bishop of a diocese and upon the latter's retirement, resignation or death succeeds him in office. The cathedral was packed to its capacity of 850 for the twohour service. Nineteen prelates, vested in red and gold, were present for the ceremony and 12 participated in the service. The actual moment of consecration occurred when the consecrating bishops and the other prelates laid their hands upon the head of Father Witcher and said a prayer that began, “Pour out now upon Robert the power of your princely spirit.” He was then robed with his Episcopal vestments and the presiding bishop presented him with the other symbols of his office: the pectoral cross, ring, mitre and pastoral staff. The Right Rev. John Maury Allin, Presiding Bishop of the three million‐member Episcopal Church, was the consecrator. Co‐consecrators were Bishop Sherman and the Right Rev. Iveson Batchelor Noland, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana. In an interview, Bishop Witcher voiced firm opposition to the ordination of women to the Episcopal priesthood and to formal, organized efforts to unify Protestantism. “The scriptures bequeathed to the church a male priesthood,” he said, “and I hope the 1976 general convention of the denomination upholds that view.” Last July, 11 women deacons were ordained to the Episcopal priesthood in an irregular ceremony that the House of Bishops called invalid. A substantial majority of the bishops, however, approved in principal the ordination of women, and this position is considered to have a good chance of approval next year. Bishop Witcher, 48 years old, said he would not leave the church should the convention approve the ordination of women, but would “hate to see it happen.” “I believe in the ministry of women,” he said, “but not as priests and bishops.” Bishop Witcher was just as firm in his opposition to the Consultation on Church Union, which has been seeking the merger of nine Protestant bodies for more than a decade. Approach is Faulted He faulted the consultation for what he described as its “top level, hierarchical approach that leaves out the grass roots.” “I prefer a cooperative, informal ecumenical approach comparable to the military chaplaincy which ministers to all faiths without compromising the traditions of any,” he said. Bishop Witcher also spoke of his opposition to abortion. “I am opposed to abortion as a convenience, and feel that the unborn fetus has the right to life,” he said, adding, however, that “medical authorities are certainly within their moral rights in making decisions for a therapeutic abortion.” The Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, with 96,000 communicants, is the fourth‐largest in the nation."
"L.I. Medical Center, in New Building, Embarks on Effort to Change Old Image",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/08/archives/li-medical-center-in-new-building-embarks-on-effort-to-change-old.html,"EAST MEADOW, L. I. — The scrapbook is three Inches thick, filled with pictures of slight, premature infants and letters from their grateful parents. “As you can see, we are in the business of prolonging life,” said Dr. Wayne Klein, who runs the ward for premature infants at the Nassau Medical Center. Officials like to talk about the good things, like “prolonging life,” that happen at the county's public hospital, which hit bottom last year with a poor rating from an accreditation service. Since then, the center moved into its new 19‐story facility 12 months ago and acquired a new superintenlent, Donald H. Eisenberg, six months ago. The center recently emerged from Mr. Eisenberg's first major crisis—the charge by antiabortion leaders that the center was “practicing infanticide” on fetuses born alive during legal abortions. But the District Attorney f6und “no basis” for the charge, and Mr. Eisenberg said “now our full attention can be devoted to our work.” Old Image Fought One of Mr. Eisenberg's projects is to overcome the old image of the center, which he describes as “the place you go when there is nowhere else.” This image was acquired when the center was known as Meadowbrook Hospital. In its 40‐year‐old building, now partially demolished, on the Hempstead plains. Even as the county dredged up $65‐million to pay for the building, the center had troubles. Early in 1974, the medical center forfeited $400.000 in state funds because its psychiatric wing was labeled “totally inept.” It gave up performing open‐heart surgery because of a 42 per cent mortality rate, and it was revealed as allowing doctors to take outside practice. The major blow fell last year, when the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals gave it a one‐year provisional rating, which jeopardized much of its state and Federal financing. Following that rating, its superintendent for 11 years, Dr. James F. Collins, resigned under pressure. These disclosures raised serious doubts about Nassau's ability to provide specialized medical care. Offering salaries below New York City scale, Nassau had trouble competing for staff. And a private survey criticized the new building for being overspecialized for the needs of a public hospital. “This is the most magnificent facility I've ever seen,” Mr. Eisenberg says. “We are getting many private patients referred to us by doctors, or asking to come here. We believe we can be the finest public hospital in the country.” Mr. Eisenberg, 45 years old, worked for a drug company for a decade before going into administration at Mount Sinai Hoipital. Later he became acting chief executive officer with the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the top job. He was picked over 100 applicants for the medical center job, which pays $62,000 a year. He says he has tried to straighten out the paper work that led to the poor ratings, and has given each department, control over its own budget. “I was not particularly happy with the internal organization when I arrived,” he said. Before Mr. Eisenberg arrived, County Excubive Ralph G. Caso paid a surprise visit one summer night and angrily found a shortage of nurses. Mr. Eisenberg has been allowed to hire around 164 new staff members. At the same time, the occupanev rate has been raised from 75 per cent to the desired 85 per cent of the 725 beds. A previous abuse was the policy of permitting many psychiatrists and other physicians to take outside practices. “Our doctors must put in a minimum of 35 hours here,” Mr. Eisenberg said. “And he must inform the chief of service of all outside activities. We have had some resistance, and we still might lose a few, but I don't want people here whose loyalties are not here.” Another positive step was the resumption of state aid for the psychiatry section last July. The center had previously lost $400,000 because of poor rating. Mr. Eisenberg admits facilities are still strained by emergency night and weekend admissions from the county's 1.4 million residents. Mr. Eisenberg said his staff was preparing for the next survey, which will begin May 30. “I have no doubt the ratings were not improper,” he said. “But we feel we're pretty well along.” In an Interview, Mr. Eisenberg reserved special praise for the neonatal intensive care unit, which was charged by John Short, a founder of the Long Island Right ‐ to‐ Life group, with leaving a fetus “to die,” after it survived an abortion in January. Caught between pro‐ and antiabortion forces, the center performed 1,200 legal abortions in 1974. Around 40 resulted in births. None survived more than a few hours. Investigation Made According to an investigation by District Attorney Denis E. Dillon of Nassau County, a nurse from another floor visited the neonatal unit on Jan. 14 to view a living 18‐weekold fetus. The nurse saw the fetus in a “warmer,” an open incubator with a sophisticated heat and oxygen flow. But because she saw no intravenous or monitoring wires attached to the fetus, the nurse apparently felt that sufficient efforts were not being made to keep the infant alive. According to Dr. Klein, all premature infants are placed in the “warmer” for emergency treatment at birth. Later, most are placed in the traditional covered “isolettes.” But he said the open “warmer” provided the same services as an “isolette,” but the infant, weighing only 300 grains, was judged too small to receive intravenous feeding. The staff provided suction of the air passages, took bacteria cultures And gave an injection of vitamin K before the infant died 10 hours after birth. According to Elizabeth A. Taylor, the chief nurse in the neonatal unit, the nurse from the other floor did not question any procedures she saw. And Dr. Klein said “I hope this was not a set‐up.” The nurse, who has not been publicly identified, is reported to have participated in antiabortion rallies. She later was in contact with Mr. Short, who has called the District Attorney's report a “whitewash.” But Mr. Eisenberg says the neonatal unit is one of the finest sections in the hospital he is “trying to make it even better.”"
"Humanitarian, Say Some; Easing Guilt, Say Others",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/09/archives/humanitarian-say-some-easing-guilt-say-others.html,"As the children arrived by the planeload from South Vietnam to face new homes, new families and, in many cases, new names in the United States, interviews in the metropolitan area indicated that opinion on the airlift was as divided among the public as it was among the experts. To some the airlift was a generous humanitarian effort; to others it was political propaganda, and still others wondered why some American children go uncared for while the switchboards of the adoption agencies have been jammed with requests for the Vietnamese foundlings. “Saving the kids is the main thing,” said David Rosenberg, a Manhattan lawyer, as he strode through Rockefeller Center while on his lunch hour. “But I'm not sure that the people who are adopting these kids realize what they are in for. “Adoption is not easy under any circumstances, and these children are going to need a lot of time and attention. I think we owe them something.” Mr. Rosenberg was not the only one who felt that the United States had a continued responsibility to the people of South Vietnam and that the airlift of the children was part of that responsibility. In Bloomfield, Conn., Patricia Quinn, who has three children and is active in Catholic Charities, said of the adoption program: “We haven't been able to lend any other suitable support to the Vietnamese, and we are filling the needs of America, where we don't have adoptable children.” Mrs. Quinn said she thought that American couples have trouble adopting because most of them want very young children and the liberalization of abortion laws has made the adoption of foreign children more common. In Hartford, Edwina L. Clohosey, the telephone receptionist at the Connecticut Senate, also cited the tight adoption situation as a good reason for the airlift. Part of Responsibility “I love children and I think it's wonderful that people want to give these children a home,” she added. “After all the killing I don't see why they shouldn't.” Even people who opposed the war in Vietnam and are still wary of any United States intervention said they approved of the babylift. “I opposed the war, but I think the airlift is a good thing,” said Sylvester Cole, a student from the Bronx. “If we sent money it would be wasted and would probably go to other things—not the children.” “I think as much as I oppose the war in Vietnam, we should set aside our views and concentrate on the humanity of it all,” Joel M. Ellis, a Fort Lee, N. J., resident said. “We should try to get together with organizations or individuals to do what we can.” But everyone did not agree that the children should be shuttled to the United States for new homes. Joe Biscardi, a Manhattan carpenter, said he felt that the children were being used as political propaganda. ‘With Their Own People’ “Look at these headlines,” Mr. Biscardi said, as slapped the back of his hand against a newspaper. “You don't see any headlines shouting about the mass starvation in this country or the children here who need homes. Why doesn't someone airlift children from Appalachia or Bedford‐Stuyvesant to clean, middleclass homes? Those children belong in their own country with their own people and culture.” Tina Jackson, who lives in a comfortable section of Hartsdale, also expressed contempt for the lack of interest in and compassion for American children in the same position. “I was wondering why this compassion for children so far away while there are those who need a little bit of love and attention right here at home,” she said. “Biafra was a problem last year but I never heard anyone expressing concern about the starving kids they saw there.” John Stiner of New Haven, who works as a research analyst for the Connecticut Elections Commission, expressed doubt about the motives of the people promoting the adoptions. “This must indicate a lot of guilt in our society,” he said. “It is a repercussion of our involvement there over a decade.” Even some of those who said they supported the airlift and were happy to see the children in new homes expressed concern for their future in this country. Phyllis Cohen of Hicksville, L. I., who has two children age 15 and 13, said: “I think it's a two‐fold problem. The first has been solved by bringing the children here. I'm glad to see the children here. “The other half of the problem, of course, is what will happen when the children grow up,” she continued. “If their foster parents remain part of the organization that sponsored bringing them here then there won't be a complete elimination of their own culture and they won't be alienated from the society in which they are forced to live.” “Why doesn't someone airlift children from Appalachia or BedfordStuyvesant to clean, middleclass homes?” • “We should set aside our (war) views and concentrate on the humanity of it all.”"
Catholics for Abortion Are Denied Communion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/09/archives/catholics-for-abortion-are-denied-communion.html,"SAN DIEGO, April 8 (AP)—The Roman Catholic Bishop of San Diego has ordered that holy communion be barred to any Catholic who “admits publicly” to membership in the National Organization for Women or pro‐abortion groups. The order from the Most Rev. Leo Maher, effective this weekend, is contained in a letter sent to all priests in the diocese and will be required reading at masses this weekend. Uunder the order, members, of the women's rights organization and abortion advocates will not be permitted to serve as a lector laymen reading scripture during mass or serve in any elected lay church office."
Senate Upholds U.S. Abortion Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/11/archives/senate-upholds-us-abortion-funds.html,"WASHINGTON, April 10—The Senate refused today to halt the use of Federal funds to finance abortions for the poor. The proposal, a deeply emotional one that is sure to be revived later this session, was killed by a vote of 54 to 36 as the Senate debated and then passed a bill to extend nursetraining and five basic Federal Health programs. Pitted against each other in the highly charged debate over abortions were two Roman Catholics—Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Dewey F. Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma. As proposed by Senator Bartlett, no Federal Medicaid or welfare funds could have been used to “pay for or encourage the performance of abortions' except those necessary to save a mother's life. Arguing that the abortion question had not been fully explored by any committee of Congress, Senator Kennedy dedared that “this floor is not the place to resolve this issue” by way of an amendment. Furthermore, Senator Kennedy argued that the Bartlett proposal would discriminate against the poor and was so loosely worded that it might bar use of Federal funds for the intrauterine device (IUD) and the so called “morning after” pill, which is still in the experimental stage. “Why does a woman use the IUD? to get aborted,” he argued. “Why does a woman take a morning‐after pill? To get aborted.” Senator Bartlett protested that his proposal “has nothing to do with birth control or IUDs ... We're talking about $150‐$200‐abortions. The morning‐after pill costs very little.” “I take it, then, that you don't mind spending a very little money for abortions but you do mind spending a great deal,” Senator Kennedy retorted. Senator Kennedy also suggested that the Bartlett proposal might prevent rape victims from obtaining effective medical assistance to prevent pregnancy. “Persons raped very seldom become pregnant,” Senator Bartlett said, “a very small number.” “That's not very consoling to those women who've had that tragedy,” Senator Kennedy said. Under persistent questioning by Senator Bartlett, Senator Kennedy conceded that he was personally opposed to abortion. But he said that under the Social Security law, funds could be used for abortion when “medically necessary.” The United States Supreme Court ruled in January, 1973, that an abortion performed in the first three months of pregnancy was within the sole discretion of the doctor and patient. The Court further held that states could impose regulations on abortions in the last six months of pregnancy, and in the last 10 weeks, could prohibit abortions except where they may be necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Joining Senator Kennedy to ask for defeat of the Bartlett amendment was Senator Jacob K. Javits,....Republican of New York. He argued that it was a “backdoor” effort to nullify the Supreme Court's decision. New York's other Senator, James L. Buckley, a Conservative‐Republican, argued forcefully for the Bartlett proposal, noting that 28 per cent of all abortions in this country are now financed by the Federal Government. The most recent Government figures show that from $40‐milIlion to $50‐million in Federal funds was spent in 1973 to help finance about 270,000 abortions. While rejecting the Bartlett proposal, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment by Senator Henry L. Bellmon, Republican of Oklahoma, to prohibit Government officials from coercing welfare recipients into obtaining abortions or being sterilized. The nursing and health program bill that served as the vehicle for today's debate on abortion encompasses two separate measures that President Ford vetoed In December. As revived by the Senate, the coined bill has not yet been acted upon by the House. The nurse‐training section of the bill would authorize $654‐million over three years for constructive grants, traineeships, student loans and other aid to student nurses. The authorization for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, would be $187‐million. The other portion of the bill passed today would authorize $1.9‐billion for five basic Federal health programs—community mental health centers, family planning, migrant health centers, community health centers for the medically under‐served in rural and inner‐city areas and general health service grants to the states."
Bishop Issues Warning To Catholic Feminists,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/11/archives/bishop-issues-warning-to-catholic-feminists.html,"SAN DIEGO, April 10—Faced with rising criticism inside and outside the church, the bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of San Diego agreed today to a modification of his pastoral letter denying communion to Catholics who are “members of proabortion groups such as the National Organization for Women.” When the letter of the Most Rev. Leo T. Maher, singling out NOW for its “shameless agitation” for abortion, is read from the pulpits of the diocese's 178 parishes Sunday, it will carry a hurriedly prepared addendum, explaining that membership in NOW, in itself, will not constitute a basis for denying the sacrament of communion. A diocesan spokesman, the Rev. Eugene Fischer, said the “clarifying” addition will make clear to the halfmillion Catholics in the four‐county diocese that only those who refuse to renounce NOW's “pro‐abortion stance” will be denied the rite of communion. The bishop's letter of instruction to diocesan priests states, in its original form, that membership in NOW and other pro‐abortion organizations is punishable by denial of the sacraments. The bishop's instructions were said by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington to be tantamount to excommunication and to be the strongest punitive measure yet taken on the abortion issue by any element of the Catholic Church in the United States. “Bishop Maher apparently, in issu big his pastoral letter, was, simply avoiding use of the more severe term, but what he has ordered is, in effect, excommunication,” said Russell Shaw, information director of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Written by the Most. Rev. G??bert Chavez, Auxiliary Bishop, the less severe “explanation” was said to have been approved by telephone by Bishop Maher, who is in Europe. Bishop Chavez was said by church sources to have informed his superior that his pastoral letter, as drafted and distributed, had not only produced a storm of controversy but also considerable confusion. Bishop Maher is expected to return to San Diego this weekend, but not in time to prepare and distribute a revision of his original letter. The “explanatory” addition to the Bishop's letter, to be read at all masses Sunday in the diocese, will say in part: “Bishop Maher did not intend to condemn the NOW organization, but rather to condemn the pro‐abortion stance which is included among its stated goals. Bishop Maher made specific reference to the NOW organization because it is active in San Diego. His statement is not a condemnation of persons or organizations but rather of a pro‐abortion stand. “A person can belong to NOW and still receive the sacrament of communion, if that person rejects NOW's pro‐abortion stance.” Bishop Maher's letter had drawn angry reaction, not only from NOW's national headquarters and local chapters, but also criticism from elements within the Catholic Church. View of Nun Sister Sally Furay, vice president and provost of the Catholic University of San Diego, openly criticized the singling out of NOW, which, she said, has many admirable objectives that Catholics can approve, although she disapproves of its position on abortion. “If we ask women not to have abortions, what are we doing about their problem; how are we helping them?” Sister Furay said. The pastoral order by Bishop Maher, who has long been a militant antiabortionist and who has been active in the nonsectarian Pro‐Life League here, evoked immediate angry reaction from NOW chapters in the area over which the Bishop holds authority, and from the organization's national headquarters in Washington, as well as from the Planned Parenthood Association. NOW, with some 40,000 members nationwide, has more than 1,000 members in the counties of San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial, which make up Bishop Maher's diocese. In his pastoral letter, the Bishop said: “No person who claims and professes views that are contrary to the teaching of the church can claim to be a practicing Catholic, nor are they to be admitted to the sacraments. As Bishop of San Diego, I reaffirm the universal, constant and clear doctrine of the Church and of the moral evaluation of abortion.” Referring to the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, and “attempts being made to discredit those who still believe in the inviolable value of every human life,” he said he was forbidding “all priests, deacons and extraordinary minsters” to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist to anyone who publicly admits membership in a pro‐abortion group such as NOW. Anne Radlow, president of the San Diego NOW chapter, said the Bishop's directive was “an indication that the Church is losing control over its members in this matter.” In Washington, Jan Liebman, legislative vice president of NOW, said the organization would dedicate its Mother's Day demonstration at the Vatican Embassy there to its San Diego chapter. “We are calling our Mother's Day mobilization a ‘Day of Outrage’ in a direct public challenge to the Roman Catholic hierarchy attempt to undermine the right of women to control their own bodies,” she said."
Extent of Anti‐Catholicism Is Debated; Issue Linked to Abortion and School Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/11/archives/extent-of-anticatholicism-is-debated-issue-linked-to-abortion-and.html,"After Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was convicted in Boston last February of manslaughter in an abortion operation, a spokesman for the American Roman Catholic hierarchy said that much of the news coverage of the event had been marked by “innuendo and unfounded accusation directed against the Catholic community.” Similar criticisms were widespread among diocesan newspapers and individual Catholics. They said the general assumption seemed to be that Catholics (who were predominant on the jury) were not capable of making fair decisions—even though, it was noted, the trial involved alleged manslaughter of a fetus, not the abortion itself. Aside from the question of the validity of these assertions, the reaction brought into focus a feeling among some Catholics that anti‐Catholicism was on the rise. ‘Liberal Elites’ Blamed The Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, a sociologist who is program director of the National Opinnion Research Center of the University of Chicago, says he finds anti‐Catholicism among people he describes as “liberal élites” who stereotype as racists all “hard hats” or “white ethnics”—terms he says are euphemisms for Catholics. Michael Novak, the author, says he first noticed anti‐Catholicism two or three years ago in politics, where, he says, Catholics are associated with “the machine” in contrast to non ‐ Catholic reform forces identified with “morality.” The Rev. Virgil C. Blum, president of a two‐year‐old organization called the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, contends, among other things, that pro‐abortion forces openly encouraged hostility against Catholics. Father Bluth, who is on leave as professor of political science at Marquette University, says he also finds anti‐Catholicism reflected in a United States Supreme Court decision in 1973 that rejected New York State aid to private, principally Catholic, elementary and secondary schools. He contended that, at the same time, the Court supported state assistance to a Baptist college in South Carolina and other private colleges and universities that, he said, “happen to be Protestant.” Others cite the prevalence of Polish or Italian jokes, and cartoons and antireligious parodies in recent publications. The league, modeled in part after the Anti ‐ Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and said to have 13,000 members, maintains that it has persuaded six advertisers to stop placing ads in the National Lampoon because the magazine published what Father Blum called “scurrilous” attacks on Catholics, Protestants and Jews. However, others in the Catholic community dispute these assertions and insist that antiCatholicism has decreased steadily, particularly since the election of John F. Kennedy as President in 1960. John Deedy, managing editor of Commonweal, views claims of anti‐Catholicism as “the manifestation of a kind of inferior ity complex” and suggests that a few vocal spokesmen inadvertently have created the impression that the claims are more widespread than they really are. Discounting the abortion controversy as a manifestation of anti ‐ Catholicism, Msgr. George Casey, who writes for a diocesan publication in Boston, remarked: “There are civil libertations and women who think the church is trying to shove its doctrine down other people's throats. We were a little rugged and they retaliated.” Donald J. Thorman, publisher of the National Catholic Reporter, says he sees no rise in anti‐Catholicism and that most of what he does perceive is among Catholics themselves who are anti‐institutional. And an official of the United States Catholic Conference, the action arm of the church hierarchy, says those who accuse others of anti ‐ Catholicism ought to be more certain that is what they are talking about. “For example, I'm not sure all hard hats can be called Catholics,” said the official, who did not want his name used. At any rate, the issue of anti‐Catholicism has been widely discussed within the Catholic community. And, whether they are talking about bigotry or about a mistaken notion that bigotry exists, spokesmen agree that a major element is the church's involvement over the last decade in the controversial abortion and school aid issues. “Catholics feel beleagured because whenever they speak out against abortion they are identified as Catholics,” the official said. Many Catholics—and non‐Catholics — complain that valid arguments regarding the “pro‐life” and parochial school aid positions have been obscured or distorted because the two issues are labeled publicly as “Catholic” even though they have many non‐Catholic supporters. ‘Tag‐Line’ Opposed Mr. Novak says the Catholic label extends beyond those issues. “I'm described as a Catholic philosopher and I find that obnoxious,” he said. “Sidney Hook isn't described as a ‘Jewish philosopher.’ That tag‐line is always there, and I think that's discrimination.” No one is comparing the situation to blatant episodes of anti‐Catholicism in the past, such as the burning of a Boston convent in the period of the Know‐Nothing party in the mid19th century. “It's subtle, it has a different form, just as anti‐Semitism has a different form,” Mr. Novak said. Father Greeley contends that it is not religious bigotry; the notion of the “Catholic ethnic superpatriot racist” is “not against the Pope, or against doctrine,” he says. “It's against people who happen to be Catholics.” Father Greeley attributes the increase in anti‐Catholicism to a kind of “hydraulic” scapegoat effect. When one prejudice goes down—namely anti‐black sentiment—another goes up, he said. Rabbi Marc H. Tannenbaum, director of interreligious affairs of the American Jewish Committee, says he thinks there is some validity to complaints that abortion and parochial school aid have not always received fair hearings. But he warned that recent comparisons of this situation to more successful efforts on behalf of Jewish causes could foment anti‐Semitism “in less friendly hands.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/12/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Today's Times carried a front‐page story reporting Con Edison's request for a two‐step 21.7 per cent increase in electric rates estimated to produce $456 million in additional income. This proposed increase comes only a few months after the Public Service Commission's approval of a prior electric rate increase for the company designed to yield $300 million annually. Aside from the serious question (not considered herein) which exists as to the propriety of the proposed rate increase and which was so promptly and justifiably raised in challenges by both Mayor Beame and Consumer Affairs Commissioner Guggenheimer, there is another important aspect which seems to have been overlooked. It surfaced during the news conference at which Mr. Luce, Con Edison's chairman, outlined the company's case for its current request, which included the need to “obtain enough (new) capital to finance new projects.” But consider what then results: If the rate increase is granted, the additional revenues in excess of those needed to offset Increased operating costs become part of the net income of the company. This in turn increases retained earnings and likewise Taxpayer Inequities To the Editor: The tax relief bill recently passed by Congress contains a major inequity in its treatment of taxpayers who itemize deductions vs. those who take the standard deduction. While an increase is provided in the maximum allowable standard deduction which, for a middleincome family in the 25 per cent bracket would amount to $150 annual tax savings, no comparable relief is provided for families who do itemize. Many families Itemize deductions because they are homeowners and can apply their interest and taxes to their deductions. These homeowners have been burdened with a doubling of the cost of heating their homes in the last two years. Many apartment dwellers, on the other hand, have not had the cost of these fuel increases passed on to them due to rent control or lease terms. Further fuel‐oil price increases will add to this burden, as additional taxes or import restrictions are imposed, although gasoline prices, which have only risen 50 per cent in the same period, could absorb these increases without exceeding double their previous levels. Congress should make an effort, in writing the energy bill, to grant homeowners a tax offset equivalent to that given to those who take the standard deduction. The proposed tax credit for insulation is not the answer, since is a one‐time item, and of no help to homeowners like myself who have al augments capital. The corresponding funds thus remaining unspent are now available for investment in new plant and equipment. Unless regulated, such acquisitions automatically increase the company's base for future rate‐making computations. It is submitted that to the extent that such funds as are utilized for plant expansion represent retained earnings which are neither contributed or borrowed capital, nor the ordinary accumulations of earnings resulting from prudent managerial policy, but are rather the outcome of special windfalls produced by rate increases specifically designed to yield them (as in this instant case), the cost of plant so acquired should be separately ascertained and excluded in all future determinations from the rate base as a form of contribution by consumers in aid of construction of plant and equipment. While it is true that any such increase must necessarily result in an increment in the value of the holdings of shareholders, insult is added to injury if it gives them a future return on capital contributed not by them but by the customers. EMANUEL SAXE Riverdale, N. Y., April 3, 1975 The writer is dean emeritus, Bernard M. Baruch College, C.U.N.Y. ready invested in the necessary insulation and turned down their thermostats. An attractive solution would be to allow an itemized deduction for fuel used to heat the home. For the average homeowner, that would result in a tax saving roughly equal to that granted those who take the standard deduction. It could also provide relief to landlords and thus remove the inflationary pressure of increased fuel costs on rents. ALEX E. FRIEDLANDER Brooklyn, April 2, 1975 • For Improved Justice To the Editor: In early October 1972, I was mugged at the front door of my house in Hollis Hills, Queens. The mugger was caught within three hours of my report to the police. I pressed charges and six hearings over a span of six months ensued. When my father and I walked into the sixth hearing, the defendant, his wife, and his brother‐in‐law were overly friendly, waving, smiling, and bidding us good luck. All the evidence which helped catch the mugger was offered: (1) description of car—year, type, color; (2) license plate number—one number off, M instead of W; (3) $40 in the mugger's pocket in the exact bills I reported missing; (4) an autoharp pick—he did not even know what an autoharp is; (5) an almost exact approximation of his height and weight; (6) accurate description of his clothing, etc. Other evidence was also given. The mugger was freed after the sixth hearing because of an illegal Last night on Channel 5 news, there was an item about the $1 rapist, who was finally caught after raping about 25 women in Queens. His name, Leroy Hamlin, the same man who had mugged me. I feel that if the judicial system were improved, my experience could have saved many women from being raped. Mr. Hamlin had several previous arrests, prior to mugging me. BETH SOFER Jamaica, N.Y., April 1, 1975 Of Affirmative Action To the Editor: Mordeca Jane Pollock is right: There is discrimination against women in academics. It is unjust. Positions should be made available without regard to race or sex. [Op‐Ed March 4.] But she Is wrong about other things. Not only women are injured by “old boys” networks. They are not so much sexist as clubby, and all of us—boys and girls—are excluded who are not “old boys.” Hiring is often done this way, but it is also often done by merit. How else to explain the truly outstanding departments found at many universities? Women and others unjustly discriminated against should be given equal opportunities because everybody should be given equal opportunities. But they should not be given more than equal opportunities. If discrimination against them was wrong, so is discrimination against others. “Affirmative action” should mean a determined effort to find the best candidates. The proper function of government is to require such effort. Neither government nor university should define the result by requiring a specific number to be hired. This is not just. No one knows what percentage of women or minorities would have been academics if not for discrimination. It is absurd to say they would have been represented in percentages approximating their percentage of the population. This is not so generally for ethnic, racial or social groups. Not all sorts of goals are quotas, but these are. The Berkeley Plan requires that university to hire 97 women, 20 blacks, 42 Asians, 10 Chicanos, 0 “native Americans” and 9 “others.” If these are not quotas, what are? If a specific number of positions must be given to members of a restricted pool, then members of that pool will be chosen over others, and this is discrimination. It is illegal and immoral; history shows that it is also dangerous. The proper remedy for unjust discrimination is equal application of the laws. Unfortunately H.E.W. pressure stampedes administrators who, trying to avoid the accusation of one sort of discrimination, practice another. Some who oppose quotas and reverse discrimination are not the very same tenured professors who were originally responsible for discrimination. Some of us don't want a return to the status quo ante. Some of us want the end of discrimination. Some of us think that principle is at least as important as result. Some of us don't want to take an eye for an eye. (Assoc. Prof.) BARRY R.

New York, March 25, 1975 The U.S. in Vietnam To the Editor: The sickening plan to salve our national guilt for the holocaust we visited on Vietnam by rapidly bringing war orphans to these shores has failed. Instead, American “superior technology” has murdered Vietnamese babies one last time, in one of the greatest human tragedies ever, the crash of the C‐5A orphan jet. If we were really a humane people with a humane Government we would have aided Vietnam's hundreds of thousands of orphans much earlier. We might have helped North Vietnam rebuild its hospitals, orphanages and schools, giving the aid we pledged to them in the peace agreement and then never gave. But we are not that kind of people. As the monk in the film “Hearts and Minds” said: “The Americans come here and say we are slant‐eyed savages: But the Vietnamese have 2,000 years of history. It is not we who are savages...” The United States has refused to answer the NLF request for humanitarian aid of clothing, food, canned milk for the refugees in their areas. We will not help them put their ravaged country back together, help them feed the people caught in the chaos. We accede to the NLF's hardwon right to govern the country, for we see we have lost the war. But the refugees, the orphans, the hungry people in the provinces “lost to Communism” are no longer important to us. Camn Ranh Bay is now “Communist” and so we will not make arrangements with the NLF to unload food and medicine there. How can we aid people whom we spent a decade killing, making freefire zones out of the areas controlled by the people who are soon to form the Government of. South Vietnam? Exactly how phony our concern is for the Vietnamese people whose suffering we now witness daily will become clear when the PRG forms a new national administration in Saigon. That will he the ,end, of the humanitarian aid, for the business of America is not to aid Communists, but to kill them. ROGER NEVILLE WILLIAMS New York, April 4, 1975 • Federal Funds and Abortion To the Editor: Paul Strohl Jr. approves Senator Bartlett's proposal (defeated today in the Senate 54 to 36) to ban Federal funds for abortion as implementing “the freedom of those [Federal taxpayers] who have no taste for subsidizing feticide” (letter April 5). Why stop with fetophiles? Why not generalize the Bartlett proposal, and ban Federal funds for (1) blood transfusions, since Jehovah's Witnesses have no taste for subsidizing them, and (2) all medical and hospital treatment, inasmuch as Christian Scientists have no taste for subsidizing them? . Followed to its logical conclusion, the Bartlett approach would substitute, for the individual patient's freedom of choice of treatment where Federal funds are needed to pay for it, a power to veto such choice by any religious group that objected to that form of treatment. By limiting this veto power to a single religious group—those within the Roman Catholic Church and their fellow travelers on this issue outside it who believe that a human person begins at conception (a metaphysical fantasy rejected, in express terms, by the United States Supreme Court in 1973 and by the Italian Constitutional Court in 1975) — Senator Bartlett betrays a profound misunderstanding of the value which the antiEstablishment‐of‐Religion clause of the First Amendment seeks to protect. To him, while all religions may be equal, some apparently are more equal than& others. (Prof.) CYRIL C. MEANS Jr. New York Law School New York, April 10, 1975 • Pressure on Israel To the Editor: Is current United States pressure on Israel to make further concessions to an Egypt that is unwilling to renounce belligerency an example of what President Ford means by his press conference pledge that “We will stand by our allies. . . .”? Many of us who opposed U.S. military intervention in Indochina recognize, nonetheless, that the political and military debacle there is a blow to American prestige and credibility. If it should be followed by cutting Israel adrift, what nation, indeed, will continue to place its faith in American pledges? JOSEPH P. LASH New York, April 3, 1975 • The Liberal Mind To the Editor: Your editorial of March 28 on “The Tide of History” is a masterpiece of self‐deceit and wishful thinking—typical, alas, of the American liberal mind. I am not defending the Administration's policies for the simple reason that, with the exception of erratic “patchwork,” they do not seem to exist. What amazes me, however, is your systematic failure to see that since World War II, Communist totalitarianism, whether monolithic or not, has been progressing in all parts of the world and this constitutes today the only discernible “tide of history”; that once in power, Communism has never been dislodged. In spite of the innumerable voices reaching the West, in spite of all “Gulag Archipelagos,” the Western intelligentsia seem to remain unshakably faithful to the motto: “no enemies on the left.” Truly, “piles vult perdere dententai.” (Rev.) ALEXANDER SCHMEMANN Dean, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary Crestwood. N. Y., March 28. 1975"
Ideas & Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/13/archives/ideas-trends-education-philosophy-earth-science-a-manned-soviet.html,"In a cryptic announcement characteristic of the Soviet space program, the Russians have disclosed that a manned craft has been forced to “abort” its mission and return to earth. The crew of two is reported safe. A later version of the three‐stage booster that veered off course last weekend is scheduled to put a Russian team into orbit July 15 for a link‐up with an American spacecraft. The Russians have assured the United States that the failure will not mean delay of the joint mission. Periodically there has been speculation that the Soviets are not technologically ready for the joint mission, but American officials maintain they have no misgivings. From time to time, the Russians have had problems with dockings and landings; more missions have been conducted without mishap. In July, the Americans and Soviets will launch and re‐enter independently. A Soviet rocket is to boost a Soyuz capsule into orbit; the United States team will follow in an Apollo capsule launched by a Saturn 1‐B. A Little‐Known, But Mighty, Volcano Mount St. Helens, a volcano 50 miles north of Portland, Ore., in sparsely Inhabited southwestern Washington State, Is not so well known as Mounts Rainier, Hood and Baker, its neighbors in the Cascades. But it now appears it has had a more remarkable record. According to specialists of the United States Geological Survey, Mount St. Helens has been “more active and more violent” in recent history than any other volcano in the United States outside of Alaska and Hawaii. The scientists predict another eruption soon, perhaps before the end of the century. Mount St. Helens was last active in 1857, and the geological record of the last 2,000 years shows only two dormant intervals of more than 200 years. The scientists, Dwight R. Crandell, Donal R. Mullineaux and Meyer Rubin, suggest that even in the apparently dormant periods, the volcano may have been active. The historical record shows that explorers and early settlers after the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1806 reported a dozen eruptions; only one left geologically identifiable deposits. The team compared Mount St. Helens's modern history with that of other volcanoes, including the Italian Mount Vesuvius, on the Bay of Napleo. The activity of Mount St. Helens, they say, probably included catastrophic episodes like the Vesuvian eruption that in 79 A.D. burled Pompeii and Herculaneum. Philosophers Out of Work Professional philosophers have traditionally been absorbed into teaching, but about 500 of the 8,000 academic philosophers in the United States have lost their teaching jobs this year, and 2,000 recent doctoral graduates in philosophy are unable to find places. Some have turned to such jobs as cab‐driving. The American Philosophical Association thinks this is a waste to society, and it has started a campaign to “sell” the value of the “thinking man.” With their problem‐solving ability and a little supplemental training in a specific field, philosophers should be quailfied for a variety of jobs in government and business, says Prof. Norman Bowie of Hamilton College, the association's executive secretary. He says purists in the field don't like the idea. “A philosopher's training in logic makes him a natural for computer programing, and some of our members have landed government jobs dealing with social trends,” said Mr. Bowie. “Experience with decision theory can be applied to urban planning. Situations involving business and medical ethics and problems such as reverse discrimination are possibilities. An ombudsman's job is ideal.” While philosophers with doctoral degrees have almost always turned to teaching, philosophy majors Who db not go on to graduate work generally have entered fields such as law, business, civil service and theology. The association is planning institutes and conferences for businessmen and government officials to see what can be done, and for university philosophy department chairmen to discuss possible changes in curriculum. The Bishop As Activist In the San Diego area the National Organization for Women (NOW) has one of its more active groups, with 1,000 members. Like other NOW branches, the group advocates the right to abortion, among other feminist causes. In the San Diego diocese the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes abortion, has a bishop who is a particularly militant antiabortionist. Last week NOW and the bishop met head‐on, and the bishop backed down, somewhat. The bishop, the Most Rev. Leo T. Maher, issued a pastoral letter singling out NOW for “shameless agitation” for abortion and denying communion to “members of proabortion groups such as the National Organization for Women.” The bishop instructed diocesan priests to read the letter from the pulpit today. There are about 500,000 Catholics in the diocese. The letter provoked criticism and angry reaction from NOW. A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said Bishop Maher's action was the strongest punitive measure taken on abortion by any element of the Catholic Church in the United States. In the face of the reaction, a diocesan spokesman said Bishop Maher, who was in Europe, had not intended to condemn NOW, only its views on abortion. The pastoral letter was modified to say that “a person can belong to NOW and still receive the sacrament of communion, if that person rejects NOW's pro‐abortion stance.” (More Ideas,& Trends, Page 18) Case Histories of Two Volcanoes Upper scale for each volcano shows eruptions per historic records.

Ideas & Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/13/archives/ideas-trends-continued-liberals-now-worry-about-federal-power.html,"“The coercive power of the Federal purse...” From the age of Franklin Roosevelt to that of Lyndon Johnson, such warning phrases were the hallmark of the political right this country. But the phrase was used the other day by a figure with authentic liberal credentials: Kingman Brewster Jr., the president of Yale University. He warned against “use of the leverage of the government dollar” to achieve social aims. Mr. Brewster gave many examples of what he saw as a tendency toward coercion by Federal appropriation. One was a proposal, not enacted so far, to withdraw all general Federal support from any medical school that does not require a proportion of its graduates to practice in areas of the country where there is a shortage of doctors. The danger that may lurk in conditions on the grant Federal funds was the subject of a speech by Mr. Brewster to the American Bar Foundation. Evidently, the perceptions of Federal money and power have changed in recent years. The assumptions of liberalism and conservatism are not quite what they were. Until lately, liberals and reformers were characteristically in favor of extending Federal programs and Federal influence in American life. The reason was simple: Washington's ideas on social and economic issues were likely to be more enlightened than those of most state governments. Liberals also tended to prefer nationwide solutions. Thus, over the years, Federal money moved into such areas as education, housing, welfare. Federal rules often accompanied the money. What liberals have belatedly realized is that the same technique may be used for ends of which they disapprove. Congress might, for example, attach anti‐busing clauses to Federal school aid appropriations. Or medical funds could carry a ban on fetal research—a current controversial provision. Another proposal, by Senator Dewey F. Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma. was defeated last week. It would have prohibited the direct or indirect use of Federal moneyfor abortion services unless a woman's life was in danger; the language raised doubts about the performance of abortions in hospitals receiving any Federal funds. And aside from particular unwelcome ideas, liberals are less sanguine generally about the efficacy of Federal programs, and more persuaded of the values of local initiatives. There is also a constitutional irony involved. The Constitution left such matters as education to state and local control; the Federal Government could not, for example, directly regulate universities or local hospitals. In the 1930's, liberals developed the legal approach of introducing Federal rules by attaching them as conditions to Federal money. Now conservatives are copying the tactic. A well‐known example is the amendment by Senator James L. Buckley, New York Conservative‐Republican, stopping funds schools and colleges unless they allow students to inspect their own files. Constitutional limits on Federal social and economic regulation were a prime issue before the United States Supreme Court for generations. In 1918, for example, the court held unconstitutional a law forbidding the movement in interstate commerce of the products of child labor. As late as 1936 it struck down the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Act because it used the Federal taxing and spending power to persuade farmers to reduce their acreage—a matter, the majority said, for local decision. Justice Stone's classic dissent in that case said Congress must have “the power to relieve a nationwide economic maladjustment by conditional gifts of money.” The views of Justice Stone—and Justices Holmes and Brandeis, who dissented on similar issues over the years—soon became the law. The Federal Government's reach is so great now, under its taxing and spending and commerce powers, that the idea of litigating such issues has a dusty ring to it. The courts would be likely to question the validity of a condition on Federal grants only if it directly affected individual constitutional rights, if, say, a citizen had to give up freedom of speech to get a grant. But the only such law in recent years, requiring recipients of Federal student loans to say they were not Communists, was dropped before it could be tested legally. Mr. Brewster was not trying to get, these issues back into the courts. He was suggesting, rather, that Congress and the public think more about the old constitutional value of federalism—the diffusion of power in local hands. The main thrust of Mr. Brewster's concern was, naturally, higher education. In addition to the Buckley Amendment and the proposal for medical education, he mentioned affirmative action—the Federal effort to increase the number of women and minorities among students and faculty. Again, he objected to the sweeping nature of the enforcement device: “If we are to receive support for physics, let's say, we must conform to Federal policies in the admission of women to art school, in women's athletic facilities and the recruitment of women and minorities not just in the Federally supported field but throughout the university.” No One Else Acted One ready response to this criticism is that on many of these matters the Federal Government moved because no one else would. There were real wrongs in the handling of student files, for instance: damaging mistakes that could never be corrected while the files were secret. And neither universities themselves nor local authorities seemed to do much about it until Senator Buckley acted. Similarly, there is a clear need for doctors in remote areas; and it is a fact that women have been victims of discrimination in appointments to faculties. Anticipating such arguments, Mr. Brewster said in his speech that he agreed with the goals of many of these Federal policies. “But it does not follow that the end justifies the means,” he said. For the reliance on Federal conditions as the mechanism for change introduced Federal control of educational policies, control that might not always be so benign. The warning is symptomatic of a growing liberal skepticism about the Federal Government's benignity. The Nixon years obviously have a good deal to do with that. When the White House is found to have tried to stop Defense Department grants to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—because M.I.T.'s president, Jerome Wiesner, was listed as “an enemy”—it is not surprising if liberals begin to sound old conservative fears about Federal power."

ABORTION BACKERS DENIED EUCHARIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/14/archives/abortion-backers-denied-eucharist-priests-in-san-diego-refuse.html,"SAN DIEGO, April 13—While heated arguments took place outside, at least 80 members of the National Organization for Women were turned away from the communion rail in Roman Catholic churches here today when they refused to renounce their support of abortion. In most of the 178 parishes of the San Diego diocese, priests refused the sacrament to persons wearing NOW symbols. They acted in response to a letter of instruction from the Bishop, the Most Rev. Leo T. Maher, who singled out NOW for what he called its “shameless agitation” in favor of abortion. The instructions of Bishop Maher, who is in Europe, had been described by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington as being, in effect, excommunication, and the strongest punitive measure yet taken on the abortion issue by any Catholic prelate in the United States. The The Bishop's letter, ordering denial of the sacrament of the eucharist to all Catholics who are “members of pro‐abortion groups such as the National Organization for Women,” was either read or distributed in printed form at every mass in the diocese, which stretches from Death Valley to the Mexican border and from Arizona to the Pacific Ocean, embracing 512,000 Catholics. ‘Clarifying’ Letter Several churches failed to make mention of a subsequent “clarifying” letter from the diocesan auxiliary bishop, the Most Rev. Gilbert Chavez, saying that Bishop Maher had not intended to condemn NOW or any other women's rights organization “but rather the proabortion stand that is among NOW's stated goals.” “A person can belong to NOW and still receive the sacrament if that person rejects and renounced NOW's proabortion stance,” Bishop Chavez said in an effort to dispel some of the controversy created by Bishop Maher's strongly worded pastoral letter. Anne Radlow, president of the San Diego chapter of NOW, led about 200 of the chapter's 700 active members and a large number of supporters in the largest of several “protest vigils” at noon mass at St. Brigid's Catholic Church in Pacific Beach. She scoffed at Bishop Chavez's statement and his assertion that the denial of communion does not constitute excommunication. “His so‐called clarifying letter was meant merely to prevent an uprising within the church over Bishop Maher's cruel and uncalled for action,” she said. While excited and at times angry arguments were going on outside the church, principally between women wearing NOW buttons and men and women members of the Catholic‐dominated Pro‐Life League, Msgr. Donald F. Doxie and five priests assisting him at the communion rail were alert to any communicants wearing NOW buttons. A Smiling Priest Wendy D'Addario, a nurse, school teacher and an officer of the San Diego NOW chapter, was greeted by a kindly smile from a young priest who asked her if she believed in abortion. “I told him that, like other members of NOW, I was not a pro‐abortionist but that I strongly believed every woman should have a free choice, that she should be master of her own body and that every child that is born should be wanted and loved,” she said. The priest replied that “in good conscience” he could not administer the sacrament to her and asked her to move on down the rail. Roselle Lassere, also wearing a NOW button, when asked whether she believed in abortion, replied, “I believe in the law of our land.” She was promptly told she could not receive communion. The Supreme Court has severely limited the restrictions that states may impose on abortions. Altogether, about 25 women members of NOW or supporters of the organization were turned away from the St. Brigid communion rail, also four or five men who voluntarily told the priest that they supported NOW's objective. NOW claims ?? national membership of 40,000. A spot check of Catholic churches of the area including St. Joseph's Cathedral in downtown San Diego, indicated that at least 80 and perhaps 125 or more Catholics who identified themselves as members of NOW, the Pro‐Abortion League or Catholics for Freedom of Choice were denied communion today."
U.S. Rights Panel Opposes Abortion Restrictions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/15/archives/us-rights-panel-opposes-abortion-restrictions.html,"WASHINGTON, April 14—The United States Commission on Civil Rights stated today in a formal report its opposition to a constitutional amendment or legislation restricting the freedom of women to obtain abortions. The commission's unanimous report said that a constitutional amendment restricting access to abortion would “undermine the first, ninth and 14th Amendments.” An anti‐abortion amendment would come into conflict with the First Amendment, the report said, because it would have the effect of “compelling every woman to accept the view that a constitutionally protected ‘person’ exists from the moment of conception, even when such a view conflicts with an individual woman's religious views.” The commission's report was attacked by Cardinal Cooke of New York, who called it “shocking.” He said that the report “raises serious questions about the role of the Commission on Civil Rights and its fidelity to the legal mandate under which it was established.” “We have come to think of the commission as a defender of the powerless and oppressed,” his statement continued. “However, in this instance it has apparently joined the ranks of those who would violate the rights of the most powerless among us—the unborn child.” The commission has statutory authority to study essentially any subject in the whole area of civil rights, and to make reports: It has no authority to require compliance with its views by any individual or organization. The commission's report noted that the Supreme Court had asserted a woman's unlimited right to abortion in the first three months of pregnancy and a right limited only by some medical considerations in the second three months. The decision was made essentially under the 14th Amendment. In addition, the commission said that an anti ‐ abortion amendment to the Constitution would “undermine the Ninth Amendment which reserved to the people of the United States Certain rights that were not enumerated in the Constitution.” A right to abortion was generally accepted at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, and thus is among these guaranteed rights, the report said. Restrictions on abortion on medical grounds were not enacted until the 19th century. The commission's report also cited a number of attempts, through legislation, to limit the access of women to abortion. It said all those that had been enacted should be repealed and those not yet enacted should be defeated. It singled out for special mention, in this particular, the Legal Services Corporation Act, which prohibits use of any of the corporation's funds to litigate a woman's right to an abortion. This provision particularly discriminates against low‐income women, the commission said, since they “have no other access to legal assistance in attempts to vindicate their rights.” The commission also warned that establishing a legal principle that a fetus, from the moment of conception, was a “person” could lead to conflict and chaos in several areas of the law including inheritances and taxes."

"Nursing‐Home Runaway, 102, Backs Living Alone",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/15/archives/nursinghome-runaway-102-backs-living-alone.html,"When you get old, you can still live alone and like it in this city, even if you are 102 years old, are handicapped by cataracts in the eyes and have only $228 a month with which to pay your bills, Henry Jones testified yesterday. Mr. Jones told members of the Moreland Commission on nursing homes that while his apartment, at 109 West 129th Street, was shared by “me and the rats and the roaches,” it was preferable to a nursing home. Morris ?? Abram, chairman of the commission, pointed out to Mr. Jones that if he went into a nursing home, life might be easier and the Government would pay $2,000 a month for his care. Mr. Jones, a forceful speaker with close‐cropped gray hair, wearing a tan brocaded tie and an apple‐green shirt trimmed with narrow ruffles, gestured with unshaking hands and sneered mildly. “I am a runaway from a nursing home,” said Mr. Jones, who gave his birthdate as March 17, 1873. He said he had been in a home where “they took all my money” and Social Security checks and locked up his clothes. As the three men and two women on the commission listened avidly, Mr. Jones told how he got a friend to bring him clothes, slipped out of the home, “got behind a bush and changed and kept on going.” That was in 1960. After that, Mr. Jones said, he sold goobers and sometimes pecans,“trying to make a living.” Since 1973, though, he has not had “the (health in my legs to get around.” Yesterday's hearing, the secHond conducted by the commission, was designed to permit the elderly to give their views concerning what is and is not being done for them by the government. In a four‐hour closed meeting before yesterday's hearing, the commission unanimously agreed to draft and submit to the Legislature this month proposals designed to curtail abuses such as those that drove Mr. Jones from his nursing home. The proposals will he aimed at increasing the accountability of nursing home operators, combating fraud and monitor ing nursing‐home care. Included will be requirements for independent audits, public disclosure of the audit reports and the assessment of treble damages for fraudulent billing. Mr. Jones, one of 11 persons called to testify yesterday, said his bigges,t problem was “not getting enough to eat.” He also said he wished his income would enable him to “get some pleasure—even if it's just sitting in a park and looking at mosquitoes and frogs and pigeons.” Mr. Abram told Mr. Jones that “the government is saving $28,000 a year on you and yet you are hungry and I think it is a shame.” “Well, it is,” Mr. Jones replied cheerfully, and the spectators at the hearing, held at the Jewish Guild for the Blind, 15 West 65th Street, were reminded that he had opened his testimony by saying that “I always feel like taking the bitter with the sweet. No need grumbling. It won't help.” Three of the other witnesses live in nursing homes where they said they were happy. They were Bella Brager, 92 and Allen Moore, 68, who live at Isabella Geriatric Center, and Bridgette Murphy, 82, a resident of Kingsbridge Nursing Home in the Bronx. Mr. Moore, a retired Pullman porter and merchant seaman, said, however, that life in a previous nursing home, the Towers, had been “dreadful.” He said he had seen a nurse beat another patient with the patient's belt. “The food was all right,” he said, “but a roach crawled right onto my plate—roaches used to get in the bed with you.” He went to the Towers after suffering a “stroke and a heart attack at the same time.” Mr. Abram asked each witness what bothered him most. Each cited a different problem, and all spoke bravely, without tears. Miss Murphy, her words enriched by the brogue of her native Ireland, said quietly, “I'm on my way out. I'm just going to die soon.” Lucy Smithberg, 77, a former milliner, responded, “I dread using up the money I have—what will happen then?” Mrs. Smithberg had testified that she was able to get along alone on Social Security payments of $227 a month in the apartment she had shared with her late husband. She said she managed, despite the loss of most of her sight, “with the help of a daycare center and I have a few dollars saved up.” This morning, she said, still in a firm voice, “I received very bad news. I'm a little upset. I have to go through two eye operations again.” They wiH cost her $750, she said, because she is not on medicaid. Abortion Curb Overturned ST. LOUIS, April 14 (AP)—A three‐judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled today that St. Louis must allow abortions in city‐owned hospitals and that the city must also hire physicians who do not object to performing abortions. The judges said that the city's policy of prohibiting nontherapeutic abortions was unconstitutional."
CURB ON ABORTION VOTED IN JERSEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/15/archives/curb-on-abortion-voted-in-jersey-legislature-would-restrict.html,"TRENTON, April 14 — A highly controversial measure banning state Medicaid payments for abortions unless the life of the mother is in danger cleared the Legislature this evening with passage by the Assembly by a vote of 46 to 18. Although nine Federal District Courts in eight states have declared similar bills unconstitutional, Governor Byrne said a news conference last week that he would eign the measure unless the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled it unconstitutional. Bill Before Court A Pennsylvania bill similar to New Jersey's proposed statute is pending appeal in the United States AUpes Court in Philadelphia, and because New Jersey is part of that court's jurisdiction, its opinion will be binding here. One state official said today that the Governor in all likelihood would wait for the court's decision before signing the measure. In other events today, the Senate conducted a highly unusual session in a New Brunswick motel meeting room, in an effort to reach an agreement on an income tax. However, the Democratic majority leaders told reporters afterward that the Senators had failed to reach a consensus on a tax plan, and that a floor vote, scheduled for next Monday, would be put off until April 28. The Medicaid bill, sponsored by Senator Joseph Merlino, Democrat of Mercer County, would prohibit poor women who rely on Medicaid to pay their medical bills from obtaining reimbursement for abortions except when the operation was performed to save a life, the so‐called therapeutic abortion. The issue is one of the most controversial in the emotionally charged aborton issue. Last Friday, the. United States Senate refused to bar the use of Federal and Medicaid funds for abortions, but that proposal may be revived. The Right to Life Organization and other antiabortion groups are strongly opposed to the legalization of abortion and the use of any public tax money for such a medical service. Discrimination Charged Opponents of the ban have charged it discriminates against the poor and against minority groups, essentially making abortions available only to those who can pay. They contend, furthermore, that the right to choose an abortion is a woman's basic right. In January, 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that no state could interfere with abortion in the first three months of pregnancy, and that in the fourth to sixth months the state could impose health regulations. Abortion in the last three months could be performed only to save the mother's life, the court said. According to a spokesman in the State Attorney General's Office, the Pennsylvania decision now on appeal held that it was unconstitutional to reimburse costs for women delivering babies, and at the same time to withhold payments for women terminating pregnancy by abortion. New Jersey's history of paying for Medicaid abortions is inconsistent. Following the ?? ed States Supreme Court decision, William F. Kugler Jr., then State Attorney General, sanctioned the use of Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women. Last year, after the Medicaid abortion bill was approved by the Senate in June, the practice was continued in some cases and refused in others. In order to avoid embarrassment and delay, several doctors reported they had simply referred their Medicaid patients to New York City, where Medicaid payments are not questioned. Approval of the abortion bill tonight came at a time when the abortion issue was being fought heatedly around the state. In Montclair, for instance, a citizens' group has thus far prevented the opening of an abortion clinic there. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court made its ruling more than two years ago, about half of New Jersey's voluntary hospitals still refuse to perform abortions except to save the life of the mother. Two Children and Mother Killed by a Fire in Linden LINDEN, April 14 (AP)—A woman and her two small children were killed today when fire swept through a two‐family house in this Union County industrial city, the police said. The victims were Mrs. Maryann McNally Wern, a 32‐yearold divorcee, and her children, Thomas McNally, 5, and Janet McNally, 7. Authorities said the badly burned bodies of Mrs. Wern and the children were found on the floor of their apartment. Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bridgeman and their three children, who live in the second apartment. escaped the early morning ?? after being awakened by ?? barking dog."
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/16/archives/new-jersey-briefs-suspect-indicted-in-death-of-2-fetuses-hotel.html,"Winfield Anderson of Camden was indicted by a Camden County grand jury for first‐degree murder in the death of twin fetuses and for shooting their mother in the abdomen during a robbery at her house. The mother, Nicki Spearman, was more than seven months' pregnant. About an hour after the shooting, the twins were delivered by Cesaerean section at Cooper Hospital. Both died within hours after delivery. The mother recovered. Albert A. Mills, assistant Camden County prosecutor, said the case ultimately might affect state laws on abortion if it establishes that,a fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy has a right to life. A Supreme Court ruling in 1973 permitted abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy but said nothing definitive about the third trimester. Hotel Robbers' Conviction Upheld The conviction of three men for the half‐million‐dollar robbery of a Lakewood hotel in 1968 was upheld by a state appeals court in Trenton. The Appellate Division of Superior Court said it found no merit in the arguments of the three defendants that testimony by a police informer bad prejudiced the case against them. The three, Nicholas Valvano, Glenn Dela Matte and Bernard Furst, were convicted in Ocean Coynty Court with two other men of the robbery at the Fairmount Hotel, mostly on the testimony of the informer, Herbert Gross, who once owned a different Lakewood hotel. Mr, Gross, who has testified about organized crime activities at several trials and hearings, has been given police protection by the slate. Bayonne Highway Protest Barred A temporary injunction was issued in State Superior Court barring 900 Bayonne municipal employes from disrupting traffic on roadways leading into the city in a protest over stalled contract negotiations. Judge Frederick Kentz Jr. issued the order in Jersey City against members of five city unions who had been distributing leaflets at Exit 14C of the turnpike and other highways after traffic was backed up more than three miles, according to officials, during rush hour periods since the picketing began last Wednesday. The morn than 1,000 Bayonne policemen, firemen, sanitation and municipal office.workers have been without a contract since Jan. 1. The unions are not on strike. Picketing has been handled by off‐duty workers. Hospital Site Election Still Months Off Federal officials told Governor Byrne that the selection of a site for a new Veterans Administration hospital in the South Jersey Philadelphia area was still several months away. Mr. Byrne met with the Federal Regional Council, a body composed of the directors of Federal regional agencies in the district that includes New Jersey. New Jersey and Pennsylvania are vying for the proposed hospital.

Byrne Formally Proposes $1.1‐Billion Tax Program,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/17/archives/byrne-formally-proposes-11billion-tax-program-governor-to-appeal.html,"NEW BRUNSWICK, April 16 — Governor Byrne formally proposed today a $1.1‐billion tax program that includes a graduated state income tax and promises $300‐million in local property tax relief. Contending that “time was running out for the great fiscal decision facing New Jersey,” Mr. Byrne said he was “taking his case for tax reform to the people.” The Governor has faced continued opposition in the State Senate to an income tax. While he proposed an income tax in his legislative budget message earlier this year, today was the first time the Governor stipulated exactly how much it should raise and‐identified other components of his overall program. The third component of the Governor's tax program would he a 2‐point Increase in the 5.25 per cent corporate business tax, raising an additional $70‐million. Spending Projected Mr. Byrne said at a news conference at Rutgers, the State University here, that he proposed to spend the $1.1‐billion as follows: ¶Five hundred million dollars to close a projected gap of $487‐million in the administration's proposed $2.82‐billion state budget. ¶Three hundred million dollars to be given back to communities or directly to individual taxpayers in the form of rebates during the first year of the program. From then on, the $300‐million would be allocated for increased state aid to public schools, as mandated by the State Supreme Court. ¶Three hundred million dollars would provide a homestead exemption of $5,000 on the equalized assessed value of a home and a flat $60 payment to apartment tenants. In addition to the income tax that would raise $900‐million, Mr. Byrne also proposed a local property tax on business and industry to prevent companies from reaping a tax windfall from the over‐all property tax relief envisioned in his program. The business‐and‐industry tax also would provide $130‐million in new revenue to the state. Designated as the business stabilization tax, it would be calculated at $3.25 for every $100 of equalized assessed valuation. If the local property tax was $3.25 or more, there would be no tax liability and business and industry in those communities would not be required to pay the tax. However, if the local property tax rate fell below $3.25, business and industry would be required to pay the difference. For example, if the local property tax rate was $1, the business stabilization tax would be $2.25. Refunds Proposed Under the homestead exemption, homeowners would pay their full property taxes to their respective municipalities, with the state refunding the amount paid in taxes on the $5,000 exemption. If the tax rate was, say. $5 for every $100 of the equalized assessed valuation, the homeowner would receive a rebate of $250 from the state. The Governor's program, announced here as part of the university's week‐long series of public events dealing with communication, was essentially the same package that was considered by the Senate en Monday. Apparently the fact that the plan did not get very far on Monday prompted Mr. Byrne to announce today that he was beginning a public campaign in support of it. “Beginning today.” the Governor said, “I shall take the case for the income tax to the people in an effort to rally their support where possible and demonstrate their understanding that it is needed.” Mr. Byrne said his campaign would include several television appearances this weekend, person ‐ to ‐ person meetings and open house forums in Bergen and Gloucester Counties. As for the basic essentials of his program, which would take effect July 1, if enacted, Mr. Byrne said he “was not wedded to every last detail.” But he insisted that any changes sought by the Legislature must retain the program's “fiscal integrity.” The Governor returned to his original proposal for an income tax—a graduated tax of from 1.5 to 8 per cent, or about half the existing rate in New York. The tax would apply to income earned in New Jersey. In addition, the income tax would include a provision that would require a minimum tax of 10 per cent on high incomes to eliminate the Federal tax shelters afforded to the wealthy. “This tax package will not solve all our problems for all time,” the Governor said. “But it is the fairest way to solve the very large fiscal problem we have this year. It will not burden the elderly, those on fixed incomes, the unemployed and those with the least ability to pay—groups which are already hit too hard by our existing inequitable system of state and local taxes.” Several weeks ago, Senate Democrats agreed to vote on an income tax by next Monday. However, their failure to reach any kind of agreement two days ago forced them to put off any vote until April 28, at the earliest, with some Senators speculating that their vote may be delayed until next month. New Aide Named In other developments, Mr. Byrne announced that he was naming Charles Carella, the executive director of the State Lottery Commission and a former assistant when Mr. Byrne was the Essex County Prosecutor, as his executive secretary, replacing Donald Lan, who announced earlier this year that he was leaving the Governor's circle of close advisers. Mr. Byrne also said he had not decided whether he would approve the 50 per cent toll increases at bridges and tunnels operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He is scheduled to discuss the increases with Governor Carey on Friday. Mr. Byrne announced he would sign a measure that would cut off Medicaid payments to poor women for abortions, even though he conceded that the law might be declared unconstitutional later by a Federal Appeals Court in Philadelphia."
NARCOTICS SCHEME TRACED TO PRISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/18/archives/narcotics-scheme-traced-to-prison.html,"Five men were indicted here yesterday on charges of smuggling heroin into the United States in a major narcotics conspiracy that was allegedly planned and organized in a Federal prison. The defendants were accused of conspiring to smuggle 528 pounds of heroin with a wholesale value of $2.6‐million at the time and a street value estimated at $42‐million. They succeeded in smuggling almost half this amount into the country, the indictment said. According to the five‐count Federal indictment, Joseph Stassi of Brooklyn and Jean Claude Otvos of France were prisoners in the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta when they set up the smuggling scheme. They are still serving narcotics sentences in the prison. Mr. Stassi alegedy recruited his brother, Anthony, to conduct arrangements outside of prison with Jean Guidicelli to bring heroin into New York from France by way of Montreal. The fifth defendant in the case, William Sorenson, was in the Atlanta prison when the alleged conspiracy was formed in March, 1970, but he soon completed his sentence and then allegedly assisted Anthony Stassi with the smuggling operation in New York. Joseph Stassi, now 70 years old, and his brother, Anthony, who is 66, have long criminal records that include gambling and abortion cases."
State Is Told It Can Limit Clinics To Performing Early Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/18/archives/state-is-told-it-can-limit-clinics-to-performing-early-abortions.html,"TRENTON, April 17 — The State Attorney General's office said today that the state's Health Department could legally limit the performance, of abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy to licensed hospitals. This would prevent them from being performed in abortion clinics. Concerning first ‐ trimester abortions, Deputy Attorney General Richard M. Conley advised the Health Department that it should not exercise any regulatory controls over abortion clinics that it does not impcse on other health‐care facilities. “unless the department feels there is a compelling need for such restrictions.” However, the Health Department could require that abortions in the last six months of pregnancy be performed only in licensed hospitals, Mr. Conley said. If the regulation is adopted, abortion clinks would be precluded from performing all except early aborlions. In his written opinion, Mr. Conley informed Health Commissioner Joanne E. Finley of court decisions in other states, that had examined first‐trimester abortion regulations. “These. courts have uniformly struck down regulations which purport to single out first‐trimester abortion clinics for special treatment,” Mr. Conley said. A North Carolina court, he said, had ruled that the state could regulate first‐trimester abortions “only to the extent that it regulates tonsillectomies and other relatively minor operations.” Last summer, Commissioner Finley issued interim regulations requiring clinics to adhere to special restrictions that are not imposed on other health, care facilities. The legality of these restrictions, which inelude such things as a written affiliation with a nearby hospital, a two‐day waiting period before performing an abortion, postoperative patient observation and counseling of patients, has been unclear."
She never cried over spilt milk,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/20/archives/she-never-cried-over-spilt-milk-stranger-at-the-party.html,"By Helen Lawrenson. Illustrated. 244 pp. New York: Random House. $8.95. Helen Lawrenson apparently spent her entire life collecting enough experiences to write a memoir. It is, therefore, rather a shame that the memoir appears about 15 years too late. In 1960. “Stranger at the Party” would have been taken up as a perfect life model by every. college‐educated female in America, half of whom hoped to be writers and all of whom hoped to become—to the best of their ability—gay, madcap adventuresses. How we would have been inspired, back then, by the ad ventures of Helen Lawrenson, born in 1907 in upstate New York, college dropout, smalltown journalist, big‐time journalist, managing editor of Vanity Fair, colleague and adversary of Clare Boothe Luce, close friend (as they say) of Bernard Baruch and Condo Nast. (They also say “mistress” of Bernard Baruch and Condo Nast, but they are technically wrong, because, as Mrs. Lawrenson quite correctly points out “It's just as well I was proudly independent . . . besides, the rich only give to the rich.”) Beautiful, classy and smart, Helen Lawrenscn was part of the cafe life of the thirties. She wrote “Latins Are Lousy Lovers” when sex could still be written about as a romp instead of home improvement course, and thus enriched her reputation for being fascinating. Concurrent with the two husbands who scarcely earn a mention in this book, and the two lovers interesting enough to justify an extensive last word in a memoir, she had an affair—ahead of the fashion—with a Harlem pimp and thug who was a lot of fun when he wasn't actually in jail. And then (15 years ago we would have found this almost unbearably inspirational) she married and Lore two children to Jack Lawrenson, who was not only the man she truly loved but was also a hero of the Labor Movement and co‐founder of the National Maritime Union. After 19 per. feet years, Jack died, and Helen proceeded to the next desirable life‐stage (as we would have seen it then). She became tough old lady, still professional, still working, surrounded by doting younger men. Still the only girl in the club. Nowadays, half the educated female population in America still wish to be writers (the other half wish to be doctors), but the stern disciplines of the feminist revolution have made Helen Lawrenson's book something totally unintended by the author. It is a horrible example of another woman who settled for experience instead of accomplishment. Mrs. Lawrenson argues that she wanted nothing more. In the last chapter of her book, she casts a backward glance and poises herself for a philosophic wrap‐up. “I certainly Haven't contributed anything to the world, or made my mark, or lusted after fame and fortune.” But, she goes on, she has been happy and been grateful for life, she has not whined, and “in fact, the secret of happiness may be learning not to cry over spilt milk.” That particular maxim, as a watchword for life, is out of fashion among journalists. Respectable livings, including my own, are being earned these days by writers making the most of spilt milk. The only possible improvement this change represents is that we now consider it unfair, for example, to reveal our friends' sexual habits without discussing our own. Mrs. Lawrenson's stoic avoidance of any but the flattest possible references to her own feelings results in bloodless narrative, full of gratuitous and rather vulgar revelations, all recounted in a voice which is meant as offhand, wryly objective. But unfortunately it reads as though the author had dictated it from extensively cross ‐ referenced scrapbooks. Avoiding regret over spilt milk is all very well, but not when it serves as an excuse for avoiding reflection and examination of the life that is being remembered in a memoir. It is astonishing to me that any woman, however much she might dislike other women (as Mrs. Lawrenson clearly does), could write today, “When I had my first illegal abortion (irrepressibly fertile, I had three in one year alone). . .,” and never discuss, at any time, the implications, of any kind, of that remark. Besides, I don't believe that Mrs. Lawrenson had no ambitions. In the beginning of the book she addresses a word to the young, whom she gener ally approves of. “I only fear that they, too, may choose eventually the multiple practical rewards of compromise. Rewards not only in a material sense, but also because it is easier to settle for less than the best, to dodge the issues, to relax one's guard against the seductive appeal of glossy mediocrity.” As Mrs. Lawrenson makes abundantly clear in the rest of her book, it is especially easy for a glossy magazine writer. She has my full sympathy when she tells stories about the trendy thirties, which were disgustingly like the trendy seventies: The nightclub owner who wore live mice in his buttonhole, Mrs. Harrison Williams resetting her aquamarines in the shape of bombers during the war, the apartments with white velvet rugs, the editor who asked George Gros?? to do some drawings of the chic life in Moscow. It was depressing then as it is depressing now to inform an editor you have the inside authoritative story on the upcoming end of the world and have the editor send you out to do a quick article on “Fourteen things you will need for the end of the world.” Helen Lawrenscn's solution was to marry and devote herself to Jack Lawrenson, who not only pleased her personally, but also established her credibility and soothed her social conscience. Mrs. Lawrenson made the same mistakes in life she makes in her book. A page of social ills follows a page of glossy events which bump into a few experiences in Harlem. It is too much. She was a stranger at all the parties, and finally it begins to seem that gay and madcap are just nicer ways to say feckless and pointless."
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/20/archives/the-region-in-summary-a-former-judge-will-make-new-attica-inquiries.html,"It now seems certain that a serious hearing will be given to charges that possible police crimes against inmates during, the Attica State Prison uprising were covered up. Bernard S. Meyer, a former State Supreme Court justice, has been appointed to head the inquiry. As both judge and lawyer, Mr. Meyer has built a reputation for ability, integrity and independence. Mr. Meyer will have the power to examine secret grand Jury minutes and to subpoena witnesses and documents. He will be able to name whatever staff he feels he needs. Mr. Meyer is to report to Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz and Governor Carey within “30 working days.” The investigator was technically appointed by Mr. Lefkowitz, but he was said to have been selected by the Governor. A former chief assistant prosecutor of Attica cases, Malcolm H. Bell, has charged that the chief Attica prosecutor, Anthony G. Simonetti, is responsible for the cover‐up. Two inmates have been convicted of crimes arising from the 1971 revolt, and 60 other inmates have been indicted. No law‐enforcement officers have been indicted, although 39 persons died from their gunfire when the prison was retaken. Mr. Bell has charged that “substantial evidence” pointed to crimes by the officers. He.said that Mr. Simonetti repeatedly refused to allow witnesses to be called or questions to be asked that would get to the substance of the cases. Mr. Simonetti has denied the charges and said he would cooperate with Mr. Meyer's investigation. Mr. Meyer is a member of a leading Long Island law firm. He became Democratic County chairman in Nassau in June; 1957, and left in September, 1958, when he was elected to the State Supreme Court. He was succeeded as county chairman by John F. English, now one of seven partners in the law firm, Meyer, English and Cianciulli. U.D.C. Fallout Affects Other Projects in State The loss of confidence in the financial community resulting from the near‐bankruptcy of the Urban Development Corporation is having a negative effect on other public agencies responsible for critical projects and services throughout New York State. Some $1.6‐billion worth of planned construction for hospitals, nursing homes and other health projects has been stopped because of the impaired borrowing ability of the sponsoring agencies. The State Housing Finance Agency and the Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency sell the same sort of “moral‐obligation” bonds as the Urban Development Corporation. Because the bonds lack the state's full backing, Investors, frightened by the oncepowerful agency's tenuous situation, have become increasingly suspicious of the device, and the 16 other agencies that can use it. State Controller Arthur Levitt has proposed legislation that would phase out moral‐obligation borrowing. The Battery Park City Authority, which is building an enormous residential, business and commercial complex at the southern tip of Manhattan, said that its housing construction may be suspended because of the uncertainty of the moral‐obligation device. The State Job Development Authority has postponed plans for $5‐million worth of moral‐obligation borrowing for pollution‐control projects. There is evidence, too, of U.D.C. “fallout” even on those agencies that have the state's full legal support. The State Dormitory Authority, which is backed by the state's “full faith and credit” is having trouble selling its securities. New York City Controller Harrison 3. Goldin has said that the U.D.C. default, in February, has been “extremely harmful” to the city's ability to market its notes, which are legally guaranteed. Mr. Beame Has More Bad News, Economically More had news is ahead for New York City residents: Services are to be further reduced and taxes will go still higher. But the extent of the damage has yet to be officially made known. It was learned that Mayor Beame, trying to balance the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, had cut spending $100‐million more. He also planned to lay off 10,000 more city employes to save an additional $150‐ million. The Mayor had intended last week to explain exactly what he had done and why, but put it off until Tuesday. The new trims are hardly an answer. The deficit in the next budget is put at $883.9‐million, already cut from $1.68‐billion by as yet unspecified real estate and other tax increases and service cutbacks. The new savings would reduce the present figure by barely a third. If Albany and Washington fail to contribute the balance, and it is doubtful they will, then still more taxes and more layoffs may be necessary. The State Constitution stipulates that the city real estate tax must be raised to whatever level is necessary to prevent bankruptcy. The tax has been going up steadily, as have tax delinquencies, as the charts show. Next year's budget problems aside, the Mayor still has not resolved this year's deficit, put at $120‐million by Mr. Beame. County Shortages Mr. Beame is not alone in trying to balance a budget. Many county executives in the state are facing rising deficits and have also asked for additional state aid. Their problem specifically is a lack of money for welfare. Unemployment is increasing the welfare rolls, particularly the home‐relief category in which the state and counties share equally in the cost and the Federal Government has no responsibility. Home relief is a measure of the effects of the recession in some suburban counties. Those on such relief are able‐bodied unemployed who have run out of unemployment insurance and have exhausted all means of support. Welfare deficits are expected to reach $21‐million in Nassau and $9.9‐million in Westchester. Suffolk officials say major increases in welfare had been anticipate in its budget. In calling for more state aid, 14 County Executives asked that Albany: increase its revenue‐sharing aid from 18 per cent to 21 per cent; grant a one‐year moratorium on contributions to the state pension fund; increase its share of support for home relief from 50 to 75 per cent so that the counties can cut theirs to 25. The proposals are under study. Now There's A Timetable For Better Air The Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which approved a cleanair program for New York City two years ago that never got off the ground, has now issued a specific timetable that the city and state must follow. Both state and city environmental officials have expressed support for the program. The long delay at all three levels of government has been in part because of changeovers in city and state administrations and in part because of disagreements over specific points in the plan. Environmental groups remain skeptical of the strength of the state and city's commitment to cleaner air. They have said they will drop a pending lawsuit only if they are convinced that the Transportation Control Plan, as the program is formally known, will in fact be enacted. The plan is intended to reduce both the number of cars and the amount of irritants they spew into the air. Carbon monoxide, a prime pollutant from vehicles, impairs drivers' judgment and ability to respond, hurts vision and produces headaches. It and other unhealthful emissions aggravate respiratory and circulatory ailments. The city, in an effort to determine the extent of the carbon monoxide problem, is going to expand its monitoring stations from 16 to 61. The city has found that present data are insufficient to determine whether citywide levels of the gas are rising or falling. The Federal orders include regular emission inspections of taxis, autos and trucks; stricter traffic and parking controls; special bus lanes; mechanic training programs on emission‐control devices, and creation of a city‐state plan to reduce traffic and improve traffic flow. Further orders are expected soon on the most controversial and politically unpalatable measures: tolls on the Harlem and East River bridges, restricting taxi cruising, and limiting business‐district parking and truck delivery hours. Questions of commitment apart, no one knows where the estimated $100‐million to start the program and $60‐million a year to keep it going will come from. For a start, the State Legislature has approved $10‐millioni for the inspection system and state officials are hoping for Federal aid. Without Fair‐Trade Laws, Fairer Trade? New York and Connecticut's fairtrade laws have been repealed by the respective state Legislatures. When signed by Governor Carey and Governor Grasso, the repeals are exexpected to save consumers money on name‐brand merchandise. Fair‐trade laws allow manufacturers to fix a floor price on items, which retailers must abide by. The effect of the laws was demonstrated during recent Senate hearings, when it was shown that in Virginia, a fair‐trade state, a 19‐inch Sony color TV sold for $569.95; in North Carolina, which has no such law, the TV sold for $449.95. A Black & Decker 4¼‐inch circular saw sold for $19.95 in Virginia and $16.95 in the neighboring state. A criticism of repeal has been that large discount and chain stores can drastically undersell smaller stores and price them out of business. The experience in states that have removed the laws seems to go counter to that notion. Generally intense price competition, and sometimes all‐out “price wars,” follow repeal. The market then tends to stablilize at a level based on competition and consumer demand. Although repeal does put added pressure on the “mom‐and‐pop” stores, there is no evidence, according to the Federal Trade Commission, that smaller stores go bankrupt or suffer unduly. Thirty‐four states, excluding New York and Connecticut, have fair trade laws; eight states (Alabama, Hawaii, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming) and Puerto Rico have repealed them. Last week, the New Jersey Assembly voted for repeal of that state's fair‐trade law, as well. Something Nice About Con‐Ed Consolidated Edison Company, which is used to being damned for having the highest electric rates in the country, has recently gotten some praise. Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting company assigned by the New York Public Service Commission to study the utility's inner workings, has concluded that Con Edison is, “by and large, operated effectively” and that improved efficiency would not appreciably lower customers' bills. The Little study did cite ways Con Edison could save up to $50‐million a year. But it found that overall, “There is little within the direct control of management that would reduce rates to customers significantly or do much to limit the size and frequency of future rate increases.” Substantial savings could come, it noted, by cutting taxes and fuel costs, which now eat up more than half the revenue dollar; this would require governmental action. Abortion Vote In New Jersey The New Jersey Legislature has passed a bill banning state Medicaid payments for abortions, ignoring nine Federal District Court decisions in eight states that have found similar bilk unconstitutional. Approval of the measure reflects the influence of the Catholic Church, which opposes abortion, in New Jersey: About 55 per cent of the state's registered voters are Catholic. The bill passed in the Assembly by a vote of 46 to 18 last week and in the Senate by 22 to 14 last June. The legislators who voted for it were aware of the court decisions. So is Governor Byrne, who does not believe in abortion. He said he would sign the bill. A court decision that will affect the New Jersey bill directly is expected shortly. A Pennsylvania measure similar to the one in New Jersey is under review by the United States Appeals court in Philadelphia. Because New Jersey is in the court's jurisdiction, the decision will also be binding in that state."
Target of Bishop's Ire Explains Her Views on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/23/archives/target-of-bishops-ire-explains-her-views-on-abortion.html,"SAN DIEGO, April 22—To the Most Rev. Leo T. Maher, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, Janet Gleason is a heretic guilty of “shameless proabortion education” who has forfeited her ministerial role as a lay reader of the church and the right to receive its sacraments. But to elated members or the National Organization for Women and other women libertarians across the country, the mother of three teenagers has suddenly become a symbol and rallying point for challenging the Catholic Church's stand against abortion. Slightly dazed by her sudden prominence nationally in the women's rights movement and not altogether pleased by the anger toward the Catholic Church on the part of some of her NOW colleagues, Mrs. Gleason said: Position Stated “I don't want anyone to try to make me a martyr. I am not at war with my church, the church is at war with itself. Even though have been spiritually excommunicated for openly supporting what is the law of the land, I still consider myself deep down in my conscience to be a good Catholic and a good Christian. “I am not in favor of abortion, despite what the Bishop says, anymore than I am in favor of cancer, nor is NOW crusading for abortion,” she said. “We only demand a free choice and recognition of the fact that every woman is the master of her own body. It was Mrs. Gleason's association with NOW and her activist role in championing women's “freedom of choice,” at a time when she was serving as lector of the mass at All Hallows Church, that prompted the strongest direct action yet taken by any Catholic prelate in this country on the abortion issue. After ordering her dismissal as lector, Bishop Maher, directed priests in the 178 parishes he supervises to deny communion to all members of NOW and other similar groups unless they renounce any advocacy of abortion. Bishop Maher said he considered his pastoral letter as a “teaching document” to reinforce the faith rather than a punitive action. Groups of Catholics, both men and women, most of them wearing NOW buttons, were turned away from the communion rail last Sunday at churches of the $12,000 member diocese when they refused to repudiate NOW's “freedom of choice” stand on abortion. Mrs. Gleason, a graduate nurse who had arrived home only a few hours earlier from escorting 329 Vietnamese orphans on an airlift to Los Angeles, did not join other protesting members of NOW at the communion rail, nor does she intend to seek the sacrament. “I don't want to embarrass any parish priest,” she said. “Further, I don't think the communion service is the proper place to bring about a change in the church's cruel and archaic position on this subject.” Diocesan officials acknowledge that Mrs. Gleason's activities, both as an officer of NOW and national president of the New York‐based Catholics for a Free Choice, were a factor in Bishop Maher's decision to deny communion to “pro‐abortion agitators.” Mrs. Gleason complained about Bishop Maher's reference to her, and other members of NOW, as “pro‐abortionists.” “I believe, as do large numbers of other Catholic women, that abortion, unfortunately, is sometimes necessary, but it should only be a last resort and then the decision must be that of the individual woman,” she said. Calls Stand Hypocritical Mrs. Gleason said that, in her view, the church has placed itself in a hypocritical position by denying communion to “free choice” advocates while allowing the sacrament to be given to millions of Catholic women who secretly use the pill or other contraceptive devices. Bishop Maher said contraception, while an offense against the Catholic faith, was less grave than abortion because it does not violate the sanctity of life. Mrs. Gleason was baptized and confirmed as a Catholic and married in the church to Dr. Matthew Gleason, a surgeon who is not completely in agreement with his wife's views on abortion. They have two daughters, 13 and 16, and a 19‐year‐old son, all members of All Hallows Church. Last week, the day following the start of the denial of communion to supporters of NOW, 13‐year‐old Sharon Gleason was confirmed as a communicant of All Hallows. Mrs. Gleason did not attend. She said that prior to her dismissal as lector, she obtained a meeting with Bishop Maher “but it was utterly. futile.” “I simply could not get through to him and make him understand I was not agitating for abortion,” she said."
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/25/archives/new-jersey-briefs-doctors-fight-medicaid-abortion-ban-state-regains.html,"A physicians' group said yesterday that it would join the fight against a bill that would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortions. The bill has passed both houses of the Legislature, and Governor Byrne has said would sign it. The physicians' organization, the Obstetrical and Gynecological Group of Perth Amboy‐Edison, noted that similar legislation had been declared unconstitutional by courts in eight states. “The Legislature and the Governor are playing roulette with the lives of the low socio‐economic groups with the cheap objective of frank pandering of votes on a religious and personally biased platform,” said Dr. Samuel Breslow, a spokesman for the group. “It is political hypocrisy and duplicity of the highest degree.” State Regains Bartered Youth Juan Guzman, a youth who was brought to Delaware last fall by a farmer who traded three chickens to get him, has been returned to a New Jersey children's home because of “unsuccessful adjustment” to foster homes, youth authorities said. The 15‐year‐old boy was placed in a Kent County foster home last November after a highly publicized family court hearing at which Delaware authorities were granted custody of the youth. He subsequently was placed in two foster homes, but Mrs. Ruth Vehslage, Kent County administrator for the division of Social Services, said there were problems at each home. She would not elaborate. The Guzman youth was brought to Delaware by David Wilkinson, a Felton farmer, who told the police last fall that the youth had approached him on a street in Newark and had asked him for a home. In order to take him, Mr. Wilkenson said, he gave three chickens to a woman who had been letting the youth live with her family. Ashland Resuming Operations Officials of the Ashland Chemical Company in Independence Township said yesterday that they expected to resume operations today in some parts of the plant that had been closed because of air‐pollution problems. Other areas, they say, will remain inoperative until pollutionabatement equipment is installed according to a consent order agreed to yesterday by Ashland and the state's Depariment of Environmental Protection. According to the order most improvements will he made by July 31."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/27/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"The Name's the Same, but To THE EDITOR: As a legal secretary, I was very interested in the article, “Towns Act to End Mixup Over Names,” in last Sunday's New Jersey section of The Times. We in our office know what confusion there can be, not only in New Shrewsbury and Dover Township, but in all of New Jersey. Just a few examples will suffice to prove my point: There is a Blackwood in Camden County, a Blackwood in Gloucester County, a Bloomsbury in Hunterdon County, a Bloomsbury in Warren County, a Brookville in Hunterdon County, a Brookville in Ocean County, a Broadway in Camden County, a Broadway in Warren County and five (count them) Cedar Groves: one in Essex County, one in Mercer County, one in Gloucester County and two in Ocean County. And this is only the beginning, just some of the towns starting with the letters B and C. Naturally, if the zip code is known, there is no problem. But what is one to do when, in many, many cases, it is not known? RIVA L. CORIN, Millburn. • School Rernedy To THE EDITOR: The political frustration of the New Jersey Legislature, after several unsuccessful attempts to comply with a court directive to equalize school budgets throughout the state, reflects the very real impracticality of so doing. I propose to show why, and suggest a remedy. The present system of school taxation, basically ad valorem, is unequal. The rich pay more school taxes than the poor, and their children are therefore educated in better schools. To take the aggregate of these taxes and redistribute them among all school districts equally would, to be sure, be both democratic and, as the court noted, in accordance with the State Constitution. The result would be one of the following: ¶Bring all school districts up to the best level of the present unequal system. This would quadruple the over‐all cost of the system. ¶Lower the level of the whole to the present average. This would bring all public schools down near the lower end of the scale. ¶Some compromise, which would combine these disadvantages. The political difficulty, which mirrors the real difficulty, is that the parents of schoolchildren also are voters. As taxpayers, they naturally feel that they are paying for the education of their children. They will resist any equalitarian plan, even one they might otherwise advocate, if it will involve sacrificing their own children. These concerns of parents for their children are too legitimate to be brushed aside by the assertion of a constitutional principle, however just. The proposed remedy is to keep the present school tax of about 2 per cent ad valorem and, in addition, impose a surtax on those dwellings whose assessed value exceeds the median for the state—say in excess of $15,000. The surtax would be levied on the excess, not on the whole value, and would carry a similar rate. Then (1) redistribute the basic school tax equally throughout the state on a per pupil basis and (2) allocate the surtax solely to the school district in which it is collected. This is the whole plan. The goal of complete equality in school funds will thus be gated at a stroke, as far as present revenues are concerned. The other desideratum — better schools for people who can afford them —is also realized, but wholly at the cost of those same people. The plan would require a constitutional amendment, but I believe that it would enjoy public support. Few people would object. Most would benefit. Only the rich would pay more for schools, and they want to. I believe that the dual goals —a uniformly higher level of public education, and better public schools for those able to pay for them—would appeal to the electorate and that the amendment would pass. Apprepriate laws would follow. HERBERT HARVEY, Morrisville, Pa. • Child Abuse To THE EDITOR: An article on Feb. 9 reported that $1.9‐million would be spent on child‐abuse programs in New Jersey. How much money will be allocated to determine the whys of child abuse? A study of beaten and bat tered children by Dr. Edward Lenoski, Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Southern California, showed that 90 per cent of these children resulted from wanted and planned pregnancies. About three years ago. The New York Times quoted a Planned Parenthood official who expressed alarm at similar findings. The reason given was that the planned child did not respond adequately to the parents sacrifices for him. The planned child was expected to give more in return for his existence than the unplanned child, who was not held accountable for his conception; when he could not, he was more likely to be punished severely. If the correlation is true, parents of “planned children” should be made aware of the potential psychological hazards. CAROL J. CHRISTIE, Westfield. • Purpose of Medicaid To THE EDITOR: I always thought that the New Jersey Legislature had reached the nadir of its existence by its consistent refusal to face the state's fiscal needs, but with the Assembly's vote to bar Medicaid, funds for abortions, our legislators have shown that they are just as blind to human needs. This vote flies in the face of the United States Constitution and is blatantly discriminatory against the poor. A vote to outlaw abortion for all would at least have the virtue of consistency. The purpose of Medicaid is to provide health care to the poor, not to be an instrument for imposing upon the poor and powerless the moral Judgments of the legislators. That Governor Byrne has announced his support for this legislation is a sad comment on his commitment to social justice, and raises questions about his respect for the rule of law. LINDA FISH, Tenafly"
Brooklyn Democrat Focuses on Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/27/archives/brooklyn-democrat-focuses-on-justice.html,"ALBANY—There are, according to Stanley Fink, three kinds of people in the Legislature — “Those who watch things happen, those who make things happen, and those who don't know anything's happening.” When the Democrats took control this year, Mr. Fink moved from the first category to the second and, as the work of the Codes Committee, which he heads, begins now to make its way to the floor; it becomes clear that in a number of areas—criminal justice, corrections, women's rights—Mr. Fink has distinctive ideas about what should happen and a better than fair chance of making it happen. Sharing the wall decorations in his Legislative Office Building suite, along with a cartoon of Meade H. Esposito, Brooklyn Democratic leader, a Simon & Garfunkel concert poster and pen‐andink sketches of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., are two smudgy sheets from yellow legal pads with lists scrawled on them. The lists detail the things that Mr. Fink hopes to get action on. One day last week he spun his chair to face the wall and ticked some of them off: Some measures to clear the clutter in the courts so that plea‐bargaining in cases of serious crimes can be curbed; Some measures to increase prisoners rights; a “workable” guncontrol bill; “some victimlesscrimes bills;” measures that would revamp “as best we can” the so‐called Rockefeller drug laws; women's rights. Brash, boomy‐voiced and always in a hurry, Mr. Fink rattles through his list. Cautious, well‐prepared and, at age 39, a seasoned member of the Brooklyn regular Democratic Establishment, he points out practically that everything must be negotiated with the Republicans, who control the Senate and that, in any case, his is a two‐year timetable. An Unexpected Coup He scored something of an unexpected coup last week when his bill to abolish the doctrine of “contributory negligence” passed both legislative houses and was sent to the Governor. Instead of mandating that any fault on the part of someone suing another for negligence wiped out his right to collect, the new rule would be “comparative negligence,” in which the proportion of a person's fault would be considered in deciding “what he could for. And this next week, his measure that would bar the use in a trial of a rape victim's sexual history with anyone other than the accused rapist is expected to clear the Assembly. Mr. Fink moves these things along on a bill‐by‐bill basis, but, he says, it is all part of a grand design to help restore a criminal justice apparatus that he finds to be “held in disrepute by both ends of the political spectrum.” Short of a massive infusion of money, which, he suggested, was most unlikely, the overload of the sytem, he said, “mandates some selectivity.” And so, he said, the Rockefeller drug laws, which limit plea‐bargaining in comparatively minor cases, should be changed. So‐called “victimless” crimes — gambling, consentual sodomy, adultery —should be taken out of the courts, Mr. Fink said, adding that this would result in much less pressure to pleabargain in serious cages such as murder, rape, arson. An ‘Urban Populist’ It all sounded, a visitor ventured, like the program of a real political liberal. Mr. Fink, who represents the one‐ and two‐family homeowners of Canarsie, grinned and avoided that semantic trap. “I am,” he said,. “an urban populist.” He had been so busy getting through New Utrecht High School, Brooklyn College, New York University Law School and the Air Force and then earning a living for his family, he said, that “I never really had time to sit down and determine what my philosophy is.” Determining his career was a bit easier.. He helped elect Leonard Yoswein (now City Hall's lobbyist in Albany) to the Assembly, spent a couple of years here as Chief Counsel to Mr. Yoswein's committee then, when Mr. Yoswein became a judge, was chosen from a number of candidates in Mr. Esposito's clubhouse to be the new Assemblyman. To stay in the job, which he likes. I'm rather ubiquitous around my district,” he said. He also maintains friendly ties with Mr. Esposito. Last year, while the Brooklyn leader's candidates were losing in unexpected numbers on election night, it was Mr. Fink's unhappy task to tally the votes and deliver the bad news to the leader. Communications in the other direction have been, he insisted, restrained. “I've been up here seven years and he talked to me about two bills. He was in favor of repealing the archaic abortion laws, and so was I. And he was in favor of a reapportionment plan in 1972 and I voted against it.”"
National Board Would End Ban on Live Fetal Study,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/28/archives/national-board-would-end-ban-on-live-fetal-study.html,"WASHINGTON, April 27—A national commission has called for the immediate repeal of moratorium on federally funded research involving the living human fetus. The recommendation by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behaviorial Research, passed late yesterday by an 8‐to‐1 vote, would allow the research to proceed under current regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The commission also said that nine other recommendations it approved earlier in the day should become effective as soon as the Secretary of H.E.W. could promulgate new regulations based on them. The other recommendations specified the circumstances under which fetal research was to be viewed as permissible. They were, in many respects, strict and emphasized ethical considerations and efforts to reduce to a minimum any risks or indignities to the subjects of the research. The moratorium on fetal research was ordered last year by Congress, bringing to a halt virtually all such research in the United States. Many scientists have asserted that the research is proper and vital to improvements in natural and child health. Many opponents of abortion have objected strenuously to such research, charging that it violates the rights of unborn human beings. The ban, written into law by Congress last year, expressed that opposition. The original sponsors of the ban, in both houses, had sought permanent prohibitions. The compromise measure finally adopted called for a moratorium until a national commission, set up by the same law, delivered recommendations on the controversial issue. In setting up the commission, Congress ordered it to report to the Secretary of H.E.W. in four months on the circumstances, if any, under which fetal research should be permitted in programs sponsored or supported by the department. The deadline was next Wednesday. The commissioners decided at the end of their meeting yesterday that their full report could not be ready in time. Therefore, the recommendations, as well as other portions of the report, will not be sent to the Secretary immediately. Letters explaining the circumstances are to be sent to Caspar W. Weinberger, the Secretary, and to Congress. The Secretary is required by law to use the report he will receive to draft new regulations or to explain to Congress why he decided not to do so. The current moratorium and the commission's recommendations apply directly only to research conducted or supported by the health department. The effects are almost universal among American scientists, however, because so much of medical research receives support from the department and its policies are extremely influential. In the commission's other recommendations, two types of research were identified as being not only permissible, but also worthy of encouragement by the department. These were therapeutic research directed toward the fetus or toward the pregnant woman. Therapeutic research Is intended to be beneficial, sometimes lifesaving, to the subject of a study or experiment. In contrast, research is commonly called nontherapeutic when there appears to be no prospect that it will help the individual under study although the research objective may be to find ways to help cure others. Thus, for example, studies of normal lung function in a premature baby might have nothing to offer that baby, but might produce life saving information for another premature baby whose lungs were not functioning normally. The commission's recommendations stressed efforts to ensure, so far as possible, that research would do no harm and it would be done only with the informed consent of the woman whose pregnancy was involved. In addition, several categories of research directed toward the fetus were viewed as permissible only with the mother's consent and the absence of objection by the father. In addition to therapeutic research involving fetus on pregnant woman, the commission recommended approval, in certain circumstances, of the following types of nontherapeutic research: ¶That directed toward the pregnant woman. ¶That directed toward the fetus in the womb. ¶That directed toward the possibly viable infant. ¶That directed toward the fetus in cases in which the woman planned to have an abortion. ¶That directed toward the fetus during the abortion and nontherapeutic research directed toward the fetus already removed from the womb when it is believed that the fetus has no chance of survival. The categories involving research on the fetus outside the womb or the fetus scheduled for abortion have been the most controversial. The crucial issue was whether it was ever permissible to do research involving a fetus scheduled for abortion when that research might involve substantial risk of harm to the fetus. The commission members decided that research proposals of this sort would have to be approved in advance by a national ethical review body, yet to be formed, before they could he conducted or supported by the health department. The law requires the commission to conduct all its deliberations, including the writing of its final report and recommendations, in meetings open to the public. For that reason, the 10 recommendations approved this weekend could not be held confidential until they were submitted to the Government.

Women Rally Today for Rights Action,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/28/archives/women-rally-today-for-rights-action.html,"TRENTON, April 27—Women of many political persuasions are expected to converge on the State House here tomorrow to lobby for women's rights legislation and to encourage more women to seek high political office. The rally, called Majority Day, was organized by a coalition of women's groups to demonstrate women's political power. “Women represent 42 per cent of the state's work force and 53 per cent of the voting power,” said Eileen P. Thornton, an organizer of the rally and president of the Women's Equity Action League, a women's rights organization interested primarily in educational and employment issues. “Majority Day is a time for women to meet New Jersey legislators to personally urge approval of women's rights legislation,” she said. Governor Byrne has agreed to meet with representatives of the group at noon, at which time he will be given a “report card” on women's issues. The Governor will reportedly receive high marks for appointing three women to his cabinet and for signing the equal‐credit bill, but low marks for his handling of the Division on Women. Division Called Ineffective “Women's groups are very concerned about the ineffectiveness of the Women's Division and its failure even to rank the priorities for action by women in the state,” Miss Thornton said. Earlier this year Governor Byrne angered many women by appointing Community Affairs Commissioner Patricia Sheehan to the additional post of director of the newly created Division on Women. The women, arguing that the job required a full‐time director, took Mr. Byrne's action as an indication that the division would not become an effective leader women's rights. However, despite the threat of a suit by the National Organization on Women, the Governor has remained firm in his commitment to keep Mrs. Sheehan in the job. Majority Day activities will also feature women in high offices of state government: Judge Sonia Morgan of Essex County; the Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies, Ann Klein; Commissioner Sheehan, and the Health Commissioner, Dr. Joanne Finley. In addition the nine women legislators will take an active part. “More women in high, state government positions is definitely a top priority of the women's movement,” Miss Thornton said. A record number of women have filed for Assembly seats throughout the state, including one for the first time in Hudson County. She is running on the regular Democratic line, which virtually insures victory there. Also included in the Majority Day schedule is a short memorial tribute to Mayor Jean Walling of East Brunswick, who died last week. While the women's groups have agreed to lobby for many bills now before the Legislature, they are reportedly somewhat divided on full support of the equal rights amendment to the New Jersey Constitution, which has passed the Assembly and will go before the Senate for a vote next month. Abortion legislation, however, will be opposed, although the decision to oppose it was reportedly not reached unanimously."
National Board Would End Ban on Live Fetal Study,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/28/archives/national-board-would-end-ban-on-live-fetal-study-board-would-end.html,"WASHINGTON, April 27—A national commission has called for the immediate repeal of a moratorium on federally funded research involving the living human fetus. The recommendation by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behaviorial Research, passed late yesterday by an 8‐to‐1 vote, would allow the research to proceed under current regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The commission also said that nine other recommendations it approved earlier in the day should become effective as soon as the Secretary of H.E.W. could promulgate new regulations based on them. The other recommendations specified the circumstances under which fetal research was to be viewed as permissible. They were, in many respects, strict and emphasized ethical considerations and efforts to reduce to a minimum any risks or indignities to the subjects of the research. The moratorium on fetal research was ordered last year by Congress, bringing to a halt virtually all such research in the United States. Many scientists have asserted that the research is proper and vital to improvements in natural and child health. Many opponents of abortion have objected strenuously to such research, charging that it violates the rights of unborn human beings. The ban, written into law by Congress last year, expressed that opposition. The original sponsors of the ban, in both houses, had sought permanent prohibitions. The compromise measure finally adopted called for a moratorium until a national commission, set up by the same law, delivered recommendations on the controversial issue. In setting up the commission, Congress ordered it to report to the Secretary of H.E.W. in four months on the circumstances, if any, under which fetal research should be permitted in programs sponsored or supported by the department. The deadline was next Wednesday. The commissioners decided at the end of their meeting yesterday that their full report could not be ready in time. Therefore, the recommendations, as well as other portions of the report, will not be sent to the Secretary immediately. Letters explaining the circumstances are to be sent to Caspar W. Weinberger, the Secretary, and to Congress. The Secretary is required by law to use the report he will receive to draft new regulations or to explain to Congress why he decided not to do so. The current moratorium and the commission's recommendations apply directly only to research conducted or supported by the health department. The effects are almost universal among American scientists, however, because so much of medical research receives support from the department and its policies are extremely influential. In the commission's other recommendations, two types of research were identified as being not only permissible, but also worthy of encouragement by the department. These were therapeutic research directed toward the fetus or toward the pregnant woman. Therapeutic research Is intended to be beneficial, sometimes lifesaving, to the subject of a study or experiment. In contrast, research is commonly called nontherapeutic when there appears to be no prospect that it will help the individual under study although the research objective may be to find ways to help cure others. Thus, for example, studies of normal lung function in a premature baby might have nothing to offer that baby, but might produce life saving information for another premature baby whose lungs were not functioning normally. The commission's recommendations stressed efforts to ensure, so far as possible, that research would do no harm and it would be done only with the informed consent of the woman whose pregnancy was involved. In addition, several categories of research directed toward the fetus were viewed as permissible only with the mother's consent and the absence of objection by the father. In addition to therapeutic research involving fetus on pregnant woman, the commission recommended approval, in certain circumstances, of the following types of nontherapeutic research: ¶That directed toward the pregnant woman. ¶That directed toward the fetus in the womb. ¶That directed toward the possibly viable infant. ¶That directed toward the fetus in cases in which the woman planned to have an abortion. ¶That directed toward the fetus during the abortion and nontherapeutic research directed toward the fetus already removed from the womb when it is believed that the fetus has no chance of survival.

FEMINISTS RATE STATE'S LEADERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/29/archives/feminists-rate-states-leaders-hold-trenton-rally-and-list-votes-on.html,"TRENTON, April 28 (UPI)—About 200 women from various feminist groups celebrated Majority Day here today with rally and later presented legislators with “report cards” on how they had voted on issues affecting women. Assemblywoman Betty Wilson, Democrat of Scotch Plains, one of the two majority whips, told the cheering crowd on the State House steps, “We've got it all together.” “The male‐dominated structure has given us unemployment, inflation and corruption in government,” Mrs. Wilson said, the crowd breaking into cheers. Her report card gave her grade of 100 per cent in voting on feminist bills. Mrs. Wilson later was named acting Speaker for today's Assembly session. She said the event was called Majority Day because women represented 53 per cent of New Jersey's population. Connie Gilbert Neiss of South Orange, moderator of the event and head of the Essex County chapter of the National Organization of Women,'said later that, of the nine women in the Legislature, six had failed to get 100 per cent on their report cards. Governor Byrne's report card said that the state's chief executive “showed great promise but does not pay attention; has difficulty following through.” Mrs. Neiss said women were particularly upset with Governor Byrne's personal feelings against abortion. Other women in the Assembly who received ratings of 100 per cent were Gertrude Berman. Democrat of Long Branch, and Rosetharie Totaro, Democrat of Denville. Jane Burgio, Republican of North Caldwell, received a rating of 82 per cent; Barbara A. Curran, Republican of Summit, was rated at 55, and Mary Keating Croce, Democrat of Princeton was rated at 82 per cent. No male members of the Senate received a perfect rating, but in the Assembly Byron M. Baer, Democrat of Englewood, Albert Burstein, Democrat of Tenafly, and Eldridge Hawkins, Democrat of East Orange, all were rated 100 per cent."
PHYSICIAN APPEALS IN DEATH OF FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/29/archives/physician-appeals-in-death-of-fetus.html,"BOSTON, April 28 (AP)—Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin is asking judge to declare him not guilty of manslaughter, despite his conviction last February in the death of an aborted fetus. Dr. Edelin's lawyers riled a memorandum today asking Judge James P. McGuire of Suffolk County Superior Court to overturn the jury's guilty verdict because it went against the weight of the evidence. The judge has scheduled al hearing for Wednesday on the motion, brought under a littleused state law that allows a, judge to declare a jury's verdict incorrect. If the motion fails, Dr. Edelin's appeal will proceed before the state Supreme Court. Dr. Edelin, a Boston. City Hospital obstetrician, was convicted Feb. 15 after a six‐week trial stemming from a legal abortion he performed at the hospital in 1973 en a 20 to 24‐week‐old fetus. Judge McGuire sentenced the obstetrician to one year's probation, and delayed the sentence pending appeal. Dr. Edelin continues to work as director of ambulatory services in the hospital's obstetrical ward."
SENATE UNIT TOLD OF SALE OF BABIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/30/archives/senate-unit-told-of-sale-of-babies-lawyer-urges-competition-to-curb.html,"WASHINGTON, April 29 (UPI)—A California lawyer said today that black market baby trade had, grown rapidly in states that do not allow “healthy competition” between independent placements and private adoption agencies. David Leavitt of Beverly Hills, who has privately arranged 800 adoptions in the last 16 years, said it a was important that racketeers and baby sellers be “put out of business.” But he told the Senate subcommittee on children and youth, which is investigating black market baby sales, that legislation giving adoption agencies a “monopoly” in child placement was not the answer. “The baby buyers are all in states that do not permit a healthy competition between agencies and the independent system,” Mr. Leavitt said. “It's not an accident that you don't have baby buyers from Oregon, Arizona and Virginia.” Mr. Leavitt said that if properly handled, independent child placement could adequately serve the needs of the pregnant woman, her child and prospective adoptive parents. Competition between independent placements and private agencies actually encourages adoptions, he said. Another lawyer who has handled independent adoptions, State Representative Brice. Oakley of Iowa, said there was no question that a black market baby sales network existed. The operation, he said, is run by “a very small number of attorneys who have been very active and very unethical.” Mistrial in Coast Case LOS ANGELES, April 29 (UPI)—A mistrial was declared yesterday in the international black market baby‐selling case against a former county crime commissioner, Ronald Silverton, because the jury deadlocked on 10 of the 14 charges against him. Superior Court Judge Thomas T. Johnson dismissed the jury and ordered a retrial to begin June 17 after the jury foreman announced that it was unlikely that the panel of six men and six women could reach unanimous agreement. The foreman told the judge that the jury leaned toward conviction of Mr. Silverton on all 10 counts, with the vote ranging from 11 to 1 to 7 to 5. The 42‐year‐old suspended lawyer, was accused of selling babies through a scheme “which would net him $3.3‐million over a two‐year period,” according to trial testimony. Mr. Silverton said he had offered unwed mothers an “alternative to abortion” and an opportunity to choose the adoptive parents of their babies, He said his “save‐a‐life adoption service” was “proper, legal and moral. Mr. Silverton's service allegedly provided pregnant women from Yugoslavia and other European nations a holiday on a Caribbean island where they would do token housework, be given free medical services and cash payments up to $3,000 in exchange for their cooperation in the baby exchange. The jury reached verdicts on four misdemeanor counts last week. Mr. Silverton was found guilty of advertising without a license and operating “home‐finding” agency without a license. He was acquitted on two counts of paying a parent money to obtain consent for adoption. Mr. Silverton was ordered back to court June 2 for sentencing on the two convictions."
CURB ON ABORTIONS FOR MINORS IS UPSET,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/01/archives/curb-on-abortions-for-minors-is-upset.html,"BOSTON, April 30 (AP)—A Massachusetts law that prohibits minors from getting abortions without parental consent has been overturned as unconstitutional by a three‐judge Federal panel. The 2‐to‐1 decision handed down here yesterday says that rights of minors under 18 to have abortions outweigh any rights of their parents. United States District Court Judge Anthony Julian dissented from the decision written by Circuit Judge Bailey Aldrich and joined in by District Judge Frank H. Freedman. In their decision the judges said, “We can attach no such factual magic to that birthday 18. It is enough for present purposes that a substantial number of females under the age of 18 are capable of forming valid consent.” “It is difficult to think of any self interest that a parent would have that compared with those significant interests of the pregnant minor,” the majority said. The suit was brought by William Baird and the Parents Aid Society on behalf of a pregnant 16‐year‐old."
A Clinic for Pregnant Teen‐Agers,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/a-clinic-for-pregnant-teenagers.html,"Pregnant teen‐agers in Far Rockaway are receiving prenatal counseling and care at a clinic that has been designed to deal with their special needs and problems. The clinic, begun last week at the South Shore Division of Long Island Jewish‐Hillside Medical Center, treats young women 13 to 19 years old. Most are unwed, accompanied by their mothers, and well beyond the period recommended for abortions, according to Dr. Sylvia Meyer, director of community medicine at the South Shore Division. “Special Cases” There are several such programs in the city and on Long Island, according to Dr. Jean Palcter, director of maternity services of the City Department of Health, but the Far Rockaway program is one of the first to create a separate unit allowing the young women to deal with the same staff. “The need for such programs has become apparent with the recognition of the special cases these pregnant teen‐agers present,” said Dr. Pakter. “Through the efforts of community groups and hospitals in educating the public, we've been able to make things more comfortable for these girls who used to be expelled from school and forced sometimes into giving birth secretly or illegal abortions.” Many of the Far Rockaway patients are poor and Roman Catholic, according to staff members, and the women do not want abortions on religious grounds. “There isn't as much of a stigma in poorer classes against an unwed mother,” said Pamela George, a medical social worker. “The baby is accepted as part of the family, which is usually large, and is cared for by the grandmother while the mother goes back to school.” By participating in pre‐natal programs meant for adults, which are now offered by many hospitals and clinics, the pregnant teenager's special problems may be complicated, Dr. Meyers said. “Most people are more at ease with their own age group, and this is particularly true of adolescents in general who often have a hard time relating to adults and doing things when they are present,” said Dr. Meyer, who was recently named interim chairman of community medicine for all Long Island Jewish Divisions. Alienation a Problem “A pregnant adolescent would feel very uncomfortable sitting in a training class with older women who are married,” she said, adding that the pregnant adolescent may, rightly or wrongly, feel alienated, resented or stigmatized. Miss George, the medical social worker who helps the young women deal with the psychological and social aspects of their pregnancy, said that the pressures of normal adolescence are considerable. Pregnancy compounds these pressures greatly, she said, particularly if the pregnancy is unwanted, the girl is unmarried and the identity of the father is uncertain. Miss George said that the girls learn more quickly and discuss their problems more readily when they are mixed with others their own age.” “Many of these girls can handle the situation very well,” said Miss George, “Many are together people, well‐aware of their mistake, but they are going to have their baby. Sometimes all these girls need is reassurance, confidence and a place to talk freely about the dayto‐day problems of being both pregnant and an adolescent as well. In some cases the girls got themselves into this situation because they thought they could find love and security through the sex act. Here, we're trying to get them to understand what the meaning of responsibility is and to learn to care for themselves and their child—physically and mentally,” added Miss George. “We sometimes have to deal with the girl's mother, who is often more upset.” Some of the special physical problems of the pregnant teen‐agers include poor nutrition, anemia, and a lack ot knowledge about the‐process of birth and postnatal care Dr. Meyer said."
FOOD STAMPS HIT 19.1‐MILLION MARK,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/food-stamps-hit-191million-mark.html,"WASHINGTON, May 3 (UFO) —Enrollment in the Federal food stamp program rose to another record of 19.1 million persons in March, Agriculture Department figures showed this week. A monthly report on the program which is expected to cost at $4‐billion in the current fiscal year and as much as 66‐billion next year, said total enrollment in Federal family food programs in March reached 19.2 million persons, up 24 per cent from a year earlier. The total included 19.1 million receiving food stamps and 100,000 persons receiving direct commodity donations under a second program that operates in only a few parts of the country. The March figure shows a total gain of 500,000 participants over the 18.7 million level in February with all of the increase coming in the food stamp program. Department records show that the March increase was the smallest in months. Food program participation, spurred partly by rising unemployment had risen by 1.1 million persons in December. 700,000 in January and 600,000 in February. Food stamp experts said that it was too early to tell whether the figures represented any slowdown trend. They noted that the big December jump had been due partly to a shift that month from commodity donations to food stamps in Puerto Rico. Bishop Criticizes Kennedy FALL RIVER. Mass. May (AP)—The Most Rcv. Daniel A. Cronin, Bishop of the Fall River Roman Catholic Diocase, sent a letter today to Senator Edward M.

Unemployment Just Keeps On Climbing,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/the-region-in-summary-unemployment-just-keeps-on-climbing-scene.html,"The Region In Summary Unemployment over the last year in the metropolitan area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has been consistently higher than the national rate, and it continues to rise. In March, the New York and Connecticut unadjusted figures were 10.2 and 9.9 respectively, an increase of about a half per cent over February. New Jersey's February jobless figure, the most recent available, was 11.7 per cent, an increase of 1 per cent. The unadjusted national rate for February and March was 9.1 per cent. New York City's rate rose 1.1 per cent, to 11.5 per cent, the highest in nearly 30 years. The city's 372,600 jobless persons account for nearly half the state's total unemployed. Nearly all other parts of New York State showed increases as well. In six major upstate labor areas, the rate was below the New York City figure. Only the Buffalo area, at 14.7 per cent, was higher. Downstate suburban areas were below both the New York City and national rates. Putnam County's declined a half per cent to 6.6 per cent; Westchester's remained stable at 7 per cent; but there were increases in Rockland (6.3 to 6.4), Nassau (6 to 6.6) and Suffolk (7.5 to 8.2). Such figures translate into long lines at unemployment centers and welfare offices, particularly in already impoverished ghetto areas. Is there a chance the figures will drop over the next few months? State Labor Department economist think not: They will probably go up, with the national rate. Along with its residents, New York City continues to suffer the recession. Last week, Mayor Beame did the predictable: He asked Governor Carey and the Legislature for an array of tax increases and other measures to help him make up a projected $641‐million deficit for 1975‐76. More than Mr. Carey and fellow Democrats, it is Republican Warren Anderson, the powerful Senate Majority Leader, Mr. Beame must convince. Senate Republicans have balked at the idea of new taxes. But even if the Mayor's requests were granted in full, his deficit might only be ??. Which means the main scene in this fiscal play is still to come: By May 15, Mr. Beame, a putative magician with numbers, must submit a balanced budget for 1975‐76 No one knows how he will do that. Some Attica Questions Are Answered Some of the charges of misconduct ascribed to the office of the special Attica prosecutor were blunted by two developments last week: Chief prosecutor Anthony G. Simonetti appeared before State ‘Supreme Court Justice Joseph Mattina to answer questions on whether the F.B.I. had supplied his office with improperly obtained information on defense tactics in the murder trial of Bernard Stroble, a former Attica inmate. Mr. Simonetti denied receiving any such information. He admitted investigating charges that prison guards had taped conversations of Attica inmates in 1971, but said these conversations proved irrelevant to his investigation. Justice Mattina has for days been examining official documents, including F.B.I. files on the Attica incident, in a search for evidence that strategic defense information in the Strohle trial had been leaked to the prosecutors. He said that he had found nothing relevant to this particular trial, but that possibly—he emphasized the word possibly—some of the material might be relevant to other Attica cases. K. William O'Connor, the Justice Department official who directed the Federal inquiry into the Attica incident, said in an interview that efforts to investigate alleged incidents of abuse of inmates had been hampered by the refusal of the inmates to cooperate. Many of the inmates, he said, were fearful of opening themselves to criminal charges. The inmates’ reluctancy to cooperate may in part explain why Mr. Simonetti's office has been unable to bring in any indictments against prison guards or officials. Abram Doesn't Wait—He Wants Law Changed Morris B. Abram, the Moreland Act commissioner investigating nursing‐home abuses, has proposed ways to strengthen the laws governing the institutions’ operations. But his proposals, like the rules that exist, will mean little if there is no firm will to enforce them. A primary problem that has thwarted enforcement is the financial and political power of the industry. Investigations have linked state officials, politicians, legislators and judges with prominent nursing‐home operators. Another problem has been the long bureaucratic and legal tie‐ups that have prevailed. There is no guarantee new laws would correct them. Mr. Abram's proposed legislation would extend the health commissioner's power to temporarily limit or suspend an operator's license without a hearing to ninety days when there was an immediate threat to the patients’ health or safety. The department could bar admission of new patients, transfer some or all of the patients, and limit or cut off Medicaid payments. The order could be renewed if further dangerous abuses were found. Another key feature of the suggested legislation would allow patients to file class‐action suits against a negligent operator and would entitle them to payments from operators for damages. Campaign Law Can Work The skepticism with which both reformers and regulars greeted New York State's campaign finance law has been matched by the irritation of 60 per cent of the 600 candidates for the Legislature and of a few minor party candidates for statewide office. Nearly 400 are now under court order to comply with the new statute's requirement that periodic spending reports be submitted, and promptly. The old law had required filing, but had no provisions for enforcement. Under the new law, effective last June 1, the State Board of Elections has gone to State Supreme Court for civil orders and fines of up to $100 for failure to file. At least 40 of the orders and fines have been against incumbents in the 210‐seat Legislature. Major party statewide candidates’ filing dates were also reviewed, but apparently were in order. What about the reports that were filed? The board has begun a “desk audit” of 12,000 of them to determine if contribution or spending limits were exceeded. As with the filing violations, infractions could be dealt with as misdemeanors. But it is not likely. The board's counsel has said it has chosen civil rather than criminal suits “because it's a new statute.” A Reprieve For U.D.C. New York State's Legislature has granted a financial reprieve to the Urban Development Corporation, enabling it to repay its debts and complete construction projects already under way, but the corporation's fiscal worries are not over. As a result of a series of billst passed by the Legislature, the corporation will be able to pay off $104.5‐million in bond‐anticipation notes it defaulted on in February and also repay a $30‐million bank loan. The legislation was part of the state's agreement with 11 commercial banks to resolve the U.D.C.'s problems. Short‐term loans of $140‐million approved by the Legislature are designed to lead to long‐term financing, either from savings banks or in the bond market. Harriet Heyman and Milton Leebaw Connecticut's Governor Grasso Remembers How She Made It By PAUL COWAN Connecticut's new Governor, Ella Grasso, personifies two trends that could reshape American politics over the next decade: feminism and the resurgence of ethnicity. She is the first woman to be elected Governor in her own right anywhere in the country and the first person of Italian extraction to be elected Governor in Connecticut. Mrs. Grasso is the product of the Hartford‐based Democratic political machine, not of the suburban‐based reformers who tried to overthrow the regulars during the McCarthy‐McGovern years. One has only to spend a few days with her to realize that, despite the image her sex might conjure, she is a tough, conventional politician with a deep respect for the traditions of compromise and flexibility, and a kind of shy nostalgia for the decorums of the past. She served in the Connecticut state capital from 1954 1970, first as a legislator, then as Secretary of the State. From 1970 to 1974 she was in Washington as a Congressman, a word she is said to have preferred, but could never quite overcome her homesickness for her native state. Governor Grasso apparently is as comfortable in the baroque state capital as she would be in her own living room. She walks unhurriedly about her office and through the halls. She blows a kiss at a photographer she has known for years, wraps an arm around one of her commissioners, asks a janitor about his ailing wife, pokes a reporter in his paunch. She discusses the inner workings of Connecticut politics in a language that is sprinkled with mild profanities, shrewd judgments of fellow politicians and self‐mocking wit. Her mentor and role model is no 1960's culture hero. He is the late John Bailey, chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1961 to 1968, who created and held together Connecticut's Democratic machine. In Mrs. Grasso's mind, Mr. Bailey symbolizes patience and flexibility, the qualities she most admires in a politician. She became personally aware of those qualities when Mr. Bailey acted as her tutor. She recalls that when he first spotted her as a political corner in the 1950's, he tried, and failed, to get her to exchange her informal, rumpled mode of dress for something more fashionable. But during her 1974 gubernatorial campaign, when some advisers wanted a media technician to teach her to be chic, Mr. Bailey insisted she keep her comfortable air of disarray. Mrs. Grasso may become an even more effective politician than her mentor imagined. During a recent informal brunch with dozens of the state's newspaper publishers, she walked about the sunlit porch of the Governor's Mansion with the ease of the practiced hostess and the authority of the skilled politician. She alternately refilled guests’ coffee cups and responded to their questions with a torrent of information. The meeting was not merely a high‐level press conference; it was a request for advice. Should she divulge the bar association's criticisms of two prospective judges and therefore cause them personal discomfort by insisting on full disclosure? “That's the problem that keeps me up nights,” she said. Most of the publishers were her longtime friends. Few hesitated to aid her. As one said of her, “It's a complicated and disarming approach. We'll all have more trouble criticizing her now that we've advised her. This is the most pleasant kind of manipulation I've ever experienced.” A Tough, Well‐Ordered Beginning Although Ella Grasso was certainly not born to power, she obtained it with an ease that is unusual among immigrant children. She was the only child of parents who, coming to America from northern Italy, settled in the small factory town of Windsor Locks, Conn. Her father, James Tambussi, a baker, had conventionally modest ambitions for her. “Most girls in town went to work for the insurance companies,” she recalls. But her mother had an ardent faith in the value of education. So when Mrs. Grasso was a teen‐ager, she applied and was accepted to an exclusive girls’ school nearby, the Chaffee School. A few of her classmates treated her with patrician disdain, she says. There were times when her desire for the material possessions her school friends took for granted wounded her mother, who was still struggling make do. Mrs. Grasso says she “blossomed” at Chaffee. And she won a scholarship to Mount Holyoke College, where she studied economics and sociology. On the whole she felt embraced, not excluded, at those elite schools. She came away sharing their ethic of service, not resenting their upper‐class sense of noblesse oblige. Now she speaks often of the two institutions, with a kind of reverential gratitude. Mrs. Grasso discussed those experiences last week at Yale, at an ethnic‐studies seminar that was composed mainly of Italo‐American students. There was a discernible gap between her comfortable sense of accomplishment and their fear that most Yale students considered Italians inferior. At times the students’ complaints seemed to Irritate Mrs. Grasso. “It's easier for you than for me,” she told one tartly, “but I managed to survive. 1 think the war you're talking about has been over for a long time. I don't think there are any barriers now, and if there are, I think you've helped put them there and you've got to remove them.” As she went on, her chilly tone made it clear she was fiercely proud of her achievements and of the country that had made them possible. The teacher asked, had she suffered more from A sexual stereotype than from an ethnic stereotype? “All my friends in the women's movement get angry at me for saying this, but I never thought that being a woman gave me any special political problems. It was only when my friends from the foreign press, New York, kept coming here and writing about me as a woman candidate that I began to think I was doing something unusual. Though Mrs. Grasso represents to many a harbinger the new feminism and new ethnicity, she herself is a bit saddened at the passing of the more communal, genteel world she knew at Windsor Locks, at Holyoke, and as young legislator. That feeling is sometimes evident in her personal transactions. A reporter was seated in the drawing room of the Governor's Mansion when Mrs. Grasso returned from state business. He paused momentarily before standing. How did she feel about the custom, which many feminists scorn? “Well, I'm still the first one to stand when an older person comes into the room,” she says. “I guess in matters courtesy I'm part of another time, another generation.” Another Difficult Start She is opposed to abortion, against toe leganzation Or marijuana, deeply reluctant to accept any changes in the laws concerning homosexuality. Although some critics say those positions are calculated ones, certain vote‐getters this predominantly Catholic state, they seem genuinely keeping with her personal desire for orderly conduct and propriety. She is wistful when she speaks of the changes in family life that have occurred over the last few decades. “I never would have been able to have a political career if I hadn't been part of an extended family. I lived on a short street in Windsor Locks, the same street where I was born. Tom and I moved across the street when we got married. The children felt warmth and security because they could always visit some member of our family enclave.” She thinks one reason the 1970's might be worse than the 1930's is that people now lack the resources of relatives and “familiar soil” to comfort them. These problems are very much on her mind. “I bleed a lot,” she says. Then, chuckling, “But I try not to leave so much blood all over the floor that I cannot get my work done.” Ella Grasso was elected Governor by a plurality of 260,000 votes. But John Bailey's death last month robbed her of her closest adviser, and left Connecticut's Democratic party without experience and continuity, a void Mr. Bailey's successor, William O'Neill, cannot possibly fill. Although the new Governor is still having her honeymoon with the press, she was criticized when, out of about 20 appointments for state commissionerships, she named only two women, one of whom is temporary. She was attacked again when she decided to erase the $73‐million debt she inherited from former Republican Governor Thomas Meskill by raising the sales tax to 7 per cent, instead of levying a less regressive income tax. More important, these are bleak times in Connecticut. The unemployment rate in the state of three million is 10 per cent. In some towns, it runs as high as 20 per cent. So Mrs. Grasso's first months have been especially difficult. Legislators and their aides describe the endless, gloomy discussions on ways to cut the budget. Mrs. Grasso has taken the symbolic step of cutting her own pay by $7,000. She has said it might be necessary to lay off 2,000 state employes, and has proposed a controversial corporate property tax. She continues to balk at the personal income tax, however, which has created discontent even within her own party. The income tax has always been a bete noire in Connecticut, but many legislators now think it may be the only way out of the economic mess. They worry that Mrs. Grasso is too cautious to risk her reputation trying to convince voters that an income tax is fairer than a sales tax. Similarly, though she claims she offered women “provocative” jobs like that of transportation commissioner and they turned her down, many feminists feel she could have been more diligent in her search, and less concerned about the sentiments of old‐line politicians. The Governor has not put her critics on an enemies list however. Her most publicized adversary was Ann Menousek, a Republican who edits the weekly Brookfield Journal and serves as chairwoman of the State Committee on the Status of Women. Now, Mrs. Menousek said, she has more access than ever to Mrs. Grasso and her staff. She said the Governor has been responsive to the criticism; last week, for instance, she appointed two women judges. Democrats and Republicans disagree about how open Mrs. Grassn's administration really Is. Clearly the Governor has no political need for Republican support: The Democrats have a 29 to 7 majority in the Senate, a 118 to 33 majority in the House. Still, Lewis Rome, the House minority leader, seemed genuinely hurt when he complained of never getting to see the Governor. “She's acting in a far more partisan way than I would have imagined,” he said. And by doing she's jeopardizing some of the “extraordinary good feeling” that accompanied her election. “Governor Mesldll rarely saw the Democratic leadership either,” countered James Kennelly, Speaker of the House. To him, the extraordinary feature of Mrs. Grasso's style that she doesn't just deal with her party's top leadership, but with assistants, committee chairmen, even individual legislators. Since taking office the Governor has tried to remain accessible to the public. She has traveled outside the state only once for a speaking engagement; but in state, she holds biweekly office hours in the capital or in towns like Torrington. Where she sees anyone who calls on her. Voters apparently still have a genuine emotional involvement with Ella Grasso. A nurse at the Hartford Hospital reflected the feelings of many of her supporters when she said, “I wish she'd taken office when times were better. don't think there's much she can do in this economy. watch her on TV and I see a very lonely woman. I know she's brilliant, but she's got a lot to contend with. I MIN hope she makes it.” If she does, she could become an important force in American politics. She denies that she aspires to national office, but on three occasions at the Yale seminar she teased her audience with hints that she might like to be President. She was one of four featured speakers at this year's Gridiron Dinner. The other three were Democratic party Chairman Robert Strauss, Vice‐President Rockefeller and President Ford. She could become the perfect melting‐pot politician for the 1980's. Her sex and her ethnic roots, her candor, her modest lifestyle, are all likely to appeal to voters who are tired of the lies, the pomp, the swaggering bravado that they feel have characterized American politics for 15 years. Democratic party leaders, who may well like Ella Grasso as much as their former chairman, John Bailey, did, will have other considerations in mind. The conventionality of Governor Grasso's social and economic ideas and her belief in the traditional mechanisms of American politics make her the kind of safe, yet highly visible politician they are so desperately seeking.

"Ideas &Trends Education, Law, History",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/education-law-history-before-erikson-or-columbus-maybe-hanno.html,"Periodically, claims are made for this Intrepid voyager or that as the first to reach the Americas. Columbus, most authorities on the exploration of the two continents agree, has already lost his title to the Norseman, Lief Erikson. There are, however, other contenders, whose travels, their champions say, predate even the Vikings. Recently, new evidence has been adduced to support an assertion that sailors from Carthage (the ancient North African city in what is now Libya) and Cadiz, once colonies of the eastern Mediterranean kingdom of Phoenicia, visited the New World as early as 550 B.C. According to Dr. H. Barraclough Fell of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, the pre‐Christian explorers left a clear record behind them in the Americas, on stones inscribed In Punic, the Phoenician dialect of Carthage, and in Iberian variants. The latest in his collection, identified last month, is from Bourne, Mass. The translation of the inscription, says Dr. Fell, is: “Proclamation of annexation. Do not deface. Hanno of this [place] takes possession.” Hanno was then a common name, One Hanno, a prince of Carthage, was in service to Hiram III, King of Tyre, Phoenicia's premier city. It is to this Hanno the North Atlantic voyage is attributed. Dr. Fell finds the Bourne stone consistent with the Phoenician‐Carthaginian hegemony of the seas and enterprising African and European trade. Similar inscriptions, he says, have been found in Canada, Mexico and South America. There are other claimants. In 1962 a scholar in Peking reported that five Chinese led by a Buddhist monk reached Mexico by ship in 459 B.C., there to influence the culture of the Aztecs. The Turks have postulated a migration across the Bering Strait in 5000 B.C., that bore to Central America its pyramidal architecture. And there are the Welsh, the Japanese, the Romans. Student Protests Now Center on Economics Academic budget cuts and higher tuition, which tend to affect minority students the most, have replaced foreign policy and politics as targets of protests on college campuses. In recent weeks students have staged strikes, sit‐ins, rallies and other nonviolent demonstrations to protest administrative decisions to retrench because of inflation and recession. The colleges have reduced their staffs and programs, student aid and jobs, and services such as counseling. Blacks especially have objected to any curtailment of higher education's commitment to help them. At Brandeis, where students took over a campus building last week, a coalition of black, Latin‐American and Asian students said the cutbacks would make it more difficult for minorities to attend the school and that Brandeis would become even richer and whiter. The demonstrators demanded repeal of a plan to reduce by 50 per cent a remedial program for poorly educated students. At Brown, where students struck for four days, blacks contended that the cutbacks in aid and special programs would particularly hurt students whose families have limited Income, and they demanded a role in assigning budget‐cutting priorities. At Hunter College, demonstrators protested proposea cutbacks in aid programs. Budget trims tend to fall heaviest on the poor and the educationally deprived students because they need the expensive remedial programs, special counseling and financial aid that often are the first to go. Many of these students are shut out entirely because, without assistance, they usually cannot pay the higher fees. A Curtailment Of Legal Aid The right to equal protection of the law, it is often argued, demands recognition of another right, the right to counsel. Poor people accused of crimes are now guaranteed publicly supported legal assistance, and New York lawyers had hoped a case before the State Court of Appeals would extend that guarantee to the state's poor in civil matters as well. It did not. In a case involving common civil action, two women had argued that because they were indigent, they were entitled to free legal assistance in their divorce suits. But in matrimonial matters and, by implication, most other civil actions, the court held that “representation by counsel is not a legal condition of access to the courts.” A number of agenoies in the state offer free counsel in civil matters. In New York City, where over three million people qualify for free legal aid, two organizations. The Legal Aid Society of New York City and Community Action for Legal Services, were able to handle 100,000 civil matters last year, of which fewer than 20,000 involved family cases, including divorce. Landlord‐tenant disputes are a primary area of concern, as are cases involving jobs and welfare, and consumer protection. The Importance Of Fetal Research A national investigative commission has concluded that while fetal research raises ethical questions, it is sufficiently important that it should continue under certain circumstances. After a four‐month study, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research last week recommended an end to the moratorium on federally funded research involving the living human fetus, either before or after an induced abortion. The report will go to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, who by law must draft Government regulations on the issue. Congress imposed the moratorium and ordered the study last year in an effort to resolve the controversy over whether fetal research is ethically justified and scientifically worthwhile. Because most biomedical research has Government support, the ban had effectively stopped fetal research in the United States. Supporters of continuing research contend that it is vital to improvements in the prevention and treatment of child disease and deformities. They say that fetal research has contributed to vaccines against polio and German measles and has improved chances for survival by premature babies. Opponents, notably antiabortion forces, charge that fetal research violates the rights of unborn human beings and therefore is morally wrong. The commission specified limited circumstances in which fetal research should be considered permissible, both to help a fetus survive and to acquire knowledge that might help others. It stressed efforts to minimize risks or “indignities” to the subjects of the research. Caroline Rand Herron and Donald Johnston"
Prep Schools Explore Ethics,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/prep-schools-explore-ethics.html,"One week last spring the discipline committee of an Eastern boarding school was confronted with two separate cases of student stealing. Viewed side by side, the crimes posed such a classic moral dilemma that hundreds of. other preparatory schools are now using them as case studies in a growing phenomenon known as values clarification. Case No. 1: A student enters a classmate's room, breaks into a locked desk and steals an expensive Japanese camera. Confronted, he confesses. Case No. 2: Two other students are caught sneaking out of a local supermarket with $28 worth of canned hams and other groceries, stuffed into a book bag. They also admitted guilt. Question: Is it more serious to steal from a friend than a supermarket chain? Some students considered the crimes equally serious. Others, operating on what one headmaster called “the Abbie Hoffman principle,” recommended a lighter penalty for the supermarket thieves, as did the discipline committee that had confronted the actual case. There was, of course, no right or wrong answer. Advocates of values clarification say that its goal is not to give students the “right” values, but rather to help them develop and express a set of personal values that define their lives. Old Ways Do Not Work On the surface it would seem that private independent schools, with their history of clearly articulated moral and ethical traditions, would not suddenly pioneer in new ways of teaching values. But the reason, school officials say, is that the old ways do not work. Headmasters have seen the honor code go the route of • the uniform and the vesper service. Every year, student faith in other institutions that traditionally transmitted culture—the church, temple and family—falters. Moreover, the young feel disenchanted and powerless in the face of ethical pragmatism at the highest levels. As Barbara Jones, head of the religion department at the Masters School, a girls boarding school in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., said: “We see it in lying, coverups, kickbacks, payoffs, bribery, corruption in government, industry and business.” Dr. Jones and other private‐school educators pointed out that the residential school is particularly suitable to values clarification. “It's one of the few places left in contemporary life where a community can act out its own convictions in a climate designed for effective teaching and role modeling,” she said. The concept of values clarification first appeared in 1966 with the publication of “Value and Teaching,” book by Louis Raths, Merrill Harmin and Sidney B. Simon. Earlier Controversy By 1970, it had become the focus of some controversy in progressive public schools that integrated it with curriculum. Parents feared that the schools were usurping the functions of family and church. Schools, in turn, argued that what they were teaching was a process of valuing, not a particular set of values. In private independent schools, value teaching has been generally well‐received. While offering no hard figures, the National Association of Independent Schools notes that many of its 842 members are using or planning to use value education, the theme of its spring conference. “It's probably the hottest issue in private education today,” a spokesman said. The Rev. James R. Blanning, executive director of the Council for Religion in Independent Schools, agrees. As researcher of the case studies that are sent out to 700 schools—'They have to be made of whole cloth for these kids, otherwise they won't wash'—Mr. Blanning visits about 40 schools year, both boarding and day. There he sees a variety of value teaching, ranging from required courses to informal workshops to “bull sessions.” In contrast to some of their public‐school peers, privateschool parents often welcome values clarification in the classroom, Mr. Blanning said. “Some parents expect the school to teach the values that they themselves feel inadequate to teach,” he explained. Besides the case studies, a variety of materials are used in the value programs. Winston Press, Inc., for example, has come out with a workbook series and study units designed to help junior and senior high school students examine values on such topics as drugs, prejudice, pollution, death and violence. Two‐thirds of its sales are to nonpublic schools, according to company figures. Also popular are such board games as “Values,” a sort of moral Monopoly marketed by Friendship Press. It has the same spinner and deck of cards, but the cards challenge players to debate a range of personal and social issues from lying and cheating to abortion to world hunger and war. The programs, like the private school themselves, are highly individualistic. One considered to be a model—though it is only a year old—is that of the Taft School in Watertown, Conn., a coeducational institution with 125 day students and 375 boarders. No Religious Aspect The school chaplain, the Rev. Peter Holroyd, runs the program but stresses that it has no religious component. “We don't even mention God at all. We don't even have a chapel,” he said. As Mr. Holroyd recalls it, two factors led to Taft's decision to add the value program to the curriculum as a required sophomore course. For one thing, he said, today's 14‐ and ‘15‐year‐olds are being forced to make choices once deferred to college years or even later, choices on complex issues such as drug use and serious sexual involvement. For another, he said, the institutions themselves are “in a state of flux.”"
Talking About the Untalkable,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/04/archives/talking-about-the-untalkable.html,"Picture this scene: I am about 12 years old and I have just entered the shower in the little cabana‐type arrangement we have outside our summer house. My mother is sitting on the bench in the dressing room. “Carol,” she says to me, “I think perhaps it's time we had a little talk about um well, you know mean now you're a woman, and that is.” I turn on the shower full blast. “What?” I say, “I can't hear you.” What UK we, growing up in the forties and fifties, know from feelings like depression or anxiety (let alone the difference between specific and nonspecific)? We knew we felt nervous a lot of the time and rotten most of the rest of it. The bulk of us got through adolescence with a combination of hope and inertia and the deeply engrained belief that s—x was probably the answer, if we could only figure out what the diagrams in the books our mothers threw on our beds had to do with it. It all sounded (a) messy and (b) singularly unattractive. Finding out about sex was a little like trying to reconstruct a lost civilization from potsherds and relics. You took overheard conversations, scenes from movies (sneaking into “From Here to Eternity” and “The Moon Is Blue” rank among my more cherished childhood memories) and, of course, books, put them all together and you arrived—presumably before you found out empirically —at what s—x was all about. (Anyone who wants to understand the sexual proclivities of women in their early thirties has only to read “Not as a Stranger” and the Kinsey report.) As for all the other feelings (they all ended, as I recollect, in “I'll kill myself,” as: “If. I don't get into Radcliffe, I'll kill myself': “If he doesn't call ma, I'll kill myself”: “If she calls on me for this question, I'll kill myself”), you were left pretty much to your own devices. Parents ran to head patting and murmurs about these being the best years of your lives. Until I read “Catcher of the Rye” I was convinced that someone had slipped up somewhere and science‐fiction was the only form of literature into which people like me fit. As a mother who shrinks in terror at the thought of having to go through my children's adolescence after having narrowly escaped with my life through my own, the idea of having available to them roadmaps through the vale of tears that is puberty is appealing. YOU AND YOUR FEELINGS by Eda LeShan (Macmillan, $5.95) and KNOW YOUR FEELINGS by Margaret O. Hyde and Elizabeth Held Forsyth, M.D. (Watts. $5.90) are two books that struck me as sensible, sound and sober surveys of how typically mixed‐up adolescents feel. While both books tend toward the simplistic, they share an attitude that I find commendable they don't pretend to have any solutions, they simply give as much information on the kinds of problems that adolescents have, explore them a bit, and stress that most‐‐‐if not all—kids that age have them. The sense of shared problems is a bit more pronounced in “You and Your since LeShan uses a lot of quotes from kids. More specific difficulties are examined in EPILEPSY by Dr. Alvin Silverstein and Virginia Silverstein (Lippincott, cloth, $5.50; paper, $1.95); FAT FREE by Sara Gilbert (Macmillan, $5.95) and PAIN: Why it Hurts, Where it Hurts, When it Hurts by Richard Stiller (Nelson, $6.95). All three books pay the adolescent the compliment of assuming that he or she can understand words of more than two syllables, and all strike me as useful if the circumstances warrant. “Fat Free” is a kind of watered‐down version of all the power‐of‐positive‐thinking diet books for grownups, but who knows if a copy strategically placed near the cookie jar mightn't nip some miserable adolescent's embonpoint in the bud? “Pain” isn't really a supportive book per se, but since I am a firm believer in knowledge as power, I can see this helping some kid who's stuck in bed with something and On the sex front, as it were, fear that none of these books will spare a mother the obligatory lecture to her adolescent daughter on how the machinery works and why you'd better not turn it on too soon. SEX AND SENSIBILITY by Elizabeth Whelan (McGraw‐Hill, $6.95) is the ctosest to “The Wonders of the Fallopian Tube” school of sex books that remember. After your standard spermmeets‐egg intro, Mrs. Whelan feels called upon to caution against premarital sexual relations, using the same argument (you — are — not — emotionallymature‐enough) that was used 20 years ago and which will probably be discarded now, as then, by the adolescent who feels that the author obviously has no idea of her truly remarkable degree of emotional maturity, to say nothing of her sophistication. The fact that the book is a mite cutesy‐poo (chapter titles run to “The Semen's Dilemma,” and sentences have a way of ending in exclamation points) may be attributable to the fact that Mrs. Whelan is a frequent contributor to Cosmopolitan, but one wonders at the degree of disapproval she expresses toward, for exanieple, abortion. Como or no, Mrs. Whelan thinks young ladies should CONCEPTION, ABORTION, PREGNANCY by Alice L. Fleming (Nelson, $5.95), on the other hand, presupposes by its very title, that its readers’ minds are already made up. It is written on a level that most 13‐year‐olds should be able to understand, describes the forms of contraception with clarity, and is probably for you if your daughter is young—you are more pragmatic than idealistic, and you are scared. (Although one wonders how a 13‐year‐old‐virgin would react to being handed this book by her mother; prior research into your daughter's experience is recommended.) One book stands out from the rest as a model of what a book on sex written for adolescents should be. SEX AND BIRTH CONTROL: A Guide for the Young by E. James Lieberman, M.D. and Ellen Peck (Schocken, paper, $1.95) while professing disinterest in the question of should — you — orshouldn't‐you, makes more sense in the few pages that tackle the question than the whole of Mrs. Whelan's book. In the main, it's a complete and excellent guide to the available forms of contraception; and its section on abortion is rational, reassuring and informative. On the assumption that it can happen here, I'd recommend this as a part of every parent's open shelf reference library, at least until somebody gets around to writing the boa that I happen to be after: “How to Find and Choose a Convent for Your"
Doctors’ Aims Questioned At 2 Hospitals They Own,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/05/archives/doctors-aims-questioned-at-2-hospitals-they-own.html,"For the last year and a half, a partnership that now numbers seven doctors had been enjoying increasing support from community and legislative leaders for the way it seemingly had been improving two private Manhattan hospitals that had been under fire by the state Health Department. Then last weekend the situa tion changed. At about midnight on Apri 25 a group of the doctors en tered the larger of the two hospitals ‐ the 106‐bed Park East at 112 East 83d Street, off Park Avenue‐with At least six uniformed security guards and began the process of ousting the executive director of the hospital. The guards stationed themselves at the entrance and checked everyone going in and out. When the executive director, Eugene Kligmann, returned the next day from a brief vacation in Florida, he said he was shocked to find the hospital looking like an armed camp. “I felt like I was walking into Adolf Hitler land,” Mr. Kligmann said later. He said he stayed at the hospital until April 27, a Sunday, when he was told to leave immediately because the doctors had voted 4 to 3 to dismiss him; He said that he was given no reason for the dismissal and that he was not allowed to take any papers with him. Says He Feels ‘Used’ He said he supposed the reason for his dismissal was that he was trying to restrain the doctors from considering the hospitals mainly as a source of profit. “I feel I've been used,” Mr. Kligmann said. “I thought we were going to serve the community but they were just interested in their own profits.” The circumstances of the ouster have turned some community members away from supporting the hospital and threaten to end the backing the doctors had from the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, which had come to their aid because six of the doctors are black. Mr. Kligmann, echoing reports from other sources, said one of the leaders of the group that ousted him, Dr. Cleo J L. Froix, a general surgeon, had used hospital personnel to paint his home in Scarsdale had charged the hospital for a $13,000 trip around the world on the basis of reading a paper at a meeting in the Philippines and had charged at least $90,000 in consultation fees in the last year to patients in the hospital who were not his own patients. Meeting Canceled Dr. Froix so far has refused to discuss the charges. Ma telephone conversation Tuesday he said he would not discuss anything without his lawyer, C. John Somers of Somers, Goldstick & Weinberger, of 551 Fifth Avenue. On Thursday he abruptly canceled a meeting set for that afternoon, saying he was busy with operations and after that had “other commitments.” He refused to set meeting. Park East and the 72‐bed Park West Hospital at 170 West 76th Street have been operated jointly as proprietary profitmaking—insti tutions. From the nineteen‐thirties until five years ago they were owned by the family of Victor Kovner, a lawyer and leading Democrat on the Upper Mr. Kovner said that with his uncle's death and with his father in failing health, the hospitals were put up for sale in the late sixties. Mr Kovner said he was the lawyer representing his family when the hospitals were sold in 1970 to a group made up mostly of people from Britain. The Britons expected to fill the growing demand for abortions that was sure to result from New York State's eased abortion law. Two years later the hospitals were sold to Life Sciences, Inc. Maxwell M. Powell, president of Life Sciences, said the other day that he bought the hospitals because he wanted to turn them into private cancer‐treatment centers. He said that he could not get a license from the state for that purpose and that he continued to operate the hospitals as they had been, “using the proceeds to support cancer research at our facility M St. Petersburg, Fla.” A New Chairman In September, 1973, Life Sciences sold the hospitals to the group of doctors then headed by Dr. Froix. The chairmanship of the group recently went to another member, Dr. John W. V. Cordice, who lives in Hollis, Queens. The doctors signed an agreement to buy the hospitals for $5‐million. They gave Sciences $150,000 and the balance was to be paid when the deal was finally approved by the State Health Department. Pending final approval the doctors agreed to pay $25,000 as monthly rent for the two institutions. Actually, neither the sale to Life Sciences nor the sale to the doctors has been consummated because the State Health Department never gave its approval to either transaction. (Until recently the state rarely did anything to block such Last January, however, the Health Department, insisting that its approval was needed for any change in Those running a hospital, ordered Park East and Park West to close down by Feb. 28 because such approval had not been obtained. “This is not just a bureaucratic paperwork requirement,” said Dr. Robert P. Whalen, who was acting state Health Commissioner at the time. “It is a vital consumer‐protection measure designed to safeguard patients. The Health Department must know at all times who is responsible for patient care.” Caucus Acts The move drew an angry response from the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. In a telegram to Governor Carey, six State Senators and 14 Assemblymen in the caucus said: We urge you to do everything within your power to prevent the imminent closing. Immediate action is necessary to save 400 jobs and insure that Manhattan residents will continue to receive the highquality health care provided by these two outstanding institutions.” Senator Robert Garcia, who led the caucus's intervention in the matter, called the closure order “irresponsible.” He said then that “the medical records of both hospitals and their undisputed service to the community are not being questioned in any way by Commissioner Whalen.” As a matter of fact, Health Department inspectors have raised many questions about the finances of the two hospitals, and the care given and the safety of the buildings. One report says administrative expenses seem to be high compared with those in similar hospitals. Although abortions have been curtailed, another report noted that there Seemed to be excessive work by podiatrists, much of which eventually must be paid by the government through Medicaid or Medicare. (The hospitals received almost $3‐million in Medicare and Medicaid funds last year.) ‘Serious Questions’ “This two‐hospital complex,” the report said, “has about 1,000 podiatric surgical procedures a year. This is an unusually large number and serious questions should arise as to the necessity of some of these procedures.” Another Health Department inspector reported after a visit to Park West: “Serious fire safety hazards exist in this hospital. This is another old, tired building. Wall and floor surfaces are almost impossible to clean.” The Health Department moved only on the violation involving failure to get permission to change management because officials said, adding all the other matters would make the case more complex and subject to long legal delays. The hospitals went to court and obtained an injunction halting the closing order. On April 15 Judge Theodore R. Kupferman, writing a unanimous ruling of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, said that while the Health Department was “technically correct” in ordering the hospital to close, that action “is clearly unreal and harsh. Judge Kupferman said “the hospitals seem to be operating in exemplary fashion, the pro. posed transferees [the doctors’ partnership], who are in effec tive control, are physicians from the community, and the area served is benefited by the continued operation of the hospitals.” Of the seven physicians, none live near Park East and only one lives as near as 10 blocks from Park West. Two of the group live in Queens, two in Westchester County, one in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, and two in Manhattan. Asked about what he meant by “from the community” in his decision, Judge Kupferman said the other day: “I didn't mean that they were from just across the street.” As to the need for the hospitals in the community, the Health and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New York has consistently denied requests from the two hospitals for approval of a change in ownership, on the ground that the hospitals are not needed because there already is an excess of beds in the city. During the last year Park East had had no trouble recruiting members of the community to help the hospital by joining the Park East Hospital Community Advisory Board. Some of those on the board had only recently won, through the 83d and 84th Street Block Association, the battle to oust a methadone clinic from the area. “We had a very good working relationship with Mr. Kligmann.” said Mrs. Sheila Rosenblatt, chairman of the hospital's community advisory board, but our community is very upset by the guerrilla‐like tactics that went on in there over the weekend. I haven't gotten a straight story. There's some kind of monkey business going on in there.” Another Objector Another member of the community advisory board is Robert Palese, who worked for the hospital for more than two months this year as an administrator. He mentioned hospital employes painting Dr. Froix's home and his trip around the world. He also said that Dr. Froix put consultants on the payroll at $250 a day. These consultants did next to nothing, Mr. Palese said. One of them, he said, put in a bill for four days that came to $1,880 including expenses. “I don't feel these men are fit to have a license, “Mr. Palese said. “I don't like thuggery and I don't respect anyone who resorts to thuggery. I guarantee you that these hospitals will be closed within 60 days.” One of the doctors in the partnership who did not go along with the ouster of Mr. Kligmann is Dr. Richard N Diamond, an orthopedic surgeon, who also is Mr. Klig mann's brother‐in law and the only one in the partnership who is not a black. Dr. Diamond said: “Four of the physicians wanted three things one, control of the money‐they wanted to siphon the money out of the hospital into their pockets; two, they wanted to increase the abortions again to raise the income of the hospital, and three, they wanted to start some kind of a methadone program to bring in more money.” “I want to get out of the deal. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I just can't trust these gentlemen. When I get all my patients out I'll never set foot in there again.” Efforts to reach other doctors in the partnership have not been successful."
"Responsa: The Law as Seen By Rabbis for 1,000 Years",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/05/archives/responsa-the-law-as-seen-by-rabbis-for-1000-years.html,"Tradition has it that young rabbis completing their training are given an ordination certificate and the telephone number of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. He is the closest that Orthodox Jewry comes to a court of last resort. During much of the clay he sits plumped atop a fat cushion in a chair in his study on the Lower East Side, great volumes of religious law and opinion stacked from floor to ceiling behind him, his telephone in hand. A hot line connects him with the yeshiva he heads who can tell how quickly followers there will need his counsel? His interpretations of religious law, like others, written in the past millennium, are, precedents guiding the faithful. About 2,000 books have been devoted to such “responsa,” containing more than 250,000 decisions, many sharply conflicting. Rabbi Feinstein is one of that select group who continue the tradition of deciding difficult issues. Born in Russia 80 years ago, he began rendering formal opinions at age 18. He came to this country in 1937, and his Vernacular is still Russian‐dabbed Yiddish. Short, spry, richly bearded, he has reached the heights of religious jurisprudence not by appointment or election, but by recognition of his talents. “You can't wake up in the morning and decide you're an expert on answers,” he said recently as disciples clustered round. “If people see that one answer is good, and another answer is good, gradually you will be accepted.” Many questions come from other rabbis, and his responsa have been published in Hebrew in five large volumes called “Iggrot Moshe” (“The Epistles of Moshe”). At least one rabbi has devoted a huge tome to attacking his views, and the Hasidic Satmar Jews in New York plastered up handbills of defiance when one of Rabbi Feinstein's responsa legitimized artificial insemination. “A rabbi who replies to people's questions works harder than a doctor dealing with a case of life and death,” Rabbi Feinstein said. “The doctor is responsible only to his patient, but the rabbi is responsible to God.” About a thousand years ago, when responsa literature had its start, communities remote from Babylonian scholarship needed expert opinions on the meaning and applications of halaklia—religious law. They dispatched inquiries, got back written replies, accumulating what a later rabbi called ‘law by correspondence.” New centers of learning rose and disappeared, tributary to the insecurities of local Jewish life and of scholarly finesse. Feeding on themselves, complexities nourishing one another, modern developments challenging the rigidity of old orders, responsa became weightier, longer, many achieving the substance of essays. Judaism is a decentralized congeries of rival beliefs. doubts and practices with no font of authority other than revelation (Old Testament) and rabbinic interpretations (notably Talmud) that do not command universal allegiance or unequivocal comprehension. The life of this law is experience, but the authority of this law is custom—what observant believers choose to make it. Those who would swim confidently in these seas need to command scripture, Talmud, the decisions of previous rabbis, and some sense of present man. Ancient law must be interpreted to cover the fabric of modern life, much as the 18th‐century American Constitution provides the threads for contemporary jurisprudence. Spain's Solomon ben Adret (1235‐1310) wrote an estimated 7,000 responsa, with over 3,000 extant and authoritative. Germany's Meir ben Baruch (d. 1293) made the landmark decision that Jews could ask Gentiles to perform work forbidden for Jews on the Sabbath this meant that the ban on lighting fires, which hardly bothered the Jews in warm Babylonia, could be modified for the harsh German winter. Jewish survival has traditionally demanded adjustment to hostile climes, and England's Rabbi Louis Jacobs, in his new book, “Theology in the Responsa,” recalls that no man need say there is no room for him to in Jerusalem. Since World War II there has been no decisor—as responsa writers are called—whose writ ran universally. Today there are scattered authorities, notably in the United States and Israel, grappling to accommodate new developments. Small wonder that in “Fiddler on the Roof,” Tevye sings of the ultimate dream—people coming to him and “posing problems that would cross the rabbis eyes.” When a woman claimed she had been raped by a demon, a decisor ruled that intercourse with a demon is not intercourse within the terms of Jewish law. A Swiss rabbi ruled it permissible to wear a self‐winding watch on the Sabbath (no work involved in getting it going), and a Beersheba rabbi decided it was all right to tell time by a clock on a church steeple (no allegiance to Christianity implied). Responsa writers have been no less adept at forthright replies to questions furdamental, even harrowing. Was it murder when a child died after a hand was held over its mouth to prevent discovery by Nazis? A rabbi said no. Rabbi Ephraim Oshry spent the years of World War H in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania. “To die once is not terrible,” he said. “What's terrible is to die every day.” To ensure that the Nazi horrors would not be forgotten, he recorded questions asked by fellow Jews and his own replies, and wrote them down on bits of paper torn from cement sacks he carried on forced labor. Since he did not expect to live (“We wouldn't survive, but Jews would survive”), he buried this record, confident that after the war people would dig under the ruins and find his account. But he survived, and eventually made his way to New York, where he now heads a congregation on the Lower East Side. He began transcribing questions and replies the paper was crumbling, the ink faded—and published them in three books, with a fourth volume now ready for print. The collection is entitled “Responsa from the Depths,” an allusion to Psalm 130 (”Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, 0 Lord. Lord, hear my voice). “I wanted to be sure that Jews would be able to show what spiritual life was like in the ghettos and the camps,” he noted. “One resists with a gun, another with his soul.” When one man was killed by the Nazis, his penniless widow, with children to feed asked whether she might remove the gold from his teeth. Rabbi Oshry forbade it as desecration of the corpse. May an Orthodox Jew, forced to this extremity by the Nazis, shave off his beard? The Rabbi said yes. He also declared it a blessing to take back a wife forced by the Nazis into prostitution. Rabbi Oshry usually opts for leniency. But he ruled that even to save his life a Jew should not buy a baptismal certificate. And he said a Jew did not have the right to commit suicide. Conservative Jews—less orthodox than Orthodox, more conservative than Reform—issue response as cautious products of their Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. “The Orthodox have never accepted, officially, anything we've done,” noted Rabbi Seymour Siegel of the Jewish Theological Seminary here, who heads the committee. “Once they accepted our legitimacy, the prop would be knocked out from under their self‐image. The only exception is suicide. If we say we should accept the suicide of our movement, they would agree.” “The Conservative movement is now being pressed for answers to questions such as, ‘May women be rabbis?’ May they wear prayer shawls,?'” said Rabbi Siegel. “Since I'm the chairman, I'm trying to hold back discussion for a white because the thing we did to permit women to count in the minyan [quorum for worship] caused such controversy. Responsa are not merely correspondence among rabbis; they're directed toward the life of the people—they have to resonate.” “In the nineteen‐sixties, thousands of questions concerned intermarriage,” noted Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, who keeps a card file. “A predominant theme subsequently was converting non‐kosher homes to kosher. Now there are even more questions on the status of women, and in recent months on abortion.” Thanks to a bias for survival as a movement, it was ruled licit to drive to synagogue on the Sabbath. The decision offended some purists, especially since rabbis should not draw personal benefit from their decisions, and it was plain that many suburban congregations would disappear unless car travel was authorized. Leviticus forbids eating fish that lack scales or fins, and sturgeon and swordfish have confused ichthyologists, and even rabbis, on the question of scales. Rabbi Arthur A. Chief of Woodbridge, Conn., inquired, “How does Conservative Judaism feel about swordfish? My ladies clamor to know.” Rabbi Jules Harlow replied that the law committee had long maintained that swordfish was kosher, based on the tale “that the unfortunate fish was consumed at the table of Prof. Louis Ginzberg.” (The widow of the pious professor, who catches her own fish to make Friday's gefilte fish, said, “He ate it many times—it's the best fish there is.) Yea saying, Rabbi Harlow concluded his reply: “Bon appetit!” Rabbi Solomon B. Freehof of Pittsburgh is Reform Jewry's designated expert on responsa. Cultured in the ways of the world, clean‐shaven in the way of Reform, the 82‐year‐old Rabbi revels in the joys of ingenuity. His — service to epistolary law began during World War II, when he headed a committee for chaplains. With Jewish soldiers stationed in Iceland, where night lasted six months, when was sunset? He decided it would be the same time as in New York. Rabbi Freehof learned to do his own bookbinding, and came to cherish books so intensely that he was almost guilty of the delicious sin of bibliolatry. Responsa collections are not computerized, and although individual volumes are often indexed, the literature as a whole is not. “It's an absurd situation that a decision should depend on the memory of a person,” Rabbi Freehof said. “I'm like a drowning man with his hand on a raft as the waves beat on him. keep going through the existing indices so that I should remember I forgot something.” On its founding, Reform Judaism sought to emancipate itself from the strictures of halakha — which makes Rabbi Freehof's enterprise paradoxical. “I'm struggling for a philosophy which will allow us to have a kinship with the greatness of the Jewish spirit,” he said. “The problem is how to have loyalty and freedom — and it's a problem. The purpose of my responsa is not governance, but guidance. “Whenever, there's a doubt, I'll make the lenient answer. Feinstein will make the strict. He's like the boy With a finger in the dike, but he's not tyrannical. ‘Bless his heart, sometimes during his brilliant answers he even forgets that be has to say no.”"

Pressure and Popularity Spur Variety In College Women's Studies Courses,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/07/archives/pressure-and-popularity-spur-variety-in-college-womens-studies.html,"Women's studies courses have become the vogue on colleges around the country, rapidly increasing not only in the number of camruses on which they are offered, but also in the depth and variety of courses given. Like the Black studies of the last decade, women's studies are entering academics on the momentum of a movement. Teachers and students in the new courses tend to identify closely with the women's liberation movement and its grievances, manifesting the consciousness of women established by organizations such as the National Organization of Women and the National Women's Political Caucus. Dozen at Barnard While students almost unaminously applau the new courses, the concept of expanding them into full‐fledged degree programs is meeting some institutional resistance. Some administrators say they fear it may be more of a fad than a discipline, while others say they are concerned that a student who majors in such studies might find a cool reception in the business world. During this decade, 885 colleges and universities across the country have offered 4,658 courses in women's studies. Now, 112 of these colleges offer programs, some of which include the granting of bachelors and masters degrees as well as one program leading to a Ph.D. degree. Barnard College, for example, provided a dozen women's studies courses within 11 departments this year. The religion, history and French departments offered, respectively, “Women and Religion.” “Images of Women in American Intellectual History” and “French Women Writers.” The State University of New York at Binghamton gives students the option of creating their own majors, such as “Women's Studies” or “Women in the American Experience.” “The Faculty and administration express general approval of women's studies,” said Prof. Mary P. Ryan, coordinator of the Ph.D. program at the State University that concentrates on women's history. Although courses in women's studies at the State University are credited, and classrooms are mostly full, she said, limited faculty and a lack of funds have made the development slow and problematic. Petitions Circulated At Brooklyn College next fall, students will be able to elect a double major of women's studies, combined with some other subject leading to a B.A. degree. Prof. Renate Bridenthal, coordinator of the program, said the double major would help reassure prospective employers who might be skeptical of such an untraditional major such as women's studies. Two years ago, Professor Bridenthal recalled, students began collecting signatures on petitions and lobbying the departmental chairmen. The student women's liberation group and the Brooklyn College Women's Organization fought to get the major program approved. Prof. Domna C. Stanton, who teaches a French course, “Female and Feminism,” at Barnard, described women's studies as “compensatory” education, echoing a commonly voiced rationale. “History was always male history, and literature was male literature,” she said, adding that, by having courses for and about women, “it will help women to get a fair shared of the pie in society, to become professionals by virtue of education.” Students commonly speak of anger, frustration and fear. Amanda P. Kissin, a 17‐yearold Barnard freshman, said she found “Sexuality in Literature,” was “almost a little frightening,” adding: “I feel like I'm really impressible. I'm taking this really personally. The readings strike chords in me.” Identifying herself with the “struggle” of women in society, Miss Kissin said: “I feel the frustration. The course gives me a nice sense of being part of it. I know that it's not just my own neurotic perception: other women feel the same thing.” ‘I Feel Angry’ Ruth A. Leibowitz, a sophomore at Barnard, said she took “Women in Antiquity,” a course in classical civilization, to find a model for her own life as a woman. Now, she says, “I feel angry, because I'm looking for that model and I don't find it” in the stereotypes of ancient civilizations. “Women have been treated as a second or inferior class,” said Beryl L. Kaplan, a committed feminist enrolled in Barnard's “Determinants of Sexuality,” an interdisciplinary course combining elements of psychology and biology. Anticipating a career in gynecology, Miss Kaplan has worked this year in an abortion clinic. “I am interested in women's health and women's physical sense of their bodies, their sense of themselves as sexual beings,” she said. In saying that women's studies were part of, the women's liberation movement, Miss Kaplan explained: “Education is a basic foundation for any kind of movement. Women's studies is in a lot of ways — consciousness raising.” The Male View Barney J. Schwartz, one of the few Columbia men who cross over to the Barnard campus to study “Sexuality in Literature,” is puzzled by whether the course teaches literature with emphasis on the women's movement or the women's movement with examples from literature. Mr. Schwartz, an English major, said to his professor: “Everything in literature . . . reflects the struggle between the sexes.” Condemning the teaching of the women's movement in a college classroom, Mr. Schwartz said, “If we're going to study introduction to the feminist movement and illustrate it M literature, then it's polemic.” Prof. Remington P. Patterson, acting dean of the faculty, suggested one reason why there was no total women studies program at Barnard. He said there was “a reluctance to see Barnard identified with a cause, making anything except an intellectual commitment to its students.” The real question is “whether or not this really represents an academic or intellectual discipline,” Professor Patterson said."
A Blurred Picture Of a Decade,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/11/archives/a-blurred-picture-of-a-decade-eyens-women.html,"The recent past is really getting it in the eye these nights, though with inconclusive results. Ed Bullins's “The Taking of Miss Janie,” which has been transplanted to the Mitzi E. Newhouse at Lincoln Center from its original base at the Henry Street Settlement House, devotes itself principally to black‐white relations in the 1960's (“This tale is about the spirit of those times”), Symbolized—or at least given some sort of framing device —by the ultimate rape of a naive white girl by the black poet she wants simply as a “friend.” The rape opens the evening, with the toweled girl sobbing over the destruction of her dream, the cool and Confident stripped male pointing out that it always had to come to this. The ′60's, we gradually learn if we pay extremely close attention, were years of self‐delusion: while blacks and whites, in the time of Kennedy and King, thought, through a marijuana haze, that they were “getting it all together,” they were doing no such thing. Blacks, in the words of a cliché‐spouting revolutionary who marches marionette‐style to a drum in his head, were “still in love with their slave masters,” were stupidly fighting a war “while loving the enemy.” Whites were simply kidding themselves—pretending to understand black poetry, inventing Platonic social harmonies that didn't, couldn't, exist. If I say that it takes extremely close attention to pick up this thread of meaning—provided I have myself got it straight—it's because author Bullins is prodigal, not to say wandering, in his recall. The ′60's are more than abundantly present: in the building‐blocks that spell out the play's title, in the spirals of barbed wire that hover just above them, in the marshmallow thundercloud that lowers nearby, in the torn umbrellas with “Off the Pigs” scrawled on them. Most of the evening is flashback, the lion's share of it taken up by a black‐white party in which sex and hostility give off approximately equal “vibes.” Mr. Bullins, a writer, has a thing about parties. Play after play has made use of them—not so much dramatic as nearly stenographic use, as though the faithful recording of all that might be said and done in a casual, then hyped‐up, personal and/or ethnic mix would surely end in some kind of intelligible pattering. A cat's‐cradle formed of all those comings and goings must, in the end, convey something, mustn't it? At this party we meet not only Miss Janie, who has slept with blacks and had three abortions with a spaced‐out white musician before deciding that she wants a “special” relationship with her poet; we also meet the poet's former wife, a former mistress, and a couple of black roomies (one the automated Black Nationalist, the other a scoffer in search of nothing more than a good time), and a Jew or two. Off and on, some of those circulating between hash and mattress prove interesting. Actress Robbie McCauley is especially fine and forceful as the woman who once married and supported the poet, drifting now into “liberated lesbianism” but not before she has taken the time to hurl “J'accuse” at us all (with the house lights suddenly up) for having “failed ourselves in that serious time known as the ‘60's” by permitting our fantasies to turn us into “freaks and punks.” Sam McMurray, as the weakling musician who has stolen his jazz from blacks, interrupts his own regrets to do an antic, and surprisingly authentic, caricature of a black superstud. And director Gilbert Moses has staged a whale of a fist‐fight between poet Adeyemi Lythcott and junkie Robert B. Silver, hurtling them down red stairways and over furniture with such apparently unbridled violence that you're certain the actors are risking their necks every night. But almost all of the best things pull us away from Janie and her problem. The play's frame doesn't really contain or explain the things that shimmer inside it, and, quite apart from our losing the two principals for long stretches of time, we are left wondering why Janie's “taking” should be made to serve as summary of a decade's mishaps and misapprehensions. Is physical conquest the only answer to the thousand questions raised; was “rape” the resolution the ′60's ought to have been seeking? Or is Janie no more than a nitwit, making impossibly childish demands in a situation too grave for children? The play's structure doesn't say, and we are forced to weave spider‐webs of meaning for ourselves out of random snatches of biography, period echoes, interpolated monologues close to harangues. No one likes having to finish—or trying to finish—an author's play for him; but that's the effort asked here, and you'll have to put yourse??t through it if you want to take something home from “The Taking of Miss Janie.” Tom Eyen means both the times and the tune to be decidedly different in his “Women Behind Bars,” a ham‐fisted spoof of all those B‐movies in which people like Sylvia Sidney and Bette Davis used to be seen in prison‐drab, tearing each other's hair out when the mood was upon th??m and leaving their houses of detention with little hope of reform in their eyes. (Actually, Miss Davis didn't appear in many B‐movies, she was A all the way; but her face happens to he the last face I saw on television, in passing, as she herself passed through those forbidding gates.) Mr. Eyen's own television recall is total, spanning films made from the ′30's through the ′50's, and every once in a while he gets his sudsy solemnities straight. “It was unreal, those first few days. ...” muses the innocent young newcomer. “There is no victory to be won here—only survival,” advises a long‐termer. “Some day they'll tear this terrible place down and someone will plant flowers here,” Eyen's ‘Women’ sighs blonde Madeleine le Roux—rather winning this time out—as a dreamy inmate quite thoroughly out of her skull. If only Mr. Eyen had stopped with the kind of dialogue all the happy hacks wrote for Hollywood those long years, or with the situations they did truly cook up: childbirth inside the walls, electrocution on New Year's Eve with the girls singing “Auld Lang Syne” as the lights dimmed significantly, that brand of inspiration. He hasn't. Instead, he's incorporated all of the words we now use in our (sometimes tiresomely) liberated theater, words that wouldn't have got past even Otto Preminger then, not to mention the broom‐handle rapes and the ostentatious masturbation that so distinguish the ′70's. And that really blows what he's doing. Parody, to be parody, has to find its fun in its source. This “fun” is superimposed, gratuitous, irrelevant, and—in consequence—a great deal less than amusing. We've lost the image we're supposed to be laughing at. Nor are the additions, which have the effect of canceling out the originals, otherwise helpful. The matron orders her aide to call the governor the phone. The aide doesn't know his number. The matron tells her to look it up in the telephone book, under ‘T.’ (For The Governor, I guess.) Now Hollywood didn't write that. Mr. Eyen did. I'd say he can have it. I am forced to. make an exception for a canny actress named Mary Boylan who, with granny glasses and toothy grin, can handle just about anything. As an elderly devotee of the Bible who has managed to snuff out nine husbands at one time or another, she gets herself a respectable laugh with “Everyone is special in the eyes of the Lord, even a dirty whore like you” and then an extraspecial one with “Lord, all men are equal in your eyes—but a dirty dyke is another bailgame.” Bricks out of straw, Miss Boylan, and good work. A last question about intended parody. How long can you sustain it unless it has—however foolishly—an interior narrative interest of its own? Think back to “Dames at Sea” and remember that you liked Bernadette Peters and were, in your soft head and secret heart, rooting for her. “Women Behind Bars” goes along for an intermissionless hour and a half at least, by which time you've memorized all the naughty words Sylvia Sidney wasn't permitted to use and are beginning to wonder what R.K.O. or Warner Brothers masterpiece is on television tonight."
Ideas & Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/11/archives/ideas-religion-is-now-an-important-part-of-business.html,"Every Wednesday morning, two groups of Christian laymen meet for breakfast, Bible reading and prayer at the Holiday Inn in High Point, N.C. The meetings are typical of the increasing religious activity among businessmen. Leaders attribute the trend to the work of the Holy Spirit but say Watergate and the recession may have added impetus to the search for religious values. Similar to the spiritual clusters among professional people and government officials, the meetings of business executives range in size from a handful gathered in a private home to several dozen at a motel or club. The groups are predominantly white, Protestant, male and evangelical. Theologically, most groups reflect the conservative view of most of their constituents. Patriotism, trust in the capitalist system and confidence in the rewards of virtue are woven together on the loom of Biblical piety. One critic, noting the homogeniety and affluence of most groups, suggests they are primarily “social functions with a religious veneer.” Jorge Lara‐Braud of the National Council of Churches says, however, “We should not be too cynical about that in a world that offers so few opportunities for the development of communities.” Supporters say the movement is a way of helping America regain its moral looting. They cite these benefits: a deepening of faith, greater moral sensitivity, sounder business judgment and relief from stress. “You don't worry about problems like you did,” says Wade McInnis, president of a High Point, N.C., textile firm and a participant in one of the citv's two dozen prayer groups, double the total of five years ago. “When you're with Christ, someone who can accomplish anything, there is a tremendous release from business tension.” The drift toward Bible study and prayer may mirror a sense of shakiness over economic conditions. Demos Shakarian, the millionaire founder of the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship, the nation's largest prayer breakfast organization with 1,500 chapters and a mailing list of 780,000, says present conditions have prompted many executives to “realize they can't trust material things.” “You must put God first,” says Mr. Shakarian. “When you do, you have peace in your family, and then material things don't seem as important. Men say their judgment improves and their business begins to turn around.” Among many groups there is the tendency to explore the ethical implications of Scripture in greater depth, even to the extent of questioning American values. The Rev. Sam Fore, a United Methodist minister who directs lay institutes for the H. E. Butt Foundation in Texas, says businessmen are increasingly “seeking help in their decision‐making.” Butt institutes include between 300 and 700 lay persons and take up current ethical topics. A recent session in New Orleans discussed abortion, euthanasia, hunger, mysticism and business ethics. The most common satisfactions to participants are intensely private.; “Many, including myself, come away feeling reborn,” says the Rev. Hubert Mitchell who directs an expanding Christians lin Government program in Los Angeles. Moral Footing"
VATICAN'S OFFICES PICKETED IN CAPITAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/12/archives/vaticans-offices-picketed-in-capital.html,"WASHINGTON, May 11 (UPI) — Hundreds of demonstrators, most of them women and members of the National Organization for Women, picketed the offices of the Apostolic Delegation to the United Stales today in a “Mother's Day of Outrage” against the Roman Catholic Church's support of anti‐abortion legislation. The marchers were met by five counterdemonstrators. One of them, a baldish middle‐aged man, was arested by the police on disorderly conduct charges for shouting obscenities at the National Organization of Women group. The police later identified him as James A. Miller of Bowie, Md. The police said there were 500 to 800 persons in the chanting, sign‐carrying crowd. SAN DIEGO, May 11 (UPI)—Members of the National Organization for Women held a “bell, hook and candle” ceremony here today to protest action by the Roman Catholic diocese last month that denied the church's sacraments to proabortion members of the organization. The symbolic ceremony at the San Diego Women's Club reversed the ancient church bell, book and candle rite for excommunicating heretics. The candles, instead of being snuffed out, were lighted to call public attention to the church's action, according to to a representative of the women's group."
HIGH COURT BEGINS FINAL RUSH TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/12/archives/high-court-begins-final-rush-today-half-of-years-cases-due-for.html,"WASHINGTON, May 11—The Supreme Court returns to the bench tomorrow for the homestretch drive of the 1974–75 term, with nearly half its cases for the year still to be decided. The Justices, who normally do not sit for more than two weeks at a time, are scheduled to be in session for the next six weeks without interruption. and it may take 10 days beyond that to clear the Court's calendar for the year. As of today, the high court had announced decisions in 81 cases since convening early last October. In addition, 72 cases have been argued but no decision announced. Normally, the Justices rule on every case they have heard before adjourning for the summer. Potentially, the dominant case before the high court involves capital punishment and raises the prospect that the death penalty could be reinstated or found unconstitutional under all circumstances. A number of Court observers believe, however, that this decision will hinge on a narrow interpretation of a ruling by the North Carolina Supreme Court and leave unaltered the 1972 Supreme Court decision that capital punishment was unconstitutional as then administered by the states because its application was erratic and freakish. Another major pending case involves the question of whether patients committted to state mental institutions have a constitutional right to treatment that might improve their condition or, conversely, whether states may provide only custodial care. If the Supreme Court should sustain the lower‐court ruling that a right to treatment exists, the financial impact on state mental institutions could be vast. Antitrust Cases Before they adjourn, the Justices are also scheduled to rule on three antitrust cases involving professional price‐fixing—by lawyers in real estate transactions, by brokers in setting fees for stock purchase and sale and by mutual fund salesmen in limiting sale and exchange of shares. The brokerage case may be declared moot—fixed fees were abolished on the stock exchange on May 1—but decisions in the other areas could introduce competition into significant consumer areas. Among other questions that the high court is expected to answer in the next six or seven weeks are these: ¶Can inner‐city slum‐dwellers successfully challenge zoning laws that exclude them from suburban housing by making its cost prohibitively high? ¶Can the Federal Government establish minimum wage and overtime standards for state and city employes, particularly firemen and policemen? ¶Can employers who have discriminated on the basis of race in hiring and promotion be required to provide back pay to the victims of such discrimination? ¶Can a newspaper editor be convicted of a crime for publishing an advertisement for abortion services that are illegal in his state but legal in the state of the advertiser? During the next six weeks, the Justices will not hear arguments on any cases, but will take the bench only to announce decisions. Each Monday they will also announce which cases, among the thousands seeking review, will be argued and decided during the 1975–76 term."
Minority Legislators in Albany Offer Hiring Plan for Construction Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/14/archives/minority-legislators-in-albany-offer-hiring-plan-for-construction.html,"ALBANY, May 13—Charging that the state was moving tool slowly in developing an affirmative action plan for hiring minority group members on state‐aided construction projects, members of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus today offered their own proposal for increasing such hiring. The proposal, presented to Governor Carey last Friday, a a meeting in his New York City office, calls for creating an office of contract compliance in the executive department with power to set goals and timetables for increasing minority hiring. The plan calls for increasing the number of blacks, Spanishsurnamed Americans, Orientals, American Indians and womer in all the construction trades with contracts for state projects. The plan would be in effect for five years and would attempt to increase the number of minorities working on such projects to their percentage in the population of a particular geographic area. Speedy Action Promised Senator Carl McCall, Democrat of Manhattan, who outlined the proposal of the 20‐member caucus at a news conference here, said that at meeting on Jan. 28 the Governor had promised speedy action on development of an affirmative action plan. “We won't hide the fact that we were deeply disappointed with the delay,” he said. He noted that the Governor had been tied up with many other pressing problems but added that “the need for some definitive program in this area is crucial.” Senator Robert Garcia, who heads the labor committee of the caucus, noted that the Governor had appointed a task force to develop an affirmative action plan. On the task force are Bernard Jackson, an assistant to the Governor. Industrial Commissioner Louis L. Levine and Human Rights Commissioner Werner Kramarsky. Mr. Jackson, who heads the task force, said in a telephone interview from his New York City office that the caucus's proposal was a “pretty good document.” Proposal to Be Studied He said that the proposal would have to be “studied in detail to see what the ramifications of each line are.” The proposal would empower the Governor's counsel, who would oversee the operations of the Contract Compliance Office, to withhold payment or cancel contracts with companies that were not complying with the affirmative action plan, and to direct that the state not enter into further contracts with such companies. Mr. Jackson said that at the Friday meeting the Governor had agreed to have New York City's affirmative action plan, known as Executive Order 71, ecover construction projects in the city being built for the State Dormitory Authority. He noted that one such project, the construction of they North Academic Center at City College, had been shut down after a local community group, the Manhattan North Coalition, charged that the Dormitory Authority had broken an agreement to have at least 50 per cent minority representation on the project. Mr. Jackson said that the group was demanding that half the minority workers come through the coalition, and that while more than 40 per cent of the workers were black or Puerto Rican, the group was going to continue its demonstrations. About 150 blacks and Hispanics blocked efforts to resume work at the City College construction project yesterday and vowed to return this morning. However, a spokesman for the Dormitory Authority said work would be resumed today. The protesters formed a picket line at 9 A.M. at the ,Manhattan building site at Convent Avenue near 138th Street, (where they were joined by some City College students. They dispersed at 4 P.M. Other action here included the following: INSURANCE SUPERINTENDENT Governor Carey has quietly designated John P. Gemma as Acting Superintendent cf Insurance to replace Lawrence W. Keepnews, who died last month. Mr. Gemma was a deputy superintendent of the department. S.I.C. APPOINTMENT Governor Carey announced the appointment of the former New York City Department of Investigation Commissioner, Robert K. Ruskin, as a member of the State Investigation Commission at a salary of $32,465 a year. Mr. Ruskin, a Republican, is chairman of the Federal Courts Committee of the State Bar Association. MENTAL HYGIENE The Deputy Majority Leader, William T. Conklin, RepublicanConservative of Brooklyn, whose bill creating an office for the mentally retarded in the executive department was vetoed by the Governor, asked that Mr. Carey withdraw the nomination of Dr. Lawrence C. Kolb as commissioner of the Department of Mental Hygiene. Senator Conklin said in a letter to the Governor that “Dr. Kolb, while a distinguished researcher, is not an administrator, and, very frankly, is a product of the very system which he is expected to reform.” ABORTION RIGHTS After a sharp debate, the Senate passed, 34‐to‐24, a bill that would allow hospitals and their staff members to refuse to aid in abortions if they had conscientious scruples. “Absolutely unconstitutional,” said Senator Carol Bellamy, a Democrat of Brooklyn. The United States Supreme Court had decided what abortion rules would be, she said. Allowing individuals to decline to help in an abortion was one thing, said aother opponent, Senator‐ Karen Burstein, Democrat of Lawrence, L.I. “But to give the right to say ‘no’ to an absolutely impersonal institution is absolutely unconscionable.”"
New Role for Mrs. Giscard: Husband's Unofficial Envoy,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/15/archives/new-role-for-mrs-giscard-husbands-unofficial-envoy.html,"Shortly before Anne‐Aymone Giscard d'Estaing set out on her current, semiprivate, semiofficial visit to the United States without her husband, the French newspaper Le Monde analyzed to its usual fare‐thee‐well the role of Presidential wife. By sending her out alone on national conferences and on overseas trips, is President Valery Giscard d'Estaing assigning her a political duty? Is he cracking cherished French republican tradition and embarking on “an era of dynasties”? Le Monde seemed to be concerned that he might, as it drew the inevitable comparisons between the Giscards and the Kennedys. “The hostess of the Elysee cannot be a Jackie Kennedy,” Le Monde asserted. Observing Mrs. Giscard as she moves through the rituals of her four‐day visit to New York and Washington—blessing the New York City Ballet and its “Hommage a Ravel” festival, and touring Memorial Sloan‐Kettering Cancer Center with Happy Rockefeller as she did here yesterday, having tea with Betty Ford as she will in Washington today—one concludes that the GiscardKennedy parallels are not close enough for Le Monde to worry about. At 42, Anne‐Aymone Giscard d'Estaing is a fragile‐looking brunette with a reserved manner that breaks into a dazzling smile. Her personal passions seem to be those shared by French and American aristocrats — those rather English fondnesses for flowers, horses, long weekends and other sojourns in the country—as well as a proficiency in sports, particularly skiing. Friends ascribe sonic of her past shyness to extreme myopia and a vanity about being seen wearing eyeglasses. Some say one reason she has blossomed in the political spotlight is that she discovered contact lenses shortly before her husband ran for president last year. Whatever the cause, Mrs. Giscard cherishes her privacy and seems determined to maintain it. She still goes shopping alone and walks her aging cocker spaniel, Bambou, in the Bois de Boulogne alone. “Why shouldn't I? Who would want to kill me? Kidnap me? Perhaps. But if want to go into the Bois, no one knows in advance, so they can't make any preparations,” she said yesterday in an interview at the French Consulate where she has stayed since her arrival last Monday. With a slightly testy edge to her soft voice, she commented in fluent English on the “concern for my security in New York.” Right at the heels of her spectator pumps are one or more French security agents, distinguishable from their American counterparts by the Cardin‐ish flare of their suits. Life seems freer in Paris because the French First Family continue to live in their apartment in the Rue Benouville, near the Bois in the fashionable 16th arrondissement. The excuse for using the Elysée Palace as an office is that it has too few bedrooms to accommodate family of four children. The Giscard children are: ValérieAnne, 21, who works for the Secretary of State for Culture: Henri, 18, who studying political science; Louis. 16, and Jacinte (which means hyacinth), 15. The two younger children attend private high schools in Paris. The daughters were christened botanically, according to maternal family tradition. Valérie‐Anne is a play on the herb valerian. Mrs. Giscard's name is word play on anemone, a flower she doesn't particularly admire because lacks a scent. In 1952, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, then a precocious, 26‐year‐old inspector in the Finance Ministry, sent anemones and poetry to 19‐year‐old Anne‐Aymone de Brantes, who was of a titled, military and landowning family. He had met her recently and would marry her at Christmastime. She was taking courses in bilingual secretarial skills and art history. Mrs. Giscard acknowledged yesterday that she “regretted” not having a university education, “but I'm from another generation.” “My mother didn't think it was necessary. Today every girl must have training, so that she can be able to support herself. She can't ask for equality with men if she is not independent,” she said. Mrs. Giscard has been nudged into public duties as a proponent of women's rights. Although she is a devout Catholic and her younger sister, Marguerite, is a prioress in a Benedectine nunnery in Senegal, Mrs. Giscard firmly supports recent legislative changes on birth control. Abortion and the sale of contraceptives have been legalized during her husband's administration. On abortion: “Every woman normally feels great revulsion toward abortion, but one had to see the fact that many women did seek it. The women who were richest could have their abortions abroad where it was legal. The only victims were women who had no money. It was very unjust. Society ought to make conditions so that women would desire to have their children.” On contraception: “It's a private, moral matter everyone should decide for herself. Those whose ethics or religion do not forbid it must be allowed to have it. It's the best way to prevent abortion.” The new law on contraceptive sales removes the requirement of parental permission for those under 18. “Of course, that sounds terrible,” she said, “but I don't suppose any girl dared ask her parents so the problem stayed.” The Government bill for liberalizing divorce in the direction of mutual consent is coming up for debate soon. Present law demands proof of wrongdoing by one party. “It would be progress to find a new way where there would be no feeling of guilt,” Mrs. Giscard said. “No one feels successful when you have to divorce.” Her oldest brother, Paul, the Marquis de Brantes, married a divorced American Suzanne Solomon Cardozo, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Harry A. Solomon of New York. Her younger brother, Guy, 37, an investment counselor, has lived here since 1965. His wife, the former Marina Boissevain, is a member of a Huguenot family that fled from France to The Netherlands in the 17th century. Marina de Brantes, chairman of the New York City Ballet Ravel festival, invited Mrs. Giscard here to attend the benefit last night. In her pre‐presidential era, Mrs. Giscard enjoyed the luxury of not caring too much about fashion. She preferred sweater and skirt simplicity and ordered all of her formal clothes from one couturier, Jean‐Louis Scherrer. Now she must act as an ambassadress of the haute couture, with a wardrobe from Dior, Courreges, Givenchy and Chanel as well. “Thank goodness, though,” she commented about the decline of fashion importance. “It was one way of keeping women in a very silly condition,” she said. ‘Every woman normally feels great revulsion toward abortion, but one had to see the fact that many women did seek it.’"
Doctor's Conviction In an Abortion Case Is Upheld in Boston,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/16/archives/doctors-conviction-in-an-abortion-case-is-upheld-in-boston.html,"BOSTON, May 15 — Judge James P. McGuire denied today a request by Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin that he overturn a jury's conviction of the doctor in an abortion‐related manslaughter case. Dr. Edelin, who thus lost the first round in what is expected to be a long appeal process, had asked the judge, who originally heard the case in Suffolk County Superior Court, to overturn the verdict on the ground that it had been against the weight of the evidence. His attorney, William P. Homans said that he would continue the appeal process to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Dr. Edelin said that he was “disappointed.” Dr. Edelin was convicted last Feb. 15 of manslaughter of a male fetus in connection with a legal abortion he performed at Boston City Hospital. He was sentenced to one year's probation. The case had strong political and religious overtones. Antiabortion groups applauded the prosecution and conviction while women's rights advocates protested. The jurors were predominantly members of the Roman Catholic Church, which has strong teachings against abortion. Church officials, however, criticized news coverage that mentioned the religious affiliation of the jurors. During the trial, a key issue was at what point the fetus became a person. Newman A. Flanagan, the prosecutor, entered into evidence a picture of the fully formed fetus, which, members of the jury said later, made a deep emotional impression. The defense argued in its ap peal, entered two weeks ago, that the conviction had been against the weight of the evidence presented during the six‐week‐long trial. Judge McGuire denied the motion to overturn in a courtroom session lasting only a few minutes this afternoon."
Doctors at Pendleton Act To Bar Refugee Epidemic,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/18/archives/doctors-at-pendleton-act-to-bar-refugee-epidemic-trailers-for.html,"CAMP PENDLETON, Calif., May 17—Public health and military doctors, satisfied that the sudden influx of Vietnamese refugees posed no public health threat to Americans, are intensifying efforts to treat the personal medical needs of the Vietnamese and to protect them from infections that often become epidemic among people living in crowded, drab conditions. Last night 18,306 Vietnamese refugees, who are awaiting security clearances to enter the country, slept on cots—16 to a tent—at the northwest corner of this larine camp. About one‐third were under the age of 15 years. When they woke up this morning, the skies were overcast, the weather unfamiliarly chilly and the ground dry. By midmorning, the sun was break ing through the clouds. The rainy season starts just about now in Saigon, where temperalutes average 85 with clear mornings, heavy afternoon and evening downpours, and balmy, ?? nights. At Pendleton today sanitation inspectors tested the water supplies from wells and storage laths for bacterial contamination, periodically emptied the latrine, trapped insects to ?? disease‐bearing species, picked up trash to keep away rodents and other animals, and adminished cigarette smokers about the hazard of setting the tent camp ablaze. Marines said they were reluctant to put space heaters in the tents because of their potential as a fire hazard. But there are electrically heated trailers where mothers can spend the night with their babies. Meanwhile, Medical personnel have set up clinics to immunize children against measles, German measles, polio, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. In Quonset huts that have been converted into outpatient dispensaries, Navy doctors. aided by Vietnamese physicians, issued contraceptives and treated such diverse conditions as skin rashes, mild diarrhea, colds, allergic reactions to injections of drugs, asthmatic attacks and animal bites. Medical corpsmen walk through each of the seven tent areas to aid any person who is either too ill or reluctant to walk to a dispensary for care. Seventeen miles to the south across this hilly base, 128 Vietnamese were in the PendleOn Naval Hospital receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, asthma, heart conditions, arthritis, kidney and venereal diseases, cancer and childbirth disorders. At the same time, Public Health Service doctors, determined not to let routine medical tests required by Federal regulations delay the refugees from obtaining immigrant visas, have set up screening centers to test lungs for tuberculosis and blood for syphilis. Earlier, the Public Health Service temporarily waived such examinations to let an unspecified number of refugees enter the country with their sponsors. Meanwhile, military officials In Washington are debating whether to grant requests from Vietnamese women for first trimester abortions. The overwhelming majority of the Vietnamese at this camp appeared healthy. And while the children played and their parents lined up to drop coins into telephones to call sponsors and friends about job applica. tions, the marines and Government officials strove to prevent an outbreak of shigella dysen?? or other condition from developing through contamination of food and water or through person‐to‐person contact. “By now, most cases of serious disease hale beer weeded out.” Capt JeanJacques Gunning of the Navy Trailers for Mothers Screening for Disease said in an interview as he visited a dispensary. But Captain Gunning, a specialist in internal medicine, who heads the refugees' medical care here, added: “My ongoing concern Is enforcing good sanitation practices because that's our most important medical operation. An outbreak of diarrhea would break our backs and an outbreak of shigella [dysentery] or food‐borne disease would wipe us out.” Dr. William H. Foege, the epidemiologist who heads the Public Health Service's role in the refugee program, said in telephone interview from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta: “Our No. 1 problem is having the Vietnamese stop at Guam.” He went on: “We've shown that this group of people is coming in with no more than the amount of disease you would expect from other aliens. But when you put people for extended periods under tent conditions, you are asking for more disease problems. “These won't be the serious quarantineable or exotic diseases but the respiratory and intestinal infections—personal health problems, not public health threats—that could be prevented if you could keep people moving, out of the camps. “At Guam, we have limited water and sewage capabilities. We shouldn't run into those problems in the three camps in the U.S. because we could open a fourth or fifth camp.” Many young women who had to leave Saigon suddenly have run out of birth control pills, creating additional anxieties beyond those associated with evacuation from a native land to a strange country. Dr. Nguyen Ngoc Giep, who was professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Saigon and who learned his specialty in Philadelphia, has given prenatal care to at least 90 pregnant women in the camp. He said that he had also received requests for contraceptives “at least twice day” from women who visit his clinic here. “Contraception is a major concern of the majority of women here and we need help” from family planning agencies, said Dr. Giep, who is a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He added that the women were concerned “with planning ahead.” “With conditions here, people are not very much concerned with sex,” he said. Dr. Giep said that about two women a day have requested first trimester abortions. “I would recommend such abortions,” he said. “The majority have several children and the mothers know what the expenses will be of raising families in the United States.” Abortions were not legal in Saigon though they were often done illicitly, Dr. Giep said. When Captain Gunning, the Navy doctor, was asked if the abortions would be done at Pendleton, he said he had referred the matter to higher officials. About 100 Vietnamese doctors are among the refugees and many have volunteered to translate and to care for patients at other dispensaries throughout the tent areas. Measles have probably been the most common infection that doctors have treated here. But the measle shots given to Vietnamese children as they arrived on American territory have virtually stopped the spread of the viral disease, according to Public Health Service officials. Military officials opened the seventh floor of the newly constructed Pendleton Naval Hospital to house the sick Vietnamese patients. “Fortunately, very few are sick,” said Lieut. Comdr. John Edwards, an infectious disease specialist.. Many people, including doctors, feared that tuberculosis would be a major public health problem among the Vietnamese. But the Public Health Service reported yesterday that of the first 16,199 refugees who had chest X‐rays. 215 had findings that raised suspicions of tuberculosis and active tuberculosis ‐ had been diagnosed in just 12 of these patients. Three of the 12 were Americans evacuated with the refugees. Though the tests indicated the X‐ray findings were not due to tuberculosis, the physicians still had to solve the mystery of what caused the abnormalities. Under the circumstances, Navy doctors said they were perplexed as to how extensively they should investigate such medical problems. When the refugees first arrived, the doctors were told that Pendleton would be a relay point and that the refugees would leave almost immediately. Accordingly, the physicians limited their medical work to what could be done quickly. However, as policies were reversed and bureaucratic problems kept the Vietnamese here longer than expected, the doctors have begun to deal with the patients' less serious medical problems. But doctors such as Lieut. Comdr. Michael H. Weisman, a Navy internist, ask. “Who is going to follow up [medical??] on what we've started?” Guam Stop Poses Problem Vietnamese Doctors Assist"
Norman Lear—Daring The Sitcom Audience,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/18/archives/norman-leardaring-the-sitcom-audience-norman-leardaring-the-sitcom.html,"Los ANGELES On a recent morning Norman Lear, a distinguishedlooking man in his early 50's with a neatly trimmed fringe of silvery hair and sad eyes the washed‐out blue of his jean seats, glanced at the weekly Nielsen ratings list that enumerated TV's most‐popular shows and began circling the numbers beside the ones he produced—two ... three ... five ... seven ... nine. He looked up over gold half‐frame reading glasses perched on the tip of his nose at the visitor in his office and said with mock solemnity: “This is an historic moment you're witnessing. The first time we've had five of the top 10 shows.” Then he raised a fist in an equally theatrical fit of resolution and said through clenched teeth: “Some day, some day five out of five!” Lear's routine deliberately played off his least favorite sobriquet, King Lear, as well as a recent Bob Hope quip: “We can all be proud of TV and its owner, Norman Lear.” popular shows and began circling the numbers beside the ones he produced—two ... three ... five ... seven ... nine. He looked up over gold half‐frame reading glasses perched on the tip of his nose at the visitor in his office and said with mock solemnity: “This is an historic moment you're witnessing. The first time we've had five of the top 10 shows.” Then he raised a fist in an equally theatrical fit of resolution and said through clenched teeth: “Some day, some day five out of five!” Lear's routine deliberately played off his least favorite sobriquet, King Lear, as well as a recent Bob Hope quip: “We can all be proud of TV and its owner, Norman Lear.” Lear had little time to exult in the ratings—he has little time to do anything superfluous these days. His daily calendar reads like a busy commuter train schedule, requiring his attendance at a whirlwind round of script readings, camera blockings, cast runthroughs, dress rehearsals and final tapings that frequently take place at the same hour in widely separated parts of the city. Starting with the groundbreaking “All in the Family” series in 1971, Lear has become television's most successful independent producer —and inasmuch as virtually all of the prime‐time programs on the three networks are created by independents, who are the real “stars” of television, Hope's jibe was only tinged with hyperbole. Of Lear's five top‐ranking shows that week, three (“Maude,” “The Jeffersons” and “Good Times”) are direct linear descendants of “All in the Family.” And in addition to those CBS offerings, Lear's company produces “Sanford and Son” for NBC, which ranked second on the Nielsen that week, and “Hot L Baltimore” for ABC, which lagged behind on the listings and would soon be canceled by the network after a halfseason's run. Ironically, Lear's main problem these days is the enormous success of his shows, all of which attempt a similar mix of humor, social relevance and identifiable characters in a half‐hour situation ‐ comedy format. This year he branched out into other areas, producing a pilot for a daily afternoon drama that gently satirized soap operas and another for a prime‐time series called “Hereafter,” a fantasy about three aging club musicians from Fresno who sell their souls to the devil's mod son in return for a year's grace as youthful rock stars. Neither has been picked up by a network, and Lear thinks he knows why. “We've done some successful realistic comedies,” he explained, “and now everyone has to do realistic comedies, including us.” • The other problem facing Lear a scant three days before he and his family were supposed to take off on a long‐delayed Mexican vacation was a more pressing one. He was about to go into production on yet another pilot for a prime‐time series, this one called “Three to Get Ready,” about a 34‐year‐old woman who walks out on her husband in Clinton, Ind., and moves to Indianapolis, where, along with her teen‐age daughter and an unmarried neighbor, she confronts all the perils of a young woman living on her own in this day and age. The trouble was that Lear had just read the script for the pilot and was not at all pleased with it At the moment he was asking Joan Darling, the director of the projected series, whether she thought they ought to go ahead with the pilot after all. “There are a lot of things said consolingly. “The teenage dialogue, for one. I figure any show that has a line like ‘the flu sucks’ can't be all bad.” A few minutes later several other people associated with the project gathered in Lear's office to audition a young actor named Bill Vint for the role of the abandoned husband. After the actor left the room, everyone around the table looked at Lear. “The trouble with him is that he's just not a funny man.” Lear said after some reflection. “He doesn't have curve in him. There's just nothing surprising about his moves.” • Although he supervises every aspect of his shows—from the business negotiations to script revisions to direction down to the minutiae of promotion—casting is perhaps his special genius. To take one example among many, CBS executives pleaded with Lear not to use Jimmie Walker, a previously little‐known standup comic, in the role of J.J. on “Good Times,” because they felt he was so physically unappealing that no one could relate to him. Lear insisted, however, and the 23‐year‐old Walker, with his “Dyn‐o‐mite” delivery, quickly became a TV‐cult figure and the star of the show. One of Lear's standard compliments is to say of someone, “He has a wet face,” meaning a certain air of vulnerability, the stamp of concern working through facial muscles. Bill Vint, with his smooth, Marlboro‐Man look, clearly did not qualify. Lear himself is the original wetface, and this accounts for the value he places on social relevance in his shows. He sees his shows as two‐act “idea plays,” and it is not surprising that his favorite writer is George Bernard Shaw (“I could read ‘Major Barbara’ every afternoon of my life”). According to a list drawn up by his publicist, some of the touchy issues Lear has explored on his shows are: homosexuality, the high cost of dying, impotency, blockbusting, sexual equality, menopause, gun control, wife swapping, rape, gambling, old age, breast cancer, abortion, mental retardation, smoking, teen‐age alcoholism and speed traps. Next year Lear, who prides himself on being able to present any issue tastefully, will attempt television's equivalent of a triple somersault with a jackknife: a situation That decision was made at a late afternoon meeting Lear held with Lou Derman, the story editor of “All in the Family,” to review ideas for next season. “Can we find a way to do it without copping out?” Lear asked. “Maybe we can have the relatives agree to it and then let the audience know they're not sure they made the right decision.” Lear then added, “By the way, Lou, next year I would like to declare that Irene Lorenzo [the Bunkers' next door neighbor] is a widow. Let's ignore the fact that there was an actor playing her husband two years ago.” “Yeah,” Derman said, “we could Just insert a line saying isn't it great how she's bearing up.” “I'd like to have her fall in love with a priest over three or four shows,” Lear continued, “and then do one show that really dealt with the subject of this man's feelings for her.” “Yeah,” Derman said. “make him a pretty goodlooking guy so we'd understand how Irene could fall for him. Could be a great story.” “But more than a story, Lou,” Lear admonished. “For a lot of people it's a real problem” As Lear read over the list of story ideas, Derman occasionally handed him the newspaper clipping that had originally suggested, or at least supported, a particular episode. An “All in the Family” show that would examine the issue of illegal aliens was accompanied by an article on the subject. “It's headline stuff in New York,” Derman said. Lear looked skeptical. “Do we have a position on illegal aliens?” he asked. “I just haven't thought about it much.” Many of the story ideas, however, were based on personal experiences. One, for example, was suggested by an incident that had actually occurred to Derman. It had Archie receiving a pornographic movie from a friend as payment on an old debt; unknowingly, Edith starts to show it to her women's club and gets arrested in the process. “Let's have one of the women suggest they keep on watching the movie,” Lear said, “and Edith will support her right to do it.” “You know how Edith is about sex, Norman,” Derman cautioned. “The coffee cup rattles. She'd probably walk out.” “No, she wouldn't,” Lear said. “She wouldn't watch it herself, but she wouldn't walk out. She'd never risk offending a live human being for the sake of a piece of celluloid. We've established that in a hundred different situations.” A great many of Lear's ideas spring from his own close‐knit family. He has two teen‐age daughters who are always feeding him lines like “you gross me out” and “that dress makes me barf,” to mention two that turned up in the script for the “Three to Get Ready” pilot. His wife, Frances, runs an executive placement service for women and has helped make Lear conscious of his own subtly sexist attitudes. Not long ago, when Lear had occasion to make out a will, Frances pointed out that men are always attaching conditions to the money they leave behind in an unconscious effort to keep some control over their wives. The incident quickly became the basis for a “Maude” episode. • The day following my first talk with Lear he stayed at home rewriting the pilot script. Working in a comfortable study lined with personal mementos and stacks of books he hopes one day to find the time to read, Lear recited the revisions onto a tape cassette which his secretary later transcribed. It is a method that allowed him to rework the 57‐page script almost totally in one day. By the time be finished, at 3 A.M. Friday, he had tightened the script's narrative structure, defined the characters more sharply and provided some witty, risqué dialogue as well as a new second act that gave the projected series a much stronger woman's‐consciousness theme. In general, Lear maintains fairly cordial relations with CBS's ever‐vigilant Program Practices Department. As a veteran TV comedy writer (for the “Colgate Comedy Hour” and the “Martha Raye Show” among others), he has been in the business long enough to know its limitations only too well. What disagreements arise almost never concern the over‐all subject matter of his shows but rather the “taste” of individual lines, generally those with sexual or religious innuendos. The script for the first “All in the Family” show was not approved by the network censor until the very last moment; the sticking point — one that Lear eventually won—was never the dozen racial and ethnic slurs Archie Bunker avails himself of, but an incredulous remark he makes when he comes home from church to find an amorous Mike and Gloria ready to repair to their bedroom: “Eleven o'clock on a Sunday morning!” In terms of subject matter, Lear's shows are allowed to be as controversial as they are in part because they are not really about the issues they raise, not primarily. They are about families. Five of his six shows are literally family shows and the sixth, “Hot L Baltimore,” sets out to demonstrate that even such disparate types as gather together under that particular roof come to constitute a kind of family, too. That sort of family‐of‐man theme would have been untenable throughout the sixties, when the differences among us were so much in evidence as to seem insurmountable. It harks back to the fifties and other periods in American life when there really seemed to be a national consensus — not to mention coherent family values—that bound us together. And so there is a curious element of nostalgia on these television shows celebrated for their contemporaneity. Both the title and the opening theme song of “All in the Family”—“Those Were the Days”—betray a longing for simpler times. Below the surface controversy, much that happens on Lear's shows (and because of him on half the other shows on primetime television, ripoffs of his spinoffs) pulls in an opposite direction. Even though someone is always yelling “Fire!” (or “Rape!” or “Alcoholism!” or “Hornocexuality!”) the underlying message is one of comfort and reconciliation. Recently, I caught a rerun of a “Maude” episode in which John Wayne makes a brief guest appearance. Throughout the program. Maude, the embodiment of suburban liberalism, is the only one not going ga‐ga at Wayne's impending visit to her house. When he finally arrives, Maude becomes fighting mad at an anti‐feminist crack he makes, but as soon as she gets close to him, she too melts in his presence. “Oh, hell,” Maude says, holding out her arms to Wayne, “let's dance.” • Like his shows, Lear is a great reconciler, a man with an uncanny ability to turn everyone into “family.” The people around him sometimes seem like characters in a Norman Lear situation comedy, literally “supporting” members of a cast. When he came into his office the next morning to read over the revised pilot script, his diminutive Chinese‐American secretary immediately planted a kiss on his baid crown. “I really enjoyed transcribing this, Norman,” she said. Halfway through the manuscript, when he discovered a typo, Lear yelled out to her. “One more mistake like this, Jedi, and it's back to the laundry.” A few minutes later, Al Burton, the company's director of new projects, stuck his head into Lear's office and said: “I can't believe what you did, Norman. It's sensational! It reads like a stage play.” At that point, Joan Darling appeared on the scene. “I laughed the whole time I was reading the script,” she said. Allan Manings, who had written the script Lear revised (“Pride of authorship is not one of our concern around here,” Manings had said earlier), seemed equally enthusiastic, and the decision was made there and then to go ahead with the project. Since Lear was leaving for Mexico the next day, the rest of the afternoon was spent frantically looking through a casting book to find actors to fill all the roles in the pilot. But with the key decision made, the group was in a holiday mood. Just before it broke up, Lear said, “Let me show you my favorite situation ‐ comedy cliché.” He walked out of his office, opened the door a notch, stuck his head in, furtively looked both ways and called out. “Dart‐lingt. I'm ho‐orne.” Everyone erupted into peals of canned laughter. ‘Like his shows, Lear is a great reconciler.’"
Member of Fetal Research Panel Objects to Some Proposal,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/21/archives/member-of-fetal-research-panel-objects-to-some-proposals.html,"WASHINGTON, May 20—A national commission appraising research involving the human fetus has made recommendations that would sacrifice “the interests of innocent human life to a postulated social need,” one of the commissioners charged in a dissenting statement made public today. The commissioner, Dr. David W. Louisell, said he voiced his dissent with regret because there was significant good in the commission's report. Dr. Louisell is Elizabeth Josselyn Boalt Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. Although his objections pertained to several of the commission's recommendations, much of the statement was devoted to two of them. These would permit, under some circumstances, research involving a fetus that was scheduled for abortion and fetal research done during the abortion procedure. The commission's findings, conclusions and recommendations on fetal research are to be delivered to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare tomorrow. The recommendations allow the possibility that some research, not permissible with a fetus to be carried to term, might be permitted on a fetus that was to be aborted. Dr. Louisell objected to that inequality of treatment and to potentially harmful research on an individual who could not give informed consent. “The good in much of the report cannot blind me to its departure from our society's most basic moral commitment: the essential equality of all human beings,” said Dr. Louisell. “For me the lessons of history are too poignant, and those of this century too fresh, to ignore another violation of human integrity and autonomy by subjecting unconsenting human beings, whether or not viable, to harmful research even for laudable scientific purposes.” Whether or not nontherapeutic research on the human fetus is permissible is one of the key political, social and ethical issues faced today by medical scientists and the Government agencies that support research. Nontherapeutic research is any research not intended to aid the individual directly involved even though its objective may be better health for persons of that same group or category. Dr. Louisell is one of 11 members of a national commission for the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research. The cornmission was established by Congress last year and directed to determine the conditions, if any, under which research involving the living human fetus is suitable for support by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The law that established the commission and set the fetal research issue as its first task also put a temporary ban on, support or conduct of nontherapeutic fetal research by the department. The commission recommended that the moratorium be lifted immediately, asserting that it has been interpreted so broadly by the scientific community that virtually all fetal research in the Unite States has been brought to a halt. Dr. Louisell dissented from the recommendation that the ban be lifted and from a recommendation that research on abortion techniques continue to the extent permitted by existing law and Government regulation. Much of Dr. Louisell's dissent was directed at recommendations numbered 5 and 6 in, the commission's list of 13. These leave to a nationall ethical review body, not yet appointed, decisions on whether some nontherapeutic research studies on the fetus during or before abortion are permissible. The commission's recommendation number 5 stated: “Nontherapeutic research directed toward the fetus in anticipation of abortion may be conducted or supported by the Secretary, D.H.E.D., provided such research is carried out within the guidelines for all other nontherapeutic research directed toward the fetus ?? utero. Such research presenting special problems related to the interpretation of application of these guidelines may be conducted or supported by the Secretary, D.H.E.W., provided such research has been approved by a national ethical review body.” Recommendation number 6 sets specific requirements for nontherapeutic research directed toward the fetus during the abortion procedure of involving “the non‐viable fetus ex‐utero” (after removal from the womb). The requirements include informed consent by the mother, absence of objection by the father, assurance that the research objective is important and cannot be met by any alternative means and the reqiuirement that the fetus involved be of less than 20 weeks gestational age. The recommendation also requires that no significant changes be introduced into the abortion procedure in the interest of research alone and that “no intrusion into the fetus is made which alters the duration of life.”"
Giscard Conquers Alsatian Village,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/21/archives/giscard-conquers-alsatian-village.html,"PARIS, May 20 — Guess who dropped in for dinner tonight? Why, Valdry Giscard d'Estaing—again. The President of France, who has broken bread with famous chefs, movie stars, truck drivers, picture framers, garage owners and garbage collectors, celebrated his first year of a “relaxed presidency” by invising a whole Alsatian village to sup with him. Every one of the 48 votes cast by the inhabitants of Ringeldorf last May 19 in the presidential run‐off went to the patrician Mr. Giscard d'Estaing. Their reward tonight was pate de foie gras, ham in a pastry crust, frozen meringue and local wines and champagne shared with the chief of state and his wife in the hamlet's only cafe. The Ringeldorfers, whom the world ignored until now, were in a tizzy. Beer Poster Vanishes Lights twinkled over scoured streets, petunias and geraniums bloomed in every window box, the beer ad in the Cafe Bellevue was hastily replaced with the official presidential portrait borrowed from the town hall. Journalists swarmed, outnumbering by far the village's 69 souls. The mayor, the constable and Antoinette Muckensturm, the owner of the cafe, Were suffering terminal stage fright. Meanwhile, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing made sure that the rest of France also had its eye on him. In a previously taped telecast, he guided the nation tonight through the Elysee Palace, a behind‐thescenes view of the presidential dwelling and its occupants reminiscent in part of Jacqueline Kennedy's televised White House tour in 190?? He granted two television interviews as well this week. Tomorrow, in another break With tradition, he will lunch with and answer questions from 210 members of the press. The newspapers are busy assessing the substance as Well as the innovative, unstuffy style of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's first 12 months in office. On the plus side is a modern abortion law that sup panted punitive statutes dating back half a century; the lowering of the voting age to 18; better relations With Europe and the United States; granting a full year's salary to laid‐off workers; the end of political censorship of films and television, and improved legislation on women's rights. The President has asked for a “grace period” of 500 days to accomplish his reforms and estimates that three‐quarters of the reforms have already been achieved. Promised, but facing heavy opposition, are heavier taxes on wealth, including capital gains and excess profits; a “no‐fault” divorce law; an opening‐up of the educational structure that would give an equal chance to more students; and legislation to grant employes more say in the factories where they work. At present, France's growing number of unemployed seriously worries the Government and the nation. In a radio interview broadcast Giscard d'Estaing said that the rolls of the jobless had swelled to “a critical threshold“—almost 800,000 people, or 3.5 per cent of the work force. Part‐time workers and new, young additions to the labor market are not counted in that official figure. The French Presiuent noted that his Government had recently given subsidies to industries so that they could expand their activities. He added that in the coming weeks he would take additional steps to provide jobs for the young. He did not spell out the measures, but said if they were “not sufficient, others must be taken.” Mr. Giscard d'Estaing was no more specific on how employment could be stimulated without causing inflation. Tonight's dinner at Ringeldorf and the 80‐minute tele vision program on life at the Elysée Palace were continuing efforts to bring the President “closer to of people,” an avowed aim of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing. By contrast, his two immediate prodecessors, Georges Pompidou and Charles de Gaulle, were haughty figures who created awe in the French. In the televised film, “Elysee Open House, Portraits of a President,” Mr. Giscard d'Estaing was shown playing a favorite ‐tune on the piano, gamboling with his dogs, dining with his family, meeting with the Premier, ordering a meal, reading the French newspapers and The International Herald Tribune, and expounding on his unexepectedly “heavy and demanding” duties. Viewers learned that the “red telephone,” or hot line, was neither red nor a telephone, but a teletype machine through which the French chief of state could reach President Ford or the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, in less than ten minutes. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing disclosed that he was fond of classical music—Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and Haydn—as well as contemporary folk music. All in all, wherever French men and women looked and listened this week, it was impossible not to remember that Valery Giscard d'Estaing was rounding out his first year at France's helm—with six more years of his term to go."

FETAL RESEARCH AVERTS ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/23/archives/fetal-research-averts-abortion-studies-have-led-to-a-test-that-can.html,"Research on fetuses has enabled doctors to prevent an abortion in a case whereit was feared the unborn child was a victim of a debilitating hereditary blood disease known as Coolev's anemia. According to a report in yesterday's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, the doctors were able to tell woman that the child she was carrying would not be affected by the disease. The woman and her husband have one child with Cooley's anemia who will require regular blood transfusions for the rest of her life, and the couple said they would abort the second pregnancy unless they could be assured that the child would not be so affected. The doctors were able to give the couple such assurance using new and still experimental techniques they had developed through studies on fetuses scheduled for abortion. The fetal research also enabled them to learn enough about the development of the fetal blood system so that their test had the best chance of yielding an accurate diagnosis. Four and a half months later the doctors prediction was borne out by the birth of a healthy child. The techniques would also be applicable to diagnosing sickle cell anemia in a fetus at a time when an abortion would still be possible if the fetus was found to have the disease. Research Ban Cited However, the doctors said in an interview yesterday that further refinements of the methods have been all but prevented by the currently legislated ban on fetus research. A Congressionally mandated moratorium now prohibits the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (the source of most funds for medical research) from conducting or supporting research on the living human fetus. A commission called for by Congress reported last month that the moratorium had brought a halt to virtually all fetal research, even research not directly supported by the Government. The commission advised ‐an hnmediate lifting of the moratorium. One of the commissioners dissented on Tuesday with the commission's findings, saying that they would result in the sacrifice of the interests of an innocent human life to a postulated social need. The current journal report of the first successful prenatal diagnosis of a possible inherited blood disease represents the culmination of years of study by tbe authors of the report and others. Until now, prenatal diagnosis has been limited to disorders that could be detected by analysis of fetal skin cells in the amniotic fluid, the liquid that bathes the unborn child in the womb Small amoints of this fluid can be ??? and safely removed by an enlarged hypodermic needle inserted through the woman's abdomen at around the fourth month of pregnancy. Diagnosis Technique However, to “diagnosis inheriteci disorders of the blood in a fetus, it is necessary to obtain a sample of fetal blood. According to their journal report, Dr. Yuet Wai Kan and his colleagues at San Francisco General Hospital found that the same type of needle inserted into the placenta could be used simply and safely to obtain a few drops of fetal blood in 60 to 70 per cent of cases. These tests were performed on women scheduled to undergo abortions. Other doctors have been testing a lighted scope that is inserted through an abdominal incision to obtain a sample of fetal skin or blood. Further studies on fetal blood samples conducted by several researchers, including Dr. Kan and Dr. Haig H. Kazazian of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, demonstrated the feasibility of diagnosing blood abnormalities early in fetal life. The doctors found they were able to define normal and abnormal blood development in the unborn child. Hemogolobin Defect Cooley's anemia, also known as beta — thalassemia, afflicts mainly people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian descent. It is more common on a worldwide basis than sickle cell anemia, which afflicts one in 400 babies born to black Americans, as well as some people of Mediterranean descent. Both clisorders involve abnormalities in the formation of hemoglobin, the substance formed by the red blood cells that carries oxygen to body tissues. The disorders result in anemia and a variety of other complications that greatly shorten the life expectancy of their victims. Dr. Kan said that although the techniques are not yet perfect (for one thing, fetal blood samples cannot be obtained in all cases), he was willing to use his test to help pregnant women who faced the pmspect of bearing a child with Caoley's, or sickle cell anemia."

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/25/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Current economic policy is not only totally insensitive to the waste and suffering of unemployment but stupid as well. For a start, there is neither historical evidence nor adequate theoretical foundation for the fear that monetary accommodation in a slack economy leads to inflation. Every single serious American inflation of this century can be directly traced to war and/or a world commodity boom. The Government has never generated an inflation in peacetime, though fears of doing so have aborted many recoveries since 1937. Today, even the Administration speaks in terms of possible deleterious effects it some imprecise date in the future. Yet the costs of doing nothing are real, and they are now. The callousness and stupidity combine most vividly in the area of intergovernmental finance. We desperately need improved public services, not cuts in the mangy levels now provided. Yet the cities and states, New York City explicitly and the others by extension, are being piously told to “cut costs” as the solution to their present bind. Of course, these costs are mainly payroll costs, which means more people in the (federally funded) unemployment lines. in other words, Secretary Simon is telling us that Washington will happily support any number of people: police, sanitationmen, mechanics, clerks, social workers, but only on the one condition that they not be performing any useful work. The tragedy is not that a rather bush‐league group of policy‐makers neither see nor feel the results of their actions and inactions. it is that they have succeeded in cowing others, including Congress, by branding further stimulation of the wallowing economy irresponsible. But the time to take action is now, not in a year when the long recession will finally be ending whatever is or is not done. No single measure would better combine equity and productive use of public monies right now than a onetime revenue‐sharing allocation to put people to work (or keep them there) providing necessary social services. There is one further point. New funds must not go to increase the salaries of people at work now when so many are without a job. Let the Federal Government hang tough on wage increases for its own workers and limit revenue sharing (the special allocation) to jurisdictions that follow the same guidelines. I doubt that many states and cities will find the restriction unacceptable. PAUL M. HOHENBERG Troy, N. Y., May 17, 1975 Israel's Nuclear Option To the Editor: President Ford's decision to withhold weapons from Israel to pressure her into more concessions may boomerang. Former Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol once hinted (along with Israeli leaders after him) that Israel would be forced to exercise her nuclear option if sufficient conventional arms were not made available to her. Foreign reports of Israeli‐made nuclear‐tipped Jericho ballistic missiles would seem to bear this out. Only steady supply of conventional weapons to Israel will give her an option away from the road to nuclear war in the Middle East. STEVE ARREL Ramat Gan, Israel, May 4, 1975 Egypt's Debt: A Solution To the Editor: The Egyptian President's proposed request for U.S. financial aid to repay Egypt's “large debts to the Soviet Union” offers all three nations some unusual fiscal opportunities. One will recall that when Congress refused to approve, as drafted, the U.S.‐Soviet trade pact (because of Russian restraints on Jewish emigration), the U.S.S.R. stated that it would not settle the reduced (but still rather hefty) balance on its World War II lend‐lease debts. Why not have the United States convey, these unpaid loans—owed by the Russians to us—to the Egyptians? Mr. Sadat could then apply these as credits against his country's obligations to the Kremlin. He is quoted in The Times of May 15 as saying that “the Soviet leaders won't even give me a grace period.” Such a conveyance by the U.S. to the Egyptians would cost us nothing, since our “grace period” to the Russians has long since expired. it would also show goodwill toward Mr. Sadat and a reasonable measure of sympathy. And finally, it would clear many books of worthless debts and worthless promises by less than worthy leaders. HERBERT M. ENGEL Delmar, N.Y., May 16, 1975 Aquino: Manila's Case To the Editor: Your May 7 editorial on the Philippines leaves much to be desired in the way it presents the case of former Senator Benigno Aquino. The former Senator is facing charges of murder, subversion and illegal possession of firearms. He does not want to stand trial, not because he has been the victim of injustice but because he says he will be the victim of injustice. He has questioned the validity of the military court trying him and contends that being a politician he should be accused only of political crimes. Meanwhile, certain state witnesses have died under mysterious circumstances, prompting the Government to institute proceedings for the perpetuation of evidence against him. Aquino has since gone on a hunger strike, obviously to avert the proceedings. [He ended the hunger strike on May 13.] Due process, however, goes on. The Government is aware of its duty to save Aquino from willful selfdestruction. But it has an equal, not a graver, duty to the life of the law, which is the basis of society and all human civilization. FRANCISCO S. TATAD Secretary of Public Information Republic of the Philippines Manila, May 12, 1975 Environmental Health and the N.A.M. To the Editor: In a letter on April 27, the National Association of Manufacturers criticizes your April 20 editorial concerning S. 841, a bill we sponsored to clarify the burden of proof in environmental health litigation. The N.A.M.'s letter inaccurately describes our bill and the present law on the subject, and it misconstrues the holding in a 1903 Supreme Court case. The N.A.M.'s letter is so misleading that it necessitates a reply. This bill clarifies the power of the courts to put a stop to threats to public health before, not after, the harm has been done. The need for this legislation was made clear in a lawsuit against the Reserve Mining Company. That company dumps iron‐ore tailings, contaminated with asbestos fibers, into the waters of Lake Superior. Substantial medical evidence was presented to show that drinking this water, with the asbestos fibers, creates a serious risk of cancer. The Reserve Mining Company contended that this risk should not be recognized by the Court, arguing, in effect, that the time to act was after, not before, people contracted cancer or died from it. By associating itself with this position, the N.A.M. discredits itself and all its responsible member businesses. Our bill does not change the present substantive law, but only clarifies it to prevent judicial error—and such errors have occurred. it is perfectly proper and often necessary to have such clarifying legislation, particularly, as this bill does, to set an unambiguous and straightforward procedure to give effect to the substantive law. The N.A.M. arguments, in addition to being simply wrong, seem to be born out of panic and irrational fear that companies will be closed down needlessly. There is no cause for this concern anywhere in the bill or in the present law. The N.A.M. letter is incorrect in several respects, but most important: 1. it says that companies could be closed down by a plaintiff who puts forth “medical hypotheses alone … without definite substantiating scientific data.…” This is false. As in any other lawsuit, plaintiff must present credible scientific evidence—of the sort presented before the trial judge in the Reserve Mining case—that there is a reasonable risk of death, serious illness or disease, or irreparable physical harm. The plaintiff's case will require “substantiating scientific data.” There is nothing in the bill which requires or even permits a judge to act on anything but credible, solid evidence. 2. The N.A.M. incorrectly states that the bill requires a defendant to prove that no risk is posed by his conduct, but the plain language of the bill is that a defendant can prove either that no risk exists, or that the risk is negligible, or that there is something more important at stake which outweighs the health risk. (Senators) GAYLORD NELSON PHILIP A. HART, CHARLES H. PERCY Washington, May 16, 1975 Housing Rehabilitation: America's Better Way To the Editor: Tourist “housing experts” seeking in Europe how to rehabilitate old sections of American cities (news story April 22) I think will find that the American way has won out. That way was first epitomized in the brownstone renewals on the West Side of New York in which some of the reported visitors had a part. Even a windshield survey, without self‐serving housing bureaucrat guides, would reveal the constant pattern of rich replacing poor in rehabilitated old housing in city centers. Meanwhile, the poor find state‐aided moderateincome housing projects too expensive for them, and the national versions of public housing in constant short supply. Overriding in much of European urban rehabilitation is not just their supposed greater respect for tradition but the impact of tourism. The old and charming are saved for visitors’ delight and native developers’ profits. One can see the influence of these factors not. only in large cities as diverse as London and Rome but also showing up in planned changes in smaller urban centers such as Rouen, Arezzo and Oxford. The needs and wishes of the rich residents and visiting tourists who.: must ride in cars set the pattern. Excessive consumerism, fervent cult of the car, paralyzed bureaucracy and urban overpopulation result in littered countryside and wornout cities in Europe even as in the United States. If America is ahead in anything, it is in a certain frontier lack of reverence for the daily masters of our fate and planners of our future in education, housing, health and other essential aspects of life. Building enlightened citizen organizations on that base, rather than elite preservationism, may be a better way. HENRY J. BROWNE Oxford, Eng., May 13, 1975 The writer is associate professor of sociology at Rutgers University. Of Abortion and the Poor To the Editor: To make more complete the list of unfinished business pertaining to the Legal Services Act in your recent editorial, mention shotild be made of recommendations concerning this act by the April report of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights entitled “Constitutional Aspects of the Right to Limit Childbearing.” According to the report, “The Legal Services Corporation Act, which prohibits legal services attorneys from handling abortion‐related cases, is suspect as another instance of invidious discrimination and an indirect attempt to restrict the right to abort. The ultimate means of challenging legal restrictions is through the use of legal procedures. if the Congress provides a range of legal services to the poor, and then, with no apparent reason related to a woman's welfare, restricts these services in abortion discrimination has occurred.” The report goes on to recommend specifically that Congress amend the Legal Services Corporation Act “to permit legal services attorneys to bring abortion‐related cases for their clients since low‐income persons have no other access to legal assistance in attempts to vindicate their rights.” Times readers who monitor the dismal legislative record (both Federal and state) of unconstitutional discrimination against the poor in relation to their right to an abortion look forward to the early correction of this particular inequity (previously sponsored by now‐defeated Republican Froelich of Wisconsin). Attorney‐members of the Congress should lead the effort to amend this statute, before the courts must deal with it.

Soviet Orbits Crew For Station Linkup,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/25/archives/soviet-orbits-crew-for-station-linkup-soviet-orbits-soyuz-crew-for.html,"MOSCOW, May 24—The Soviet Union launched today a manned Soyuz spacecraft for an expected linkup with Salyut 4, a space research station in orbit since last December. The launching today of Soyuz 18, which like earlier Soviet space launchings was not announced beforehand, follows the abortion of a Soviet manned space flight early last month. The failure of that mission to link up with Salyut 4, which was never recognized with a formal numerical designation, was privately attributed by Soviet space officials to the malfunction of an oldermodel rocket used in the launching. The liftoff of Soyuz 18 from the Baikonur launching pad on the desert steppes of Soviet Central Asia reportedly took place without any difficulty at 5:58 P.M. today Moscow time (10:58 A.M. Eastern daylight time). Lieut. Col. Pyotr I. Klimuk of the Air Force, commander of the Soyuz 18, and Vitaly I. Sevastyanov the flight engineer, reported from earth orbit that they were feeling well and all on board systems were functioning normally. Their mission was disclosed to the Russian people about an hour after blastoff, first on radio and television and then by the official press agency Tass. ‘Further Experiments’ Tass reported that the Soyuz 18 crew intended to “conduct further experiments with the orbital research station Salyut 4,” which was launched on Dec. 26, 1974. The Salyut 4 was used by a Soyuz 17 crew sent up the following month that set the Soviet record of 30 days in space. IThere was no'indication here whether the crew of Soyuz 18 would attempt to exceed the record of the Soyuz 17 astronauts. Some American space specialists have felt that the Russians would try for a longer stay, perhaps 45 to 60 days, on their next mission. Such speculation was bolstered after the orbit of the Salyut 4 station was adjusted in March before the abortive April flight. The world record, 84 days, was set by three astronauts in the American Skylab project almost a year and a half ago. The new space shot comes less than two months before the Apollo‐Soyuz linkup scheduled for mid‐July. A successful extended stay aboard the Salyut 4 would consequently approach or even overlap the duration of the Soviet‐American joint‐flight, enhancing Soviet space prestige but also distracting from the cooperative nature of the joint linkup Connection is Denied Today, Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, the chief of Soviet astronaut training, was quoted by Tass as declaring that the current mission was not connected with the Apollo‐Soyuz rendezvous. “On the contrary, the forthcoming Soviet‐U.S. experiment I will be another opportunity for us to extend the range of tasks which can be accomplished by Soyuz spaceships,” General Shatalov said. “This will, specifically, pave the way to our spaceships’ participation in the future in other international space programs.” The two astronauts on the Soyuz 18 mission have both made successful previous flights for which they were named Heroes of the Soviet Union. Colonel Klimuk, 33 years old, commanded the Soyuz 13 flight in December, 1973. He was born in the village of Komarovka in the Brest region of Byelorussia. He is married and has a 7‐year‐old son. Mr. Sevastyanov, who Is 40, was flight engineer on the Soyuz 9 mission in June, 1970, that set a record at that time of nearly 18 days in orbit. A civilian graduate of the Moscow Aviation Institute, he is married and has a 12‐year‐old daughter. Mr. Sevastyanov was born in the town of Krasnouralsk in the Sverdlovsk region of the Urals. The flight engineer has also been a commentator on a periodic television series here, “Man, Earth, Universe,” which Tass asserted made him the first journalist in space. Both men were shown several times on Soviet television this evening in their bulky white space suits, first waving happily before climbing into their capsule for blastoff and then reporting by telecast‐from their space orbit. General Shatalov, who is also a space veteran, told Tass that thc current flight was planned “to test individual elements and systems of the spaceship” and “to search for new possibilities of the use of both an individual spaceship and a group of spacecraft for the accomplishment of [scientific and applied tasks in the near‐earth orbit.” The Salyut 4 was described by General Shatalov as “proceeding in an automatic flight mode.” It appeared that the number designation intended for the failure would not be obvious in any review of the Soyuz space program. On that mission, the two astronauts landed safely in their capsule by parachute on the side of a mountain. Konstantin D. Bushuyev, the Soviet technical director of the Apollo‐Soyuz mission, assured his American counterpart Glynn S. Lunney, that the older rocket to which the malfunction was attributed would be replaced by a more modern one in the Soviet‐American project. No reason for the failure has been given to the Soviet public."
Legislative Notes,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/25/archives/legislative-notes-budget-still-lists-raise-for-byrne.html,"TRENTON — Governor Byrne said earlier this year that he and members of his Cabinet would consider taking salary cuts in an effort to reduce state spending and as evidence that his administration was prepared to make personal financial sacrifices as a public demonstration of official belt‐tightening. Special to The New York Times Later, however, Mr. Byrne announced that, because the pay‐cut suggestion had failed to generate much enthusiasm, he was dropping the idea. At the same time, he said he would still consider giving up a $5,000‐a‐year salary increase that had been authorized for him, particularly since he was balking at granting pay rises to state employes. The Governor's proposed $2.3‐billion budget for fiscal 1975‐76 has been approved by the Joint Legislative Appropriations Committee, and, despite Republican opposition, it contains the $5,000 increment. Asked at a news conference last Wednesday if he had decided whether to have his increase eliminated from the budget, Mr. Byrne replied that he had not. Should he fail to take any action, the pending budget, once it is approved by both houses of the Legislature and signed into law, will include the $5,000 raise. With that in mind, supporters of Mr. Byrne are unhappy over the potential political consequences of a Governor insisting on keeping a salary increase at a time when public employes are being asked to reduce their demands. A small contingent from the 303d Civil Affairs Group of the Army Reserve spent three days here last week. They were preparing for what a press release from the Governor's office said was “the possibility that it [the group] will some day have to establish a military government, such as those established by the United States in West Germany and Japan after World War II.” The exercise was to familiarize the unit with the daily operation of state government. “We're practicing something which we hope never happens,” said Col. Francis Clark, the unit's executive officer. it would take a disaster of “unthinkable proportions,” he added, before reserve units could be summoned by a governor to take over control of civilian governmental functions. While local governments have been studied by the Kearny — based unit before, last week's training here was its first experience on the state level. “But this is by no means ‘Seven days in May,” said Colonel Clark, recalling the popular novel about the attempted military takeover of the Federal Government. Earlier this year, Gordon Large resigned as the state's Energy Administrator, partly because he objected to his office being placed under the aegis of the Public Utilities Commission. Last week, a Senate bill was amended in committee to make the energy office an independent state agency. The legislation would transfer the office to the Department of Law and Public Safety. The switch was a victory for the oil industry, which feared the regulatory powers of the P.U.C. Governor Byrne wanted the office kept within the commission because of the “logical connection” between their parallel governmental mandates. The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a measure calling for a nationwide constitutional convention to approve an amendment that would outlaw abortions. The legislation is sponsored by Senator Joseph A. Maressa, Democrat of Gloucester County and the leading exponent of antiabortion legislation here; it was prepared at the request of Right to Life, an antiabortion organization. The bill would put New Jersey on record as saying that every human being “shall be deemed, from the moment of fertilization, to be a person and entitled to the right to life.” In order for a constitutional convention to be held, 34 states must make a request. Thus far, only New Mexico has done so."
U.S. WILL END AID TO HOSPITAL HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/25/archives/us-will-end-aid-to-hospital-here-agency-cites-fire-hazards-at.html,"Linden General Hospital in the East New York section of Brooklyn has been notified that it will receive no more Federal funds because of fire hazards and other deficiencies, posing the likelihood that the 42‐year‐old hospital may have to shut down. The 78‐bed hospital, in a rundown area, received 75 per dent of its indome last year from Medicaid payments for the poor and most of the rest from Medicare contributions for the aged. Earlier this year, Linden General lost its accreditation by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals because of its deficiencies. City and state health inspectors have declared the hospital, at 501 New Lots Avenue, hazardous and irreparably obsolete. A nursing supervisor at the hospital, reached for comment on the cutoff of funds, said no one in authority to make a statement would be there until Tuesday. The cutoff of Federal funds to the hospital after June 9 was announced by Bernice L. Bernstein, regional director of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Bernstein said that the hospital lacked a sprinkler system, smoke barriers, adequate exits and other required fireprotection provisions. She said that Linden General also did not meet conditions for Federal funds because of deficiencies in the medical staff, emergency services, dietary and social work departments and other services. “We have concluded that deficiencies, uncorrected for an inordinate amount of time, have created an environment that jeopardizes the health and safety of the patients and seriously limits the hospital's capacity to render adequate care,” Mr. Bernstein added. She said Federal payments would continue for up to 30 days for patients admitted before June 9. The hospital is situated on a lot bounded by Bradford Street and New Lots, Miller and Riverdale Avenues. it is surrounded by abandoned buildings and vandalized stores. Last year, Linden General received $1,039,910.30 in Medicaid funds and $193,600 from Medicare. Although the City Health Department said it was used mainly for tonsillectomies and abortions and recommended in May, 1974, that the hospital be closed “with all deliberate speed,” the State Health Department renewed its operating certificate for two years last Aug. 1. A memorandum said the State agency had insufficient information on affairs at the hospital."
Soviet Crew Checks Orbiting Research Station,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/27/archives/soviet-crew-checks-orbiting-research-station.html,"MOSCOW, May 26—Two Soviet astronauts checked out systems to continue a research program aboard an orbiting Soyiet space station today, after docking with and boarding the craft in pitch darkness. The astronauts, Lieut. Col Pyotr I. Klimuk and Vitaly 1. Sevastyanov, docked their Soyuz 18 craft with the Salyut 4 station later last night Moscow time, according to reports by Moscow radio and the official press agency Tass. The reports said that the rendezvous was handled automatically to within 100 meters —about 330 feet—of the space station. The two‐man crew then reduced their speed and, despite the lack of visibility, made the successful docking maneuver manually. It is the first known time that a Soviet space station has been occupied by successive crews though there have been previous attempts to do so. The Saiyut 4 was first used for research last January and February by the Soyuz 17 crew that set the Soviet record of 30 days in space. The station, which has been orbiting automatically since it was vacated on Feb. 9, had completed 2,379 revolutions of the earth when it was boarded today by the Soyuz 18 crew. The station itself was launched last Dec. 96. The Soyuz 18 astronauts. Tass reported, checked out the onboard systems of the station and then began a research program providing for the continuation of the experiments started by the Soyuz 17 crew. A Hearty Welcome As the newcomers crawled from their Soyuz capsule into the space station, Tass said, they were greeted by a sign—“Welcome to our common home”—left by Lieut. Col. Aleksei Gubarev and Georgi Grechko in February. It has not been disclosed whether the Soyuz 18 crew will try to exceed the 30 days spent in space by the Soyuz 17 astronauts or approach the 84‐day record set by the American Skylab crew a year and a half ago. Nor is it known whether they will attempt to overlap the Apollo‐Soyuz linkup scheduled to begin in little more than seven weeks. Today's successful linkup with the Salyut station follows the malfunction and abortion of another Soyuz flight on April 5 believed to have headed for the same space rendezvous. That mission would logically have been courted as Soyuz 18, but it has been evidently consigned to the obscurity of a nonflight, since the designation was passed on to the present mission. The Soyuz 13, which was lofted into orbit Saturday evening, began the docking process at 9:11 P.M. last night Moscow time, Tass reported. A slight brake was applied slightly less than a mile away from the station. Tass said, “when the brain of the automatic tracking system found the speed to be oo high.” Docking in Dark At 800 meters—or about half a mile away, Colonel Klimuk, the spaceship commander, radioed ground control, “I can see the station. It is well lighted by the sun.” However, both the ship and station had “entered the earth's shadow” when docking was attempted, Tass said. The searchlight of the Soyuz 18 was “unable to penetrate ithe darkness,” Tass said, and the crew was given permission to gto to manual control before their ship moved beyond radio contact for the next hour and a half. “The linkup was smooth, hardly noticeable and not one gram of fuel was expended. for the operation to absorb the shock,” the flight engineer, Mr. Sevastyanov, was quoted as reporting. After they had checked and stabilized the pressure in the connecting joint, Tass said, the astronauts were given the go‐ahead to enter the station. Tass reported that the experiments undertaken by the crew included a study of the sun, planets and stars “in various ranges of the spectrums of electric‐magnetic radiation,” a study of medical‐biological research as well as tests of the station itself. The astronauts, both of whom have made earlier space flights, were reported in good health though they had worked 14, hours without rest before boarding the station, Tass said. The linked spacecraft are orbiting the earth every 91.3 minutes at an inclination of 51.6 degrees, Tass said. Their altitude varies from 214 miles to 221 miles during each revolution."

ABORTION DEATHS IN SHARP DECLINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/28/archives/abortion-deaths-in-sharp-decline-us-report-links-decrease-to-shift.html,"WASHINGTON, May 27—A sharp decline in maternal deaths and injuries related to abortion has accompanied liberalized abortion laws, a report from a panel of the National Academy of Sciences laid today. In its conclusions, the report Implied that this reduced toll bad resulted from a major shift to legal abortions, done by competent medical personnel, and away from illegal abortions ore under circumstances hazardous to the woman's health. “A return of restrictive laws would probably lead to a rise in illegal abortions and the dangerous health consequences they entail, Dr. Henry W, Foster of Meharry Medical College, a member of the academy's panel, said during a news conference here. The academy's Institute of Medicine began its study of legalized abortion and the public health about a year ago. The impetus was the Supreme Court decision of January, 1973, that severely limited states' rights to restrict abortions and the opposition to liberalized abortions that has been voiced since then. “The rulings crystallized opposition to abortion,” said the Report, “led to the introduction of national and state legislation to curtail or prohibit it, and generated political pressures for a national debate on the issue.” Another panel member, Dr. Frederick C. Robbins of Case Western Reserve University, said the purpose of the study was to provide factual information that would allow the abortion debate to be conducted on a more informed basis. Figures cited in the report show that competently performed legal abortions involve small risk to the woman if done during the first three months of pregnancy. The risks increase thereafter. A healthy woman undergoing competently performed abortion during the first three months of pregnancy has about six chances in a thousand of some important medical complication, the report said. During the second six months of pregnancy, a comparable woman would have a risk rated at 21 chances in a thousand. “The frequency of medical complications due to illegal abortions cannot be calculated precisely,” said the report, but it cited figures from New York and Los Angeles suggesting strongly that problems of this sort have been much reduced since the introduction of liberalized abortion laws several years ago. Admission to New York City's municipal hospital for two serious complications of abortion — septic and incomplete abortion—dropped from 6,524 in 1969 to 3,253 in 1973, according to the report. It said most restrictions on legal abortion in New York City were dropped in July 1970. Risk of Infection Septic abortion is an abortion that involves infection in the Uterine cavity and sometimes other abdominal organs. Probably, it results most often from illegally induced abortions, the report said. Incomplete abortions, which can result from legal, illegal or spontaneous abortion, is a potentially dangerous situation in which pot all of the products of conception are expelled from the womb. The report said a recent analysis of data from New York City's first year of experience with liberalized abortion indiCated that about 70 per cent of the women who had legal abortions there would have resorted to illegal abortion if the legal operations had not been available. “Replacement of legal and illegal abortions also is reflected in the substantial decline in the number of reported complications and deaths due to other‐than‐legal abortions since nonrestrictive practices began to be implemented in the United States, the report said. The number of all known maternal deaths related to abortion declined from 128 in 1970 to 47 in 1973, the panel's figures showed. The report said Increased use of effective contraception may also have played a role in the decline of abortion‐related deaths nationally. The study panel cited figures Indicating that 745,400 legal abortions were performed in the United States in 1973; that shout one third of the women obtaining them were less than 20 years old and another third were between 20 and 25. The available data showed that 25 per cent of women obtaining abortions were married and 68 per cent were white. The report is titled, “legalized Abortion and the Public Health.” Legal Abortion Backed The Associated Press reported yesterday that a Harris Poll had found that 54 per cent of the American people supported legalized abortion, 38 per cent were opposed and 8 per cent were not sure. However, the poll among 1,578 adults found that 68 per Lent were opposed to abortions after three months of pregnancy."
British Feminists: Still ‘Mountains to Climb’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/31/archives/british-feminists-still-mountains-to-climb.html,"LONDON, May 26—When Margaret Thatcher, the new leader of the Conservative Party, walked out from lunch recently, the photographers gathered to record the event as if she had just achieved a miracle. In a sense, it was almost that. She was emerging from the Carlton Club, one of those fortresses of leather couches for men only that waived its rules and allowed her in only because she was the Tory leader. She is the only woman member of the club, founded nearly 150 years ago. While obviously pleased with her success—she is the first woman leader of any major party in British history—women in the feminist movement are not cheering any million. They realize they still have a long way to go in British society before they achieve an end to discrimination or even come close to the successes so far of women in the United States. Indeed, many activists are worried that Mrs. Thatcher's climb in politics may lead to the wrong impression that “women have made it” in Britain and may generate complacency. As it is, leaders of the various women's groups here often find difficulties in efforts to mobilize women to fight for their own rights. “The letters we get in response to a women's movement article are revealing,” said the editor of the women's page of a London newspaper. “Most of them don't say: ‘Good work and keep it up.’ Rather, they say: ‘Why are you trying to make me unhappy? I like staying home and taking care of the children. You're troublemakers.’” “Anyone who thinks that the vast majority of women are Interested in sex equality in Britain should have his head examined,” the leader of one women's group said. “They don't know and they don't care. The majority of women here have been so brainwashed that they concede male superiority without thinking about any fight for rights.” Some Strides Forward Still, there have been enough women active in the movement here over the years to have made some significant impact. The response of governments may fall short of pleasing everyone, but many women now feel they are making important strides toward some semblance of equality. A law providing for equal pay, passed in 1970 and criticized for its loopholes, goes into effect this year. Abortion is now easily obtained, although there are efforts to impose new restrictions. The Labor Government is pushing through Parliament a new sex discrimination measure described by officials as the “most comprehensive measure of its kind in the world.” Moreover, women are seen and heard more often on radio and television. Women jockeys were recently allowed to compete on race tracks. More jobs have opened up for women in the civil service. Oxford University no longer represents a symbol of male privilege. “We still have many mountains to climb,” said Pamela Anderson of the Fawcett Society, founded in 1866 as the London society for women's suffrage. “We won't be satisfied until we see women at the top of business and financial institutions and the professions. We've got to change laws, but we also have to change attitudes.” The feminist movement here, of course, has had some marked successes. Shortly after the turn of the century, women, including the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, the fragile widow of a Lancashire lawyer, attracted attention to their cause by interrupting political meetings, chaining themselves to fences, breaking windows and engaging in hunger strikes after arrest. They won the vote in 1918, two years before women's suffrage came to the United States. Britain's class society and widespread resistance to change have not made it any easier for women. The debates in Parliament over the years, for example, are full of comments that could make even a devout male chauvinist look the other way. There was the aristocrat who, just before the turn of the century, told Parliament that “The real fact is that man in the beginning was ordained to rule over woman, and this is an eternal decree which we have no right and no power to alter.” In a debate in the House of Lords a few years ago, a viscount could not quite understand why women wanted all jobs open to them. “Who would want to take out a girl who drove a bus?” the Viscount of Massereene and Ferrard asked in one of the frequent Parliamentary discussions on the topic in recent years. “It is not a female occupation. I certainly would not want to do so; it would put me off.” London Transport now has about a dozen women bus drivers, but there are no women train drivers. Women have been allowed to work as postmen only when no men were available, and they have no seniority rights. Remedial measures are now under way. Past and Present Inequality Statistics testify to past and present discrimination. Average wages paid to women are just about half those paid to men. Eight per cent of the women receive higher education, compared to 22 per cent of men. About 11 per cent of senior civil servants are women, 17 per rent of senior local government officials, 4 per cent of the lawyers and 1 per cent of the engineers. Although women make up just under 40 per cent of the total working population, most of them do lower grade jobs, for lower rates of pay than unskilled men. One survey showed that only 7 per cent went into apprenticeships for skilled occupations, as against 42 per cent of men. In short, women have found little improvement in their share of top jobs since Parliament's first sex discrimination bill in 1919, a law without teeth. There are 27 women among the 635 members elected to the House of Commons, but that is only two more than the total in the nineteen‐thirties. By comparison, there are 19 women among the 535 members elected to the United States House of Representatives and Senate. “A big part of the problem in Britain, unlike America, is that there is greater reluctance to change,” said Penny Cooper, a 23‐year‐old sociology student at Southbank Polytechnic and a leader of the women's campaign within the National Union of Students. “Attitudes are changing, but slowly. We are managing to raise some consciousness about the rights for women.” ‘The Wrong Attitude’ “Too many still have the wrong attitude,” said Mona Gleditsch, an economics student at London University. “They say women should do certain things—should not be boss of men, should not study after they've had children. The education system here feeds it—girls are channeled into so‐called wornen's courses and discouraged from taking subjects like science.” Recent reports have supported the view that children are molded along “sexist” lines in many English schools. A survey by the Department of Education, for example, showed that boys are “normally regarded as breadwinners” and end up studying courses such as physics and chemistry, while girls are “normally regarded as future mothers” and study more modern languages. “The discrimination is sometimes quiet and sometimes open as a book,” said another young Londoner. “I applied for a job, signing my name only with initials. When I was informed that I qualified, they turned me down flat, saying they did not want a woman for the job.” Bank loans and installment credit are usually more difficult for a woman to obtain, with lenders often demanding male guarantors. If a woman has an investment income of her own, it counts as her husband's for income tax purposes. Women are allowed into famous clubs of London only at special hours and often under rather stiff conditions. In the Reform Club, for example, where women may eat at dinner but not at lunch, a sign on one door says: “Ladies may not be shown this room.” And that is all hours. The pending legislation would have no effect on such private clubs, but it would prohibit “men only” sections of public pubs. In broader terms, it would outlaw discrimination against women in jobs, education, training and other areas. An Equal Opportunities Commission would be created, with powers to enforce nondiscrimination decisions in the courts. Advertisements for jobs could no longer include such terms as “waiter,” “salesgirl” or “stewardess.” Some women's groups, however, are criticizing the proposals as inadequate. Maureen Colquhoun, a Labor member of the House of Commons, is complaining, for example, that the new bill would not give women a chance to obtain high jobs in business and indus try. Mrs. Colquhoun, who would like to see the House of Lords renamed the House of Lords and Ladies, is arguing for a “balance of the sexes” bill, noting that women do not have an ?? say in running Britain's most ?? organizations such as the post office or the railways. “We have got to take action like the women in America,” she said. “They have legislation that any organization run with the help of Public funds must have equal places for women or the funds will be withdrawn.” On equal pay, which goes into full effect at the end of December, many women are also complaining that employers have made plans to evade its provisions. Some companies have improved pay for women, under pressure of the law, but others have lagged behind. “They call a woman a secretary and pay her less than a man who does the same work as a personal assistant,” one woman activist said. “New laws help, of course, but the main thing is to change attitudes. And in this country that's not easy, even with Margaret Thatcher.”"
Article 15 ‐‐ No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/01/archives/article-15-no-title.html,"Having forsaken chemistry to become a barrister specializing in tax and patent law, she withdrew from active politics after the 1951 election (in which Churchill led the Tory party back to power) and had her two children in 1953. “Conveniently twins, all over at once,” sneered the Socialist New Statesman in a wounding profile of her four years ago—one that is said to have brought her to tears. Husband Denis is, if anything, more suburban, more insular than she—and 10 years her senior (“a mature courtship”). Public school, major in the artillery, a brief period in his father's furniture business, now an oil‐company executive, he is the archetypal south of England Conservative and an ideal backstop to her ambition. Caricaturists are, as ever, unmerciful. A magazine competition for poems describing his private thoughts came up with this: The washing machine's on the blink again, The whole bloody house is a mess The fridge is beginning to stink again The dishes are piled in the sink again “Yes, doesn't she look in the pink again,” What price the bitch‐goddess success? Returning to politics, she won a seat in the Commons in the 1959 election, made a maiden speech proposing a bill to admit the press to local government deliberations and was greeted by her now loyal lieutenant Sir Keith Joseph with the words: “I am sure we must all hope this will not be her last venture into legislation.” The rest is silence, or very nearly so. No great speech, no firm reputation as a debater or questioner, no television sideline or newspaper interest. She voted in favor of the first application to join the Common Market in 1961, and voted against the abolition of capital punishment, the legalization of homosexuality and the reform of divorce law. (Untypically, she voted to relax the abortion laws, which has led to some louche gossip in the lobbies.) A 1968 pamphlet in which she recommended “a far greater degree of personal responsibility and decision” is a fair sample of her style. In short, a fairly commonplace Tory backbencher. But the Edward Heath administration of 1970 through 1974 was a terrible disaster for such Tories and their morale. As it moved away from the aggressive Conservatism of its election manifesto, and opted for more and more of the statist and conformist mix which has made British politics so boring for so long, its most loyal and docile supporters began to squirm. And when they did, they found their leader unbending, tyrannical and unapproachable, convinced that his policy was the only one and finally taking them all onto the rocks in a grand showdown with the miners' union, a showdown which led to a Labor victory at the polls in February, 1974. He had to go. Enoch Powell, the romantic and irreconcilable Tory prophet who first dared to raise the issue of color in British politics, advocated a Labor vote if that would secure the defeat of his hated former chief. Nobody else went so far. But there was one member of the Conservative Cabinet, only the second woman ever to have held such a post, who had attempted to hold the line for the right in her own ministry and in closed Cabinet sessions. Those like Powell who say Mrs. Thatcher came late to repentance forget that her department ceased to “feather. (Continued on Page 21)"
Ford Plus and Minus,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/01/archives/ford-plus-and-minus.html,"WASHINGTON, May 31—The prevailing mood here at the beginning of the summer is increasingly restless and partisan. The cattle are beginning to stir in the barn. The politicians are organizing for next year's elections, when many of them believe new leaders will be chosen, not only for the White House, but for the House and Senate as well. The most significant change in the last few months has probably been the rise in the popularity of President Ford. He has come through the formative stage of his Administration in better form than had been generally expected. He is visibly more confident. He has put together a competent Cabinet, and, by a combination of candor and friendliness, he has swept away the atmosphere of conspiracy and mistrust that polluted this town in the last months of the Nixon Administration. He is being helped for the moment by the feeling, not quite supported by reliable facts, that the worst of the recession is over, but even among many people who like and support him, there remain serious doubts that he has the imagination or resiliency to handle the challenges of the last years of the seventies. WASHINGTON The successes of the sixties have been followed by—may even have produced—a torrent of new and more complicated problems in all free societies. A rising middle class is demanding more from its governments in the industrial countries, and provoking, since the organization of the oil cartel, new cries from the hungry countries for a more equal distribution of the world's wealth. At home, a new generation of industrial and service employes as well as the young professionals, is thinking and living and acting politically in different ways. Internationally, the fears of the cold war era have been replaced by a popular but dicey belief in “détente,” and there is a vague suspicion here, underlying all traditional political assumptions, that America is approaching the new problems of the eighties with a lot of old men and, old notions. In short, there is a pervasive feeling here that there is something out of date and maybe even deeply wrong with the organization and spirit of our politics, and that the last four years of the decade will require the sort of economic and political innovations that marked the first half of the thirties. Those who feel this way and at the same time regard Mr. Ford as an ideal interim President, do not quite see him as a leader of these coming turbulent years. Senator Edward Kennedy is back on the front pages of the news mag azines and continues to lead the popularity polls, but this is so only because the Democrats are in such mess. The guess here is that his promise not to run or accept a draft in 1976 is genuine. And that the Democrats would do better to take him at his word and find themselves another candidate. Kennedy cooperates with the writers of profiles and Sunday supplement features, probably not because he is secretly maneuvering for a draft, but because he must run next year for re‐election in Massachusetts, which is deeply divided on the issues of busing and abortion, and he could be in trouble over these questions. Accordingly, it does him no harm to concentrate on the large issues of health insurance, unemployment, and foreign policy, and dominate the popularity polls and the magazine covers. Nor does it hurt Representative Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts, who is leading the charge for Kennedy. Tip has political ambitions too, and the more he shares the headlines with Kennedy, the better his chances of moving up from majority leader to Speaker of the House when Carl Albert retires, as he is expected to do next year. So the politicians are trying to anticipate the coming changes, sensing that new problems and new leaders may be forthcoming after the Bicentennial suggests the need for new beginning& Even the 75 new Democratic Representatives, who made such a splash early this year, are planning to go away to a “retreat” for a weekend after they return from the Memorial Day recess, in order to discuss their future plans, including whether they want to go along with the Humphreys, Jacksons, Muskies, and the other Democratic leaders now in their sixties. Ford's rise in recent weeks has muffled some of the talk about a challenge from farmer Governor Reagan of California on the right. Reagan says he's not interested in heading a Conservative party movement, and unless the President runs into even more serious economic troubles or abdicates like Lyndon Johnson, his nomination is almost assured. And meanwhile, the President is quietly putting together his own political team, and trying to demonstrate by his trips abroad that he is not only a Man of the Congress, but also a leader in the world. The danger in this is that the distracted and divided free world leaders will not respond to his exhortations, and that the world situation will get worse in the coming. year rather than better. Accordingly, events in the next twelve months may dominate the men, rather” than the other way around, but the campaign has obviously already started. It is dominating most conversations in this city, and it is likely to dominate the legislation from now on, until November of 1976."

James Stassi, 58 years old, of Elizabeth, entered the plea shortly before jury selection was to begin in his Federal conspiracy trial. Mr. Stassi will face five years in jail and a $10,000 fine on June 23, when he will be sentenced. His co‐defendant, Dr. Sherwin Raymond of Jefferson Township, will also be sentenced on that date. Dr. Raymond, a physician, previously pleaded guilty to possessing the two submachine guns, both equipped with silencers. Law‐enforcement officials have described Mr. Stassi a member of the Vito Genovese crime family. He was a codefendant with Dr. Raymond once before, when they were convicted of operating an abortion mill in Bergen County. Byrne Calls for Carpenter Settlement Governor Byrne called for a settlement in the monthold strike by union carpenters, saying a “timely completion” of the sports complex in the Hackensack Meadowlands would be jeopardized by a long strike. He said a prolonged strike “would have a disastrous effect on New Jersey's economy, already plagued by record unemployment.” The Governor noted that unemployment in the construction trades was nearing 25 per cent. “I renew my request that members of the state Council of Carpenters resume work on the Meadowlands Sports Complex immediately, pending such a settlement,” Governor Byrne said. “We have been making good progress on that project, but due to the critical nature of the construction schedule, any substantial delay might endanger our chances of opening on schedule next year.” Murder Victim, 65, Was Raped, Too Ann Talian, a 65‐year‐old widow, was raped after she was stabbed to death Sunday in the exclusive development for the elderly where she lived, the Brick Township police reported following an autopsy. They said they suspect the killer might have been someone who was familiar with the Greenbriar Development because of his apparent knowledge in selecting his victim. Mrs. Talian lived alone and was attacked in her house and then dragged to an unoccupied house 50 feet away. State Ocean County and local policemen questioned workers at nearby construction sites, but reported no new fleads."
Albany Approves of Curbs On Rape‐Trial Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/03/archives/albany-approves-of-curbs-on-rapetrail-questions.html,"ALBANY, June 2—The State Senate tonight voted final approval of a measure that would prevent defense attorneys from questioning rape victims about their private sex life. The measure, which had been sought by feminist groups to eliminate demeaning cross‐examination in criminal rape cases, was approved, 54 to 2, and sent to Governor Carey, who is expected to sign it. There was no debate when the measure came up on the agenda—a quiet final action that offered no hint of the controversial history of the issue. Two Republicans were in the negative, Bernard C. Smith of Northport, L.I., and John R. Dunne of Garden City, L. I. Mr. Dunne explained later that the restriction on an attorney's cross‐examination rights “offends my sense of due process.” Abortion Debate Intense In contrast to the passage of the rape‐trial bill, the Senat?? engaged in an intense debate over the abortion issue, finally passing by a bare majority a bill that would make it difficult for young women under the age of 18 to obtain abortions without their parents' consent. At present the law permits physicians to treat minors without parental consent in cases of emergency when delay would be a risk to life or health. The bill, sponsored by Frank S. Padavan, Republican of Queens, is designed to close a “loophole” that, he said, allowed organizations such as Planned Parenthood to offer “abortions on your lunch hour” for school girls. Karen S. Burstein, Nassau Democrat, objected, noting that the United States Supreme Court had already guaranteed the right to abortion. “The Bill or Rights doesn't turn on anything so artificial as the age of 18,” Senator Burstein said. Opponents such as Bernard G. Gordon, Republican of Peekskill saw the bill as an attempt to “erode the concept we accepted in 1970” when the Legislature legalized abortion. The measure, which is expected to die in the Democratic‐controlled Assembly, was defended by proponents as part of parents' responsibility to their children. Carl McCall, Manhattan Democrat, argued that parents who had a good relationship with their children had no need of such a law, and good family relationships could not be legislated. The bill would change the present law so that physicians could perform an abortion without parental consent only in cases where delay would mean “permanent and serious physical injury” to the patient. The Senate session was the major activity on a day that the Democratic majority in the Assembly devoted to building an environmental record. The Assembly passed a package of nine bills, including the Governor's measure that would require environmental impact statements for local government construction projects. The measure was approved, 109 to 36, and sent to an uncertain future in the Senate. Other bills also approved would require warnings for aeroso?? sprays suspected of eroding the earth's ozone barrier; establish state control of liquid natural gas deliveries; set noise standards to bar the SST airliner from New York City airports and establish programs to reclaim mineral wastes. A bipartisan agreement to pass a bill placing stricter controls on lobbying activities fell apart this afternoon when Senate Republicans balked at a provision giving the Secretary, of State sole power to make rules and regulations governing lobbyists. The Senate Republicans met and later agreed to amend the bill, deleting a section that read, “The Secretary of State is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations deemed proper and necessary to carry out the provisions of this article . . .” The Senate Republican majority is expected to add wording to the measure placing control over the promulgation of rules and legislations jointly in the hand of legislative ethics committees and the Secretary of State, Mario M. Cuomo."

Rape Laws Undergoing Changes to Aid Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/04/archives/rape-laws-undergoing-changes-to-aid-victims.html,"DENVER, June 3—Laws concerning rape, the major crime least reported to the police, are undergoing a fundamental revision throughout the country. The chief aims are to encourage more women to seek police help in arresting their attackers and to give prosecutors a better chance of getting them convicted. The changes are being mace in large measure because of vigorous lobbying by women's rights groups, which, having suffered setbacks in the fight to ratify the Federal Equal Rights Amendment and having won the battle over abortion, have made rape their No. 1 issue. A spot check of 25 states shows that in the last year 13 of them have changed the rules of evidence in a rape case to limit the introduction in a trial of material about a victim's personal sex life, either current or past, except in limited instances. Prosecutors believe that this change will help to bring more women forward to report a rape because they will be spared embarrassing questioning at a trial. They also believe that juries that do not hear discussions of a woman's sex life will be better able to judge objectively the merits of a sexual assault case. The 13 states that have enacted laws limiting discussion of a victim's sexual conduct fare California, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Oregon, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. Yesterday, similar bills received final legislative approval in two other states, New York and Colorado. Governor Carey and Gov. Richard D. Lamm are expected to sign them. Bills providing for a similar change have been proposed in eight other states among the 25 checked. They are Alabama, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. There may be other states in which such laws have been passed or proposed. No national or government organization, however, keeps up‐to‐date statistics on rape law revisions. The changes reflect a growing national trend to view rape not as a deviant sexual offense but as a violent crime of assault. “It has no more relationship to an act of love than a beating has to a massage,” declared Eve Norman of the California National Organization for Women. The women's groups have fought to eliminate the kind of demeaning cross‐examination that tends to put the victim of a rape, rather than the rapist, on trial. Said Lieut. Winona Franz of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department: “It's been a loaded deck and it's about time we get things equalized.” Until a few years ago, rape laws often fostered an implication that many women invited sexual assault or brought unfounded charges against men as an act of female revenge. In numerous states, the prosecution was required to offer corroborative testimony — an eyewitness, evidence that the woman put up a struggle or a medical report. Many victims who went to the police felt they were often questioned by unsympathetic male interrogators whose attitudes suggested the belief that any woman could resist rape if she really wanted to. If a case came to trial, the woman was often subjected to questions about her sex life. Judges in some states were, and still are, required to give juries the 17th century “Lord Hale instructions” about rape being the easiest charge to make and the most difficult to prove. As a result, most women (as well as men who were sexually assaulted) suffered in silence. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that only one out of every five rapes is reported to the police. Many prosecutors and feminists say the figure is even lower. Convictions are rare. During the first half of 1972 in New York City, for example, the conviction rate in rape cases was 1.8 per cent. The New York bill, which was passed by the State Senate yesterday 54 to 2, would bar defense attorneys from questioning rape victims about their sex lives. The proposed Colorado law would allow evidence regarding a rape victim's sexual conduct only if it concerned the defendant. To introduce it, the defense would first have to make a written motion to the court. An initial hearing would be held outside the presence of the jury. The Colorado bill would also prohibit the judge from giving a jury the Lord Hale instructions. In addition, it would establish several degress of sexual assault, according to the degree of violence involed. “We've had victims who have said, the rape was bad but the trial was worse,” said Richard Wood, an assistant district attorney in Denver, in explaining the reasons for the proposed law. The Michigan law, regarded by many as a model for other states, went into effect April 1. In 1974. Michigan recorded 3,370 instances of forcible or attempted rape but the filing of only 915 formal charges and only 111 convictions on the original charge. The law dispenses with the requirement for a corroborating witness, recognizes male as well as female victims of rape, limits the admissibility of evidence of the victim's sexual conduct and establishes four degrees of sexual assault, providing varying penalties. Federal Bureau of Investigation preliminary statistics for 1974 show that among the nation's largest cities, Detroit ranks highest in reported rapes per capita, with 83.4 per 100,000 people. In Texas, where a new law takes effect Sept. 1, the State Judicial Council recorded 1,703 rape cases on file at the start of 1974. By the end of the year, only 417 defendants had been convicted as charged, 42 had been acquitted and 116 cases had been dismissed for insufficient evidence. Legislators and prosecutors alike credit women's groups, especially the National Organization for Women, and such local organizers as Sally McGee of the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus with pushing the new laws forward. These groups have also been instrumental in getting police forces to set up special sexual assault squads, some of which use policewomen to interview victims and hold sensitivity training sessions for their officers. Also women's rights groups have encouraged hospitals to set up special rape treatment centers. In Oregon, a rape trial had a significant effect on the passage of that state's new law. A Portland man accused of raping a 25‐year‐old woman was acquitted after the woman was subjected to extended cross‐examination. “The defense lawyer asked me, 'do I wear a bra, do I have any see‐through blouses, how many cigarettes I smoke, did I enjoy being raped,” “she later told a legislative committee. Her accused attacker would not have been acquitted, she said, “if they hadn't delved into my past, humiliated me, embarrassed me.” The prospect of having her moral character called into question “can intimidate all but the hardiest of victims,” Lawrence H. Cooke, associate judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, said recently. Two celebrated cases have also focused attention on the crime itself, although they do not have a direct hearing on rape laws. Inez Garcia was found guilty of murder in Cali fornia last fall after she killed a companion of a man who she said had assaulted her. In North Carolina, where a rape bill is pending, Jo Anne Little is accused of murdering a jailer who allegedly attempted to rape her. Another, less publicized case in Van Nuys, Calif., is on appeal before the state's highest court. Leonardo Rincon‐Pineda, the defendant, was found guilty after the judge refused to give the jury the mandatory Lord Hale instructions. Saying that the instruction was “unwarranted by either law or reason,” Superior Court Judge Armand Arabian declared that it “arbitrarily discriminates against women, denies them equal protection of the law and assists in the brutalization of rape victims.” Despite the movement for a more realistic legal approach to sexual assault crimes, some experts still believe that the American culture itself must be changed to rid women of the idea of submission and men of the ideology that encourages rape as an expression of male aggression, hostility and dominance. “The most perfect rape laws in the land, strictly enforced by the best concerned citizens, will not be enough to stop rape,” concludes Susan Brownmiller in “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,” a book to be published this fall. “Obvious offenders will be punished, and that itself will be a significant change,” she writes, “but the huge grey area of sexual exploitation, of women who are psychologically coerced into acts of intercourse they do not desire because they do not have the wherewithall to physically, or even psychologically resist, will remain a problem beyond any possible solution of criminal justice.”"

Spouse's Veto on Sterilization Denied,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/07/archives/spouses-veto-on-sterilization-denied.html,"WOODBURY, June 6 (UPI)—A married woman has the sole right, independent of her spouce, to decide if she wants a sterilization operation, a Superior Court fudge ruled today. Judge Philip A. Gruccio made the decision on a suit brought, by Judith Ponter of Paulsboro, who was denied the operation by physicians because her husband, John, would not sign a consent order. “The plaintiff has a fundamental, constitutional right existing independent of the requirement of spousal consent to obtain a sterilization,” Judge Gruccio said in an unusual case. Mrs. Ponter, 28 years old, who has been separated from her husband for five years, is expecting her fourth child, by a man other than her husband, next week, according to her lawyer, John Ensminger. Mr. Ensminger said doctors generally followed a policy requiring a spouse's consent to the operation to guard against possible civil suits in sleril??tion cases. There is no state or Federal law requiring consent. “There is a fear on the part of many doctors, and perhaps it is groundless, that they could be liable for court action,” Mr. Ensminger said. “We hope this case will settle the law in the state for this issue.” Judge Grucdio reserved decision on the plaintiff's request for an injunction to prevent her husband from filing suit. But Mr. Ensminger said the decision voided any action her husband might institute. In the suit, Mrs. Ponter argued that sterilization rights were a natural corollary to the United States Supreme Court decision giving a woman a right to an abortion. “The right to choose whether or not to bear children must be given the same protection from unreasonable interference before a child is conceived as it is once conception has occurred,” her lawyer's brief said."
A ‘Health Fair’ for Englewood,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/08/archives/a-health-fair-for-englewood.html,"ENGLEWOOD—A five‐day “Health Fair,” a pioneering community effort in which free medical services and advice will be offered to the public, will get under way here Tuesday evening. The fair, which is spon sored by the Englewood Health Department, is regarded by health experts as one of the most ambitious and comprehensive programs of its kind to be held in the state. Some 25 health, welfare and community‐service agencies in Englewood are collaborating in the program, as are 15 Bergen County offices and agencies. The fair, whose slogan is “Stay Alive in '75,” is primarily the work of Mrs. Violet Cherry, Englewood's sometimes controversial Health Services Administrator. Mrs. Cherry, who has been described by some of her critics as “an exotic foreigner,” is a handsome Indian who was born in Durban, South Africa, 39 years ago. She is now awaiting final certification of her United States citizenship. Clinic Was Closed Because of her activities on behalf of multiracial health services and education, Mrs. Cherry had a number of brushes with the South African Government before she left. She was arrested more than once, and her interracial health clinic in Durban was closed in 1967. The facility was for children. Appointed as Englewood's Health Services Administrator last July—she is the first woman to hold the post—Mrs. Cherry has raised some eyebrows in this well‐to‐do Bergen County community, chiefly as the result of her “take charge” tactics. Among other things, she has instituted programs designed to detect and prevent problems such as alcoholism and drug addiction, which some residents would not like to admit exist here. However, the Board of Health has recognized Mrs. Cherry's talents by approving a $5,000 salary increase, thus bringing her pay to $30,000 a year. The proposed increase was the subject of a sharp, dispute, and became a political issue prior to its final approval by the board last Monday night. The “Health Fair,” which represents the first major test of Mrs. Cherry's policy, has received strong backing from both the civic and the professional communities. Individual residents have contributed $2,000 to underwrite the cost of the event, and physicians, psychiatrists, dentists, nurses, social workers and medical and dental technicians have pledged to contribute an estimated $20,000 in professional services. “We have moved away from the mere dissemination of literature,” Mrs. Cherry explained. “We are going to provide actual medical services.” Among the services that will be available to anyone attending the fair, which will take place in centers in various parts of the city, will be screening for hypertension, tests for diabetes and a wide range of cancer‐detection examinations. In addition, a mobile unit sponsored by the local Lions Club, and staffed by professional ophthalmologists, will provide testing for general vision, cataracts and glaucoma, among other potential eye ailments. Special seminars for youngsters will focus on drug addiction, smoking, mental health, sex and abortion counseling and family planning, among other subjects. In the first issue of a new publication that Mrs. Cherry produced for the Englewood Health Department, she wrote: “Our perspectives are changing in the direction of more personal services and direct delivery of health care to this community. . . . Our emphasis will be on services to people—the rich, poor, black and white of all denominations.” In an acknowledgement of the professional horizon that lies ahead of her in her new role, Mrs. Cherry added: “I feel a great sense of excitement and enthusiasm for the challenge that this department presents to me.”"
"Two English comedies, one that works",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/08/archives/two-english-comedies-one-that-works.html,"Harriet Waugh comes to literature with a name that has stirred the dust and routed the foe since the century began. Her grandfather warned England that T.S. Eliot was the voice of Bolshevism and anarchy. Her father once threatened to arrest Life magazine. Her uncle Alec, the family cutup, celebrated the loom of youth in the Jazz Age, and her brother Auberon once posed as a scholar of Pound's “Cantos,” eliciting from the old man in the madhouse generous explications which Mr. Waugh then burned, with glee. Aside from Papa Evelyn's brittle demonstrations that the world is tacky and absurd, it would seem to be the opinion of the Waughs that most things are bosh. The first woman to win an Olympic chariot race, a Spartan, signed in as “the daughter and sister of kings,” by which she meant that things were expected of her. In Miss Waugh's case these expectations must have been a positive burden, more the family curse than a tradition to uphold. In prose less distinguished than that of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, Miss Waugh has popped together a novel about an ugly man who has his face made beautiful by a plastic surgeon. He then takes his revenge on thoso who were revolted by his homely looks. So far, so good. Not one of your brilliant plots, but it will do. Or would do, in more skillful hands. The novel by this time is a formulaic art. If you are writing a novel and need to jolt same energy into the plot, you can throw an innocent child down a flight of stairs and break his neck. You can jolly along the action at a wedding breakfast by having one character vomit on another. You can have silly people taken in by a religious fanatic, wear crowns of thorns and hammer nails into their palms. You can have a muddleheaded woman freeze her husband in Swiss snow on their honeymoon. You can even have a nun don a chippy's garb and play Judith and Holofernes by sawing off a man's head with a bread knife. The God‐Awful Moment is the Waugh trademark. But in Harriet Waugh one senses the mere desperation of an unskilled writer groping for effects. Papa precipitated the grotesque from the dullness of people who scarcely knew what they were saying or doing, and when doom fell on his characters you knew that it was their own doing and that vengeance was the Lord's. Like a woman telling a joke, Miss Waugh starts with the punch line and asks us to be patient while she fills in. A lumpier plot does not exist. Occasionally the story hits a lucid streak, and our protagonist Godfrey Pettlement comes into focus for a short‐story's worth of significant action. Isolated, these bits would make entertaining reading — the death of Godfrey's father, for instance, or the vignettes of the snotty and mean priest who understands grace to be deportment. As it is. these few crisp pages only contribute to the book's unevenness. Nor can I figure out what the novel means. Godfrey is ugly because he began life as an abortion that the hospital was reluctant to murder. His parents despise him. His playmates recoil. He goes up to Oxford swathed in bandages. His roommate thinks he is a vampire. And so on. His ugliness can usually be found measuring and damning charily. A deranged man dying of listlessness takes Godfrey in and gives him a home. Heir to the man's fortune, Godfrey consults a plastic surgeon. With a comely mug he becomes a bogus evangelist and has some grisly revenge on the world before a nun cuts off his head. What in the world could all this mean? Is it satire? Comedy? Allegory? A sermon? I take it that coherence in a work of art is an absolute condition, like life in an organism. It follows that there is no such thing as an almost coherent novel. For what it's worth, “Mirror Mirror” may have the distinction of being well out in the lead, if any such competition exists, among the worst novels published in this century. “The Bottle Factory Outing,” the fifth novel of the English writer Beryl Bainbridge, is, in these days of curveball titles, about a bottle factory outing. The factory is in London, is Italian, and employs — except for one Irishman and Brenda and Freda, the two very British girls whose adven tures constitute the plotline — Italian peasants who glory in having escaped forever the goats and rocks of the Bologna hills. Brenda and Freda share a room across from an old folks homo — symbolically they face the goal of their best efforts to make a life out of their existence on this earth. A property line of books divides their bed into territories. The toilet does not flush. The Italians treat them as if they were Martians, but rather sexy Martians. Briskly, her eye on the telling detail, Miss Bainbridge follows this little domestic comedy through all its alarms and trivialities until we have the exact flavor of its poignancies. Then, apparently for want of a better ending, she has Freda smashed in an absurd accident. So meaningless is her death that the outing continues with her corpse in the back seat of a mini. Back at the factory, the body is put in a hogshead and sent to Spain — an X on the outside indicates that it is defective, not to be refilled. Before its embarrelment, Freda's un seeing body is taken on a tour of a children's zoo where listless animals sprawl in English Damp. The theme of this novel is the waste of human energy. Like the animals who in their own habitat would live on the alert and die ferociously but who languish in a zoo to amuse the Sunday outings of an industrial culture, all the people in Miss Bainbridge's novel are out of context. Where they belong she does not say, but she has a firm sense that they are camping out on the mudflats of a wasteland. Outings on a Sunday—Italians probably invented them—are a cultural index, and Miss Bainbridge frames her story with one because she can round out her studies in character with an extreme test of character: what a person does when he has nothing to do. In the bottle factory life follows the age‐old rhythms of funnel, cork and label. In Brenda and Freda's apartment, unznatching components of a family bang about in a chaos of disconnections; on the outing everything goes wrong from first to last. Not even the feigned community of a party maintains. Miss Bainbridge keeps her sense of comedy throughout. Comedy concerns itself with knowing how to live and makes its jokes out of people who don't know how. She is curious to see how her characters, all sensible and all full of good will, can botch their best efforts with such consistency. One reason is that each is blinded by a private and mistaken view of everybody else. Amenities perfected by the Late Stone Age, such as eating, defecation, conversation and sex, are all insurmountable problems in this novel. And when the rhythms of industry can better accommodate the ritual of burial than any rhythm available to Miss Bainbridge's characters, we have a complete picture of people from whom every advantage has escaped leaving them to reinvent a culture, and to wring their hands. Loss of culture is comic; loss of civilization is tragic. Miss Bainbridge has her comic eye on cultural confusion. She makes us see that it goes deeper than we think and touches more widely than we had imagined. The most appalling muddles can still be laughed at, and laughter is a kind of understanding. ■ Mirror Mirror By Harriet Waugh. 250 pp. Boston: Little. Brown & Co. $7.95.

Pro‐Abortion Groups Rallying,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/08/archives/proabortion-groups-rallying.html,"CHERRY HILL—When the New Jersey Medical Society held its convention here last weekend, officials mistakenly told Fran Avallone that an exhibit booth for her proabortion Right to Choose group would cost $450, rather than the $150 that was actually charged, and warned that she could not distribute her literature without a booth. Mrs. Avallone ignored the warning, attended the convention as the guest of Dr. Samuel Breslow, a Perth Amboy gynecologist, and quietly distributed the literature. Her determination wad evident of a new momentum among pro ‐ abortion proponents, who now say they have been too complacent since the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision sanctioning abortion. Their complacency withstood several years of extremely active campaigning by antiabortion Right to Life groups. It began to crumble last year, when a bill banning Medicaid payments fqr legal abortions was introduced‐in the State Senate. The measure, which was approved last month, now awaits Governor Byrne's signature. ‘Time to Get Busy’ Pro ‐ abortion supporters also have been jarred by a bill calling for a Constitutional Convention to eliminate abortions altogether. The measure was approved by the Senate's Judiciary Committee last month. “If we ever knew it was time for the silent majority on an abortion issue to get busy, it is now,” Mrs. Avallone said in an interview. “All the polls show that we are in the majority on this issue, and so we have been thinking the battle was over. Obviously, it wasn't.” The mother of two children, Mrs. Avallone has been devoting all the time she can spare to her volunteer job with Right to Choose. The group contends that women should have the right to make their own decision regarding abortion; it is affiliated with the National Abortion Rights Action League and has 1,000 members throughout the state. Lee Bullitt of Franklin Township was at a meeting in Princeton last spring at which Right to Choose was organized. “We had been doing almost nothing,” Mrs. Bullitt recalled, “and then the Medicaid‐ban bill really brought us to our senses. “We started Right to Choose.” “Legislators have heard from the anti‐choice people so much that they are numb,” Mrs. Avallone asserted. “One Democratic Assemblyman showed me a telegram urging him to vote for the Medicaid ban. It was from well‐known Republicans who consistently worked against him. Still he voted their way and did not seem to care that they never supported him and we did.” Right to Choose is not the only pro‐abortion group that has become alarmed over the possibility of losing out on the abortion issue in New Jersey. In November, a state chapter of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights was born, also as a result of the Medicaid bill. It is composed of 11 organizations, including the New Jersey Council of Y.W.C.A.'s the National Council of Jewish Women and the Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ. A Fight for Choice The Rev. Raymond Pontier of Passaic is coordinator of the group. He, too, feels that those who believe in abortion rights have suddenly realized that they are fighting a tough adversary and are beginning to strike back. Coalition members have varying opinions on abortion. “What we do agree on,” Mr. Pontier said. “is that every individual has a right to make her own choice on the issue, guided by her own conscience. “We are trying to let the legislators know that the abortion question is an openended one. In lobbying, I have found that legislators are very receptive. They have so much harassment from the other side. We add a healthy kind of balance that might give them some courage.” Mrs Susan Ranski of Bayonne, a member of a national organization called Catholics for a Free Choice is hopeful that a state chapter of the group will be formed soon. Barbara Babcock of the National Organization of Women is not so optimistic about the new push from the pro‐abortion groups. As N.O.W.'s state coordinator for Right to Choose, she has found that women who want to retain abortion rights are still too apathetic. “If we can just wake up the feminists to what is happening in New Jersey, we'll be doing something,” Mrs. Babcock said. “At this point, I still feel we may lose the whole ball game.” Senator Matthew Feldman, Democrat of Bergen County, opposed the Medicaid ban. He also feels that the proabortion battle is almost lost in New Jersey. “This is a last‐minute try for the pro‐abortion people,” Senator Feldman said. “They may be working had to change the attitude of New Jersey, but they will have to work harder to counteract the Right to Life groups.” One Assemblyman who did not want his name used said he had mixed feelings on the abortion issue, but he added: “One thing is certain: The State Legislature will vote for every antiabortion bill that comes down the pike, and the Right to Choose people might as well face it.”"
"If The Decision Is Abortion, What Is the Man's Attitude?",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/11/archives/if-the-decision-is-abortion-what-is-the-mans-attitude-informal.html,"Some spend the four‐hour wait enclosed in silence. Others, hungry for diversion, talk—mostly about sports. All look furtively at every newcomer who drifts through the waiting room for signs of recognition or, worse yet, a camera. They are the more or less ignored partners in the abortion procedure: the men whose wives or girlfriends are terminating an unwanted pregnancy. What impact does abortion have on the male? What voice did he have in the decision and what motivated him” to advocate it? What services should be offered to him? Officials of Parkmed, a private, state licensed outpatient clinic, which has performed 64,000 first trimester suction ‐ curettage abortions since its opening on May 8, 1971, decided to find out. “We were surprised to find so many men escorting women,” said Dr. Milton Danon, an anesthesiologist who is administrator of Parkmed. “We wondered what we could do for those men.” Informal Chats In an admittedly informal and unscientific inquiry, Eileen Milling, the clinic's public relations consultant, spent Saturdays from May through September last year, chatting with, the men in the waiting room of the facility at 475 Park Avenue South. Mrs. Milling did not divulge her identity, but she questioned only those men amenable to her questions. “Generally, nobody pays attention to the guys. They responded to me because they needed someone to talk to,” she recalled at the clinic recently. When she completed the interviews with 400 men ranging in age from 17 to 62, she realized that she had sufficiently significant information for a report. Her findings were printed in a recent issue of Woman's Life magazine. Mrs. Milling found that the overriding concern of all the men was for the physical condition of the woman during and immediately after the abortion. Despite the fact that 50 per cent of the men interviewed said they were Roman Catholic feelings of guilt never surfaced in their remarks. And when there were vestiges of guilt, they came from an unexpected source. “Single males between the ages of 17 and 19, while seemingly the most hip, were the ones most bothered by guilt feelings and Moral implications, even though sexual permissiveness and legalized abortion are closest to their growing‐up years,” Mrs. Milling observed. “The young are so afraid, that then parents will find out, and usually that fear is unfounded,” said Dr. Danon who is often asked to tell the parents one the telephone. Reject Birth Control Asked why there was so little expression of transgressign against religious tenets, Ardis Danon, his wife and former assistant administrator, explained, “These people are not using any birth control for religious reasons. They're just crossing their fingers and hoping nothing happens. When they're faced with a pregnancy they just can't cross their fingers any more. “I had the wife of an antiabortion leader tell me. ‘I was against abortion last month, and I'll probably be against it next month, but right now I need it.’” Of the non‐Catholic population represented in the study, 30 per cent said they were Protestant, 10 per, cent were Jewish. Two per cent belonged to other faiths and 8 per cent had no affiliation. Two–thirds of the men were white, one‐quarter black and the rest Puerto Rican, Oriental and Indian. Of the men questioned, 240 were single, 138 were married, 16 were separated and 6 were widowed. For the single men, immediate marriage was not considered a suitable solution to the pregnancy. “In addition to school and/or insufficient income,” the report said, “other reasons cited by more than 75 per cent of unmarried males included lack of maturity and uncertainty in handling additional responsibilities, need to find oneself, upward lob mobility, different race or religion, personal views about parenthood.” Of the 218 bachelors between 20 and 39 years of age, more than half said their relationships were serious and would endure. Many planned eventual marriage. “Look, I'm sure she wouldhave wanted to get married and have the baby, but once I explained to her—she's 19 —that this was the wrong reason for marriage, she agreed that abortion was the only alternative,” said a 23‐year old policeman. As they left, he gave his girlfriend an engagement ring: Some had contemplated marriage and then decided against it. There also were those who did not want to forego any measure of freedom. “We have a great relationship. It's filled with love and mutual respect.” said a 35‐year old accountant who has lived with the same woman for 10 years. ‘Best of Everything’ But marriage? “Marriage is one hassle after another. So are kids,” he continued. “We have the best of everything and want to keep it that way.” Not one man spoke of the fetus, and not one said he would consider an out‐ofwedlock birth, Mrs. Milling reported. Nor did giving the child up fors adoption appear to have been considered. “Why should she be burdened for nine months to hear our child that will be raised by someone else?” a 25‐year‐old freelance writer asked. Of the 138 married men in the survey, most said their families were already large enough and that they were concerned for the burdens another child would place on their wife or the strains it would put on the marriage. Men whose wives were working or had resumed abandoned careers were loathe to give up the income. Parkmed officials said most of the cases seemed to have happy endings. “Couples cling to one another and look so happy and relieved,” Mrs. Milling said. One case even had an O. Henry‐like ending. That was the time, Dr. Danon recalled, that a man accompanied his girlfriend to her abortion only to find his wife had an appointment at the same time. “We put them in a room together to thrash it out,” Dr. Danon said. “The girlfriend stayed to have the abortion, and the wife went home to have the baby.”"
Looking at the Role of Father What it Has Been and Might Be,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/13/archives/looking-at-the-role-of-father-what-it-has-been-and-might-be.html,"AKRON, Ohio—Maybe Suitday's celebration of Father's Day ought to be called off. The stretch socks could be returned to the store while there's still time. All those trophies declaring “The World's Greatest Dad” could be melted down into something useful. If that sounds extreme, just listen in on an unusual course called Fatherhood given at the University of Akron. The class discussion points to little worth celeInfluenced by the belief of Dr. Sullivan, who is a professor of family life, that “others have unconsciously stolen away the child‐rearing role. Pat McClendon, a married student who does not yet have children, said that before she took the course she found herself thinking “about what kind of relationship had with, my. father, and I realized we had no relationship at all. He brought home the money, and that was When she entered the brating in the traditional father. One student after another, in discussing why he or she took the course, relates some dismal tale of a distant father, unresponsive to the emotional needs of children, misguided into thinking that the giving of things means the giving of love—the irritable man a child waits for when mother says, “Just Wait till your father gets home.” Stirs National Interest The class, which is now two years old, has stirred some national interest beCause it concentrates on the male parent rather than, as sits instructor, Dr. Joyce Sullivan, puts it, on “the discussions of lactation and pregnancy” that dominate other college courses on parenthood. And the direction of this two‐credit course is strongly course, she wondered if she was the only one who felt like that. “But then Dr. Sullivan was talking about fathers being unemotional and distant,” she recalled, “and there were 30 or 35 other people nodding their heads and going, ‘Yeah, yeah, that's how it is.’ “ It wasn't just the 36 women in the class of 48 who felt deprived of paternal closeness. “Fathers in a way can't show love,” George Frankovich said, “They do, but it's a different type than mother's love. Mothers can hug you, but when a boy reaches a certain age, it's hands off, and ‘How yuh doin’ kid? Everything has to be manly.” He said that tht result in his family was that he couldn't talk to his farther about many things that mattered—“the things that involve emotional feelings; it's easier to go to mom.” The class discussed three historical stages of fatherhood. The agncultural father was said to have been close to his family in everyone worked n a unit. The industrial father moved into the city where the division of labor developed‐father goes to work, mother stays home to raise children. In World War Il women went to work, and in the postwar phase, there was the gradual shift toward more equality in the home, a shift given a boost by women's lib. But since most students in the class were teen‐agers or in their early twenties, their parents were of the pre‐lib generation. in any case, research projects that the students did indicated that as much as the situation might be changing there was still a lot of coldness emanating from fathers. One project yielded results that showed fathers moving gradually away from their children emotionally as the children grew older, while mothers seemed to be moving, if anything, closer. Historical Perspective Shirley Rutledge, who was taking the course for her husband, who “really wanted to, but didn't have the time,” said the historical perspective had given her some insights. She described life with father this way: “I can't ever remember kissing him, except for that goodnight kiss. Mother would say ‘Kiss your father goodnight,’ and she'd say, ‘You know your father loves you,’ but my father never said that to me.” “Yet,” Mrs. Rutledge continued, “I realize that my father saw his job as providing monetary support for the family, and he worked two or three jobs and hardly ever saw us. it must have been an awful strain on him.” Mrs. McClendon, who now sees her father only about once a year, said he had always wanted to give her things “whether I wanted them or not — he gave me a bike before I wanted it and gave me a car when I really didn't want it.” “I feel sorry for him,” she said. “He missed so much.” For many of the young people in the class there is the determination that they as fathers or that their husbands will do better this generation around. Kathleen Elliott, who brings her 5‐month old, Amy, to class, says that she has in fact seen a visible change. “My father held the children and changed them but It was more out of necessity because there were eight of us,” Mrs. Elliott says. “My husband really wants to do those things. My dad's theory was, ‘Bring them to me when they're grown—I'll get involved then.’ My husband's feeling is, ‘I want to be totally involved now.’ “ In addition to history, the class dealt with such topics as fatherhood and the law (Dr. Sullivan points out, for instance, the legal powerlessness of fathers when women decide to have abortions), fatherhood in other countries and father's role in the delivery room. Among the class readings was an article that took an unpopular position, declaring in its title, “Fathers Shouldn't Try to Be Mothers,” and explaining that men did not. fulfull themselves in the home but in society as a whole. Another article argued that the only reason fathers weren't motherlike was that they wanted to retain the more powerful position of breadwinner. ‘Reluctant Drag‐In’ Through it all, Bill Chrisant, who has been married for two years, remained skeptical. From the start he was what Darrell McDonald, the graduate teaching assistant, calls “a reluctant dragin”—his pregnant wife insisted that he attend the course. He thought that, regardless of the way most of the class felt, “the father's role is secondary.” After all, he said, “The mother is the one who gives birth, and she's the one who spends the most time with the child. It's a fact, the way things are right now.” And he thought the class, which wanted to make war on stereotypes, actually clung to some. He said, “You see all these men being painted into stereotypes — they can't love, they can't communicate with children.” But he conceded that the class had been getting to him. “I hadn't foreseen any problems with my child until I took this course,” he said. “I began to wonder, is it really going to be that hard to relate to a child? I'm really not a very emotional person, and the course says, ‘Here's your child, now you've got to love it. But they don't tell you how‐and just telling you to do it doesn't work. It's got to be natural.” One thing the course has convinced him to do is to go into the delivery room with his wife. “I hadn't intended to,” he said, “I thought I'd just be a third wheel (“Oh no, you're so wrong,” a woman student blurted out before he'd finished). “But now,” he said, “I think it's a start. it could help.” Parents/Children"
Multiracial Families Hold Outing to Show They're Normal,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/15/archives/multiracial-families-hold-outing-to-show-theyre-normal.html,"WESTBURY—A group of adoptive parents brought their children to a picnic at the Friends School here last weekend in an effort to dispel the notion that multiracial families are unusual. The children, who romped and played at the affair, sponsored by the Open Door Society of Long Island, an adoptive referral group with 500 family memberships, once would have been classified as unadoptable and doomed to live in institutions or foster homes. “We're no different than any other family,” said 17‐year‐old Tyrone Hart, a black foster child who has lived for two years with white foster parents. “We all fight together. We are a very good family.” Young Hart's foster parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Caperna of Holbrook, a small community in Suffolk County, have eight other youngsters, including several who are biracial. Mrs. Caperna is also a co‐founder of Open Door. “They don't really know what I am,” said Paul Caperna, 16, who classifies himself as Korean. “They found me in Korea, and put me in an orphanage until the Capernas adopted me nine years ago. At first I was called names, but the people didn't know me … Now they do, and they are my friends.” Paul's white sister, blondhaired Jodi Caperna, 8, said, “The ‘worsenest’ fight I ever had was when my friend said things about my brother's and sister's color. She [the friend] doesn't say anything any more.” Open Door, founded six years ago, is a nonprofit and nonsectarian organization whose primary goal is to inform potential parents of children who are available for adoption. However, with the legalization of abortion, the number of children has dwindled, and the members are now promoting adoption of the “hard to place,” but “easy to love” children, said the society's president, Jack Janson of Coram. “We have placed more than 800 children in Long Island and metropolitan New York homes sine our inception,” said Mr. Janson. “Most of these were considered hard to place children.” Mr. Janson has four children a Korean, Puerto Rican and two biological children, a term used by society members to differentiate their adopted children from their natural born. “I guess you would call us a child advocacy group,” he said. Mr. Janson explained that Open Door works with 24 agencies who are constantly updating their adoptive listings. “Many biological families are not even aware they are eligible for state subsidies if they adopt these children,” Mr. Janson said. “Of course, this financial aid is based on a sliding scale depending on one's salary and number of dependents.” He advised interested couples to call (516) 585‐5433 for information. The founders of Open Door, Mrs. Caperna and Mrs. Henry Young, formed the organization after attending a three‐day transracial adoption seminar in Montreal in 1969. Although Open Door is active throughout the nation, it is autonomous, and in its first year of operation was responsible for placing 120 children in Long Island homes. John Sheehan, a spokesman for Suffolk County Social Services, said the county has a staff member who attends Open Door informational meetings as a liaison to observe and provide input for the county. The department, when requested by an approved agency, also provides home studies for residents wishing to adopt children here and overseas. Studies are required before county and agency adoptions are approved. Nassau County, on the other hand, does studies for residents wishing to adopt children in county custody, but does not do studies for overseas adoptions. Its residents rely on private agencies for these reports. Because of a departmental transfer, Nassau has no liaison representative with Open Door, but a county worker does attend special meetings and supplies speakers for the society. “Many of the Open D???r members have adopted children from us,” said Dorcas Carlos, a spokeswoman for Nassau Social Services. “We have placed many of our children in excellent homes because of Open Door. Our rapport with them is excellent”"
"Refugees Are Welcomed By One State, at Least",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/15/archives/refugees-are-welcomed-by-one-state-at-least.html,"SEATTLE—“Washington State,” eald Mai Hoang An, a South Vietnamese refugee, “is very kindly toward us.” It has, in tact, been very kindly toward several hundred South Vietnamese refugees. Almost two months after the fall of that Southeast Asian nation as the Federal Government's refugee aid program struggles with its burden, Washington is the only state to have its own official operating refugee resettlement program. The program, widely supported in this northwest corner of the United States, involves a broad range of state agencies from Emergency Services to Employment Security. From Seaview on the west to Bossburg on the east, state employes are out in search of homes, jobs and apartments for the refugees. In California's Camp Pendleton, Washington state recruiters shepherd their charges through immigration processing and onto airliners to the space‐age Seattle‐Tacoma Airport where a ranking state official greets each load with smiles, flowers and handshakes. When supplies or sponsors are needed, Washington radio and TV stations broadcast special pleas. When Le Dac Ho went for his driver's license examination, Dean Hudson, a major in the National Guard, drove him there—and back, as it happens, because Mr. Ho flunked. Why should people in the state that made the B‐52 bomber and lost 1,010 men in Vietnam, rise up to help so enthusiastically? And then not assign a public relations man to boast about it? “Well,” said Gov. Daniel J. Evans, a Republican, “it just seemed like the right thing to do.” Such a step, taken decisively without fanfare, would be in full accord with the historic social and ‘political patterns of much of the West, especially Washington State and Oregon, where more value placed on doing than on talking about doing. While other states and the Congress were debating the need for financial disclosures by public officials, Washington State citizens quickly distributed petitions, sparked a voter's initiative and required full and complete financial disclosures by all state officials, even unpaid ones. Years before Eastern states and cities defeated proposals to require deposits on all beer and soft drink containers, as an anti‐litter step, Oregon imposed just such a law. Seattle may vote on a similar provision this fall. And recently, Oregon's legislature also banned aerosol cans with chlorofluorcarbons because they threaten the earth's ozone layer. Both states have stiff antipollution codes that are enforced. When one paper company threatened to close a mill rather than install costly improvements, Oregon's past Gov. Tom McCall said, “Okay.” The company then backed down. And the salmon now are back in the Williamette River. Both states long ago liberalized their abortion laws. And voters using intitiative and recall seem to hold their elected representatives closely to account, especially if they seem to be shedding their mantle of citizen‐legislator to become professional politicians. As a result, only 11 of Oregon's 90 state legislators are lawyers. The rest are doctors, farmers, teachers and others whose life remains primarily rooted their district, not in Olympia or Salem. Political gatherings in the Pacific Northwest, rarely illuminated by the bleaching white lights of television cameras, are more like local Kiwanis luncheons than giant political rallies. Party labels also seem to mean less hereabouts. an official seems worthy, he is elected and re‐elected as witness Senators Warren Magnuson and Henry Jackson in Washington and Senators Mark Hatfield and Robert Packwood and Representative Al Ullman of Oregon. Governor Evans here is in his third term. There remains, too, in the Northwest a certain humane scale to life, even in the cities. The metropolitan areas of Seattle and Portland have over million residents. But trees grow downtown and shiny brass drinking fountains gush fresh water for sidewalk strollers. Dense forests or stunning waterfalls wait a few minutes from downtown. Not all that far away either is Asia, which maintains strong trade ties with the Pacific Northwest, principally Seattle, and which over the years has provided a steady stream of immigrants, especially from Hong Kong. These immigrants have mingled well with the hard‐working Scandinavian stock. And Governor Evans speculates that the hostility toward Vietnamese refugees expressed elsewhere in the United States is based on ignorance and fear that the new refugees may work harder and succeed better than many so‐called native Americans. A view of Seattle, Washington. Washington Helps Settle the Vietnamese Because ‘It Just Seems Right’"
The Abortive Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/15/archives/the-abortive-revolution.html,"As Indochina “falls” one thinks of how China was “lost” Lon Nol and Thieu tread an ashen path that Chiang Kai‐shek blazed before them. Why do Washington's favorites on the mainland of Asia lose? When and how might we have effectively pursued a different policy? And, in the mirror of China's case, what can we learn about how Asian Communist states turn out after the leap of liberation gives way to the crawl of construction?

Twitchett. 170 pp. New York Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company. $75. In “The Abortive Revolution” Lloyd Eastman shows why Chiang Kai‐shek tailed to win the Chinese people or retain full power for long corruption, over — militarization, currency misjuggling, purges and repression as the Kuomintang shriveled from a movement into a fascist clique, tax levies that the people simply could not pay. America bore no part of the blame for the mess Chiang made in the decade when he really had his chance. Eastman does a superb autopsy on the corpse of the Kuomintang. His book is sober, industrious, clear, judicious. It is packed with information and shrewd judgments that come from a mastery of Chinese and Japanese sources. But “The Abortive Revolution” is all abortion and no revolution; it chronicles Chiang's errors without making clear whether his success would have amounted to much. I do not be. lieve, as Eastman does, that the Nanking Government was bent on a task big enough to be called a revolution. The poverty of Chiang's virtues is more striking to me than the long list of his vices. Even if Chiang had succeeded in the particular tasks he set himself, he would not have gotten China together again. Eastman is unclear about this because he defines the Kuomintang's aim solely in terms of the search for a political form. You do not make a revolution by constructing a political form; that emerges after the social system has changed. The fancy state structure of the Kuomintang period was a gargoyle, like Thieu's new constitution of 1967 or one of Lon Nol's reshuffled cabinets. Eastman dismisses with hauteur scholars who have “a penchant for class analysis”—like a leaning for Scotch. Yet class was the heart of the matter. The Communists won because of whom they served. The issue was constituency. The key to it was class analysis not “dedication” on the part of leaders. Mao worked out a view of the world that stemmed from a theory of semicolonialism. His army took life from the villages as fish take theirs from water. He built up political power (not political form) on that peasant base—that is what he was doing during the “Nanking decade” when he is magnificently absent in Eastman's narrative. Mao used the political power he had won to batter down the old society, and only later did he raise the issue of political forms. The Communist success is summed up by the war with Japan. Eastman says Tokyo's attack may have wrecked Chiang's chances of creating his new political form. Mao on the other hand made the war a springboard to victory. He tapped patriotic sentiment and merged it with a mass movement fir revolution. Eastman quotes Chiang's policy: “First unite within, then resist the enemy without.” We will never understand the loss of China (or the fall of Cambodia and Vietnam) if we suppose that Chiang's slogan meant mere chronological order of tasks. Chiang did not believe in a unity that embraced Communists, only one that exterminated them. Mao won against Chiang because he saw that resisting Japan on a broad front and moving on to socialism were one process. Books on Chinese foreign policy have seldom had an organizing theme; John Gittings's does, and it is the right one Chairman Mao's thought. “The World and China” is as acute a book as we have had on China's foreign policy. Gittings weighs with care Mao's ideas about the world, treating 1949 not as the starting point but as a stage in the development of Mao's view of international politics; and his writing is full of the awareness (just now reaching the scholarly mainstream) that Peking's policies have been less a blueprint for ambitious action than a way of coping with a superior power on its doorstep. Gittings is a fiery satellite in the left‐wing outer orbit of academia who now writes for The Manchester Guardian and feels the need to fire shots at Americans, even when he must know the shots will miss. A weakness of his crisp book is that, when he comes to a questionable patch in Peking's foreign policy, he is content to merely raise his eyebrow rather than dissect the problem. Toward the end he also becomes scrappy; he is better on the roots than the shoots of Peking's policies and tends to go astray when he deals with the non‐Chinese end of a relationship. But the theme of Gittings's book—that Mao has a longstanding and original view of the world, the heart of which is an idea about how imperialism relates to social change, and that Chinese foreign policy has been based on this view‐is spun with skill, economy, and just the right dose of passion. If Gittings is a scholar in the robes of a polemicist, K. S. Karol is a journalist with a longing for a scholar's robes —hence he lacks Gittings's concision. A Pole who has lived in Russia but now prefers the less stern air of Paris, Karol does not read Chinese, as Eastman and Gittings do, but he knows enough of the Western studies of China to alternate between leaning on and attacking them. A socialist terrier who gnaws at any bone that might yield him truth, Karol grew to dislike Soviet socialism and wrote a book, “China: The Other Communism,” to show that the Chinese type was better. Now he gives us his hopes and his worries about the Cultural Revolution in a book not as rich as the previous one, but distinguished for its intelligence and frankness. The unusual merit of Karol's angle of vision in “The Second Chinese Revolution” makes up for his unawareness of important documentary sources. More than all visitors to China except Edgar Snow, Karol has been able to probe conflicts in high places. More than most Western writers he keeps a steady head about the C.C.P.'s struggles. He does not draw a veil over them, as Gittings sometimes does, but he doesn't forget that power struggles in China are often about issues. Karol goes beyond Gittings in wrestling with the issues of how we know what we know about China, and he chides Peking for dishing up morality tales instead of frank accounts of setbacks: “I believe that the Chinese workers were perfectly capable of understanding why Liu Shao‐ch'i was not the right man for the situation of 1966 and why Lin Piao could not be retained in power in 1971.” The feuds and flux of the Cultural Revolution gave play to the regional diversities of the one quarter of mankind that is China. In few lands does geography so influence politics, and the handsome “The Times Atlas of China” is a gold mine of information on China's land, peoples, climate, resources and economy. One even learns that one third of the world's pigs are Chinese. To browse in these maps and text is an antidote to the domino theory. The levers of power in a continent twice Europe's size, you feel, must move by laws different from those in a shrimp of territory like Laos. No wonder the 850‐m‐lion Chinese who dwell among those rivers and mountains are still rather isolationist. No wonder they evolved the chessboard strategy of “people's war.” The editors have surmounted some but not all of the myriad problems that faced them. Since the data stems from various years it ought to be dated in each case (Chekiang's population is up‐to‐date. Liaoning's is not; one map of Shanghai is fresh, while another with different spellings is so old that it includes the International Racecourse). The city maps are mostly too sparse to be useful. It is a pity that the oil statistics, among other economic data, date only from 1970; China's oil output has trebled since then. And small errors have crept in, including a table for world crop production that does not add up correctly, a wrong figure for the area of Peking municipality and misprints that are a nuisance in a reference work. Karol is a European to whom the problems of socialism mean more than to Americans. Yet it is we who have been singed. not Europe, by the surge of the East Asian left over the past quarter century. As the dust settles what we can learn deals with what we may have to expect as much as what we will be able to do. It is not only what we did in Asia but who we were that counted. We were not peasants, and we were not Asians. Dean Acheson warned the Chinese in 1950 not to be “led by their rulers into aggressive or subversive adventures beyond their borders.” Chou En‐lai replied: “Cool down and look at the map.” Since 1970 Cambodia is nut the latest of many cases where rightist and militarist policies have directly bred the Communism they were supposed to combat. It was Japan's militarism, more than Moscow's that eased Mao's path to power; Ky and Thieu who got rid of the moderate left that was once an alternative to Communism in Saigon; Lon Nol and the C.I.A. who knocked Sihanouk off his perch and let the Khmer Rouge climb into his place. China is vast and deep, as the Atlas shows us, and what the United States did there could never have swayed the outcome of the civil war as much as it could, and in a bizarre way did, in Indochina. What Washington could have done, but did not because ideology obscured the option, was to have reacted to Chiang's decline by keeping its hand free to deal with any strong Chinese government after 1945 and by moving in 1948 to prevent the United States being locked into enmity with Mao. This ought to be the policy toward the new order in Phnom Penh and Saigon, and if it is, the issue of who rules in those two cities need not cause Americans much loss of sleep. Is Mr. Ford farsighted enough to discern the potency of nationalism—there will be splits among the Communist minnows as there was a split between the two giants. And is he farsighted enough to believe that diplomacy and an ample purse will do more for America in East Asia than B‐52s and right‐wing generals who make their own people the enemy by practicing fierce repression at home and tame dependence abroad? Mao's view of the world has worn well: “The U.S. puts its bases everywhere,” he remarked in 1956, “just like an ox with its tail tied to a post, but what good can that do?” But China's new sense of security might itself eventually chip away at the consensus which Mao rallied behind the twists of his policy. Yet whatever China's problems, and Indochina's, it is Mao's friends who will be tackling them. Communism has won the right to face the future in a broad band of Asia that we once fancied as our own. The time has come to cool down and look at the map."
Prosecution of Montreal Doctor in Abortions Stirs Wide Debate in Canada,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/15/archives/prosecution-of-montreal-doctor-in-abortions-stirs-wide-debate-in.html,"OTTAWA, June 14—Court proceedings against a Montreal surgeon who says he has illegally terminated more than 5,000 pregnancies has stirred an emotional debate over the rigid Canadian law governing abortions. The surgeon, Dr. Henry Morgentaler, was acquitted by a jury in Montreal in 1973 on a charge of having performed an illegal abortion on an unmarried student from Sierra Leone. The Quebec Ministry of Justice appealed to a higher court, which reversed the verdict. That decision was upheld by a majority of six justices of the Canadian Supreme Court in March, with Chief Justice Bora Laskin and two others dissenting. Last Monday, Dr. Morgentaler won a second acquittal by a jury, this time on a charge of having performed an illegal abortion on an unmarried 17‐year‐old. Again the Quebec Government gave notice of appeal, and announced that Dr. Morgentaler would also have to face 10 additional abortion charges. Serving a Jail Permit Besides bringing the abortion question to a boil in the Canadian Parliament and elsewhere, the Morgentaler case has also brought the status of jury verdicts into question. Meanwhile, Dr. Morgentaler, 52 years old, is serving an 18‐month jail sentence on the 1973 conviction. While in jail in Montreal, Dr. Morgentaler was named cowinner, with Betty Friedan, the feminist, of the Humanist of the Year award of the American Humanist Association. Later, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau referred to Dr. Morgentaler, in a speech, as “a fine humanitarian.“ Critics of the manner in which Dr. Morgentaler was jailed contend that the higher court's reversal of the jury's verdict, instead of ordering a new trial, set a questionable precedent in Canadian jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Louis‐Philippe Pigeon, declared that the Canadian statute permitting conviction by an appeal court, instead of a jury, is “clearly a fundamental departure from common law principles.” However, the decision let the action stand on the basis of the law. Former Prime Minister Jchn Diefenbaker, terming the proceedings against Dr. Morgentaler an “orgy of persecution,” demanded in the House of Commons on Thursday that Justice Minister Otto Lang initiate legislation to change the law so that “henceforth no Court of Appeals shall be able to circumvent and undermine a jury by substituting its own views.” Mr. Lang, who has been accused of overly rigid enforcement of the abortion law, replied that “comment on a matter which is quite properly before the courts” would be “completely improper.” Mr. Lang, a Roman Catholic and father of seven children, defended the appeal court actiara against Dr. Morgentaler in a radio interview the previous night “There was no way a jury could properly reach any verdict but guilty and therefore they substituted that verdict for the jury verdict,” he said in the interview. One Hour for Acquittal The jury in Dr. Morgentaler's second trial took only an hour of deliberation to acquit the surgeon. On the panel were a truck driver, who was the foreman, four mothers of three to eight children each, an unmarried career woman, a banker, a construction analyst, a welder, a plumber, a factory worker and a carpenter. According to newspaper accounts of the latest trial, which was conducted in French, thei official language of Quebec Province, the prosecution's evidence showing that Dr. Morgentaler maintained elaborate equipment for performing abortions helped the defendant, as did the testimony of the woman on whorl the operation was performed who is now married Ito the man by whom she had become pregnant. Under a Canadian law enacted in 1969, an abortion may be performed legally only in specified hospitals after a standing cgmmittee of three doctors at the hospital has certified that continuation of the pregnancy would be “likely to endanger” the woman's “life or health.” Only 27 of the 281 hospitals in Quebec have the required committees and even fewer actually provide the operation “routinely,” according to a letter to Prime Minister Trudeau and other high officials criticizing the abortion law, signed by 350 professor and students at McGill University in Montreal. In a Gallup Poll last September on the question whether abortion should be a decisior solely for a woman and her doctor, 62 per cent of those questioned were in favor and 31 per cent opposed. According to Statistics Canada, the governmental agency for tabulating information, 43,201 legal abortions were performed in Canada last year There wos no official figure. on illegal abortions."

"COURT, 8‐0, VOIDS FEES FIXED BY BAR FOR HOME SALES",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/17/archives/court-80-voids-fees-fixed-by-bar-for-home-sales-supreme-bench.html,"WASHINGTON, June 16—The uniform minimum legal fees that many lawyers charge home buyers for real estate transfers were banned today by a unanimous Supreme Court as a form of illegal pricefixing that violates the antitrust laws. The decision, Involving a single suburban Virginia transaction, appeared certain to bring down the real estate closing costs that virtually all consumers and many lawyers have regarded as artificially high in many sections of the country. By banning fixed legal fees set by bar associations, the 8‐to‐0 ruling opened the way, at least by implication, for competitive pricing by lawyers and thus—although most bar associations now ban it—for some form of reporting to the public of different charges made by different lawyers. Commissions in Peril Also clearly threatened by the Supreme Court's decision were the compacts among real estate sales companies in a given community under which a uniform percentage of the purchase price of a home is charged as a commission, with no effective competition permitted. Because the decision effectively eliminated the antitrust exemption claimed in the past by the “learned professions,” it also had potential impact on the fees charged by such groups as architects, engineers and certified public accountants. The Supreme Court ruling was confined to real estate transactions, which the Court classed as part of interstate commerce, leaving doubt as to how the Justices would regard lawyers' fee schedules for other kinds of local activity, such as divorce or criminal cases. No Minimum Schedules Here At the close of the Court's opinion, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that states may properly insulate some professions from “demoralizing” competition and that today's decision placed only “certain anticompetitive conduct” within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws. A 1974 survey by the American Bar Association indicated that 19 state bar associations recommended statewide minimum fee schedules, with a number of others having rescinded them in recent years. Among 12 states that said they had never had such schedules were New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In its brief in today's case, the Department of Justice reported that 750 local bar associations engaged in this kind of professional price‐fixing. Generally, however, only state bar groups can discipline members who undercut the minimum fees. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. a former member of the Virginia Bar Association, which was a defendant in the case, did not participate in today's decision. The case arose in 1971 when Lewis and Ruth Goldfarb applied to a Virginia lawyer for a title search of the home they were buying in Reston, a Washington suburb. Told it would cost $522, they wrote to 19 other lawyers and got identical estimates, based on the state fee schedule. The Goldfarhs brought an antitrust action against the Fairfax County and Virginia Bar Associations, charging violations of the Sherman Act prohibition on price ‐ fixing. They won an injunction against the county fee schedule in Federal District Court, which ruled, however, that the state suits as an agency of the state bar was exempt from such suits as an agency of the state government. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed as to the immunity of the state bar but reversed as to the county bar. It found the associations exempt from antitrust prosecution both because the law was a “learned profession” and because the real estate transactions were not in interstate commerce. The Supreme Court reversed both positions of the appellate court. Chief Justice Burger called, the Virginia fee system “a classic illustration of price fixing,” where would‐be homeowners had no alternative source of service because the legal profession had established “a fixed, rigid price floor.” While acknowledging the professional status of lawyers, Chief Justice Burger declared, “It cannot be denied that the activities of lawyers play an iroportant part in commercial intercourse and that anticompetitive activities by lawyers may exert a restraint on commerce.” The American Bar Association, which had asked the Supreme Court to affirm the “learned profession” exemption of lawyers from antitrust prosecution, said today that the ruling was “complex, and other cases will have to he decided before its full impact is understood.” James D. Fellers, president of the A.B.A., said in a statement that “the opinion was not unexpected, and, in my view, certainly will not make it more difficult for the legal profession to carry out its duty.” John W. Douglas, president of the District of Columbia bar, called the ruling “an excellent result for the legal profession and the public.” The National Society of Pro fessional Engineers, which also, has an antitrust case against it pending before the high court, said that today's decision was not controlling because it did not establish whether fee‐bidding by engineers could be prohibited as unethical. ADS FOR ABORTIONS In another decision, the Justices invalidated a Virginia statute, since amended, that prohibited publication within the state of advertisements for legal out‐of‐state abortion services. The majority in the 7‐to‐2 decision said the ad was proJected by the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment. Jeffrey C. Bigelow, editor of a weekly newspaper in Charlottesville, Va., had been convicted of a misdemeanor for printing an advertisement for a New York City abortion clinic in 1971, when the practice was legal in New York. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun appeared to go further than the high court had in the past in rejecting the theory that commercial advertisements were not entitled to the same constitutional protection as news articles and editorials. In the dissent, Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist maintained that the abortion clinic ad was “a classic commercial proposition directed towards the exchange of services rather than the exchange of ideas” and thus, under earlier court rulings, was entitled only to “the limited constitutional projection traditionally accorded commercial advertising.” ‘MURPH THE SURF’ CASE The Justices also upheld a Florida robbery conviction of Jack Roland Murphy, also known as “Murph the Surf,” over objections that some jury members had read of his earlier illegal exploits as well as accounts of the particular crime before the court. Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. was the sole dissenter. Mr. Murphy, serving two life terms in Florida for the slayings of two secretaries in 1967, had appealed his conviction for a 1968 burglary. He also had been convicted of the 1964 theft of the Star of India sapphire from the Museum of Natural History in New York. In the majority opinion, Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall said that a criminal defendant did not enjoy a constitutional right to a jury that had never read any articles about his previous record or about his arrest on the current charge. Mr. Brennan argued that Mr. Murphy had been denied a fair trial in Dade County Court because the “taint of Widespread publicity” had, according to the record of the trial, “infected the jury's deliberations.”"

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/20/archives/books-of-the-times-much-evidence-no-conclusions.html,"I guess the trouble is I can't finally see the point of Linda Wolfe's “Playing Around: Women and Extramarital Sex,” a pop sociological survey by a writer who got interested in the subject when she discovered it was happening all around her. It is not that we don't need a book on this particular subject. First, it hasn't been written about very much, and yet, as Miss Wolfe points out in her section of historical survey, “From Adultery to Extramarital Sex,” what scanty evidence there is seems to show that women have been seeking sexual gratification outside of marriage ever since recorded history began. Second, the phenomenon seems to be growing more prevalent these days. For whatever fundamental reasons —improved contraceptive methods, the lessening risks of childbirth, the increased availability of abortion, not to speak of that complex of forces that have diminished the sanctity of marriage (or at least the lip service we pay to it)—the statistics that Miss Wolfe reads show that more American women are looking around them than ever before. And the facts need to be faced. PLAYING AROUND. Women and Extramarital Sex. By Linda Wolfe. 248 pages. Morrow. $7.95. And third, it might he argued that any serious consideration of the subject helps to promote a more enlightened attitude toward the differences between men and women. For it has always been a truism, whether valid or not, that men tend to wander where women don't. And if it can be shown that women in greater numbers are wandering more and more, then one must ipso facto forget about that particular difference between the sexes. Gets Down to Cases Nor is it really that “Playing Around” is never interesting to read. Miss Wolfe writes with easy grace and just the right tone about a subject that could easily have been mangled. She wastes little space on generalizations and gets quickly down to the case interviews that compose over three‐quarters of her text. And those case histories can be provocative, to say the least. Indeed, for anyone not quite so earnest about her subject as Miss Wolfe shows herself to be, “Playing Around” may prove more useful as a Book of Folly or, better yet, an Encyclopedia of Farce. How else is one to look upon Amelia Furman (pseud onymous, as are all the names that appear in these pages), who in order to preserve her “open” marriage must deceive her husband into thinking she is deceiving him, when in fact she prefers not to do so at all and spends the allotted time going to the theater, visiting with old girIfriends and shopping for what she hopes he'll misconstrue as lovers' gifts. Or Alexandra Newman, who felt would be “impolite” to look at the other couples at the orgy she's finally agreed to attend. Or Pamela Lewisohn, whose idea of a satisfying lover is someone with whore she “can get up in the middle of the night and make zabaglione and drink champagne,” and who feels, especially if a lover is doing well financially, that “If one conducts an extramarital affair like a halfmarriage, then there should be financial arrangements to cover the situation.” (Does that mean that if one conducts an extramarital affair like, say, one‐100th of a marriage, it's worth about $10 a go?) Of course, most of the interviews, far from funny, are poignant, pathetic, disturbing, sad (even when the subject claims to be happy) and occasionally tragic (like the case of the old woman who dreamed all her married life of romance with a beau from her youth, and then when the dream came true and the lover failed to perform, attempted suicide). But unfortunately, they don't prove very much, except that Miss Wolfe was able to track down and investigate “infidelities” of every variety and description—from cases where secret long‐term affairs have held marriages together, to those where sporadic liaisons have torn “open” marriages apart; and so on, throughout the spectrum of imaginable human behavior. Anything Can Happen For the problem with such variety is that it defies any useful conclusion. With so much to describe, Miss Wolfe is left with nothing to decide. After demonstrating that anything can happen, she cannot say why one thing happens. And we readers are left with a mass of undigested material, which represents nothing but certain American women who were willing to be interviewed because they heard that someone was writing about something that involved them. Miss Wolfe forces a conclusion anyway. “But no matter how one prophesizes the future, it is the present that is our biggest concern. And it is in helping us to sense the temper and tone of our own times in regard to extramarital sex that the personal testimony of women who have had the experience is most important. It enables us—men and women—to see that women are, after all, the same kind of animal as men, as prone as men to feel compelling sexual and emotional drives. We respond as intensely as men do to inadequate marriage, to feeling ignored, to starting to age.” Fine, but in its context it is pretty lame. Though it may he true, this particular book doesn't really prove it."
Does the U.S. Have the Right to Subpoena a Film in Progress?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/22/archives/does-the-us-have-the-right-to-subpoena-a-film-in-progress-the-us-vs.html,"Hollywood was severely jolted three weeks ago when stories in several West Coast newspapers linked movie figures with the notorious Weather Underground. Not only were the prominent documentary filmmaker Emile de Antonio, film editor Mary Lampson, and Academy Award‐winning cameramandirector Haskell Wexler subpoenaed to appear before a Los Angeles grand jury, along with film and tapes pertaining to a documentary on the Weather Underground, but indictments were reported to be imminent against various unnamed actor?? and actresses for allegedly giving financial aid to the fugitives. The three filmmakers argued that the subpoenas raised substantial questions of Governmental censorship. Events moved swiftly. De Antonio, Lampson and Wexler acknowledged that yes, indeed, such footage exists. They have been secretly making a film about the clandestine group of revolution aries known as the Weather Underground, formerly the Weathermen, which was a radical violence‐prone offshoot of the Students for a Democratic Society. According to the F.B.I., the Weather Underground has claimed responsibility for a score of politically motivated bombings in this country since 1970, including the explosion last week at the Banco de Ponce in Rockefeller Center. Beyond acknowledging that they are making a documentary, the filmmakers would say no more. They refused to cooperate with the grand jury, preferring to invoke the protection of First Amendment guarantees of free speech, for which they risked contempt citations and jail terms. The three of them gathered together an impressive array of legal talent. Their lawyers, Leonard Boudin, Charles Nesson, and Michael Kennedy, were clearly spoiling for a fight. Boudin had successfully defended the Harrisburg Eight and Daniel Ellsberg. Nesson, a professor of law at Harvard, had also worked on the Harrisburg and Ellsberg trials and is currently preparing the appeal on the Edelin abortion case in Boston Kenedy is counsel for Jack and Micki Scott, who are under investigation for their alleged connections with Patty Hearst. Within two days after the subpoenas were issued, several dozen of Hollywood's best known names, including Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty. Peter Bogdanovich, Jeff Bridges, Mel Brooks, William Friedkin, Peter Fonda, Shirley MacLaine, Terrence Malick, Jack Nicholson, Arthur Penn, Bert Schneider, Rip Torn, Jon Voight and Robert Wise came forward in support of “the right of these people to make a film about any subject, and specifically the right of these people to make a film about the Weather Undergronnd.” The subpoenas were shortly withdrawn. • De Antonio, Lampson and Wexler, far from being heartened by this apparent Government defeat, saw it as a tactical retreat. “Right now,” de Antonio told me a few days ago, “what the Government would like more than anything else is for us to lead them to the negative and the original tape, which we've hidden.” The fact that the subpoenas have been withdrawn means that the issues in the case will not be litigated, leaving the film makers in a legal limbo, facing the possibility of new subpoenas, indictments, or seizure of their film. According to Miss Lampson, the Government's expressed desire to examine the film for clues to the whereabouts of fugitives was no more than a pretext to interfere with the completion of a film whose exhibition it would find highly embarrassing. The Justice Department, for its part, wasn't saying much. In a telephone interview, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner declined to answer most of the questions I put to him concerning the Government's intentions, but he did say that the withdrawal of the subpoenas doesn't “nec essarily preclude new subpoenas from being issued.” The case itself raises several important legal questions. De Antonio's attorney, Charles Nesson, pointed out that this represents “the first time First Amendment privilege has arisen in the case of a documentary filmmaker.” Completed documentary films have long been protected by the First Amendment from federal, state, or local censorship, but the fact that it is the filmmakers sources who are under investigation made the case resemble recent Government attempts to force journalists to reveal their sources and yield up their notes. Even this ??logy is inex act, however, since the uncompleted status of the film introduces an element of prior restraint. As Nesson explains: “Our situation is one in which effectively the Government has put its foot on the typewriter—that is, the product has not been finished. The subpoena is prior restraint that would really stop the production process.” Or, as Haskell Wexler said to reporters at a press conference in Los Angeles: “What the Government is demanding is our notes. It's as if, as you leave here, someone says — ‘Give me those little pieces of paper you're writing on. I want them to study what kind of an article you're going to write or what kind of film you're going to make.’” • Moreover, the case raises questions about the Government's use of grand juries for police, rather than investigative function. “The??'re not trying to solve a crime,” charges Nesson, “they're trying to catch somebody, and that's not any grand jury function I ever heard of.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Bonner, on the other hand, denies that the subpoenas were intended to harass the filmmakers, and doubts that First Amendment issues are involved. The Government maintains it merely wished to examine the film, not obstruct the filmmaking process. Emile de Antonio, best known for such documentaries as “Point of Order” (the Army ‐ McCarthy hearings), “In the Year of the Pig” (the Vietnam War) and “Millhouse: A White Comedy” (a • less than glowing account of the career of former President Nixon) is no stranger to Government surveillance. Largely as a result of “Millhouse,” he was given an honored place on the White House enemies list. I asked de Antonio how he, Lampson, and Wexler came to be involved with the project which he called “notes from the underground.” He told me he first became interested in making the film after reading “Prairie Fire,” the political manifesto of the Weather Underground. “I was always impressed by the way the bombings were executed,” de Antonio said. “No one was ever hurt, and the targets were symbols of Government oppression and authority at the time of the Vietnam War. ‘Prairie Fire’ intrigued me on several levels, not the least of which was the cinematic, theatrical level; that is, how the hell does a group which for five years has been living underground, publish, print; and distribute 10,000 copies of a very well‐printed work, and get away with it?” De Antonio then went to Haskell Wexler, and talked him into co‐producing the film with him. Each put up $5,000. Although de Antonio would not reveal how he made contact with the Weather Underground, he agreed to describe the meetings in general terms. Each meeting, said de Antonio, “was carefully organized so that I stood on a street corner for precisely five minutes. I could see that that street corner was observable from any number of different directions. Then I was asked to go to another place, and then another, and each step of the way I realized that I could be observed to determine whether or not I was being followed. Once the contact was made, we always went to public places, and behaved in a very open, relaxed way. The film took three days to shoot.” Mary Lampson described the movie as a dialogue between the filmmakers and the Weather Underground during which, as de Antonio stressed, the filmmakers voiced their misgivings. “The kinds of questions Mary, Haskell and I asked were: ‘What is your view of violence and how did you arrive at it?’ One of the things which bothered me was the springing of Timothy Leary from prison. They responded by saying that it's a good thing to spring anybody from prison. They don't admire what Leary is doing now, informing, but they defended the idea of breaking him loose.” • I asked de Antonio who had final control over what will be included in the film—he or his subjects. “We have control in a filmic sense; they have in a security sense. It had to be that way. There were times during all the hours we shot when a head would turn and come right into focus, better than any mug shot. But, I don't mind saying here, we have already what I call ‘sanitized’ the film. Every mistake of the camera in which a subject's face is seen has been destroyed.” How were the identities of the Weatherpeople protected from disclosure in the film? “We used every trick, except disguise. We felt disguise was untrue to the way they operate. They operate out in the streets, in the open, among the people. So that we did not want to put ski‐masks on them, which are menacing, hostile symbols to begin with. We didn't want to camp them up with a lot of strange make‐up which would make them grotesque. The press has done a good job planting the image of crazed terrorists, but the film will show that they are very rational, human, loving people, and that's what the Government is afraid of. So instead of using disguises and make‐up, we used a number of devices, some of them extremely natural. For instance, there's one very good shot in which a group of them sit on the ground facing us, and we're shooting into a mirror, so you get their backs and you have us in sync talking to them, and you capture the animation of the conversation.” I asked de Antonio whom he hoped to reach with the film. “It seems to me the Government is building an audience for us. I was on the Cronkite show. That's a great ad. Every move the Government makes from here on out is the kind of advertising you can't buy. The only thing I regret is that I can't give you a still from the film.” The Justice Department and the three filmmakers now seem deadlocked, and it is difficult to predict what will happen next. One unforeseen offshoot of their encounter may well be the reemergence of the intense sense of engagement that characterized Hollywood in the thirties and forties. Hollywood support of political dissidents has melted away before, but many observers believe that the fifties and sixties have taught a lesson that is not lost on the new generation of film people who have grown up in the shadow of the blackist. As Robert Wise, President of the Screen Directors Guild, put it: “The feeling in Hollywood is that looking backward now and seeing what happened during the blacklist—the illegitimacy of the whole thing, the horror of it, and knowing that it may happen again—we're bound to speak up and turn our backs.” ■"

"Italy's Reds, Citing Gains, Outline Reform Proposals",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/23/archives/new-jersey-pages-italys-reds-citing-gains-outline-reform-proposals.html,"ROME, June 22 — The Italian Communist party, which made major gains in last week's local elections, today outlined a series of proposals for “necessary economic, social and political changes” that indicated that it expected to be consulted on national matters. In a 2,000‐word statement, carried on the front page of the party newspaper L'Unità, the party said that the local, regional and provincial election results were of “extraordinary importance” for Italy and indicated the need for “a profound renewal of the goals and methods of governing at all levels, including the national level.” The party document made no specific statement about Communist participation in national Government, but the statement asserted: “The Communists intend to use their increased strength to begin solutions to the most urgent and critical problems facing the country and to overcome, in a democratic and positive way, the dangerous crisis through which Italian society is passing.” Its tone appeared to echo the statement made last week by the party's leader, Enrico Berlinguer, that it was now “unthinkable” that Italy's problems could be solved without the Communist party. [In an interview in the new Time magazine, Mr. Berlinguer says that “we are not in a hurry” to enter the national Government. But he added that “we ask all the democratic parties to respect the trend indicated by the vote.” He indicated that he favored a “constructive relationship in Parliament” with the governing parties.] The leadership of the ruling Christian Democratic party, which is allied in the national Cabinet with the Republicans, has already called for talks with the Socialists and the Social Democrats as well as the Republicans to form broader based government that could stem the growing Communist strength. But the fate of Premier Aldo Moro's Government was uncertain today after the Socialist party, which has been supporting the Cabinet though not participating in it, rejected an appeal by the Christian Democrats last Thursday that the Socialists help form a new four‐party government. In their refusal, made public this weekend, the Socialists said that it would be useless to return to the often tried center‐left formula until the Christian Democrats “clarity their position.” This was understood as a demand that the party remove its political secretary, Amintore Fanfani. During the last few days, pressure has also increased from the left wing of the Christian Democrats that Mr. Fanfani be replaced. The Communists in their statement today said “no one can pretend to ignore the force that comes from the popular vote.” In the election the Communists received 32.4 per cent of the vote, a gain of 4.9 per cent over the 1972 Parliamentary elections, while the Christian Democrats slipped from 38.7 per cent in 1972 to 35.6 per cent. The Communist statement placed administrative reform at the top of its list of needed changes in the system of government, which it said had shown itself to be “harmful and intolerable” to a growing number of Italians. Formation of “capable, efficient, honest and stable” administrations is essential, the document said, urging also greater autonomy of regional governments. Three of Italy's regions—Liguria, Piedmont and the Marches—had such large Communist party gains in the elections that it was thought that they might try to form regional administrations of a left‐wing coalition, joining three regions that already have left‐wing governments. The Communist statement called for a new economic policy to help Italy out of her slump by increasing productivity and investments, insuring adequate employment and guarding against waste in the public sector. The party also urged a rapid revision of tax reforms that have caused chaos throughout Italy in recent months. It asked that an emergency buildingindustry plan, approved some time ago by Parliament, be carried out. The party reiterated Its offer to help with current negotiations between the central Government and the powerful trade unions on issues such as job security and costof‐living benefits. In the social sector, the document urged priority in dealing with crime and corruption and also said that Parliament must begin debate on certain “hot” issues such as abortion. “A year after the victory of ‘no’ in the referendum to repeal divorce,” the statement said, the elections “confirm how profound and widespread are the changes taking place in Italian society, and how large and, at this point, irresistible is the push for political and social renewal, for moral recovery for civil and cultural progress.” Communist Chief Views Role Enrico Berlinguer, leader of the Italian Communist party, does not believe that his party is “on the eve of entering the national government.” In an interview in the new issue of Time magazine, Mr. Berlinguer said: “We are not in a hurry. At this stage we believe it should take the shape of a constructive relationship in Parliament.” The Communist leader, citing his party's gains in recent local elections, said, however, that “we ask all the democratic parties to respect the trend indicated by the vote.” “We have never believed that one single party, or single class, can solve the problems of our country,” he said."

Supreme Court Postpones Review of Death Penalty,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/24/archives/supreme-court-postpones-review-of-death-penalty.html,"WASHINGTON, June 23—The Supreme Court postponed today any re‐examination of its 1972 ruling that capital punishment is unconstitutional. A ruling now is unlikely before early 11976. Without offering any explanation, the Justices announced that they were putting a North Carolina murder case that was argued last April back on the calendar for a second hearing after the Court returns from its summer recess in October. As a result, the 287 convicted criminals who have been condemned to death in the last three years under new state laws and court interpretations will await execution or deliverance for at least six more months until the high court speaks on the issue. Also, the validity of new state laws that attempted to meet the 1972 objections of the Supreme Court will remain in question. With the signing of a capital punishment hill today by Missouri's Governor, such laws are now in effect in 33 states. In 1972, dividing 5 to 4, the high court held that the death penalty was unconstitutional because it had been imposed in an arbitrary and capricious way, subjecting criminals to death in some places while letting others with similar records elsewhere stay alive. Part of the problem in drafting new state and Federal legislation to reinstate capital punishment involves the fact that the Justices wrote nine separate opinions, confusing many lawyers and legislators as to what kind of law the Court might later find acceptable. The case the Court accepted last October and heard on April 21 involves Jesse T. Fowler, who shot an acquaintance to death after a dice game brawl in a Raleigh tavern before several witnesses. The only issue is whether he can be put to death for his crime. Also pending before the Supreme Court are nine other capital punishment cases from North Carolina, seven from Georgia, five from Florida and one from Louisiana. The Justices have not yet agreed to hear any of these cases. All but one cf the defendnants is represented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., one of whose lawyers, David E. Kendall, said today that the postponement leaves the organization and its clients “in a black box.” The Court normally does not offer any explanation when it restores an already‐argued case to the calendar for a second hearing. In 1972, the Justices took this action with the abortion and obscenity cases then pending. Speculation among lawyers on the reason for today's postponement centered on two possibilities: the fact that the Fowler case deals with a special legal situation that is far from typical of many of the others and the six‐month disahility of Associate Justice William O. Douglas and its possible delaying effect on decision‐making. The rationale of the Fowler case is curious. It is based on a 4‐te‐3 decision of the North Carolina Supreme court, which ruled that the 1972 Supreme Court decision automatically converted the state's capitar punishment penalty from an invalid discretionary one to a valid mandatory one, under which Mr. Fowler could consitutionally be executed. Of the 72 defendants onl death row in North Carolina—by far the largest number of any state‐50 were sentenced under this court interpretation. The 22 others were sentenced, under a new law adopted later, by the state legislature. Some lawyers believe that the Supreme Court may agree next fall to hear a second capital case along with the Fowler case, probably one of those based on a new statute, to broaden the base of the resulting decision. Justice Douglas, who suffered, a stroke on New Year's Eve and has been hospitalized for all but a few weeks since, heard the Fowler‐case arguments so that there would presumably he no harrier to his casting a vote. If he or any other Justice did not vote, a 4‐to‐4 deadlock could result, influencing the court to call for reargurnent. While in the hospital, Justice Douglas has voted on several cases that he did not hear argued, basing his decision on the legal papers and transcripts of the arguments. However, during Mr. Douglas's absence, the Court has put over a number of cases to the 1975–76 term, apparently either at his request or to avoid the likelihood of fragile 5‐to‐4 rulings on controversial issues. With today's postponement on capital punishment, accompanied by similar action on two tax cases, the number of deferred cases for the term rose to eight, considerably more than court observers could recall in the past. Because the inner workings of the Court are officially secret, it is impossible to determine whether Justice Douglas's disability played any role in the capital punishment move. In 1972, he was part of the majority that found the practice unconstitutional. It is possible that one or more of the other Justices requested Chief Justice Warren E. Burger to put the Fowler case over, they might have more time to study the issue, a request that is reportedly made rarely and honored even less frequently."

WARNINGS AREURGED ON CONTRACEPTIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/30/archives/warnings-are-urged-on-contraceptives.html,"WASHINGTON.

Under the proposal, doctors would receive detailed notices with the devices, now used by an estimated 4 million American women, as well as separate brochures to give their patients. The brochures would warn women that complications such as excess bleeding, perforation of the uterus and septic abortion may accompany the use of IUD's.

The Women Head Home,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/04/archives/the-women-head-home-armed-with-conferences-10year-plan-they-must.html,"MEXICO CITY. July 3—The 10‐year plan of action unanimously adopted at the International Women's Year World Conference here will probably benefit women from the developing nations more than women from the industrialized world‐if it benefits anybody at all. News Analysis The United Nations‐sponsored document has no teeth and its future use is strictly up to individual governments, most of which are controlled by men. As a result, the plan's effectiveness will probably depend on how assertive and demanding women delegates, whom Representative Bella Abzug calls “the guarantors of the plan,” are when they get back home. The 49‐page document puts heavy stress on areas not always relevant to women of the industrialized countries on improving women's health and nutrition, their housing their literacy, and on attempts to rescue rural women from the drudgery of their daily lives. Western women will probably benefit from provisions calling for the end of stereotyped sex roles, the recognition of women as wives, mothers and job‐holders, equal status with men under the law, and equal access to policy‐making jobs in professional careers. Little Achieved in Past Long‐time United Nations observers caution, however, that women should not expect too much from the plan. They point to past plans of action on population and food, neither of which has changed the world much. These plans have, however, made food and population popular causes. And some women here, while feeling a revulsion at being considered a fad, realize that anything focusing world attention on their problems may help them in the long run. Adherents of the plan of action point proudly to its built‐in monitoring system, and its timetables for action. For example, a target date has been set for 1980—when a second women's conference will probably be held in Teheran, Iran —in 14 major areas, including more employment opportunities for women, increased literacy, greater access to education, political office and professional careers, and improved health and nutrition. Almost all issues relating to women are included in the document, except rape and abortion. A controversial paragraph, opposed by the Vatican and some Latin‐American countries, asserts that individuals and couples should have the right to plan their families and practice birth control if necessary. Wide Range of Provisions There are provisions to combat prostitution, to pay special attention to female criminals, and to give equal rights to unmarried mothers and children born out of wedlock. Concern with child care caused a passing reference to be expanded to a full paragraph stressing that facilities for children are “of vital impor tance in promoting equality between men and women.” Several Western‐sounding concerns were disapproved or dropped from the plan, including references to “sexism,” “legal aid,” and a statement that “men must accept equal responsibility for home and children.” Among the more interesting ideas that emerged from the two‐week conference were the possibilities of an institute for women that would study their problems on a worldwide scale, with special attention to the developing countries; and a private international women's development bank. The bank would be both an investment bank and a savings and loan association, and would finance women's projects in the areas of food production, home and family‐life improvement, and small‐industries development. A Political Success The conference was a political success in that its goal, approving a world plan of action, was achieved. In addition, the political views, of the developing nations, especially their call for a “new international economic order” and their condemnation of. Zionism, were approved in a second document called the Declaration of Mexico. So almost everybody went home happy. But, from the point of view of many of the 1,300 delegates the conference was a public‐relations failure. They had hoped to show the world that “women could do it better,” and they were distressed by the concentration of the press on such things as the refusal of Jihan el‐Sadat of Egypt to talk to Leah Rabin of Israel, on the walkout of many Arab and Communist delegates while Mrs. Rabin was speaking, and on the chaos at the concurrent non governmental conference, the Tribune. Other United Nations conferences have been just as disorderly, conference veterans say, but this has not been stressed in the past. Manipulation Charged Charges that men manipulated the women's conference are probably true; many women delegates did not utter a word before consulting with the inevitable man sitting right behind her. This could probably be attributed, in part, to an unfamiliarity with international politics What will be the significance, then of the conference and the plan of action? Experts say it will probably take at least two to three years to see whether any of its provisions trickle down through government subagencies and private organizations to the women they were intended to help.

Supreme Court's Term Marked by Caution in Making New Law and by Refusal to Review Some Major Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/07/archives/supreme-courts-term-marked-by-caution-in-making-new-law-and-by.html,"WASHINGTON, July 6—The closing ceremony of the 197475 Supreme Court term was somehow appropriate. Before a rearly empty courtroom for 23 minutes the Justices announced eight decisions, only one or two of much interest, and then quietly adjourned. During the preceding nine months Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and his colleagues had disturbed placid pond of American jurisprudence with a few waves, but most of their decisions looked more like ripples. With Associate Justice William O. Douglas in the hospital during nearly two‐ttrirds of the tern, the high court produced the smallest number of rulings, 137, in a number gol years. It postponed until the fall resolu ons of eight cases, including one involving capital punishment. Caution and sometimes avoidance were the watchwords of the term. The majority repeatedly declined to reach the merits of cases by ruling an procedure instead and consistently handed down decisions narrowing its jurisdiction then, and in the future. At least three times, the Justices agreed to review a case, heard arguments and then decided not to decide it. Refusal to Hear Cases On several occasions, the Court refused to hear cases that appeared to pose important legal questions. One involved the Government's power to wiretap without a warrant in espionage cases; another, precensorship by the Central Intelligence Agency of all the writings of a farmer employe. Within the framework of the, cases it did decide, the Court did not conform to any clearcut philosophical pattern. If its nilings in the areas of labor, business and antitrust regulations appeared conservative, several decisions on individual rights, freedom of speech and press and Executive branch power won warm liberal support. The Burger Court, during its third full term, was dearly still in transition. The four Justices named to the Court by President Nixon—Chief Justice Burger and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist—voted together less, consistently than in previous years. So did the three‐man liberal bloc of Associate Justices Douglas, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall. As a whole, the high court appeared more accommodating, less sharply contentious. The share of its decisions that prompted no more than two dissenting votes rose to 68 per cent, a record for the Burger Court. Following are some of the highlights of decisions reached by the Court during the term: GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY In a unanimous decision, the Justices held that President Nixon did not have the right to impound $9‐billion in water pollution funds approved by Congress. The ruling was based on the language of the clean water statute and did not reach the broader question of whether a President may claim implied constitutional authority to take such action. Rejecting the claims of 13 Atlantic coastal states, the Court had little difficulty in finding that the United States held title to all offshore land outside the three‐mile limit and thus to any oil deposits beneath it. The vote was 8 to 0. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS In one of its more significant rulings, the Court found unanimously that a mental institution cannot hold a patient against his will without treatment if he is not dangerous to himself or others and is capable of being self‐supporting, perhaps with the aid of others, on the outside. The Justices stopped short, however, of upholding a lower court ruling that any involuntary mental patient has a constitutional right to treatment aimed at improving his condition. Dividing 5 to 4, the Court held that public school pupils cannot be suspended without notice, an explanation of charges against them and an opportunity to respond, or the same sort of due process rights that adults enjoy against Government interference with their rights. EDUCATION In a case involving Pennsylvania, the Justices ruled, 6 to 3, that a state cannot provide aid to parochial schools to finance instructional equipment or auxiliary services like counseling, testing and remedial classes. The Court also upheld, 6 to 3, the loan by a state of secular textbooks to private schools. LABOR The Court ruled for the first time that a labor union could run the risk of costly antitrust penalties by attempting to organize subcontractors through a secondary boycott directed against a prime contractor. The vote was 5 to 4. Generally, unions have been held exempt from the antitrust laws. DISCRIMINATION In the sex discrimination area, the Justices ruled that states cannot deny women an equal opportunity for jury service and that widowers are entitled to the same Social Security survivors' benefits paid to widows. But the armed services, the Court said, can set different discharge rules for female officers than for men. On racial discrimination, the Court ruled, 5 to 3, that Southern cities can annex predominantly white suburbs as long as they have some governmental purpose and blacks enjoy a proportional share of political power in the enlarged city. The Justices, dividing 5 to 4, deprived black inner‐city residents of the right to challenge as exclusionary zoning restrictions in white suburbs that drive up the cost of housing, with the majority concluding the city‐dwellers had no legal standing to bring the lawsuit. Victims of discrimination in hiring or promotion can be awarded back pay by the courts, the Justices ruled, even if employers demonstrate that they acted in good faith, a decision that was hailed by civil rights groups. CRIMINAL LAW Splitting 6 to 3, the Justices ruled that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to undertake his own defense in court, in preference to accepting an assigned counsel. By the same vote, the Court held that a defendant in a nonjury criminal trial was entitled to a summation on his behalf before the judge. In a group of cases involving border searches for illegal aliens, the Court ruled that law enforcement officials cannot make warrantless searches of cars at checkpoints well within the border or stop and question passengers about their citizenship merely on the ground that they appear to be foreigners. Venturing into the area of white collar crime, the Justices held, 6 to 3, that the president of a supermarket chain could be held criminally responsible for unsanitary warehouse conditions it he fired responsibility to deal with such problems. THE COURTS In a half‐dozen decisions a majority of the Justices applied a series of curbs to Federal court jurisdiction, raising barriers to litigants who believe their rights have been violated in pending courts‐martial, state criminal prosecutions and even some state civil proceedings. A 5,to 2 majority ruled that Federal courts cannot award attorneys' fees to citizens' groups that win public interest lawsuits, on the theory that they are acting as “private attorneys general” Critics said] this could aft off millions of dollars of support for such litigation BUSINESS Of 18 cases that involved various aspects of conflict between business enterprise and Government Supervision, the Court ruled for business 11 times. But on probably the most significant of these, it upheld, 7 to 2, the, 1973 Railroad Reorganization Act designed to rescue eight bankrupt lines in the Northeast and Middle West. The Justices ruled against Government attempts to enforce the antitrust laws in five of seven cases before them. But, once again, in one of the most important, they held that fixed Minimum fee schedules charged by lawyers were an illegal form of price‐fixing, a decision that may ultimately open to economic competition a number of other professions. INFORMATION The Court ruled that states cannot tar communcations snedia from publishing accurate public Law enforcement information, such as the names of rape victims. It also blocked criminal prosecution of a newspaper for printing an advertisement for a legal out‐of‐state abortion service, in an expanded application of press freedom guarantees to commerical advertising. In the entertainment area, the Justices extended to live theater the constitutional ban on advance censorship that newspapers and books gave enjoyed, ruling that a municipal theater could not, sight unseen, bar the musical “Hair” as obscene. They also struck down a city ordinance against nude scenes at drive‐in motion picture theaters."
Canada's Third Party Picks New Leader,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/08/archives/canadas-third-party-picks-new-leader.html,"OTTAWA, July 7—The New Democratic party, a Socialist group that stands third in strength in the Canadian Parliament and governs three of the country's 10 provinces, elected a new leader today in a convention that appeared to turn the party further left than before. The new national leader, chosen in a vote by 1,616 delegates from party units around the country, is John Edward Broadbent of Oshawa, Ontario, who has been a member of the House of Commons since 1966. The 39‐year‐old Mr. Broadbent, always referred to in Canadian newspapers as Ed Broadbent, is a former university professor. He his been a leading spokesman for his party in Parliament, usually critical of the Government headed by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of the majority Liberal Party. Party Gets Woman President Rosemary Brown, a Jamaicaborn member of the British Columbia legislature, who is noted for her intellectual attainments and feminist views, was the leading challenger to Mr. Broadbent for the party leadership. The first black woman to reach so prominent a place in Canadian party affairs, she was the only one of several rivals of Mr. Broadbent to hang on until the fourth ballot, on which she lost by a vote of 958 to 658. Women were prominent at the convention, which elected Joyce Nash of Nanaimo, British Columbia, the party's first woman president. However, a determined attempt by a feminist group to get abortion issues onto the agenda failed. Mr. Broadbent succeeds David Lewis, a long‐time member of Parliament from Toronto, who announced his retirement from politics after his surprise defeat in the national election a year ago by Ursula Appolloni of the Liberal party. The New Democratic party was an influential force in national affairs between the elections of 1972 and 1974, when Prime Minister Trudeau headed a minority Government. During that period the 31 New Democrats in the House of Commons held the balance of power, and when they turned against Mr. Trudeau on budgetary issues in May, 1974, the Government fell. Strength Cut to 15 In the subsequent election the New Democratic strength in Parliament fell to 15, while Mr. Trudeau's Liberals won 141 seats, a solid majority in the House of 264 members. The Progressive Conservative party, which stands to the right of the Liberals, has 95 seats and the Social Credit party 12, and there is one independent. Although no longer a central force in the Government, the New Democratic party nevertheless remains a factor of importance in Canadian politics, controlling the three western provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. In the three provinces, the party's policy has been described as mildly Socialist, with the realities of politics preventing realization of its more radical objectives."
Final Work for Liftoff of Soyuz Is Begun at Desert Base in Asia,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/12/archives/final-work-for-liftoff-of-soyuz-is-begun-at-desert-base-in-asia.html,"MOSCOW, July 11 — Space technicians at the Baikonur launching center in Soviet Central Asia, working in a scorching desert heat, have begun the final preparations for next week's Soviet‐American space mission. The 15,000‐pound Soyuz spacecraft protected by a sleek white shield, was wheeled out to the booster rocket as final assembly work began today, till Government newspaper Izvestia reported this evening. The Soyuz is to be joined to the powerful rocket that is scheduled to blast it into earth orbit with its crew of two astronauts next Tuesday. On the Soviet television tonight, the two astronauts, Lieut. Col. Aleksei A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov, appeared casual as they chatted with an interviewer at the Baikonur launching site. Colonel Leonov, the Soyuz commander, said that they had arrived from training and had found their ship “in perfect order” for its launching to link up with the American Apollo in earth orbit on July 17. No foreign newsmen are being allowed thus far to visit the Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan, although Soviet newsmen have been invited to the American facilities at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Moscow Press Center Instead, 400 foreign newsmen and 300 Soviet journalists have been accredited to follow the Soyuz blastoff and flight on closed‐circuit television sets in a press center, set up by the Soviet Foreign Ministry in a downtown, Moscow hotel. As they carry on their assembly work at Baikonur, the Soviet technicians have been subjected to temperatures that climb to 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade each day, prompting Izvestia to comment tonight that “for the cosmodrome some really hot days have come now in the figurative and literal sense of the word.” By contrast, the newspaper's correspondent at Baikonur, Boris Konovalov, pointed out that American space technicians were enjoying “more favorable climate conditions” at the Apollo launching site at Cape Canaveral, Fla. The red tulips and green grass that had greeted the American astronauts of the Apollo crew when they visited Baikonur to inspect the Soyuz ship last spring have now been burned out by the desert heat, the Izvestia correspondent not, ed. But he said that Baikonut remained a good launching site because of “the laws of ballistics and the vast desert stretching for hundreds of Idlometers all around.” The Soyuz craft and rocket are expected to be trundled to the launching pad tomorrow. The Soviet press has been sketchy about details of the Soyuz preparations, while hail. ing the mission as an example of Soviet‐American cooperation. The official responsible for checking out the Soyuz at Balk onur told one of the Soviet journalists permitted at the site that the preparation plan had been precisely fulfilled and expressed his confidence in the craft's reliability. “In the preparations for the flight, more perfect methods of assembly and testing of the Soviet Soyuz were used, and we are sure of the reliability of the ship,” Arkady I. Ostashev was quoted by Izvestia as saying. He went on to says that “each operation is being done in its final version for the last time,” but did not go into details. Soviet space officials have, emphasized their confidence in the mission following the abortion of a Soyuz flight last April when the booster rocket malfunctioned. The failure prompted some doubts in the United States about the dependability of the Soviet space program. But Soviet officials, in talking to their American counterparts, have attributed the malfunction to an older model rocket that would be replaced with a newer one in the forthcoming joint flight. Izvestia reported tonight that the series of electrical tests for all systems had also been completed and that the systems had been tested both separately and together. Mr. Ostashev conceded that there were some “difficult areas” but said “the schedule is being maintained ideally.” The Soyuz is scheduled to blast off” on July 15 at 3:20 P.M., Moscow time (8:20 A.M., Eastern daylight time). If there are any complications, a backup Soyuz capsule and rocket will be ready. The Apollo craft is to be sent into orbit seven and a half hours later. The Soviet and American astronauts are expected to rendezvous in space on July 17 for two days. The Soyuz will return to earth on July 21, while the Apollo continues its mission for several more days."
"Lenin smiled for him, Eleanor Roosevelt vouched for him",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/lenin-smiled-for-him-eleanor-roosevelt-vouched-for-him-the.html,"Robert Bernard Considine has written 20 books, 10 of them collaborations. They began in 1942 with “MacArthur the Magnificent” and include works on Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Toots Shor, Harold Stassen (“Where I Stand”), Robert L. Ripley, Nikita Khrushchev, the Maryknoll Sisters, By Bob Considine. Illustrated. 287 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $12.50. “The Red Plot Against America” and “The Men Who Robbed Brink's.” His 20th book, also a kind of collaboration, is a biography of a character so versatile and unbelievable that most writers of topical‐events fiction would be embarrassed to put him in a novel. Try these on your credulity quotient. There is this medical student named Hammer, born of immigrant Russian parents on the lower East Side and named Armand for the lover in Dumas's “Camille” He becomes a self‐made millionaire in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics while winning his degree at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He goes to Russia in 1921 to collect a $150,000 drug bill and make a gift of a field hospital, and he becomes a protégé of Lenin, who has “a smile of great sweetness and charm” and whose eyes twinkle “with friendly warmth.” He lives in a 24‐room Moscow town house, marries a beautiful young Russian baroness, wins concessions to represent 38 foreign corporations and in 1930 returns to the United States laden with furs, art and diamond‐studded Faberge Easter eggs. A year earlier, at the time of the stock market crash, he had owned not one share of stock. In the depths of the Depression he becomes an art dealer and masterminds the sale of the Romanov and Hearst art collections in department stores. He buys a cow for his freezer, decides he cannot slaughter her because she is pregnant and ends up as owner of one of the country's great breeding farms for Black Angus cattle. In June, 1940, he gives his friend Franklin Roosevelt the idea of lend‐lease for Britain. He decides to retire in 1956 and, when his tax counsel advises him to find a moneylosing tax shelter, he buys half interest in a shaky company called Occidental Petroleum, whose net worth is $34,000 and whose stock is selling on the Los Angeles Exchange for 18 cents a share. He makes this tax shelter the country's 11th largest oil producer and its 20th largest corporation, with a net income of $73,789,000 in the first quarter of 1975. In 1961 his friend John F. Kennedy makes him a roving economics emissary without portfolio. He returns to Russia after an absence of 31 years and there is held in high esteem, almost reverence, because he had known Lenin, He takes to Russia an exhibition of works by Grandma Moses and gifts of a Goya painting and two handwritten letters by Lenin; he brings back the unforgettable exhibition from the collection of two Russian merchants, the Morozov‐Shchukin Impressionists and Post‐Impressionists, an agreement to build a $110‐million international trade center in Moscow, and a $20‐billion fertilizer barter deal. Armand Hammer is a “controversial” figure, and this biography might be subtitled “The Case for the Defense.” He has told Considine his side of the story in every dispute and has given him access to company and personal records as evidence, Among other offerings, Considine presents the names of Dr. Hammer's wide‐ranging friends; a selection from his fan mail from stockholders; a seven‐page article from Oxy Today, a house organ, on the “excruciating difficulties” of searching for oil in Peru; Hammer's four‐page preface to the catalogue on the dissolution of his Shadow Isle Herd; 10 pages of an indignant 15,000‐word letter‐to‐the‐editor Hammer sent to The Washington Post when one of its “journalists masquerading as art critics” faulted an exhibition of his collection of paintings, and his testimony in full in April, 1974, before a subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee defending his fertilizer deal with the Soviet Union. Whatever the book's artistic faults of method, it presents the raw material of history; and John Sparkman did call Hammer's presentation the best he had heard in all his years in the Senate. One seldom gets the impression that Considine is being overly defensive in treating his subject. In most of the doctor's battles, he gives the opposition's story in some detail before he charges back with the rebuttal. He talks frankly about the shadows in Hammer's background: his father's radical politics and term in jail for performing a therapeutic abortion (he was pardoned by Gov. Al Smith); his second wife's drinking problem; his son's arrest for killing a young Korean War veteran (it was ruled self‐defense and the case was dismissed without going to trial) and his numerous lawsuits, all of which, to date, he has won. Considine plays some of the episodes in Dr. Hammer's career for laughs. There is comedy when the doctor becomes the pencil czar under Lenin's brief New Economic Policy and, with his capitalistic drive, performs miracles of production and price reduction. There is high comedy in the appearance of Eleanor Roosevelt as a character witness for Dr. Hammer at an Internal Revenue Service hearing. And in the lament of the Exxon executive who complained that he could not negotiate with Occidental Petroleum “because Dr. Hammer does not understand the oil business.” And in Armand Hammer's attempt to buy the Arm and Hammer Baking Soda Company. And in the doctor's battles with “fanatical ecologists” and “no‐oil advocates” in Maine and California who hold that “if Oxy struck oil in their general neighborhood it might cause earthquakes, mud slides, and other disasters.” There is something fascinating about a man who, in combination with hard work, long hours and extraordinary luck, has had an almost psychic sense of what people want and who, in combination with his generous charities, has always been driven to ask the prime questions of the born competitor: “Who won?” “Who stayed in business?” and “What is on the bottom line?” At 77, Dr. Hammer is planning and working on giant projects that even he must know will not come to fruition and repay their cost in his lifetime. Bob Considine is not one of the immortals of biographical writing, but he has produced an informative and readable work about a 20th‐century phenomenon. ■"
Legislature Increases Aid for Elderly; Longest Session Since 1911 Is Ended,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/legislature-increases-aid-for-elderly-longest-session-since-1911-is.html,"ALBANY, July 12—After an 18‐hour marathon that included the final passage of higher Supplemental Security Income benefits and of a bill to allow some witnesses to bring lawyers into the grand jury room, the longest legislative session in 64 years ended just before dawn this morning. The Senate and Assembly both adjourned for the year, abandoning plans to return for a special session in November and leaving a long list of issues suspended between the politically divided houses. These included increased unemployment benefits, passed by the Assembly but not taken up in the Senate, and the entire question of increased state taxes. “We've all done our best and we'll be back to do better,” Governor Carey told the Democratic‐controlled Assembly in an unusual appearance on the speaker's rostrum as the clock approached 4 A.M. ‘Exquisite Performance’ “I have been witnessing for some time your exquisite performance,” Mr. Carey said, an impish grin on his face. Indeed, the “orderly closing session” that Speaker Stanley Steingut has been promising for weeks under the new Assembly rules adopted this year had turned into chaos, virtually indistinguishable from the unruly closing nights of past sessions. As bleary‐eyed members of both houses hacked their way through thick calendars of bills, the leaders were engaged in frantic last‐minute bargaining. reviving long‐dormant opposition bills in their own house in return for getting their cherished bills unbottled in the other. As a result, new bills—some of them only mimeographed drafts—kept arriving on members' desks in a stream that did not let up until even after the formal adjournment. The supplemental calendars simply listed the bill numbers without even a hint of the subject matter, and few members knew what they were voting on. The legislators occasionally vented their pique by refusing to vote for bills that had been earmarked for easy passage. One such spontaneous revolt occurred in the Assembly on a bill, already passed by the Senate, to appoint “nursinghome advocates” in each county. Members denounced the bill as ineffectual and voted it down. Suddenly, at 1:30 A.M., it re‐emerged. “We're already up our knees in turkey feathers, and now we're going to start flying them again?” Robert C. Wertz, Republican of Commack, L.I., demanded. The bill passed, 120 to 25. The Assemblymen did make their revolt stick on two other bills. One, strongly supported by New York City and the leadership, would have allowed the city to enter into contracts of up to 20 years with private companies for garbage disposal and fell four votes short of a majority. The other bill, lobbied for by the state's ski‐resort industry, would have subjected someone who “stole” an unpaid‐for ride on a ski lift to one year in jail. It was sent back to committee. Grand‐Jury Bill Of the bills that did receive final passage early this morning, the most important, as well as most unexpected, was one to allow a witness who has signed a waiver of immunity to he accompanied by a lawyer in a grand jury proceding. Under present law, no witness can bring a lawyer into the grand jury room, although the lawyer can be available just outside the room for consultation. Under the new bill, the attorney. could consult with the witness but could not otherwise take part in the proceed. ings. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, had first appeared several months ago. Since the people most likely to be asked to waive their immunity from prosecution are public‐office holders, some criics had labeled the bill as a special‐interest measure for politicians. During the Senate debate on the bill this morning, Bernard C. Smith, Republican of Northport, L. I., and a former Suffolk County District Attorney, said that the presence of lawyers would make indictments much more difficult to obtain and warned that the bill would be “the start of the demise of the grand jury system.” The bill's supporters said it was a civil liberties reform. There was no indication of whether Governor Carey would sign the bill, He will, however, sign the 8 per cent increase in Supplemental Security Income benefits to the blind, elderly and disabled, which he himself had requested. The Assembly had passed the increase earlier, and the Senate vote this morning broke a deadlock. For days, the Republican majority there had insisted on tying the increases to another bill that would have penalized New York City—up to $100‐million, according to some—for the high number of ineligibles on its welfare rolls. The bill will raise the monthly benefit for an S.S.I. recipient living alone from $207 to $219, and for a couple from $295 to $313. The cost to the state will be $18‐million. money the Governor has said he will find by management economies in the Department of Social Services. Another kind of benefit, unemployment compensation, never did get increased during the session. Governor Carey had proposed increasing the weekly benefit from $95 up to a ceiling of $163 for a family with three dependents. The Assembly passed a similar bill, but the issue was not taken up in the Senate. It was, in fact, a session that appeared to specialize in “one‐house bills” — measures deto appeal to the primar ily urban constituency of the Democratic‐controlled Assem bly or to the mostly upstate and suburban constituents of the Republican Senate majority, with little prospect of passage in the other house. Among such bills were the repeal of vacancy decontrol in New York City, passed by the Assembly, and several bills restricting access to abortion, passed in the Senate. A typical one‐house bill that made its way through the closing hours of the Assembly was a so‐called “open meetings bill,” providing that committees must conduct their official business in public unless a majority votes to call an executive session. “This sunshine kick that everyone is on is a lot of nonsense,” Assemblywoman Rosemary R. Gunning, RepublicanConservative of Queens, complained loudly. She charged that this year's new Assembly rules, providing for open committee meetings, had simply meant that the most sensitive matters were taken up in “meetings before the meetings.” The bill passed. G.O.P. Scores Rules The Assembly rules — the same ones that were supposed to provide for an orderly closing last night—came in for some theatrical abuse by the Republicans. “This calendar is rules,” cried Dominick L. DiCarlo of Brooklyn, the deputy minority leader, waving a nearly indecipherable list of bill numbers over his head. His point was that the Democrats had promised to end the Rules Committee's total control over the end‐of‐session agenda, but in doing so had given the same control to their own leadership in the form of special calendars. “Democracy is not easy to work,” replied Albert H. Blumenthal, Democrat‐Liberal of Manhattan, the majority leader. “We've done the very best we could with the process.” Both skilled debaters, each had been the other's favorite opponent throughout the session. The Democrats' so‐called reform rules had also called for a recess, rather than an adjournment at the end of the session so that the Legislature could come back at will to override gubernatorial vetoes. “Mr. Speaker, we did it, we batted 1.000,” Mr. DiCarlo cried with glee as he observed that this rule, too, had been overlooked at the end. In the closing hours, the Senate voted final passage to a bill that eases the penalties for possession and sale of small quantities of methadone. The Assembly, obviously as part of an accommodation with the Senate, gave final passage to a bill allowing the city school district of Yonkers to receive five state‐aid payments next year instead of four. The Senate gave final approval to a bill allowing profitmaking organizations to enter the field of home health care. Opponents warned that the Legislature could be setting the stage for another nursing home scandal, since home‐health‐care services are even less liable to regulation than profit‐making nursing homes. The principal sponsors were Senators Joseph L Galiber, Democrat of the Bronx, William T. Smith, Republican‐Conservative of Big Flats, and Assemblyman Herbert J. Miller, Queens Democrat. The flavor of the final night, in the opinion of many people, owed more to the presence of television cameras than to any other single influence. Public television broadcast almost the entire night, live, on eight stations from New York City to Buffalo, and the telephone rooms off the two chambers were crowded with legislators. A number of them were overheard phoning their families at home to—as one said—“be sure to watch in five minutes—I'm going to make a speech.” Then they made them. Sixty‐four years ago, in 1911, the session went all the way to Oct. 6."
Blackmun Suggests Mon Public Contact by Justices,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/14/archives/blackmun-suggests-more-public-contact-by-justices.html,"ST. PAUL, July 13 (AP)—Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the United States Supreme Court says that he and his fellow Justices should keep in constant touch with the grass‐roots sentiment in the country. “I think it's so easy, because of the pressures here and the demands on our time, for us to stay in our ivory tower and not get out,” Justice Blackmun said in an interview published today in The St. Paul Pioneer Press. “I think we're too confined at times. It doesn't seem to me that we should hit the political circuit, but it's good to hear the voices of America from a different podium than the rostrum before us.” Discussing Ills five years on the high court, Justice Blackmun said that he did not relish the pressures and demands of his job or like living in Washington. He said that he envied friends who were “enjoying life.” However, the 66‐year‐old Justice said he found his job exciting and satisfying and had no plans to retire as long as his health remained good. Justice Blackmun became eligible for retirement last November when he completed 15 years in the Federal judiciary. The Justice, who is from Rochester, Minn., had been a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit when appointed to the nation's highest court in 1970 by President Nixon. He was among four Justices appointed by Mr. Nixon. Justice Blackmun said that if the current Court were rated “conservative to liberal,” William H. Rehnquist would be first, followed by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Byron R. White, Lewis F. Powell Jr. “in certain areas” and then himself. The other four Justices are William O. Douglas, Potter Stewart, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall. “I like to think I am distinctly more near the middle than any of the others,” Justice Blackmun added. Justices Rehnquist, Burger and Powell are the other Nixon appointees. Justice Blackmun, who wrote the majority opinion in the 7‐to‐2 decision in 1973 that struck down restrictive abortion laws, said he was not sure if his own legal philosophy had changed since coming on the court. “But certainly one has a ??ferent perspective here than in practice or on the Federal appellate bench,” he said. “There's an atmosphere of finality here that's obvious. One is very much aware of how the decisions we make here nudge the country one way or another.” “I think sometimes we overlook that and it startles me in retrospect. I doubt if the country's going to fall apart however we decide a case, but it does set the tone and direction of the country subject to Congressional override.”"
State Senate Unit to Hold Inquiry on Abortion Clinics,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/14/archives/state-senate-unit-to-hold-inquiry-on-abortion-clinics-committee.html,"TRENTON, July 13—A special Senate committee will meet bere Thursday to begin an investigation of abortion facilities and procedures in New Jersey. The committee chairman is Joseph A. Maressa, Democrat of Camden County and an outspoken critic of New Jersey's abortion policies. The 11‐member committee comprised of Senators, citizens and one priest, will interview witnesses in closed session and issue a report later this month. Senator Maressa has charged the state with allowing the Atlantic Abortion Clinic in Atlantic City to operate an “abortion mill for out‐of‐state residents,” many of them under 18 years of age. His committee is known to be gathering information on the number of abortions performed at the clinic, as well as ages and addresses of clients. However, the state has refused to divulge names and addresses of the patients on the ground that the information is confidential. Two abortion clinics, which provide out‐patient abortion services at prices averaging from $125 to $150, are now operating in the state, and a third is about to open. The cost of an abortion at an outpatient hospital averages about $375. Others Seek Certificates Six other facilities have received certificates of need and are expected to open when complete, and three more doctor groups have applied for certificates of need. The Planned Parenthood Clinic in Jersey City, which has been open for more than six months, has consistently refused to reveal any information to the state about its operations, and the Health Department is currently taking measures to enforce compliance on a new mandatory‐reporting regulation adopted three weeks ago. Meantime, the third clinic, the Pilgrim Medical Group in Montclair, will open within two weeks, according to its owner, Dr. Herbert Wiskind. Despite an avalanche of bitter public opposition, the facility, which is one of three abortion clinics that Dr. Wiskind expects to operate, was granted a temporary license in Superior Court in Essex County on June 27, pending completion of minor repairs. About 5,000 area residents have signed petitions opposing estabishment of the clinic at 393 Bloomfield Avenue. The state has long sought to impose a series of health regu??ations on abortion clinics. The requirements included such things as a written hospital??ffiliation agreement, a two‐day waiting period between diag??osis of pregnancy and the abortion operation, and mandatory counseling of patients, all of which were opposed by clinic owners. In April, the State Attorney General's office ruled that the State Health Department could legally limit abortion clinics to performing only early abortions, those in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Late‐stage abortions would then have to be performed in hospitals. The Attorney General advised the Health Department that the remaining regulations that it sought to impose were probably unconstitutional, as evidenced by court decisions in other states. Nevertheless, the Health Department formally adopted a modified version of the regulations in June, The Governor's Commission on Abortion, under its chairman, Dr. Stanley Bergen Jr., president of the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, has been investigating the legal and medical aspects of abortion for Governor Byrne and is expected to recommend revision and withdrawal of the controversial clinic requirements. Some Hospitals Refuse Although two and half years have passed since the United States Supreme Court ruled that women have the right to abort pregnancies, one‐half of New Jersey's 100 hospitals still refuse to perform abortions except when the operation will save the life of the mother. In a survey by the State Health Department of abortions in the one‐year period from Sept. 30, 1973, to Oct. 1, 1974, 50 hospitals in the state performed 11,010 abortions, of which 8.3 per cent were late abortions. The totals do not include the number of abortions performed in doctors' offices, which is unknown, or the clinic abortion data, which are incomplete. In the state survey it was also learned that 34.3 per cent of all hospital abortions were Medicaid operations for those who could not afford to pay."
The Russian Visitor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/16/archives/the-russian-visitor.html,"WASHINGTON, July 15—Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn steps into American life out of the pages of a Dostoyevsky novel. A deeply religious man and a moralist, he is preoccupied with fundamental questions of what is truth and what is justice. He sees every issue, large and small, personal and political, in terms of good and evil. He is a victim who became a hero. a teller of tales who became a symbol, a uniquely Russian prophet who became an exile in the wilderness of the West. He speaks of sin, shame and redemption, concepts which our neo‐pagan society with its secularized atmosphere and deeply corrupt popular culture can. barely comprehend. It is no wonder that although he seeks to warn and Instruct us, we are bemused and baffled. As well as a powerful novelist and a moral prophet, Mr. Solzhenitsyn is also an informed, uncompromising critic of Communist theory and Soviet practice. In this third role as political critic, Mr. Solzhenitsyn has recently been provided with forums by A.F.L.‐C.I.O. president George Meany, who underwrote the cost of large public banquets here and in New York for invited audiences. Mr. Meany regards these appearances as useful demonstrations against the Nixon‐Ford‐Kissinger policy of détente with the Soviet Union. Mr. Solzhenitsyn does indeed make a powerful argument against the moral emptiness of détente as it is now being practiced. He indicts the greed of businessmen who are prepared to sell anything to the commissars including police security devices. He throws on the defensive those politicians and intellectuals who confuse conciliation with appeasement. ■ Despite the clarity and force of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's analysis, however, his speeches are unlikely to produce firm political action. Although the trade unionists and their guests applaud his words and some reactionaries use his remarks to attack the concept of détente, there is not in American life today among trade unionists or‐ conservatives or liberals the moral energy and political will to mount a campaign to put his ideas into effect. Nearly thirty years of political struggle with Communism and two costly wars in Korea and Vietnam have exacted their toll on Americans. For the moment at least, we as a people have a need to regroup and rethink our alternatives. Moreover, to Americans across most of the political spectrum, détente is morally acceptable because it lessens the chance of a nuclear war occurring on account of a failure of communication between the opposing. leaders. Secondly, it opens up the hope— fragile and speculative though it is—that increased trade and travel may lead to some reform of the So viet system. Mr. Solzhenitsyn, of course, regards both reasons for détente as pathetic hopes. He would return to the full rigors of the cold war and hope to see the Soviet system fall further behind the West, eventually changing because of its own stultifying inefficiency and arbitrariness. Homey well be right. But Western leaders are not unreasonable in calculating that prospects for peace are improved rather than worsened by a positive instead of a negative approach to the Soviet tyrants, A policy of détente, however, does not require moral surrenders such as President Ford's initial decision to snub Mr. Solzhenitsyn. The decision was almost inexplicable because it was like passing up the opportunity to have a conversation with Tolstoy or Thoreau. It was sad because no American, be he President or private citizen, ought to be embarrassed by someone who makes an absolute, unqualified defense of the idea of human freedom. ■ It ought to be possible for American leaders to reconcile détente with hard bargaining, to maintain a civilized tone in dealing with the Rùssians while preserving their own moral perspective on the Russian system. Jefferson or Lincoln or John. Kennedy could have carried off this intellectual and political feat. Richard Nixon, so morally compromised and ambiguous a figure, could not. Their avoidance of Mr. Solzhenitsyn indicates that Henry Kissinger, the sorcerer's apprentice, and Mr. Ford, nominally his new master, are likewise incapable of it. As the politicians and diplomats fumble, Americans can still benefit from Mr. Solzhenitsyn's moral counsel. Less important than how we choose to live in the world with our enemies is how we choose to live with ourselves. Freedom, he points out, is not. an end in itself but “a means by which we can attain another and higher goal.” That goal is to lead a morally worthy life. After all the fashionable causes of the moment—abortion, women's rights, “gay” liberation—have achieved their goals, there will still remain the enduring problems of how to invest our lives with moral content and how to create a culture worthy of human beings. Only a visitor from a land where freedom does not exist could ask so penetratingly the question: To what good use are you putting the precious gift of freedom?"
Grand Jury May Weigh Woman's Death,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/18/archives/grand-jury-may-weigh-womans-death.html,"MINEOLA, L.I., July 17—Testimony is expected to be presented to a Nassau County grand jury next week following an investigation into the death of the wife of Dr. Charles Friedgood, a source close to the case said today. The 57‐year‐old physician has been the subject of an investigation by the Nassau County police and the District Attorney's office since the death of his wife, Sophie, 48, in the couple's home in Kensington on June 18. Dr. Friedgood, a surgeon who practices in Brooklyn, has refused to comment on the investigation, as have the police and the District Attorney's office. The surgeon has been in difficulty with the law before, according to court records, but has been sentenced only for tax evasion. He was indicted on an abortion charge in Brooklyn in 1964, before abortion was legalized, but the charge was dismissed. Probation Extended He was convicted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn of three counts of income‐tax eva sion involving more than $300,000. The conviction was overturned, and a retrial was ordered. He later pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment and was placed on two years' probation. The probation was schedultd to end Sunday, but has been extended for six months because of the present investigation. In addition, according to John W. Palmer of Mineola, Dr. Friedgood's lawyer, Toby Miller, a friend and business partntr, charged the doctor in 1972 with having kidnapped and drugged him and with having forced him to sign promissory notes totalng $510,000. Mr. Palmer said that Dr. Friedgood had testified before the grand jury in the case and that because of a lack of evidende no indictments had been handed up. Dr. Friedgood also is part of a group of 13 doctors being investigated by the State Assembly's Health Committee Task Force on Institutional Medicaid Costs, headed by Assemblyman Andrew J. Stein. Democrat of Manhattan. Mr. Stein's investigators are looking into the possibility of fraud in storefront offices. The Friedgoods had been married about 25 years and had six children, the oldest of whom is 24. Mrs. Friedgood was found unconscious in her bed by a maid, who called the village police. Her husband was then called home from a hospital in Brooklyn. Mr. Palmer said in an interview today that the local police had asked the surgeon to sign the death certificate because they had been unable to obtain the services of another physician. Mr. Palmer said that because Mrs. Friedgood had suffered a stroke in 1960, had complained of headaches and had high blood pressure, “Dr. Friedgood, would normally sign the death certificate with a cause of death as ‘cerebral vascular accident.’” That same day, Mr. Palmer said, Mrs. Friedgood's body was sent for burial to Hazelton, Pa., where she had grown up and where she had told her husband she wanted to be buried. The custom among Orthodox Jews is for burial to take place as quickly as possible. Burial Delayed However, the Nassau police, lat the request of the Kensington police, asked for a delay of the burial, because of the circumstances surrounding the death certificate. A preliminary autopsy was performed on June 19 in Pennsylvania with the approval of Dr. Friedgood, the lawyer continued. It disclosed that Mrs. Friedgood had not died of a stroke, but no finding as to the cause of death was made at that time. Burial took place on June 19 after that autopsy, during which tissue was removed. Later, the tissue was sent for toxicological examination to the Nassau County Medical Examiner. It was determined through that examination that Mrs. Friedgood had died of an injection of Demerol, a painrelieving drug. The body was exhumed on July 11 and further tests are now being made to determine whether the drug had been self‐administered or indicated a homicide. Shortly after his wife's burial, Dr. Friedgood called his family and told them he was going away for two weeks. He then bought a plane ticket for London. On June 25 the Nassau police went to Kennedy International Airport after Abraham Meneshe, a son‐in‐law, told them the physician was leaving with $600,000 in negotiable bonds, Mr. Palmer said. The lawyer said he did not know where the physician had been going and could not confirm that he had been on his way to Denmark. Mr. Palmer refused to discuss reports that his client had been having an affair with Harriet Boell Larsen of Tonder, Denmark, and had fathered two children by her after she started working for him as a nurse in Brooklyn in 1969. The source reported, however, that Dr. Friedgood had signed an affidavit in Denmark that he was the father of the children, copies of which are now reportedly in the hands of Nassau law enforcement authorities. Dr. Friedgood, who is from Detroit and a graduate of the Wayne State University School of Medicine, was described by his lawyer as being under “a great strain because of the adverse publicity, while trying to continue to practice medicine.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/19/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: It ill becomes our American press to write editorials (Times July 9) about “Cambodia's‐Crime ...” after the vast crimes our own Government committed against the Cambodian people—crimes which, to a great extent, precipitated the present state of affairs in Cambodia. No one doubts the many thousands of innocent Cambodian victims suffering and dying from the chaos, vast dislocations, starvation and economic crisis that is still' taking place after Lon Nol and his supporters were driven out by the Khmer Rouge with their hyperactive revolutionary zeal and their limited governing and organizing experience. Our sorrow cannot help but be great for possibly millions of innocent victims. But, except for urging our Government to provide genuine humane aid for the suffering that now prevails in Cambodia, what else can be done? Shall we send our bombers in again to reinstate a new “Lon Nol” surrounded by the same old rip‐off establishment that prevailed there before? Where were our editorial outcries when Prince Sihanouk pleaded for peaceful coexistence of classes in Cambodia as our C.I.A. and military responded with illegal, massive bombing and subversion to assure his exile from the country as we shored up the corrupt Lon Nol and his surrogates for our own selfish purposes? Didn't we, to the very end, provide billions of American taxpayer dollars for bombing and destroying Cambodian human beings—while at home unemployment and dog‐food rations for our elderly became the order of the day for unprecedented millions of Americans? Indeed we must not keep silent. The members of Congress and other branches of our Government who on the one hand criticized the undemocratic nature of the Lon Nol regime but in reality allowed five years of bombing and destruction to take place do have a special obligation to speak up. The United Nations has the same obligation. But, other than make available ample supplies of food and medicine with no strings attached and allow the Cambodians to work out their own destiny, what practical and moral alternatives do we have? A. J. ROSENSTEIN Canaan, Conn., July 10, 1975 Unpaid City Services To the Editor: Under the headline, “Law Allows City to Tax the State,” Peter Kihss called attention in a recent news article to the Henderson Law, which empowers localities to levy charges for police and fire protection, sanitation, water supply, highway construction, lighting and maintenance on the state and various other properties exempt from the real‐estate tax. Whether or not the Legislature extends the effective date of the statute to April 1, 1976, it should be given immediate attention by the city authorities. The value of all property exempt from real‐estate tax here is over $22‐billion, out of a total of about $61.5‐billion; of this, the state owns over $500 million. Included in these figures is also the value of real estate owned by foreign entities, where a question of international law is involved. Other property is owned by the Federal Government. The main portion of the tax‐exempt property, however, is owned by nongovernmental nonprofit organizations, such as foundations, charities, churches and synagogues, many of which can well afford paying the city a fee for the services mentioned above. As many legal and financial problems are involved, but also a possible source of substantial additional income for the financially troubled city, the proper departments of the city government should investigate this matter with all possible speed. HENRY SALFELD New York, July 10, 1975 Of Players and Pawns To the Editor: Stella B. Allen, in her July 10 letter, aims her anger at the pawns rather than at the chess players. She waggles her finger and “tilts, tsks” the politicians, describing their putrid manipulations as “shenanigans.” Whereas city workers, sick of charades and exploding with honest anger, she depicts as “hooligans.” Many of these “hooligans” have served New York City for over seven years. They have been burned, shot at, suffered smoke poisoning regularly and otherwise routinely maimed. Now they are called upon to play their part in the annual “money musical”: choreographed by Beame, staged by Anderson et al., and featuring Governor Carey as the “good guy.” Their role requires that they receive a stunning late‐night call, smash all their hopes and plans for the future and in mild shock plan to begin all over again at age 38 in the midst of a recession. Stella B. Allen's ire might better be directed toward the players—the pawns don't think the game is funny any more. JAMES MAY New York City Fireman Queens Village, N. Y., July I0, 1975 • ‘Culture Down the Drain’ To the Editor: The public library branches in Manhattan and the Bronx have lost 200 staff. No one talks about the layoffs in this and other branches of city services. I think the public should know the entire picture and not merely details that have been released. I'd be a nothing, and so would millions of others, had we not had access to free books. Our culture is going down the drain, along with our safety.. BELLE SCHILLER New York, July 7, 1975 • The Postal Snoopers To the Editor: It is the current policy of the Postal Service to return all mail dispatched without postage stamps. Even if the letter is correctly addressed, no attempt is made to deliver it and to collect the missing postage from the addressee. Instead, the letter is opened in search for the address of the guilty sender. Only if this procedure does not reveal the name and address of the sender is the letter delivered to the addressee, after a delay of several days. This method of opening a deliverable letter is of doubtful legality. It represents a serious invasion of the privacy of the contents of the mails and should be discontinued. It was also completely unnecessary for the Postal Service to go through the costly trouble of snooping into a recent letter addressed to me. I would have gladly paid immediately the postage and the extra ten cents “handling” fee, since the letter contained a check I had been waiting for. MARTIN FREUND New York, July 10, 1975 A $1.2‐Billion Cruiser We Don't Need To the Editor: The front page of The Times of July 7 contained an item headlined “Ford Backs Navy and Seeks Funds for Atom Cruiser.” In an official memorandum Admiral Thomas Moorer stated: “For all levels of military action other than all‐out nuclear war ... the attack carrier is the primary striking force of our Navy....” It is certain that an all‐out war between the two superpowers will include nuclear exchange—indeed it is likely to start with it. Since super‐aircraft carriers are of doubtful utility in an all‐out war, how is it possible to justify building a $1.2‐billion ship to protect a carrier? Unlike ballistic‐missile‐firing submarines, where each ship can operate independently, this cruiser will add to the burden carried by antisubmarine escorts, each costing $500 million. This cruiser can be of some use against aircraft and, possibly, cruise missiles but is useless against ballistic missiles and submarines—by far the greatest danger to aircraft carriers. Even though this project has the blessing of Admiral Rickover, who fathered nuclear propulsion for sub. marines, spending $1.2 billion per strike cruiser would be a gross mistake. Because of his past record Admiral Rickover has a “halo” surrounding his person. It is probable that this “halo” effect is largely responsible for President Ford's espousal of the project in spite of its lukewarm reception by the Pentagon. We sank many billions in the Sheridan tank and in the A.B.M. missile projects before they were abandoned. Their managers were reluctant to admit their futility and kept on pouring good money after bad. It is probable that the same fate will overtake the B‐1 bomber and the Trident submarine. The proposed strike cruiser, in terms of her effectiveness and viability, is even lower on the totem pole. A few more projects like that and we'd need no enemies to wreck our economy. [Editorial July 12.] LEE J. LEVERT Tenafly, N. J., July 7, 1975 The writer is a professional engineer and a graduate of the Naval War College. Wallace and the People To the Editor: William V. Shannon's July 6 column on George Wallace simply misses the point. The thought of Governor Wallace as a national candidate is as repugnant to me as it is to Mr. Shannon, and for many of the very same reasons Mr. Shannon cites. But the fact remains that many people, including myself, agree with practically everything the Governor says. Having experienced the nightmare of dealing with the Federal bureaucracy myself, I, too, favor eliminating a large number of bureaucrats (be they pointy‐headed or flat‐töpped) whose only reason for being seems to be to justify their own existence. Examples: C.A.B., I.R.S., I.C.C., F.P.C., Selective Service Board, E.P.A., F.T.C., and dear old H.U.D. Fully one‐third to one‐half of all the people in these agencies (if not the entire agency) could be eliminated and nobody would notice. I am also sick and tired of all those things now regarded as clichés, such as coddling criminals, welfare, $4‐billion boondoggles out of the F.H.A., costly social experiments that haven't worked, and the seemingly pervasive liberal philosophy of “find a problem and throw money at it.” Governor Wallace thus far appears to be the only national figure who is also sick and tired. So until someone else wakes up, I may eventually cast my “selfish, defeatist, self‐pitying vote” for Wallace and, to the dismay of The Times, “punish them all.” JOHN H. NOONAN Wyckoff, N. J., July 6, 1975 • Arthur Burns Explains To the Editor: Upon returning from a foreign trip, I found on my desk a copy of an article entitled “Burns Linked to I.R.S. Inquiries,” which appeared in The Times on June 7. The article states that “A Congressional staff report issued today said that it was Arthur F. Burns, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who passed on to the Internal Revenue Service President Nixon's order that the tax agency make special investigations of student protesters, black militants and anyone who was financing them.” There is no truth in this statement. The staff document to which your reporter referred states clearly on page 6: “The staff has not found any evidence that anyone in the White House requested that the Service establish a special compliance or data gathering project dealing with extremist organizations.” This statement is repeated on page 16 of the staff document. Beyond this, let me merely note that my only connection with the doings of the I.R.S. consisted in responding to a request by Mr. Thrower, then Commissioner of the Service, for suggestions of prominent citizéns who, might be appointed to a public advisory committee on tax‐exempt organizations. In the course of a conversation on this subject, according to Mr. Thrower, I also conveyed, Mr. Nixon's concern that tax‐exempt funds may be supporting some activist groups. I have no recollection whatever of any such conversation with either Mr. Nixon or Mr. Thrower. However that may be, Mr. Thrower records on page 30 of the Congressional staff document that I indicated at the time that I “had no occasion to criticize, but was simply raising the question” of possible ideological bias within the I.R.S. ARTHUR F. BURNS Chairman, Board of Governors Federal Reserve System Washington, June 16, 1975 The staff report to which Dr. Burns refers also states (page 5), “The interest of the White House in tax examinations of left‐wing tax‐exempt organizations apparently was conveyed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Randolph Thrower, by Dr. Arthur Burns on June 16, 1969.” The Times believes its news story was accurate.—Editor, The Times. • To Protect ‘Womblife’ To the Editor Your July 12 editorial in defense of the wild animal deserves commendation. No animal should be “mangled in steel traps” or “trapped into agonizing deaths.” Your conclusion that “wildlife is...deserving of freedom from death by torture” strikes this faithful reader as self‐evident. Will your respected editorial page now rush to defend the right to life of the animal in the human mother's womb? Tens of thousands of them are being “mangled by steel traps” and “trapped into agonizing deaths.” Surely womblife is no less deserving of freedom from death by torture than wildlife. (Rev.) JAMES J. GILHOOLEY New York, July 14, 1975"

Country Wedding in France A Ritual That Never Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/24/archives/country-wedding-in-france-a-ritual-that-never-changes.html,"MONTPELLIER, France—Gen. Antoine (Tony) de Reals changed swiftly from his dress uniform and gold embroidered kepi (for the wedding of an officer's daughter), into a sober, dark suit and said gaily, “In July, everybody in France gets married.” It is partly true. The public issues recently have been about the prostitutes strike, the divorce law, the abortion law and the like. But traditional weddings, with all the traditional trimmings, are what families and friends still talk about and plan. On a summer weekend, the roads are filled with processions of cars flying white gauze bows from their radio antennas and door knobs to signify a bridal convoy. The general and the Countess de Reals were invited to three ceremonies last Saturday and managed to attend two. The second was that of Marie Caston, daughter of their friends Frangoise and Ernest Castan, to Philippe deBengy de Puyvallee. Before the party arrived at the abbey church of Saint‐Genies‐des‐Mourgues here, the Rev. Andre de Montgolfier was sweeping off the steps of the, creamy stone church, first built in the 10th century. “Look at all this rice,” he said with mock grumpiness. “What a waste.” There had been a wedding there the day before and there would be another the day after, which meant the three families could splurge on flowers and share the cost, so it wasn't all waste. A Bright Contrast The flowers were country bouquets of daisies, tiger lilies, asters snapdragons and foxgloves, splashes of brightness against the glowing old Romanesque walls. Countess de Reals approved. “In a white church like this, it's so much nicer to have colored flowers than the usual white,” she told the mother of the bride. But the bride wore white, a classic princess cut in pique with a long train and a long white gauze veil. The groom, his father and the bride's father suffered through the summer day in morning coats and gray top hats. Mrs. Castan, American‐born Frangoise Clark, wore a beige lace dress that her mother had worn in China in 1929. It is now quite fashionable again as part of “La Mode Retro,” the vogue for nostalgia. It was a typical country gentry wedding. Marie had chosen the church, nestled in the walls of the family chateau, because it was there that she had been baptized and received her first communion. But the reception had to be some 20 miles away, in the park of the Chateau de la Mogere because there had been an old family quarrel that had led her uncle, the heir to the chateau at Saint‐Genies to refuse a big party there. The owners of La Mogere, having trouble maintaining the estate, occasionally rent out the garden and some salons for parties and conferences. It costs $400, plus lights, catering and so on. The bride is a lawyer who works for the firm of Coudert in Paris. She met Mr. Puyvallee in law school, and now he works in the legal department of a large Paris bank, so they will live in the capital. But it was natural for them to arrange the wedding in her old family precincts hereby the Mediterranean. Some people came from Paris, more from nearby Perpignan. Beziers and Lyons and Grenoble where the groom's relatives reside. July is also the season for receiving examination results, and a lot of the talk among both the young people and their parents was about the news the mail had brought, the excruciating unfairness of the French school system, the relative advantages of going in for math or philosophy. Baron Emmanuel du Roure and Pierre de Bordas, the bride's godfather and witness at the wedding, are wine‐growers. They were discussing the troubles of the market, which has Montpellier in a state of endemic agitation. The wine of the Languedoc, an inferior quality, has sold poorly in recent years and the growers have staged repeated angry marches and demonstrations. Not long ago, they poured a cargo of Italian vermouth into the sea to express the kind of sentiments that prompted Boston's Tea Party. But Mr. de Bordas has a temporary advantage. Apricots in all the neighboring regions froze during this year's cold spring, but he had a good crop. “I managed to pay off all my debts at once this year,” he said with sunny smile. But the two growers were a little uneasy at being overheard about their work. In this region, we do work hard but we never talk about it, it isn't done,” said one. “Yes, the English dress up for dinner but we dress up all the time. It's bad manners to drop in on someone's house without notice here. They might be in working clothes,” said the other. There was a long buffet, plenty of wine, whisky, champagne and orange juice at La Mogere, and a dance floor with discotheque music. The first dance was a deliriously fast Viennese waltz, but then the music changed to rock and pop as the younger set took over. About 200 guests attended the wedding. The Castans have been a local family for hundreds of years, but Mr. Castan was in the French diplomatic service and retired here only recently. His friends are mostly people he knew from childhood or dignitaries, such as General and Mrs. de Reals. The general is commander of the Seventh Military Region and will retire to his native Brittany later this year. It was one of Mr. Castan's ancestors, off in Canada to buy the salted codfish that the people of Montpellier used to dry in the sun, who founded the town of Montpelier, Vt. Historical Notes “They weren't too good at spelling then,” Mr. Castan said with a laugh when he was asked about the missing “L” in the American name. Mr. Castan's grandfather, who was in Mexico with the French Emperor Maximilian, brought back the first avocados and there are still avocado trees growing in Montpellier's botanical garden, founded by Henry IV. But that is very recent history here. Prof. Robert Desmouliez of the law faculty at Montpellier University, founded in the 13th century, pointed out as he sipped his wine that the school's most famous alumni were Nostradamus and Rabelais. Like many French towns, Montpellier has burgeoned in the last decade, but its mayor has carefully restored and cherished the old quarters while building an ultramodern satellite town and administrative center on the outskirts. The party went on until midnight. Mr. de Cavalier, a monocled gentleman who judged the 1932 horse show at Madison Square Garden and recalled it with delight, mentioned to his wife that an acquaintance had died. “My husband hates funerals,” she explained. “He does't want to go.” “My wife loves funerals, weddings and all that,” he replied with an air of being quite unable to understand why. The guests congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Castan and thanked them for the warm, cheery evening. The ritual marriage congratulations had already taken place in the church. “Well,” said Mr. Castan to one of his friends. “It's your turn now. Marry off one of your daughters.” Marie and her husband stayed until the end, looking after the guests and the little cousins, two boys and two girls, who had been the wedding attendants. The couple were going on honeymoon to the Balearic Islands and a Mediterranean cruise next day. It has been an expensive event, Just the stamps to send out the invitations cost $400, but everything was done as things always had been done. “Marie is like that,” Mrs. Castan said. “She loves tradition. It is nice, after all. I do hope they'll be very happy.” So did everybody. Whatever else was new, it had been a happy day."
School Critics Press Drive for Old Values,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/25/archives/school-critics-press-drive-for-old-values-school-critics-press.html,"The dispute between parents and educators over what public schools should teach and what texts should be used has spread from West Virginia's Kanawha County where it exploded in shots and arson last year, to dozens of other communities across the country. More is involved than protests over allegedly “dirty” texts, though such hooks often are the catalysts in the confrontation. At issue in the broader sense is who shall control the nation's elementary and'secondary schools. In recent months, irate parents in places as diverse as Randolph, N.Y., Tampa. Fla., and Aurora, Colo., have demanded changes in teaching methods and materials. They want the schools to re‐emphasize the basic skills and traditional values — the three R's plus patriotism and respect for authority. They worry that their children's social and cultural values are being destroyed by too much classroom emphasis on sex education, too much study of radical and liberal politics and ton much exposure to the lively street language and bluntly realistic life situations found in many of today's modernized textbooks. They are concerned, at a time when school taxes are going up and up, that they are not getting their money's worth, that the schools have become just another overcostly, ineffective, meddlesome American bureaucracy. The protesters constitute only a few thousand of the millions of parents with children in the nation's public schools, but their cries for change are loud. Most educators are resisting change. They say their critics are ultra‐conservative with no concern about the consequences of censorship and denial of academic freedom. But here and there a few school officials are giving in and putting parents on textbook and curriculum committees. And a number of pubIlishers are expurgating their books rather than lose lucrative sales. Broader Concern Seen “This thing has spread since the West Virginia outbreak to the point that there is not an educational publisher of any size who has not made at least minor revision in the face of Pressure,” says Craig T. Scmft a textbook publisher who serves as chairman of the Freedom to Read Committee of the Association of American Publishers. “The right of teachers to teach and publishers to publish and students to study is seriously endangered,” he adds. Onalee McGraw, a “concerned” parent and one of the directors of Citizens United for Responsible Education, a group that monitors school systems in the Washington area, disagree with Mr. Scmft. “It's not just some ‘dirty books,” she adds. “Educators no longer worry about whether a child can write. They worry about what the child writes, what the attitude is toward a particular subject. “It's no longer ‘See Susie and her mother.’ It's ‘Susie lives in a slum. How does Susie relate to her mother? How do you relate to your mother?” Disputes over what is to be taught in American schools and how it is to be taught are not new. But seldom since the, historic Scopes “monkey” trial, which ended half a century ago tomorrow, have such arguments been as widespread as they are at present. Some of today's disputes even involve the Scopes issue—evolution. It has never been decisively settled. In most parts of the country, public school textbooks and curriculums have traditionally been chosen by the school authorities, either at the state or local level. That system is now being challenged. There is no real evidence that the challengers are organized nationally, but some national groups and foundations have participated in more than one dispute or spoken out in favor of parental protests in general.

School Critics Press Drive for Old Values,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/25/archives/school-critics-press-drive-for-old-values.html,"The dispute between parents and educators over what public schools should teach and what texts should be used has spread from West Virginia's Kanawha County, where it exploded in shots and arson last year, to dozens of other communities across the country. More is involved than protests over allegedly “dirty” texts, though such books often are the catalysts in the confrontation. At issue in the broader sense is who shall con4rol the nation's elementary and secondary schools. In recent months, irate parents in places as diverse as Randolph, N.Y., Tampa, Fla., and Aurora, Colo., have demanded changes in teaching methods and materials. They want the schools to re‐emphasize the basic skills and traditional values — the three R's plus patriotism and respect for authority. They worry that their children's social and cultural values are being destroyed by too much classroom emphasis on sex education, too much study of radical and liberal politics and too much exposure to’ the lively street language and bluntly realistic life situations found in many of today's modernized textbooks. They are concerned, at a time when school taxes are going up and up, that they are not getting their money's worth, that the schools have become just another overcostly, ineffective, meddlesome American bureaucracy. The protesters constitute only a few thousand of the millions of parents with children in the nation's public schools, but their cries for change are loud. Most educators are resisting change. They say their critics are ultra‐conservative with no concern about the consequences of censorship and denial of academic freedom. But here and there a few school officials are giving in and putting parents on textbook and curriculum committees. And a number of pubIlishers are expurgating their ‘books rather than lose lucrative sales. “This thing has spread since the West Virginia outbreak to the point that there is not an educational publisher of any size who has not made at least minor revision in the face of Pressure,” says Craig T. Scmft a textbook publisher whop serves as chairman of the Freedom to Read Committee of the Association of American Publishers. “The right of teachers to [teach and publishers to publish and students to study is seriously endangered,” he adds.

The Curse. Of Gray Shingles,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/26/archives/the-curse-of-gray-shingles.html,"NANTUCKET, Mass.—On Nantucket, at least 99 out of every 100 buildings are gray; almost every summer cottage, the hospital, the high school, the state‐police station, the two supermarkets, the newspaper office, the steamboat dock—you name it and it's gray. When you enter the harbor at the jetties, you won't see a single un‐gray building, except my two lighthouses, until you reach Brant Point. Every house on the cliff and every house on Hulbert Avenue, the local Snob Rows, is gray. Twas not always thus, Sonny, despite the fact that the island has been known as the Gray Lady ever since whaling days. The old mansions in the heart of town, built before the civil War, were mostly (and still are) red brick and painted wood. Even when I first started coming here in 1917, most stores and places like, the schools and the old folks home had painted exteriors. But some time before World War II weathered shingles became de rigueur. There are now the Nantucket Planning Board and the Historic Districts Commission to check on the practicability and good taste of all proposed new structures on the island. But judging by some of the legalized abortions which have toadstooled recently, particularly out Madaket way, even the Houston Astrodome or the Empire State Building would be deemed fitting— provided,’ of course, the architects agreed to shingle the structures. To counteract the island's grayness. many cottages sport window boxes gaudy to the point of luridness. It's tradition at my gray cottage (which sits between the two range lighthouses, circa 1838, long since declared surplus by the Government) to have boiled lobster and to display window boxes on the day after our arrival. This year, one of our two teen‐agers had just obtained her driver's license. In the equitable division of allowanceearning summer chores, which always takes place at least in theory when the man of the house is in full‐time residence, she was an eager volunteer to, perform any distant errand. And so she was dispatched to pick up four live lobsters for dinner, some eggs for breakfast and two window boxes filled with gravel, top soil, dried oow manure and a dazzling mixture of geraniums and petunias. When she arrived back at the cottage, she announced—all too uncontritely, if you want my opinion—that “I blew it.” Of course, the first thought Was that she had wrecked the Gas Guzzler. But no such luck. It seems that she had placed the window boxes on the back seat. She had put the lobsters and the breakfast materials on the back floor, where they would not escape or break, respectively. Then, en route hone, a dog had crossed her path, she had braked suddenly, and the window boxes had somersaulted onto the victuals, thus smashing the eggs and freeing the lobsters. There was a time when the floors of automobiles could be swept. Now they must be vacuumed. But have you ever tried to vacuum a mixture of dried cow manure and scrambled eggs inhabited by miscellaneous flora not to mention Hire and vicious fauna? rather thought not “Well, nobody's perfect,” she observed in one of the clichés of the day. “What did you want me to do, run over the dog?” I mulled over the question, and it was a nice one. Finally, I had to admit, though, that when all things were weighed in the balance—including the fact that children should be taught to be kind to animals—I'd vote to spare the canine. Irascibility is a vice to be avoided, especially as one approaches the Golden Years. But while I sorted the mutilated flora from the rebellious fauna, I tried to assess the blame for the incident. The teen‐aged driver? (Did you want her to run over the dog, you brute you?) The dog? The lobsters? Of course not. The culprits are the Planning Board and the Historic Districts Commission and their accursed gray shingles. If weren't for the dictatorial rules about grayness, who'd bother about rainbowhued window boxes? Don't tell me! Damned if I'll ever put weathered shingles on my two lighthouses—not if I have to take the matter all the way to the Supreme Court"
TV VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/27/archives/tv-view-the-new-soap-operas-they-still-dont-wash.html,"Cry for the soap opera. Struggle as it may, it still finds respect elusive. Every so often, an executive producer decides to prove to the critics that the maligned form is bursting with first‐rate talents. The critics are invited to studio performance sessions. The reviews are written. The verdicts still range from patronizing to devastating. Directors and actors return to muttering darkly about things like insensitivity. The situation must be indeed frustrating for the regular practitioners. Steady employment on a successful soap opera can generate a quite hefty income and a respectable degree of “celebrity” with a particular segment of the public. Life can be beautiful or at least comfortable. And given the wobbly patterns of work opportunities in the non‐TV areas of the stage or film, a number of solid talents have been drifting into soap opera. Some merely moonlight briefly in the daytime schedule, but many stay to become major characters. On “Another World,” for instance, now running daily for a full hour, the cast includes Douglas Watson and Anne Meacham, and one of the regular directors is Melvin Bernhardt, whose credits include the award‐winning stage production of “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man‐in‐the‐Moon Marigolds.” Scriptwriters point out that the soaps now can deal with such “mature” subjects as drUg addiction and abortion. Network executives stress that the huge profits from a long‐running soap make possible the occasional prime‐time foray into quality programing. Everyone with any direct involvement is highly supportive and enthusiastic about the form. The soap opera would seem to have everything—except that respect from objective outsiders. The problem, of course, is the very nature or structure of the form. Devised many years ago for radio, the soap is a vehicle designed to sell products, a series of brief scenes used to connect a series of money‐generating commercials. No matter the content, that basic structure remains constant, always recognizable and predictable, occasionally titillating but never provocative. A provoked viewer may not be fully receptive to that commercial for soap or margarine. The latest candidate for sales immortality is ABC's “Ryan's Hope,” presented Monday through Friday at 1 P.M. The production is recorded in New York and, far more significant, the story is set in Manhattan. The Upper West Side is nowhere near the prim settings of anonymous suburbia that are standard for soap opera. An ABC executive explains that the new setting is “both contemporary and urban centered.” That sounds promising. However, he adds: “But it is the characters themselves—youthful, colorful, vital, multi‐dimensional people—who provide an ideal framework to mount the continuing stories of personal adjustment, conflicting loyalties and changing relationships.” In other words, more of the same only in different trappings. Claire Labin and Paul Avila Mayer, the creators, executive producers and head writers of “Ryan's Hope,” know their format well. The innumerable plots revolve around three nicely contrasting families: the Ryans, owners of a neighborhood saloon; the Coleridges, whose head of the family is the chief neurosurgeon at the inevitable hospital across the, street from the saloon; and the fantastically wealthy Beaulacs, who have a nephew doing his internship at the hospital. The older Ryan folk still retain traces of a brogue, and Mrs. Ryan (Helen Gallagher) is sure to say that someone can “charm the leaves off the trees.” The younger Ryans are climbing fast, via politics and medicine. As usual, plotlines are stretched to the point of minimum Mobility. The smallest dug of inspiration is milked thoroughly. When the series began three weeks ago, viewers saw a man falling, in slow motion, down a long flight of stairs. It was soon made apparent that the young man was Frank Ryan, who was beginning his first political campaign. That was a Monday. The shot of the fall was repeated several times during the week. It wasn't until Friday that Frank was finally picked up off the floor, put on a table and wheeled into an operating room. By the end of the second week, he was still unconscious in his hospital bed. His wife then became the perfect ploy for commercial breaks. “What happened?” she would ask, stumbling out of her bedroom. “Did Frank wake up?” Very slow fadeout, with all in the vicinity looking worried. For all of its avowed dedication to the contemporary and the urban‐centered, “Ryan's Hope” might just as well be set in anonymous suburbia. As it happens, still another recent soap opera was also set on Manhattan's Upper West Side “Ann and Andy—The Way We Are,” written by Jane Chambers, was a radio production, carried on WBAI‐FM, the “listener‐sponsored” station. Opening with the street sounds of panhandlers and hustlers (a Puerto Rican male whispering to Ann: “Ahhh—I want to show you something”) the programs billed the setting as “a microcosm of the civilized world.” They asked the questions: Can the individual survive, and whatever happened to the nobler instincts of mankind? • • • Of course, noncommercial radio can afford to be a bit more adventurous in the content of its soap operas. Ann and Andy simply lived together. He was an idealistic young lawyer, she a political science student, who apparently spent most of her time of demonstrations. At a gay liberation rally she met Amy, a radical activist and lesbian, who had just started an affair with Nancy, who worked for the telephone company and was Andy's sister. All of which obviously, is not your typical cup of “Guiding Light” tea. But even Ann and Andy couldn't avoid the curiosities and clichés of the soap form. The political “heavies” were smeared with a gross brush. Said one, in confrontation with a protest group of lesbians: “That's damn clever—for a woman.” And the other side; the good people, were drenched in sweetness. One scene had Amy and Nancy arising after: their first. night in bed together. Amy: “Thank you.” Nancy: “It was beautiful, wasn't it?” Amy: “And it will get better and better.” Cry for the soap opera. Cry for us all."
"In power, and down and out",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/27/archives/in-power-and-down-and-out-ella-grasso-was-elected-to-do-all-those.html,"Early last May, on the eve of her 56th birthday and four months after her inauguration as Governor of Connecticut, Ella T. Grasso rose early, went to pray at a 6:30 A.M. mass, prayed again at 8 in a Hartford hotel at the Governor's annual prayer breakfast, again at 9 at a memorial mass for John M. Bailey, her political mentor and former state and national Democratic chairman, and finally arrived at the State Capitol at 10. Flanked by a state policeman in civvies and her husband, a retired school administrator whom she calls “my very best friend, Tommy,” the Governor, clad in a beige pants suit, strode serenely, shoulders back, aware of being observed, up the central stairs to her second‐floor office. People who know her say her walk began changing when a poll showed, about this time last year, that she was destined to rule her state. Her daughter, Susane, once gave Mrs. Grasso a toy duck to remind her not to waddle. Other changes, too: “Suddenly,” remarks an old acquaintance, “she's Italian. Never used to mention it, but now she's free at last to be an ethnic.” In her corner office, the Governor conferred with staff members hurriedly, standing up, eyeglasses pushed up into her short, tousled hair, a mannerism she acquired from John Bailey. Minutes later, she headed for the hallway again, gesturing “follow me” to a writer who was trailing her around. “I've been to work,” she whispered to him conspiratorially. (Newly ethnic though she may be, her syllabic emphasis also betrays Yankee finishing school—Chaffee.) “I've established my turf. Let's get out here.” Not that Ella Grasso doesn't like her new job. She put in 22 years of public life to get it and relishes its long, hard days. But this was to be a particularly strife‐ridden day at the Capitol, which, she decided, might best be served by her playing hooky. The Legislature, known officially in Connecticut as the General Assembly, had chosen this day to ram through the year's budget, a bulging bill of $1.68‐billion in expenditures and a record‐breaking laundry list of taxes, exceeding that of the previous year by more than $125‐million, all in one mighty thrust. The two totals had to match exactly. Mrs. Grasso had said she would sign only a balanced budget and clearly meant it. The least of the Governor's worries was that the Legislature would fail her. Her fellow partisans were, in the main, disciplined and loyal as well as overwhelming in power (a Democratic preponderance of 118 to 33 in the House of Representatives; 29 to 7 in the Senate). What worried her was all those other people, hundreds of them, crowding the lobbies of both legislative floors, sporting protest buttons, wielding placards, pinning their legislators against Coke machines with fiery demands to upset the Governor's budget. Most of these angry constituents were “her people,” in whose interests she had campaigned and who helped elect her: welfare mothers, parents of handicapped children, teachers and, most numerous of all, state employes, all of whom were budgeted to receive, in a year of severe inflation, not an additional penny. Holding the line doesn't mean holding the line—it means cutting back. Holding fast to last year's level of payments to needy welfare families means, in a year of inflation, pushing those families well below the subsistence level. The soaring costs of hospitalization, nursing‐home care and medicines for the aged and indigent on Medicaid—rising costs the state is mandated to meet—mean that something else must be cut back: job‐producing construction of buildings and highways, and state aid to libraries and to budget‐crushed cities. “On a television panel, someone once called me the last of the big spenders,” Mrs. Grasso recently lamented to a lunch gathering of the state's newspaper editors. “Now, here I am—Governor—with not a penny to spend.” It is a year when “big‐spending” Democrats dominating the nation's state capitals and city halls are cast as the ax‐wielders in a recurring Republican dream of big slashing. A year of Democratic rethinking of goals, of tormented reappraisal of rising expectations. A year when the Democrat‐controlled Joint Economic Committee of Congress, headed by Senator Hubert Humphrey, declared that “the picnic is over for state and local governments.” A year of Mayor Abe Beame's devastating “crisis budget.” A year when New York Gov. Hugh Carey declared, “The times of plenty, the days of wine and roses, are over.” A year when Oklahoma's Democratic Gov. David Boren, after selling his state airplane and cutting his personal staff, demanded and got laws for tougher prosecution of fathers who desert families and for compelling welfare mothers to register for work. And, most startling of all, a year when California's young, crusading Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown declared that the “liberalism of the sixties is dead.... The fact that there's a problem doesn't mean that more government will make it better. It might make it worse.... I'm rethinking some of that escalatory social interventionism. Inaction may be the highest form of action.” Yet Ella Grasso, for all her state's troubles, is an exception to that group of reappraising Democrats. From her, there hasn't come a hint of forsaking the traditional Democratic commitment to services for the dispossessed. To her, the present economic turbulence is a temporary storm, a mere cold front passing through. She continues to speak of doing “all those good things” she got elected to do in, say, the third and fourth years of her term, “when our economy will once again be vibrant, expansive,” and increased incomes will yield increased state revenues to pay for increased services. Perhaps Mrs. Grasso can afford more optimism than Governors of bigger, more urbanized states. While recession unemployment runs high — close to the national average of more than 9 per cent—so do incomes, the highest per capita of any state in the nation. For most people, living is graceful in Connecticut—gleaming schools, lovely town greens, idyllic country roads through woodsy two‐acre plots. The lovely greenery makes it easy to screen out the squalor in much of Hartford, the smokestacks of Bridgeport, the crunch on New Haven, where the most valuable downtown property, the Yale spread, is tax‐free. Hartford's anguished cry for the state to take over its local welfare cost falls on deaf ears in a primarily rural Legislature. After all, good living does cost, and Connecticut's real‐estate, business and sales taxes are among the nation's highest. To Mrs. Grasso's right, conservatives and Republicans, who last year flashed a campaign bumper sticker reading, “Connecticut Can't Afford a Governess,” lift we‐warnedyou fingers at her faintest mention of revived spendingas‐usual. To her left, a liberal and labor bloc repeats an annual chorus demanding a state income tax, to which Mrs. Grasso turns a stony ear. In her campaign, persuaded by heavily negative polls on Connecticut's most emotional issue, Mrs. Grasso pledged herself against an income tax —and that's that. Having little predilection for long‐range strategic reappraisals, Mrs. Grasso's stance is simply to tough it out until the storm passes. She has stood tough against vociferous welfare moms and the articulate school and university lobbies. But she has also been equally unyielding with an aroused small‐business bloc that foresaw doom in her imposition of Connecticut's 7 per cent sales tax (highest in the nation) on “nonessential” services: employment agencies, management consulting, data processing, car and truck rentals, even sign painting, interior decorating and telephone answering services. These new levies, combined with a 7 per cent tax on stock dividends (for coupon clippers earning $20,000 a year or more) and a corporation tax increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, form the bulk of the $125‐million increase in the Grasso tax package. Where Mrs. Grasso's stance of toughness—and her political agility—met its severest test was in facing a revolt of state employes, the most powerful lobby of all, if for no other reason than that it is closest to home. Mrs. Grasso's effectiveness as Governor rests largely on the loyal labor of planners and clerks, academicians and social workers, state police and toll takers. By law, these employes are due an automatic annual pay rise reflecting not a cost‐of‐living increase but supposed increments of skill. To cancel that provision of their “contract” requires a special act of the Legislature. And there stood Ella—the state employes' friend—daring to ask the Legislature for that special act. Anticipating some protest, Mrs. Grasso had tried to head it off with the open rumination that she might have to lay off 2,000 employes. Unmoved by the threat., one union leader called the increment cancellation “inhumane” and “immoral,” accusing Mrs. Grasso of “betrayal” and “lying,” a criticism the Governor called the most bitter of her political life, “a first.” Legislature Republicans charged her with “breach of contract,” while opposing tax increases that might pay for the increment. The union leaders publicly threatened a statewide strike. Mrs. Grasso responded icily, “Each of us knows the limitation of the possible.” While organized opposition to other budget cuts and tax increases collapsed the night the budget was rammed through, the state‐employe unions pressed on. Mrs. Grasso had to deal with, them. After high‐tension meetings with leaders of three stateemploye unions, strike talk still charging the air, Mrs. Grasso conjured up a nifty soltition, agreeable to the unions, while still holding the line. The state would pay three‐quarters of the normal increment by diverting $5.3‐million from its contributions to the employes' retirement fund. That, too, would require a special act of the General Assembly. At that point, the loyalty and discipline of her fellow Democrats collapsed. The Legislature refused, on the ground that in a year when nobody was getting anything, state employes should not be the first in line to get something. At her daily press conference, Mrs. Grasso threw up her hands—she had tried, but lost. Her net gain, however, was considerable, having been restored as champion of her employes. The monkey was off her back—and on the Legislature's. But the unions would not let her so easily salvage her image. They insisted she force the Legislature to reconsider. Putting her prestige on the line, she did. In early June, the final week of the legislative session, both houses caved in. Senate Majority Leader Joseph Lieberman emerged from the Governor's office, wilted, explaining ruefully, “She has to live with them all year after we go home.” With some Democratic defections, Mrs. Grasso's plan for restoring the increment passed. Many of her campaign supporters who wore “We Love Ella” and “We All Win With Ella” buttons, particularly those in the liberal‐intellectual flank of her party, express disappointment in her: “She's so conservative.” While some admiration remains, love went out with the honeymoon: Nobody won in Ella's austerity budget. The period following a honeymoon is a good time to take a fresh look at the bride —who she is, and always was. During her campaign, one critic characterized Mrs. Grasso's philosophy as “Connecticut's best‐kept political secret.” Not so. Immediately before her election as Governor she served two terms in Congress, casting hundreds of votes. If her record as “last of the big spenders” can be measured by the “favorable rating” of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, she barely qualifies, with a lukewarm 80 per cent. On emotionally charged, “symbolic” issues reflecting changing national values, “conservative” is a reasonably accurate word for her positions, which she voiced unabashedly during last year's campaign. Abortion? Against it, although “respecting” its legality as declared by the Supreme Court. Marijuana? Present laws punishing for possession in small quantities, as well as its sale, need no change. Prayer in schools? She recently signed a bill, opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, permitting a period of “silent meditation,” a prayer‐in‐schools substitute certain to be challenged in the courts. On these issues, her liberal critics frequently sum up Mrs. Grasso, in faintly disapproving tones, as “very moralistic” and “very religious.” Counterbalancing her “conservatism,” since her first days in the State Legislature almost a quarter‐century ago, Mrs. Grasso has strongly identified herself with—and often written bills for—bigger investments in schools, health care (especially mental health), expansion of aid to the handicapped and mentally retarded, and streamlining the bureaucracy—“all the good things” she hopes to advance as Governor as soon as “times get better.” Neither orthodox liberals nor orthodox conservatives discern a pattern to categorize her by—a state of affairs which frustrates both groups. Local Democratic chieftains, particularly in larger cities, are upset by Mrs. Grasso's faithlessness to patronage, particularly after the help they gave her as one of their own. She even reached out of the state to fill such key jobs as commissioners of welfare and of finance. Confounding as it may be to these fixed‐view interests, her career does have an inner consistency, not to be explained by ideology but by three powerful influences of happenstance: (1) her political initiation through the partydetached, study‐and‐efficiency‐minded League of Women Voters, (2) her early tutelage in the navigation of party crosscurrents by a master pilot, John Bailey, and (3) the security, the sense of root, of extended‐family life among Italian immigrants in the factory town of Windsor Locks, a milieu of scant means and status, but rich with striving and pervading tradition. From this trinity of influences, Mrs. Grasso has metamorphosed in only one important way: development of a political skill perhaps unmatched in her state, especially the major subskill of not getting trapped in the shifting crusades of one's allies and friends. That's why Governor Grasse was so eager to get out of the Capitol on that strife‐torn day in early May. Before the day was over—she'd sensed it coming—state workers would drown out General Assembly debate with a hallway chant: “Defeat the budget!” Worse still, welfare lobbyists would swarm outside her office door, shouting—and this was no adoring campaign slogan—“We want Ella! Where's Ella?” Where Ella Rosa Giovanna Oliva Tambussi Grasso was, by the good luck of a promise made some weeks earlier, was on a journey to her childhood, a ceremonial visit to Chaffee School, these days gone coed as Loomis‐Chaffee, a halfhour's drive from Hartford. In an unmarked‐ police sedan, her modest official carriage, she sat up front with the driver; her husband, Tommy, and her writer‐companion in back Nostalgically, she directed her driver around the picturebook campus. Her ticket, as a youngster, through this elegant place was provided by a Rockefeller scholarship endowment and her high grades at St. Mary's Parochial School, just as her high grades here opened the way to a scholarship at Mt. Holyoke College, a Phi Beta Kappa key, a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in sociology and economics, followed by a master's degree. Her academic energy apparently came from her mother who was an immigrant and “a great reader”; Ella's father, a baker, “pretended he could read and write.” She commuted daily from Windsor Locks to Chaffee by railroad. (Still devoted to rail transportation and a disdainer of proliferating highways, she made a point of traveling to her inauguration on a commuter train from Windsor Locks.) “In my senior year at Chaffee,” the Governor mused, “they said in the yearbook I would be the first woman Mayor of Windsor Locks. I was horrified—politics! I mean, I aspired to something eminently greater.” Specifying no destination, she told her police driver, “Turn right, turn left,” and the car crossed the town line into Windsor Locks, past an ancient, long, red‐brick factory. “That used to be a cotton mill and my mother worked there. She also wound armatures at General Electric, next to the railroad station. My father had his bakery shop right where that orange car is. This is the street where my father was hit by a rock, because he was an Italian looking for work. My mother came here from Italy when she was 14 and lived with her brother, and made $5 a week, her best wages—go right, please—and married my father and moved into his house with all my father's brothers and their mother, who was a tyrant. My mother had to be subservient, and she was not the type. “Now, this is Olive Street, my street. That's where I was born, right there, and married Tom and we lived there, until we moved across the street there, 13 Olive Street. My uncle lives right there, we shared a common driveway, and he's still got my mother's cat. Tom, where do you want to have lunch?” Tom suggested the Suffield Inn in a neighboring town, where, as it happens, the restaurateur is an active Democratic committeeman. As soon as everyone was seated, Tom excused himself and went to the telephone to check on the “state of things.” Grasso, whom the Governor's staff refer to as “the Doctor” in recognition of his advanced degree in education, accompanies his wife on most ceremonial outings and deflects many of the phone calls aimed at the Governor by old political and personal friends. While he was phoning, the Governor chatted about her political beginnings. During World War II, fresh out of graduate school, newly married and employed in a research job in Hartford by the U.S. War Manpower Commission, young Mrs. Grasso joined the League of Women Voters. In its nonpartisan way, that group selects a cluster of reform issues to “study,” its more gung‐ho members becoming impressive authorities on those issues. The L.W.V. concentration at the time was on the inefficiency of county government and its frequent duplication of services offered by towns and the state: the group also studied the possible elimination of local, often unprofessional, courts, and the transference of their authority to the state. Those issues were to define Mrs. Grasso's early political career. In 1953, Windsor Locks, through population growth, became entitled to an additional State Representative. The intoxicating thought crossed her mind to jump out of the sidelines and into the fray. “The Democratic party in its great wisdom,” the Governor related, suspending a forkful of cottage cheese, “had nominated a Gold Star mother. I went to see the lady and persuaded her that she really wanted to stay home, not go to Hartford every day—and I became the candidate. Then an older man decided to challenge in a primary, and I remember I sat in my living room and wept. Primaries are bitter campaigns, and I thought I shouldn't subject myself and my family to a fight. Anyway, I got elected. “I was lucky because I got there at a time when there weren't many Democratic legislators, and all the bright young people had gone off with [former Governor] Chester Bowles to wherever he was off to. So since nature abhors a vacuum, I said to myself. ‘We'll fill that little gap.’ I said to John Bailey [who was not in the Legislature, but the kind of state Democratic chairman who was very much in charge]. I said. ‘This is my platform, what I campaigned on. I think what we should do is write these bills and make them Democratic party bills.’ He let me do just as I wished. So I'd get a bill written, go and testify on it, write up a press release, cut the stencil and distribute it—you know, just a one‐man army. So it was great—absolute bliss. Then, the next year. I was able to become involved in the making of a government. That was the year Abe [Ribicoff] ran for Governor. Abe was a Congressman and I helped bring him up to date on all the things happening in Connecticut. I was writing a budget message for him when Susane got the measles. She was so sick I had to sit by her, but while I was sitting there at least I had something to do. It was exciting, exciting.” Did she feel any guilt in connection with the family, women in politics being so rare in those days? Faint surprise. “I was with her. Until Susane was better, I wouldn't have left. And everybody on Olive Street has been there for a hundred years, my parents across the street, my uncle next door, people all around who knew me before I was born, so I could leave my children. They were secure. And I always got home in time to cook supper. I felt my husband deserved it—even if I had to kill myself in the process. You see, I'm an Italian wife, and that made a difference.” Mrs. Grasso's singular hero was—and still remains —John Bailey. He ruled state Democratic politics not as a heavy‐handed boss but with a remarkable talent for harmonizing warring camps and personalities in his party. His skill dazzled not only Mrs. Grasso but John F. Kennedy, who lifted Bailey to the national chairmanship. But why would a party boss —any party boss—encourage a novice legislator in bills to eliminate county jobs and local courts? “Because he also had a broader view, that politics was an instrument for service,” Mrs. Grasso replied. “He was the best friend the liberals ever had, because he provided the machinery for others to get things done. For instance, years later—it's 1968—Bailey is national chairman, and I'm co‐chairman of the resolutions committee at the Democratic National Convention. President Johnson doesn't want any anti‐Vietnam plank in the platform, and the national chairman is my best friend—and I choose to support the anti‐Vietnam plank. There are times when accommodations can be made, but other times when push comes to shove, and you have to do what conscience requires. I thought John was going to throw me out the window that day. He was tallying the anticipated vote and said to me, ‘There'll be x Connecticut votes against Vietnam,’ and I said, ‘John, there'll be x‐plus‐one because I'm not going to support the President.’ He just glared at me and shook his head, then helped me see Carl Albert so I could speak for one minute for my side. And that's the kind of guy he was. He held power lightly. He was not formidable. Never. “The most important lesson I learned from John Bailey was patience. The objective may not be secured in a day or a week, but you may work toward it. Don't panic under pressure. You know, we got some very tough legislation through in a State Legislature where we had one vote to spare. Try telling people, when for the first time the Democrats are going to get a lot of patronage, that we're going to eliminate the county system and all the political jobs that go with it, change the court system and all its political spoils. It wasn't easy. I remember talking to some legislators every day. I wouldn't let them out of my sight. We fed them in my office so they wouldn't get lost.” Patience, however, was not all she learned from Bailey. Mrs. Grasso became a close observer of his wizardry at averting ccmbat by harmonizing the combatants. In 1965, after the Supreme Court issued its one‐man, one‐vote decision for apportioning legislative districts, Connecticut called a constitutional convention, its first since the early 19th century. Bailey designated Mrs. Grasso as Democratic floor leader. Awed by the responsibility, she steeped herself in the minutiae of state history and tradition. Bailey was awed for other reasons—the possible destruction by voters of the convention's work. He made a fateful personal decision, and Mrs. Grasso watched him spend weeks selling it to reluctant Democrats in the Legislature: a 50‐50 sharing of convention seats by Democrats and Republicans, even though Democrats were then in firm control of the state. Thus, every important issue would require arduous negotiation—and eventual agreement—between both parties. Bailey's theory was that a constitution which could survive such a tough goingover would surely survive at the polls—which it did. “The lesson Ella learned from that,” says a staff aide who covered the convention as a reporter, “was that in something really big and important, you'd better get everybody's fingerprints on it. What came out was a true political document, in its best sense. Maybe not perfect, but close to politically perfect.” By 1955, Mrs. Grasso was assistant Democratic floor leader in the State House of Representatives. Bailey's deepening faith in his protégée was displayed in 1956 when he persuaded Mrs. Grasso to give up the Legislature and become the state's Democratic National Committeewoman. She found it an anesthetizing bore. So, two years later, he slated her to run for Sezretary of State, traditionally a woman's post. Outwardly, the job has more glamour than power, but it has distinct advantages for the ambitious person canny enough to make the most of it. Mrs. Grasso turned her firstfloor Capitol office into what she calls a “people's lobby.” “Everybody who wanted to have a meeting place and didn't know where to go came to my office. I gave space to the League of Women Voters. The job opened a large window for me on the world of Connecticut.” She gazed out that window for 12 years with Baileyesque patience, until 1970 when her district's Republican Representative, Thomas Meskill, announced his run for the governorship— and she made straight for his seat. Winning it by a hairy margin of only 4,060 votes she bucked the Nixon landslide two years later with a 47,507‐vote spread. But they were not a happy four years. Tom suffered two heart attacks; she was plagued by an inner‐ear infection and consequent dizziness occasionally necessitating cancellation of speaking engagements. She abhorred the weekly commute to Washington. Last year, when Meskill, a sworn budget balancer who wearied at the stresses of turning that goal into reality, decided after one term to trade his Governor's chair for the Federal bench, Democratic polls showed Mrs. Grasso a favorite for her party's nomination. She jumped in, won the state convention by acclamation and tromped over her Republican opponent, Representative Robert Steele. Then came a shock. Magnanimously, Meskill had announced he was delivering Mrs. Grasso a solvent treasury, twitting her for a deficit he had inherited from the Democrats. On taking over, Mrs. Grasso learned how Meskill had “balanced” income and outgo. His welfare department had swept under the rug a backlog of more than 500,000 overdue bills from hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and pharmacies. In addition, Meskill's estimate of 1975–76 Medicaid costs fell far short of Mrs. Grasso's. This “budget balancing” sleight‐of‐hand stuck Mrs. Grasso with $41‐million in unexpected costs, exacerbating her own budget trauma. Despite those woes, Mrs. Grasso hastened to fulfill one central campaign pledge, which she had advanced with League of Women Voters' zeal — a promise of “new openness” in government. She presented—and got passed—a Freedom of Information Act, patterned after Florida's model “sunshine law,” to insure public access to meetings and records of state agencies. She called four public hearings on the budget, each in a different city, at which anyone could speak while the Governor—sometimes uncomfortably—sat and listened. Less formally, she conducts preannounced “office hours” in town halls around the state, hours during which any citizen may make an appointment to discuss a problem personally with the Governor. A staff member follows up every request for help or information. Almost‐daily press conferences, with television cameras present, and her almost‐daily visits to local public events, at which she circulates and chats, indeed make her a uniquely accessible Governor. She wears lightly, even itchily, the mantle of the nation's first woman Governor elected without succeeding her husband on the job. Feminist groups felt betrayed when, filling 20 commissionerships, Mrs. Grasso appointed only two women: one, a Carmelite nun, a temporary appointment at that, as acting commissioner for the aged, and another to the “woman's job” of consumer‐protection commissioner. Actually, she had offered cabinet posts and judgeships to seven women who turned them down. Then she infuriated women's groups by not accepting their substitute candidates, commenting, “People expect skills.” Indeed, Mrs. Grasso's appointments have won admiration for their quality. To manage her budget trials, she plucked Jay Tepper from the staff of just‐defeated Gov. John Gilligan of Ohio to be commissioner of finance. In the bloody job of budget‐axer, Tepper has emerged with broad respect, even from commissioners whose budgets were axed. To head the Department of Transportation, long dominated by highway zealots, she elevated Samuel Kanell, an almost lone advocate in his department for “balanced” mass transportation, especially railroads. Upsetting both tradition and patronage‐minded party leaders, she turned the Public Works Department over to Robert Weinerman, a political liberal and successful businessman— not a construction contractor. The criticism from women's groups subsided when Mrs. Grasso finally got acceptances from two women as judges and two others as commissioner of personnel and deputy commissioner of welfare. Her present eminence, Mrs. Grasso believes, came to her because she's an experienced politician, not because she's a woman. She gets as rankled by men's put‐downs, however, as she does by what she regards as women's haste. Mrs. Grasso experienced one of those put‐downs on a recent visit back to Congress: “I'd step into an elevator and all these guys would giggle girlishly and say, ‘Good morning, Governess.’ I kept thinking, ‘What's wrong with them? Why are they doing this?’ We've been friends a long time.... I think it was probably fear. Some women may be running against them some day and those women may just win.” Inevitably, Mrs. Grasso's name bobs up in conversation about potential Vice‐Presidential candidates. Quipsters say she's for almost anybody for President except Edmund Muskie (whom she supported in 1972) and Ted Kennedy, because they are New Englanders, and thus she would scarcely be chosen as a ticket‐balancer. She ritually pushes aside the subject with “I don't expect anyone to offer it to me.” But when a girl recently asked her at a collegians' press conference for the earliest date a woman might be a candidate for President, Mrs. Grasso shot back: “When's the next election—'76?” ■"
House Outlook Is Unclear on Plan to Authorize $2‐Billion for Range of Programs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/27/archives/president-vetoes-health-care-bill-senate-overrides-house-outlook-is.html,"WASHINGTON, July 26—President Ford vetoed today a $2‐billion health bill, and the Senate, acting with unusual speed, overrode the veto by 67 to 15. PRESIDENT VETOES HEALTH CARE BILL; SENATE OVERRIDES The President announced his veto this morning just before leaving on his European trip, and the Senate, already meeting in an unusual Saturday session, voted in the early afternoon. It was the first time that either house had voted to override one of Mr. Ford's vetoes 1this year. The House has failed several times in efforts to override vetoes of bills that it originated. House leaders could not be reached for their judgment on the prospects that the House would be able to override this veto. Ford's 36th Veto Congressional observers attributed the size of the vote today and the speed with which the Senate acted in part to the popularity of health measures and the relatively small size of the money total in the bill. The bill would authorize grants to the states for public health service programs, family planning programs, community mental health centers, migrant‐worker health centers and community health centers in rural and inner‐city areas. The bill, which was the 36th to be vetoed by Mr. Ford since he became President last August, also would authorize money for rape prevention and control, the treatment.of hemophilia and the education of nurses. It passed both houses by voice votes. The President's veto message said that the bill would both “authorize excessive appropriations levels” and be “unsound from a program standpoint.” Like preceding vetoes, Mr. Ford's action seemed in accord with his promise earlier this month to use his veto power as a “positive” instrument “to keep the Federal Government from overextending itself at the individual's expense.” Yesterday, the President vetoed a $7.9‐billion aid‐to‐education bill, saying that it would also add too much to the Federal budget. There appears to be some prospect that the House will override the veto of the education bill because it passed the House by a majority of 370 to 42, and because Congress has usually been able to push through legislation to aid education. Only four of President Ford's 36 vetoes since he took office last Aug. 9 have been overridden, all of them last year. The last such action was on Dec. 3 when the House and Senate overrode his veto of a bill increasing educational benefits for veterans. This year the House has failed to override vetoes on four key measures: a farm bill, an attempt to provide public service jobs, curbs on strip mining and a housing bill. For a bill to be enacted into law over the President's opposition, both the House and the Senate must override a veto by a two‐thirds majority. The house that originates the bill is the first to vote in a move to reverse a veto, aria in the four override attempts earlier this year, the Senate never voted because the House voted first and failed to override. Today's vote to override was preceded by a brief debate in which Senators of both parties said that the bill provided for essential national health and nursing services. Separate bills providing funds for health programs clearned Congress in late 1974, and President Ford pocket‐vetoed both of them. In an effort to meet the President's objections, Senate conferees accepted this month the lower funding levels that were contained in revised legislation passed by the House. The reductions failed to win Mr. Ford's approval, however. In his veto message, the President declared, “The levels authorized are still far in excess of the amounts we can afford for these programs. . . At a time when the over‐all federal deficit is estimated at $60‐billion, proposed authorization levels such as these cannot be tolerated.” “From a program standpoint,” Mr. Ford said, community mental health center projects have been adequately demonstrated “and should now be absorbed by the regular health services delivery system.” Also, the President said, the legislation “would auethorize several new narrow, categorical and potentially costly programs which duplicate existing authorities, including $30‐million for the treatment of hypertension, $17‐million for rape prevention and control, $10‐million for home health service demonstration agencies and $16‐million for hemophilia treatment and blood separation centers.” Mr. For contended that these “narrow categorical programs” were not consistent with development of an integrated, flexible health service delivery system.” The President also maintained that nursing schools have adequately expanded their enrollments because of Federal funds and that “the employment market for general‐duty nurses already is tightening in some areas.” In the Senate debate, Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New Nork, argued that the health measure was “just as essential to the security of the country” as a weapons bill agreed to by House‐Senate conferees yesterday. One provision of the bill would impose maximum penalties of a $1,000 fine and one year in jail on persons running Federally funded programs who coerce their clients to undergo abortions or sterilizations by threatening them with loss of health services."
"Giscard, in Interview, Stresses His Belief in ‘Liberal Reform’",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/28/archives/giscard-in-interview-stresses-his-belief-in-liberal-reform.html,"PARIS. July 27— President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is convinced that “conservative democracy is condemned” and that most people almost everywhere in the world “aspire to liberal reform.” “Reform democracy,” he said in an interview last week, is the key to his administration. The French President rejected the views, heard among some of the participants at the recent European summit conference in Brussels, that the West was in decline and the future of the democratic system in danger. “Conservative democracy is condemned,” he said. “On the other hand, in my opinion reformist democracy is unbeatable. I am convinced that if von could look in the hearts and minds of people, you would see that's what they want, nearly everywhere. The trouble is that reformist democracy is more difficult because you have to take the initiative and set up teams. It causes more problems than conservative democracy.” Discusses Domestic Affairs The President seemed relaxed, leaning on his office sota. A big howl of roses was on a coffee table. He had just lunched with Prince Fand of Saudi Arabia and was wearing a black suit, a navy‐blue knitted tie and blue shirt. He wanted to talk about France and domestic affairs, he said, because America does not know much about French politics, and besides it might be misinterpreted if he discussed international issues just before meeting President Ford in Helsinki this week. However, he did respond to a question about whether there was a lack of leadership in the Western world, indicating he did not see the problem in that way. “As long as there were people in the U.S. who thought they could lead the world alone, single‐handed,” he said, “the West was doomed to he divided. Other countries just refused to accept a single leadership. It is the nature of the Western world that we have to seek a consensus, a common view of those who have to take decisions.” He spoke of “crisis” and “disorder” in the West, but what he had in mind, he said was the economic situation and particularly the instability of exchange rates among the great trading nations. Calls for a Meeting Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has called for a meeting to deal with the monetary situation. France wants the dollar to return to a fixed rate. The United States rejects this, in favor of floating rates. “Here we have a crisis,” he said, “and the people in charge aren't even talking, getting together to discuss how serious it is.” The experts talk, he said, “but that's something else. We need a collective appreciation of the whole situation.” Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he would take up the question when he saw President Ford. Technically, he said, “You can find advantages. Notably that the floating system avoided some monetary crises in the last few years. But it is a political issue. “The atmosphere of economic disorder in the West, the widespread uncertainty of economic forecasts, the lack of confidence among the public, all this is linked to continued instability of exchange rates. So the motives for a fixed rate are political motives. It has to be talked about at the summit.” The President said Prince Fand, who visited France last week, had told him that the Arabs would not consider raising oil prices this fall if the dollar were pegged to a firm rate. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing added that he was convinced that oil would not have gone up so much if it were not for the floating dollar. Most oil sales are paid for in dollars. He made clear that he wants a regular series of meetings at the top among a small group of countries, a kind of permanent Western economic directorate that would exchange analyses and try to coordinate domestic economic policies. He has suggested a leaders' meeting of the United States, Japan, France, Britain and West Germany for this purpose and to discuss the monetary issue. The problem of representation for other members of the Common Market could be solved “with imagination.” he said, with rotating representatives or divided responsibilities. In any case, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he thought Europe was closer than realized to the point where it could participate as a single member of a tripartite group—Europe, the United States and Japan. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing cited, economic preoccupations as the main reason why the French political climate is not more clearly and resoundingly in support of his reformist‐mindedl administration. But he said he was confident that further, more important changes will be accepted. The emphasis throughout an hour's conversation was on his belief that social and economic reform through democratic means was the sure answer to the French, and the general modern political problem. But “liberal reform.” he pointed out “is not one of the traditions of French politics.” “France is a country that has always swung between conservatism and revolution,” he said. “There are several very rare cases of liberal reform, little known abroad, and that is what I want to implant in France.” He said nobody would have believed a year ago that he would be able to lower the voting age to 18, and get through liberalized divorce and abortion laws without outraging the public. The next set of reforms are far more sensitive to his constituency, however, and he was asked if he feared a rebellion when voters began to feel reforms in their pocketbooks. The first bill on the calendar when the Assembly resumes in September is a new real estate law, the President said. He described it as a means of “making sure that beyond a certain construction limit, land usage in the center of towns derives from the people and belongs to the community,” “When the justice of this is demonstrated it's very difficult to oppose it,” he said. “That's why we aren't afraid of a rebellion.” Mr. Giscard d'Estaing added that the vote of the Communist‐Socialist opposition on the bill “will be a political test of their attitude.” “They always said they wanted structural reforms,” he said, “this is an important and necessary one, so their vote will have political significance.” The bill provides for a specific limit of cubic space to be allowed for building on new land or when an existing building is demolished. Beyond that limit, the builder must pay the municipality for additional space used. If he turns a four or five‐story building into a skyscraper, he has to pay for the occupied air. Municipalities will be required to use the funds to buy up other property for open space, or for public housing. An even more controversial reform of the lax laws, with an introduction of capital gains tax for the first time in France, will go to the Assembly in the spring, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said."
Weinberger Moves to End Ban On Research Involving Fetuses,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/30/archives/weinberger-moves-to-end-ban-on-research-involving-fetuses.html,"WASHINGTON, July 29 (AP) —Casper W. Weinberger, Secretary, of Health, Education and Welfare, acted today to lift the 13‐month‐old Congressional moratorium on medical research involving human fetuses, well‐placed sources said. Mr. Weinberger approved, without major changes, the 16 recommendations forwarded by a national commission last April 30, the sources said. It was not learned immediately when H.E.W. would resume funding studies involving pregnant women and unborn children. Lifting the ban will probably be effective upon publication of Mr. Weinberger's action in the Federal Register, it was said. Antiabortion forces led the drive for the ban, imposed by Congress in June, 1974. They argued that experiments on living fetuses inside mothers about to have abortions violated the rights of The unborn. MORE Medical researchers said the ban also had the effect of blocking experiments such as taking blood samples from fetuses to try to diagnose defects early, which could prove beneficial for thousands of children in the future. Congress created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Society to provide the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare with recommendations on research involving fetuses, prisoners and children who cannot give informed consent, and on psychosurgery. The commission recommended that fetal research be resumed immediately, provided that parents gave their informed consent and proper review procedures are in effect. In the case of a pregnant woman, the commission said that therapeutic research should be encouraged provided there was little risk to the fetus, but that nontherapeutic research should be undertaken carefully if there was any significant risk to the unborn. “It is further provided that nontherapeutic research directed at the pregnant‐women may be conducted and supported only if the father has not objected, both where abortion is not at issue and where an abortion is anticipated,” the panel said. Nontherapeutic research with fetuses during abortions “may be conducted or supported” by H.E.W. if that is the only way to obtain important biomedical knowledge, the fetus is less than 20 weeks old survival animal research preceded it, the commission said. chances are not altered and"
The Cult Of Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/30/archives/the-cult-of-change.html,"WASHINGTON, July 29—There is widespread disillusionment with Government, big business, labor unions and other major institutions. Politically, this expresses itself in an uneasy mood that resembles conservatism but is more nearly passivity and a withdrawal from world and national concerns to those of family and community. Such periods of disarray have occurred before. When the nation was preparing to celebrate its Centennial a hundred years ago, the corruption of the Grant Administration, the frustrations of Reconstruction, and the severe economic depression beginning in 1873 produced a comparable decline in national morale. But unsettling cultural influences exist today that were unknown in the past. Among many serious intellectuals as well as among the commercially‐motivated tastemakers in the popular media, for example, there reigns what the British critic Christopher Booker has termed “neophilia” —a love of the new simply because it is new. There is a cult of change. Human perceptions and social needs do change, but that is only half the truth. The other half is that the enduring constants of human nature do not change. There is in every human spirit a tension between selfishness and selfsacrifice. The cult of change is peculiarly inappropriate as a basis for analyzing and guiding American society today. Looking at the United States over the last twenty years, we can readily see that ours is a society that has been racked by change. Twenty years ago this fall, American schools were making their first efforts to comply with the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision of the previous year. It marked the beginning of the civil rights revolution that was to move to the lunch counter, the voting booth, and the place of work. Although a serious gap still exists between the living standards of blacks and whites, a traditionally exploited racial minority has moved into the mainstream of society. It was a brilliant juridical and political accomplishment of which Americans can be proud. Yet the civil rights revolution unavoidably subjected American society to severe stress. If the United States had been required to cope with no other problem in these last two decades, the racial issue in all its complex ramifications would have taxed the nation's moral wisdom and political skill, its capacity to shed habits and suppress prejudices, its ability to compromise and to innovate—in short, its capacity for change. The striving for racial equality was change in a positive direction, but change can also be for the worse. Thus, the serious inflation of recent years has changed the value of our money and had a debilitating effect on our confidence in planning the future. Change can also be ambiguous. The Vietnam war and the domestic turmoil surrounding it altered the nation's perception of itself in world affairs in ways that are salutory and others that are damaging. In human relationships, change is not limited to blacks and smaller minorities such as Indians and Chicanos. Women and homosexuals are also pressing for genuine equality. The Supreme Court has been an agent of social change not only in outlawing racial discrimination but in several other spheres as well, It has abolished prayer in the public schools, effectively barred public financial assistance in church‐related schools, legalized abortion, greatly loosened restrictions against pornographic movies, and reformed the way in which state legislatures are apportioned. These many different changes have naturally varied in their impact and seriousness. Some have touched the whole society, while others have struck some persons and touched many other persons not at all. No change occurs without a cost to someone, he it an economic or political or psychic cost, be it tangible or intangible. A people can bear only so many costs at one time. A society, like en individual, can only bear so much stress. While our society has been undergoing these large and small transformations, its politics has been convulsed by assassinations, confrontations, and startling scandals. What is needed in these circumstances is political leadership that can provide people with renewed sense of competence and of control over their own destiny. Ideally, such a leadership would respond to both the conservative and the liberal impulses of society. It would respond to the liberal passion for justice and to the conservative respect for order and established institutions. It would recognize that if constructive changes are to succeed, people need time and leadership in reordering their lives to take account of them. It would hold out the hope of progress but also the reassurance of reasonable stability. Such leadership would be an exercise in politics of the highest order, much more demanding than an easy radicalism that promises new things it cannot deliver or stalwart reactionary faith that rejects everything new. No such leadership is now clearly visible on the horizon. But in society's great conversation about itself that is politics, the first step toward meeting a need is discerning the shape of that need."
"Respect for Life—and Capital Punishment, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/30/archives/respect-for-life-and-capital-punishment-too.html,"All the young years of my life I was against capital punishment. Passionately, and with all my heart, as I opposed Richard Nixon (the first Richard Nixon), Joseph McCarthy, and the Pentagon. But years have passed, times have changed. McCarthy died in ignominy, Nixon broods on Elba, and I believe in capital punishment. More than believe in it. I long for it with an eagerness that, in truth, frightens me a little. But I am not ashamed. My upbringing, my early religious training, and my expensive liberal education all converged on one central tenet, which became one of the few values I have been able to wear proudly and intact from my ponytail and saddle‐shoes teens through the radical chic of my twenties, all the way to that moment in my life when I began to sympathize with Helen Trent—and that is the value of human life. Virtually every decision I have made that required a value‐judgment, from whether or not to support the war in Vietnam or abortion, to whether or not to get a divorce, was ultimately based on, or strongly influenced by, the reverence I have for human life. Moreover, respect for human life is, and should be, at the heart of every social contract, and every major religion. It is because of this reverence, which civilized society has always—if hypocritically—acknowledged, that the taking of human life outside the formal carnage of war has always been taboo, along with incest and cannibalism. And, in consequence, the unwarranted taking of a life was, in the past, repaid with the most awful and solemn penalty society was capable of meting out. A murderer paid for his savage act with his own life, and the ledgers of cosmic justice moved a hair closer to balance. Forget about deterrence. (Although Prom. James Q. Wilson, author of “Thinking Abaut Crime,” shrewdly points out that even when legal the death penalty has been so infrequently carried out in this century that its deterrence capability simply cannot be determined.) Execution—preferably in public—should be a solemn ritual of great significance—a ritual that powerfully announces to all its citizens that the state so values human life that it must mark its violation with the most awful penalty available. Those who assert that capital punishment is wrong because the state should not itself take on the guilt of murder completely miss the point. For by failing to take the life of those who murder their fellow men, the state becomes a passive accessory after the fact. The state says, in effect, that murder is no more serious an offense than embezzlement or shoplifting. When children grow up in a state that often releases even the most sadistic murderer after a relatively short prison sentence, or, in the extreme, no sentence at all, how can these children fail to get the message: that neither their elders nor their society gives great weight to human life—or its destruction. My desire for capital punishment became particularly obsessive recently when within a two‐week period the public was treated to an interview with a young mugger‐murderer. This chilling young man described the sang‐froid with which he killed innocent people, and when asked if he felt guilty responded (smiling) that, no, after a murder he usually laughed, finding slaughter both droll and mundane. The fact that this man is still free, let alone alive, to tell his tale unpunished is an invitation to millions of young, poor or disaffected men to do the same. Then there was a news story of 15‐year‐old boy who had just been arrested for the brutal murder of a harmless 80‐year‐old woman, committed for all of $3. The police officers who questioned him were agog at the boy's lack of remorse. “He wasn't one bit sorry. He just sat there eating tunafish sandwich. From time to time, he laughed.” Oh, yes—because of the boy's age, his name could not be reported, nor could he be sent to jail. Are we really to believe that letting these two killers go free shows a reverence for human life? That seems to me insane. Indeed, it is the innocent victims of these amoral creatures whose lives deserved, but did not receive, reverence. And by committing the inhuman act of wanton murder, the aggressors forfeit their right to be valued highly as those who do not kill. And I don't give a damn if inside every murderer there's a Birdman of Alcatraz dying to get out. A final word about revenge. Those who lobby against the death penalty deride revenge as its justification. Under other circumstances, perhaps they would deride jealousy, envy, gluttony and pride. But these are all real and honest feelings that most people act on and give in to at some point in their lives. For the same reason that we sometimes eat too much when we're no longer hungry, we hope to taste revenge against one who has killed someone we love: because it tastes good."
Notes on People.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/02/archives/notes-on-people-gsa-head-resigns-cites-circumstances.html,"The resignation of Arthur F. Sampson, who had said he planned to remain as head of the General Services Administration until late 1976, has been accepted by President Ford effective Oct. 15. In his letter to the President, the controversial administrator of the Federal Government's housekeeping agency wrote that “circumstances are such” that he would set the earlier date. The “circumstances,” according to Washington sources, are that the White House told the appointee of President Nixon that he would be replaced and that, as the F.B.I. has acknowledged, the G.S.A. is the subject of an inquiry. At least part of Mr. Sampson's problems date back to his role in the improvements on Mr. Nixon's California and Florida properties. Nicholas A. Panuzio. 39‐year‐old Republican Mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., has confirmed that White House officials have conferred with him about succeeding Mr. Sampson. • The Army has reassigned Dr. Van M. Sim, head of the research program at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland in which the hallucinogenic drug LSD was given to 585 servicemen. Attributing the action to “allegations made in the media,” a psokesman said that the Army had made no charges against Dr. Sim. Currently on leave, he will return as special adviser to the arsenal's technical director and will have no personal involvement with testing programs. • To avoid being “wrong again” as in the United States military involvement in Southeast Asia, more attention should be paid to dissenting junior officers, Vice Adm. William P. Mack said yesterday in his retirement as commandant of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. His successor is Rear Adm. Kinnaird R. McKee. Admiral Mack said that the academy would continue the “morals courses,” instituted two years ago, to teach the ethics that Navy officials believe many midshipmen are no longer learning in their homes, schools and churches, as well as “the religious and morals of others—we have to learn with other races.” • Wearing white slacks, a head scarf and her eternal dark glasses, Greta Garbo made a rare public appearance at a concert by Birgit Nilsson, the Swedish soprano, Thursday in, Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens. The 69‐year‐old Swedish‐born former film star was accompanied by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte and his wife, Countess Kerstin, the commoner and former magazine editor for whom he renounced his title of prince and his royal rights when they married in 1946. Maine lobstermen and Vice Predident Rockefeller will be able to wave at each other when he vacations at his Seal Harbor Mine, but all other boaters will be kept at a distance of about 550 yards offshore by order of the Secret Service, the Coast Guard said yesterday. Mr. Rockefeller is to arrive in Maine today for the weekend, a spokesman said, to help his wife, Happy, “settle the family in.” He will return Aug. 9 to spend two weeks. • In one of his characteristic surprises, President Idi Amin of Uganda took as wife No. 2 a 19‐year‐old soldier in one of his army's “suicide regiments,” introducing her only as Miss Sarah, and then whisked her away to watch a mock aerial attack against “South African” targets. She had first been seen with him two weeks ago. Mr. Amin, allowed four wives as a Moslem, has another, Madina. One of his former wives was found in a car trunk a year ago. Her death was attributed to loss of blood following an abortion and her doctor later committed suicide. “I will have a very good honeymoon,” the President said, smiling broadly at newsmen. His petite wife turned her head away shyly. • Jim Whittaker, who was the first American to conquer Mount Everest, but was stopped by storms in his recent assault on K2 — the world's second highest peak —is probably “through climbing big mountains.” He returned to Seattle yesterday with his wife, Dianne, and eight other members of the Himalayan expedition. “One try at the highest and one at the second‐highest are enough,” Mr. Whittaker said. “If you do the best you can, you come back feeling okay.” • It was 115 days ago that Allan Chadburn, carrying a 120‐day supply of food, set out from East Orleans, Mass., in his 8‐foot sailboat, the smallest craft ever to attempt an Atlantic crossing. He had hoped he might make it to, Portugal in 60 days. A New Bedford fishing trawler Made the only sighting of Mr. Chadburn one week and 100 miles after he set sail. Yesterday Natalie Chadburn refuseed to consider that time might be running out on her 29‐year‐old husband. He could probably stretch his supplies, she said, “but believe me, every time that phone rings, I think it could be news of him.” • The British Government has granted Nguyen Van Thieu, now living in Taiwan, a six‐month visa to visit his son, a student, and “other family connections” in Britain Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, told Parliament yesterday that any extension would be studied by “the criteria we have traditionally applied.” • Married and childless for 42 years, Henry A. and Tess Cohen were named “nonparents of the year” and hailed for their “varied and fulfilled lifestyle” by the National Organization for Non parents Wednesday in Baltimore Past honorees have been mainly single citizens such as Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem and Stewart R. Mott. Mr. Cohen was a teacher, guidance counselor and coach in city high schools for 40 years and spent 30 summers directing a camp for underprivileged children. Mrs. Cohen is the representative of B'nai B'rith Women at United Nations headquarters and a New York League of Women Voters board member. • Edith Irving owes $1,000 less on her Federal incometax bill—$355,000 plus penalties and interest—as the result of what her husband, Clifford, called “an uptight incident and shouting match” in Southampton yesterday. Internal Revenue agents first seized 51 of her paintings at the Tower Gallery, where a show of them is to open today, and then allowed. Mrs. Irving to buy them back with $1,000 borrowed from a lawyer friend in the resort community. The tax bill is her share, as a nonresident alien, of the $495,000 I.R.S. lien on the $765,000 paid by McGraw‐Hill in 1971 for Mr. Irving's hoax “autobiography” of Howard Hughes. The money was returned to the publisher but not in that tax year, according to an I.R.S. spokesman. It was a small yield for the trouble of sending a five‐man task force to the gallery, conceded Milton Wells, who was up from the I.R.S. international division in Washington. “But it was the maximum collection‐potential,” he said. “The $1,000 was the most she could come up with and we might not have got that much at public auction.” • Reversing her notion that she and Greg Allman “made a mistake” when they married July 9, Cher Bono has withdrawn the divorce action she filed nine days later. The television entertainer, who is 29, and the rock singer, aged 27, had often been seen together recently."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/02/archives/books-of-the-times-a-world-lurking-in-the-lines.html,"The rise of women's consciousness in the nineteen‐sixties added a burden to the reader of contemporary poetry. Every observant reader in the past has been aware of the special sensibility in the poetry of women, but the tendency has been to assimilate the work into the larger body of American verse. Though it was evident, for example, that Emily Dickinson and Edna St. Vincent Millay (to take two disparate cases) expressed themselves in ways uniquely feminine, their poetry was read, by and large, as part of a tradition that extended not just from Anne Bradstreet and Phillis Wheatley to Anne Sexton and Nikki Giovanni but as one that was part of the wider stream that ran from Edward Taylor to Robert Lowell. YOU ARE HAPPY. By Margaret Atwood. 96 pages. Harper & Row. $6.95. CASTING STONES. By Helen Chasin. 47 pages. Little. Drown. $6.95. THE HOUSE ON MARSHLAND. By Louisa Glück. 42 pages. The Ecco Press. Distributed by Viking. $6.95. The new special pleading has changed all that. Now we read and reread the poets not only for the totality of their work, but also for those glimpses of the woman's world lurking in the lines and which only they are capable of revealing. In “Psyche,” an anthology designed to reflect “feminine poetic consciousness,” Barbara Segnits and Carol Hainey, the editors, wrote, “The dominant idea unifying the poetry of women is that of defining or more precisely redefining themselves and their world realistically. . . . In the past the nature of woman, her modes of perception, and her sphere of engagement have been narrowly and comfortably defined for her.” New Found Lands of Womanhood Thus the reader today is like an astronomer alerted by the findings of other astronomers to search in the old areas of the heavens for new heavenly bodies that their equations say must be there. The reader searches and sure enough finds them: new found lands that incorporate th'e special relationships of mother and child, daughter and mother, the experiences of childbirth and abortion, and those erotic and sensual responses to life that are woman's own. It is a little startling, as well as prophetic, to encounter Louise Glück's “For My Mother” with its outspoken hostility: It was better when we were together in one body. Thirty years. Screened through the green glass of your eye, moonlight filtered into my bones as we lay in the bug bed, in the dark, waiting for my father. Thirty years. He closed your eyelids with two hisses. And then spring came and withdrew from me the absolute knowledge of the unborn . . . Or to encounter in a kind of esthetic reversal the comments of a mother on the sullenness of her daughter in Helen Chasin's “Mona Lisa, Aged 12”: Her skin's not good, pale and enraged at the same time. Her whole sullen body's still baby fat, no neck to move swanlike . . . The same poet's “After the Bad Ending,” records that ominous and Janus‐faced silence at the end of a quarrel when enmity or reconciliation can prevail. She concludes with her frustrating cry: “Still, she's his/and he's her one real joy, pure, pure pain.” Margaret Atwood in one of her poems starts with an almost Donnelike assertion of independence: Love is not a profession genteel or otherwise sex is not dentistry the slick filing of aches and cavities you are not my doctor ‐you are not my curs nobody has that power, you are merely a fellow/traveler . . . Similarly Miss Glück, besides “For My Mother” speaks from her own coign of vantage as a woman. “Gretel in Darkness” uses the old fairy tale to say something intriguing about sibling attachments, family security and the making of spinsterhood. And in one of the finest poems in the book. “Apple Trees,” she plays on the theme of father, son and that symbol of the first betrayal, the apple, to fashion a work that is shadowy but exact, mythic and immediate at the same time. One of her more provoking works, “The School Children,” summons up the sacrifices of the mothers for the education of the young. It is a gray, joyless work and will inevitably, and perhaps unfairly, call to mind two other poems not written by women: Spender's “An Elementary School Classroom in a Slum” with its hope of buoyant rebirth and Yeats's great poem “Among Schoolchildren”—a poem that sees the finished work of art in the rude, unpolished stone. That Miss Glück's poem should appear so narrow‐spirited in contrast to the spacious utterances of the two men is a fact of beguiling interest. Sometimes, however, a woman's special vantage does not yield special insight. Helen Chasm's brief “Abortion” has the clinical objectivity of a hospital chart. It brings no more illumination to the experience than if the event had been an appendicitis operation. Yet it might be that this is how the poet wishes to recall the experience thus making her verses eloquent in their reticence. Making the Larger Statement To single out in the work of these women the more noticeable examples of their consciousness is patently unfair, since they may well argue that it informs all their work and is not the only strand in it It's an argument easy to support. Margaret Atwood's “Songs of the Transformed,” for example, a splendid series of animal poems in “You Are Happy,” will remind the reader of Roethke's greenhouse poems in her ability to capture the natural world and yet to manage to make larger statement. Miss Glück's “Flowering Plum,” “To Autumn,” “Departure,” among other poems, transmute individual impressions into hard compact statements. And the work of Miss Ohasin, whose work is more febrile than that of the other two, is dotted with striking images that catch the reader's attention even before the poem is finished. I liked especially her phrase in “Tattooed Woman”: “multicolors under my skinfas if I clot in pictures.”; and the lines “A sentence sticks in his skin like a fishhook” from “Marriage” and “We're doing the I Ching‐like telephone calls” from “We're Doing the I Ching.” These three books, contemporary in mood, concerns, and stylistic devices, can be studied from either end of the telescope. Each view shores up the other. The result oddly enough is not a divided landscape, but a surprisingly harmonious one."
MEDICAID LIMITS PUT ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/02/archives/medicaid-limits-put-on-abortions-appellate-court-overturns-ruling.html,"An appeals court has decided that a Federal law does not require Connecticut to make Medicaid payments for abortions unless they are medically necessary. The decision, filed here late Thursday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, overturned a lower court's ruling on a Connecticut welfare department regulation that bars Medicaid payments for elective abortions. This regulation had been declared invalid by Judge Jon O. Newman in Federal District Court in Connecticut on the ground that it was contrary to the 1965 Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. Judge Newman ruled that these provisions of the Federal law permitted payments for elective abortions, as well as for therapeutic abortions, and that they prohibited state regulations that “impair a woman's exercise of her right, in consultation with her physician, to have an abortion.” In reversing Judge Newman's ruling, the Court of Appeals decided that the Federal law on Medicaid neither required nor prohibited payments for elective abortions, leaving this up to individual states. Scope of 26 Page Decision Judge Frederick vanPelt Bryan, who wrote the decision with the concurrence of Judge Wilfred Feinberg, stressed that the court had not considered the question of whether the Connecticut regulation was constitutional. The constitutional question should he determined by a three‐judge Federal Court that would he convened for that purpose, Judge Bryan said. His 26‐page decision was limited to whether the Connecticut regulation violated the Federal law on Medicad, a federally financed program that states administer for aid to medically indigent persons, regardless of their age. The judge said Connecticut had argued in the appeals court that it had adopted the disputed regulation because it believed that the law prohibited Federal reimbursement to states for the cost of an abortion unless the abortion was necessary for the woman's physical or psychiatric health. However, now that the appeals court has ruled there is no such requirement, Judge Bryan suggested that Connecticut might drop the regulation and end the need to consider its constitutionality. A spokesman for Connecticut's welfare department, now called the Department of Social Services, said yesterday that state officials had no comment on the court's decision because they had not yet seen it. Judge William Hughes Mulligan of the appeals court wrote a separate opinion agreeing that the Federal law did not require Medicaid payments, for elective abortions but contending that it went further and prohibited such payments. His six‐page opinion, stressing that Congress had authorized Medicaid payments only for “necessary medical services,” said the court's decision could make taxpayers' money available for such “cosmetic surgery” as face lifting."
Disclosure Law Curb Accepted,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/03/archives/disclosure-law-curb-accepted.html,"TRENTON — Democratic legislative leaders disclosed his week that they had no plans to replace a highly controversial section of the New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Act that was struck down as unconstitutional last month in State Superior Court. The court's decision, written by Judge Irwin J. Kimmelman, nullified a section of the act that required all kinds of organizations to file public disclosure and lengthy financial reports with the state on all funds spent to influence legislation here. However, the disclosure law and reporting requirements for lobbyists who work directly with the Legislature here was not affected by the decision. While the legal attack against the section was largely financed by some of the largest and most influential financial, business and industrial organizations in the state, the court's decision was handed down in the name of those small, ad hoc, grassroot groups that form year in and year out to support and oppose legislation here. In effect, the court said that while the state Chamber of Commerce and groups like it were well equipped to take care of themselves, smaller groups could not, and that the section violated their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and political assembly. According to Robert N. Wilentz, who argued the case for the plaintiffs, the section had a “chilling effect” on groups and Individuals who sought to exercise their constitutional right to oppose or support legislation here. A Last‐Minute Insertion While Mr. Wilentz and many political liberals in the state support tough disclosure laws in campaigns and for lobbyists, they contended that the section struck down by the court was far too broad and went too far. Initially, the section was inserted at the last moment in 1973, and the legislation was aimed at disclosing election‐campaign finances. Its insertion, actually, was an effort to sabotage the bill However, the effort boomeranged, and the section was approved by the Legislature along with the parent bill and signed into law by the then Republican Governor, William T. Cahill. In January, 1974, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, the state agency created to oversee the new disclosure and campaign financial reporting law, ruled that its reporting requirements would apply to any group that sought to influence legislation here—from the Roman Catholic Church to the American Civil Liberties Union. Requirements also apply to any organization—no matter if its membership comprised only two or three persons—that decided to do anything for or against a pending measure. Initially, the A.C.L.U. filed a suit in Federal District Court against the section, contending that if it was forced to reveal the identity of its financial supporters, as required by the section, it would cause it irreparable harm and thus tend to destroy its effectiveness. The state court's decision apparently makes the Federal suit moot. Issue Defined Judge Kimmelman helped formulate the original election law as an Assemblyman in the nineteen‐sixties. In his lengthy decision, handed down in Essex County, he said: “The issue for decision in this case involves a balancing of completing interests between the First Amendment rights of citizens to freely ban together, in corporate form or otherwise, and express their political views concerning candidates, public questions and the content, introduction, passage or defeat of legislation with the countervailing legislative objectives behind the New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act. The point is whether the legislative mechanics designed to obtain these goals will tend to deter, stifle, chill, or otherwise obstruct and impair such guaranteed rights to a degree which is constitutionally impermissible.” Judge Kimmelman noted that a number of experienced state legislators had testified as to the effectiveness of the controversial section. “Their concern,” the judge said, “was not at all with well‐organized and adequately financed public information organizations and political committees such as the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce, for whom the act might not have a substantial deterrent effect. “Rather they were concerned with the so‐called single‐issue groups or ad hoc committees which spontaneously spring up to voice their special interest on specific bills before the Legislature. “These less ‐ organized groups, often just husband and wife or neighborhood teams, constitute a very typical vehicle for political expression throughout the country and New Jersey. “In fact informal political cooperation is a most distinctive characteristic of the American public. Group action is the heart of the political process. In contrast to the well‐organized lobbyisttype group, these less‐organized political groups probably never heard of the New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, and could not understand that their activities, because they worked in groups of two or more, were covered.” For example, the judge said, “well‐meaning groups who charter a bus and descend upon the state capital to campaign for or against abortion laws, or for a state income tax, or for aid to parochial schools, or the state employes who assemble in a group carrying placards for higher wages or the motorcycle group seeking permission to travel on the Garden State Parkway, all of whom incur expenditures in varying amounts to voice their opinions on these subjects, are unknowing violators of the act.” At the same time, Judge Kimmelman expressed concern about the secrecy that has mocked political funds. “No one doubts,” he said, “that money is a prime lubricant of the machinery of politics, or too many years, the financial aspects of politics has been shrouded either in a veil of secrecy or a fog of confusion. The average voter is aware of the tremendous cost involved in running even a modest campaign for elective office. However, he cannot help but wonder where the money comes from and more importantly why it comes.” In constructing his legal case against the voided section, Mr. Wilentz, a former Democratic Assemblyman from Middlesex County and a highly regarded liberal in the state, enlisted the support of a number of campaign ‐ disclosure advocates, such as Assemblyman Albert Burstein, a Bergen County Democrat, and former State Senator William Schluter, a Mercer County Republican."
Peers Win a Point; Justice Comes Out Ahead of Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/06/archives/peers-win-a-point-justice-comes-out-ahead-of-politics-british-peers.html,"LONDON, Aug, 5 — The House of Lords won one last night. It was not a great victory, just enough to remind the House of Commons that the 1,074 lords and ladies of the realm can on occasion rise above constitutional disability, pageantry and eccentricity to teach a moral lesson. Technically, the victory lay in a Commons decision at midnight to accept a Lords amendment to a Government housing bill. The effect of the amendment is to continue penalties on local officials who had willfully defied a law three years ago raising the rents in public housing. Many here, however, saw the issue in broader terms: Could a handful of people escape punishment for ignoring the laws of Parliament without threatening the whole structure of parliamentary government? The Lords said no, and in the end even some Labor members of the Commons—who had been under tremendous pressure to rescind the penalties—grudgingly agreed. “We can't try to push the Commons around very often,” said one earl, referring to the tact that the Lords has virtually no real power.” “But when we do, it's most satisfying.” To appreciate the victory requires a brief recapitulation. In 1972, the Conservatives passed a housing act that raised rents on lowincome housing. Most officials went along, but the Labor majority of the local council in the former mining town of Clay Cross, Derbyshire, did not. Inspired partly by their hatred of the Tory Government, partly by the tacit encouragement of influential figures in the Labor party, the Clay Cross council members refused to raise rents. Their disobedience won the support of many of the 10,000 inhabitants of the town, where the average basic wage was $30 a week and where nearly half the residents lived in low‐income housing. Inevitably, the courts invoked remedies provided for by the act, fined the council members and disqualified them from public office. The episode became a national issue, and the Labor party vowed that it would rescind the penalties when it returned to office. When Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned to power, legislation indemnifying the council was quickly enacted as part of a new housing bill. The bill was then sent to the upper house for routine approval. The august chamber of the second house, with its maroon leather benches, its atmosphere of stately and even sleepy contentment, its bewigged attendants, seemed an unlikely setting for revolt. True enough, debate in the chamber is often spirited. “I thank the noble lord for his profoundly disappointing statement,” is a quite typical sally among members—and, quite often, the more energetic among them have pioneered in liberalizing legislation on homosexuality, abortion and other controversial issues. But in practice the House of Lords is subservient. Under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the Lords have no power over bills dealing with taxation or expenditure. They can amend other public bills, but if the Commons rejects these amendments, the most the Lords can do is delay the legislation by a year. And even the delaying power must be exercised with caution; too much of it could lead to a constitutional clash and, perhaps, further loss of influence. But occasionally the Lords will risk these perils for the sake of making a point. As a Labor peer, Lady Burton of Coventry, put the matter during debate several weeks ago: “It Is impossible for me to support [this] clause. It is a question of conscience and the clause is morally wrong. It is not enough just to abstain. I am dismayed that Parliament should be asked to condone the breaking of the law. The question is how far one goes in choosing loyalty to party over everything else.” The House of Lords rejected the clause by a vote of 148 to 41—a rather substantial turnout, considering that many of its members rarely totter in from the countryside. Privately, some Government ministers — including Anthony Crosland, whose Department of Environment handles housing matters—applauded the action. But leftof‐center members of Labor's steering group in Parliament voted to keep the clause, forcing Mr. Crosland into the uncomfortable position of urging a straight party vote of approval for something he didn't much like. But after hours of debate last night, the House of Commons voted 268 to 261 to eliminate the clause and maintain the council members' disqualification from public life. There was much merriment on the Tory benches, and the unfortunate Mr. Crosland was pelted with cries of “resign, resign!” But what save the Lords a sense of gratification was not the Government's momentary embarrassment but their sense that—in the words of one of them —justice had “come out well against politics.”"
British Abortion Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/06/archives/british-abortion-dispute.html,"LONDON, Aug. 5 (Reuters)—A committee of Parliament today urged restrictions on abortion clinics here, which attract nearly 60,000 foreign women a year to Britain. The move was a reaction against Britain's 1967 laws legalizing abortion on medical and social grounds."

It was not a great victory, just enough to remind the House of Commons that the 1,074 lords and ladies of the realm can on occasion rise above constitutional disability, pageantry and eccentricity to teach a moral lesson. Technically, the victory lay in a Commons decision at midnight to accept a Lords amendment to a Government housing bill. The effect of the amendment is to continue penalties on local officials who had willfully defied a law three years ago raising the rents in public housing. Many here, however, saw the issue in broader terms: Could a handful of people escape punishment for ignoring the laws of Parliament without threatening the whole structure of parliamentary government? The Lords said no, and in the end even some Labor members of the Commons—who had been under tremendous pressure to rescind the penalties—grudgingly agreed. “We can't try to push the Commons around very often,” said one earl, referring to the fact that the Lords has virtually no real power.” “But when we do, it's most satisfying.” To appreciate the victory requires a brief recapitulation. In 1972, the Conservatives passed a housing act that raised rents on lowincome housing. Most officials went along, but the Labor majority of the local council in the former mining town of Clay Cross, Derbyshire, did not. Inspired partly by their hatred of the Tory Government, partly by the tacit encouragement of influential figures in the Labor party, the Clay Cross council members refused to raise rents. Their disobedience won the support of many of the 10,000 inhabitants of the town, where the average basic wage was $30 a week and where nearly half the residents lived in low‐income housing. Inevitably, the courts invoked remedies provided for by the act, fined the council members and disqualified them from public office. The episode became a national issue, and the Labor party vowed that it would rescind the penalties when it returned to office. When Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned to power, legislation indemnifying the council was quickly enacted as part of a new housing bill. The bill was then sent to the upper house for routine approval. The august chamber of the second house, with its maroon leather benches, its atmosphere of stately and even sleepy contentment, its bewigged attendants, seemed an unlikely setting for revolt. True enough, debate in the chamber is often spirited. “I thank the noble lord for his profoundly disappointing statement,” is a quite typical sally among members—and, quite often, the more energetic among them have pioneered in liberalizing legislation on homosexuality, abortion and other controversial issues. But in practice the House of Lords is subservient. Under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the Lords have no power over bills dealing with taxation or expenditure. They can amend other public bills, but if the Commons rejects these amendments, the most the Lords can do is delay the legislation by a year. And even the delaying power must be exercised with caution; too much of it could lead to a constitutional clash and, perhaps, further loss of influence. But occasionally the Lords will risk these perils for the sake of making a point. As Labor peer, Lady Burton of Coventry, put the matter during debate several weeks ago: “It is impossible for me to support [this] clause. It is a question of conscience and the clause is morally wrong. It is not enough just to abstain. I am dismayed that Parliament should be asked to condone the breaking of the law. The question is how far one goes in choosing loyalty to party over everything else.” The House of Lords rejected the clause by a vote of 148 to 41—a rather substantial turnout, considering that many of its members rarely totter in from the countryside. Privately, some Government ministers — including Anthony Crosland, whose Department of Environment handles housing matters—applauded the action. But leftof‐center members of Labor's steering group in Parliament voted to keep the clause, forcing Mr. Crosland into the uncomfortable position of urging a straight party vote of approval for something he didn't much like. But after hours of debate last night, the House of Commons voted 268 to 261 to eliminate the clause and maintain the council members' disqualification from public life. There was much merriment on the Tory benches, and the unfortunate Mr. Crosland was pelted with cries of “resign, resign!” But what save the Lords a sense of gratification was not the Government's momentary embarrassment but their sense that—in the words of one of them —justice had “come out well against politics.”"
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/08/archives/metropolitan-briefs-inquiry-opened-on-air-crash-robbery-decision-on.html,"The police said they had begun an investigation into the charge that $15,000 belonging to a victim of the June 24 plane crash at Kennedy International Airport had not been returned to the victim's family. Joseph Dispenza, a 40‐year‐old restaurant owner from Baton Rouge, said only $7,680 of the $22,000 his wife, Connie, was carrying in her purse at the time of the crash was returned to him by the police. Mrs. Dispenza was killed in the crash. Decision on Albano Foe Upheld State Supreme Court Justice Nathaniel T. Heiman upheld a ruling by the city's Board of Elections that Bernard A. Rittersporn was not properly registered as a voter or enrolled in the Republican party. The decision meant that Mr. Rittersporn could not oppose Vincent F. Albano, the Manhattan Republican leader in the Sept. 9 primary for leadership of the midtown East Side district. Mr. Rittersporn said he would appeal. 3d Gunman Ruled Out in Robbery Discarding the theory of a third gunman, the police said the $20,000 payroll missing after Wednesday's frustrated robbery of the Pandick Press at 345 Hudson Street had been dropped in the elevator by the two suspects and later stolen by unidentified persons. Four victims injured during the shootout with the police were reported in stable condition. Friedgood Fails to Get Reduced Bail A request by Dr. Charles E. Friedgood, who has been charged with murdering his wife, to have his $1‐million bail reduced to $100,000 was denied by State Supreme Court Justice Beatrice S. Burstein. She said the bail was “reasonable and appropriate” since the surgeon had twice violated probation by leaving the country. Abortion Clinic Pays Woman $30,000 A Florida woman has obtained a $30,000 settlement in Federal District Court here because she remained pregnant after undergoing an abortion procedure in 1972 at a Westchester Clinic. The settlement resulted from a malpractice suit against the clinic, the Pelham Medical Group, which performed the unsuccessful abortion, and has since gone out of business. Higher Taxes on Vacant Lots Urged Councilmen at Large Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Henry J. Stern, both of Manhattan, urged that the city stop underassessing its 60,000 vacant lots and raise assessments to true value to increase revenues by $18‐million a year. They said this would provide an incentive for private owners to develop vacant land.

Co‐op City Contempt Hearing Put Off A contempt‐of‐court hearing sought by the state, which could result in jail sentences for the 22 tenant leaders of a rent strike at Co‐op City in the Bronx, was postponed until Aug. 18 by State Supreme Court Justice Alfred J. Callahan. The state said the tenant leaders disobeyed a June 20 court order enjoining them from withholding maintenance charges of 80 per cent of the 15,372 families. The co‐op owners are protesting a 25 per cent increase in maintenance charges."

Robins Company announced today that it was abandoning plans to put the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine contraceptive device, back on the market. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical manufacturer said the company “remains firm in its belief that the Dalkon shield, when properly used, is a safe and effective I.U.D.” The Dalkon shield was taken off the market a year ago by Robins after the company notified doctors that reports had associated it with septic, spontaneous abortions."
Church‐State Legal Conflicts Persist,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/10/archives/churchstate-legal-conflicts-persist-churchstate-legal-conflicts.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 7—When the Billy Graham crusade decided, to visit Jackson, Miss., this year, the Jackson City Council decided to help out. It appropriated $1,000 for the crusade, and paid the money out of the city's general fund. The adjutant general of the Mississippi National Guard, Maj. Gen. E. A. Baby Turnage, helped out too: He wrote a letter on his official stationery to all the guard troops, informing thern of the event. He invited them to attend, and, as he put it, join “in a spiritual crusade for our Saviour.” Religion and government were intertwined in Jackson, as they have been, and continue to be, in countless places across the country. The line separating church and state—a separation mandated by the First Amendment—Lis fuzzy in some parts of the nation, crooked in others, and, in not a few places, broken altogether. Sometimes the church‐state mixes are, clear violations of the law, direct and even knowing affronts to Supreme Court rulings. Other times they are of debatable legality, falling within the gray area of the law. Often they are challenged in the courts. But more often, apparently, they are not challenged, most commonly because the potential challengers are either fearful of the social effects their action might have or simply nonexistent. In Jackson, the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi began organizing a lawsuit to challenge the $1,000 appropriation. The Billy Graham Crusade heard of the suit, and returned the money. No one challenged the general's “invitation,'” however, an invitation that the general defends but that Leo Pfeffer, special counsel to the American Jewish Congress and an expert on church‐state law, calls “absolittely unconstitutional.” A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last May in a case called Meek v. Pittenger, has raised the issue of churchstale relations anew, on a national scale. The Court struck down Pennsylvania's system of providing “auxiliary services” at parochial schools, labeling it a violation of the First Amendment's prohibition of “establishment” of religion by government. To lawyers on both sides of the issue, the decision raises serious doubts about the constitutionality a similar—though not identical—“auxiliary services” programs funded by the Federal Government—programs in which about $100‐million worth of services ranging from nutrition to counseling are provided to parochial, school students each year, according to an estimate by the Office of Education. The current stance of the office is that it will continue to provide this funding until a court rules it unconstitutional, but that it is also studying the ruling to see if it should modify Some of its departmental regulations. A few states have similar “auxiliary services” funding too, such as Connecticut; the Court ruling has thus thrown these programs in doubt as well. Parochial aid—or “parochiaid,” as people who work in the area call it—is one of the largest and most troublesome areas of church‐state relations. The Supreme Court also agreed last term to consider, in the coming year, a Maryland case that challenges state aid to colleges with religious affiliations. A Complex Question Yet as the Jackson episode suggests, the problem of maintaining the proper separation of church and state covers a broad and complex range of situations aside from parochial aid. In New Hampshire, for instance, there is a new state law permitting school districts to decide whether to allow programs for the voluntary recitation of the Lord's Prayer in the public schools. The Supreme Court struck down, in 1962, a supposedly nondenomination prayer drafted by New York's Board of Regents; in 1963, it ruled unconstitutional a program in which passages from the Bible and the Lord's Prayer were read in Public schools, a program also purportedly “voluntary” hi that children could be excused. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has also ruled a state prayer bill unconstitutional. But one New Hampshire state Senator said last May, as the new state prayer law was being adopted: “I could care less that the [New Hampshire] Supreme Court thinks this is unconstitutional.” In North Carolina, the State Department of Transportation distributes free of charge the official state highway map; the map carries an 82‐word message labeled “A Motorist's Prayer” that begins: “Our Heavenly Father, we ask this, day a particular blessing es] we take the wheel of our car.” Map With Prayer Challenged The North Carolina affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the state's distribution of the prayer‐embellished map as a violation of the First Amendment. The state is contending that if the prayer does have any effect toward “establishing” religion, it is only “minor,” and that the suit is “frivolous.” Says Robert W. Kayton, Associate Attorney General of North Carolina: “It's the type of thing that's so deeply ingrained—like ‘In God We Trust’ on a coin or a building.” In Eugene, Ore., a 51‐foot high cross made of concrete stands atop a butte overlooking downtown, on a patch of land owned by the city. It is decked with neon lights, and at Christmas and Easter they are lit. The cross has been the subject of litigation since 1965, a year after the cross was erected, and along the way, there have been a few rulings to the effect that the creation and maintenance of the cross on city land were unconstitutional and that it must come down. But the litigation is continuing —an appeal of the latest ruling Is under way — and for now, the cross is standing. Other church‐state incidents around the country still involve religion in the schools. One such problem is the high school assembly program featuring a visiting evangelical group. According to Charles Wittenstein, Southern counsel for the Anti‐Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, evangelical assemblies are the major churchstate problem in the South. What happens, Mr. Wittenstein says, is that schools have empty schedules for their assemblies and that an evangelical group offers a program involving music, say, or other entertainment. The school or one teacher accepts the group, happy to fill up an assembly program. But at the end of the entertaininent comes a religious pitch. More Direct Violations Officials of such groups as the A.D.L., the A.C.L.U. and its affiliates and the American Jewish Congress also report getting complaints of an even more direct church‐state violation—prayers and Bible reading in the public schools, in direct contradiction to the Supreme Court's prayer decision. Such incidents are most often at the behest of individual teachers, and the activist groups believe the practice is widespread—not in the urban areas, they say, and not nearly as frequently as 10 years ago, but still substantial in rural and relatively homogeneous areas. Court dockets attest to still other church‐state battles—Mr. Pfeffer says there are at least 50 cases currently in litigation, including one involving a judge who made attending church a condition of probation. There has been a churchstate undertone to the abortion controversy all along. Church‐state questions are also raised by Central Intelligence Agency funding of certain groups, including religious groups, in South America. A number of factors contribute to this tangle of churchstate conflicts and violations and lawsuits. They include the complexity of the law; practical factors such as the rising cost of education, which increases the demands for parochial aid; politics; the desire of many parents for religious programs for their children; insensitivity; the reluctance of people to sue; and the fact that, as Mr. Pfeffer puts it, “Supreme Court decisions are not self‐enforcing.” The Supreme Court has reasoned that the Government must thus be “neutral” to religion: it may not help it by financing the building of a church, say, but neither may it obstruct it—by removing police and fire protection for the church site, for instance. Yet between those extremes there is room for interpretation. The Court has ruled, for instance, that the state may have a program of “lending” textbooks of a nonreligious nature to parochial school students; it has, however, banned other types of aid, such as the auxiliary services involved in last May's landmark ruling. Logically, it could be argued that the loan of books helps the parochial school in the same way, but to a different degree than the other aid, by making the parochial school education less expensive. Yet obviously the degree of churchstate cooperation is much different. At the moment, the court has a three‐part test. As described in the Meek case, it is: “First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose. Second, it must have a ‘primary’ effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute and its administration must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.” The third test has an added factor—political controversy. There must not be “entanglement in the broader sense of continuing political strife.” There is, of course, the possibility that the people involved in the practice simply do not understand that others of an entirely different religious belief, or no belief at all, would find the practice in question offensive. Mr. Wittenstein, who lives in Atlanta, says that he has heard people reply to complaints about religious programs in the schools by saying—in tones of surprise — “But it's nondenominational Christianity.” He contends that “a lot of people perceive nondenominational Christianity as the unofficial religion of the nation.” General Turnage, of Jackson, Miss., reflected this feeling. Asked his religion, he replied, “Baptist and I couldn“t tell you what Billy Graham is to save my life.” He paused for a moment, then noted that the Billy Graham crusade was in factadvertised as “nondenominational.” But wasn“t that nondenominational Christian, he was asked. Of course, he agreed."
Betty Ford Would Accept ‘An Affair’ by Daughter,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/11/archives/betty-ford-would-accept-art-affair-by-daughter.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 (UPI) —Betty Ford said today that she wouldn't be surprised if her daughter, Susan, 18 years old, decided to have an affair. Mrs. Ford suggested that in general, premarital relations with the right partner might lower the divorce rate. President Ford's wife also said she assumed that all of her children had tried mari?? out of curiosity, and added that she might have tried it herself had the drug been widely used when she was young. “What if Susan Ford came to you and said. ‘Mother, I'm having an affair’?” Morley Safer, an interviewer, asked on CBS‐TV's “60 Minutes” show broadcast tonight. “Well, I wouldn't be surprised.” Mrs. Ford responded. “I think she's a perfectly normal human being like all young girls, if she wanted to continue and I would certainly counsel her and advise her on the subject, and I'd want to know pretty much about the young man that she was planning to have the affair with—whether it was a worthwhile encounter or whether it was going to be one of those... “She's pretty young to start affairs.” “But,” Mr. Safer asked, “nevertheless old enough?” “Oh, yes, she's a big girl,” Mrs. Ford said. President Unperturbed Commenting further on premarital affairs, she said there seemed to be “a complete freedom among the young people now. “And in some cases, I'm not so sure that, perhaps, there would be less divorce.” Later, aboard Air Force One on the way to Vail, Colo. the White House press secretary, Ron Nessen, was asked for Mr. Ford's reaction to the interview. “The President has long since ceased to be perturbed or surprised by his wife's remarks,” Mr. Nessen replied. Mrs. Ford in the interview. was asked about the pressures on a woman living in Washington. “The pressures are many,” she said. “And it depends on the family, the type of husband you have, whether he's a wanderer or whether he's a homebody.” ‘Perfect Faith’ in Husband Mr. Safer asked whether she had any doubts about her husband “and some of the attractions in this city.” “I have perfect faith in my husband,” she said. “But I'm always glad to see him enjoy a pretty girl. And when he stops looking, then I'm going to begin to worry. But right now, he still enjoys a pretty girl. And he really doesn't have time for outside entertainment. “Because I keep him busy.” Mrs. Ford said that she was confident her daughter and three sons were not very interested in drugs, because of their upbringing. However, she said, “I'm sure they've all probably tried marijuana.” Asked whether she might have tried it herself had it been widely used when she was young, Mrs. Ford said she “probably” would have, out of curiosity. She compared such experimentation with having “your first beer or your first cigaret.” Mrs. Ford also said that the Supreme Court's decision to legalize abortion was “the best thing in the world . . .a great, great decision.” Asked whether she sometimes found some women's liberation advocates “a little bit hard to take,” Mrs. Ford said she did, and added: “I'm not the type that's going to burn my bra or do something like that.” Mrs. Ford, who suffered fatigue on the recent Presidential trip to Europe, said she now felt “absolutely marvelous” and had been advised that there was no sign of any recurrence of the breast cancer that was removed last year."
"Susan Ford Likes Mother's Interview, But Others Criticize View on ‘Affair’",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/12/archives/susan-ford-likes-mothers-interview-but-others-criticize-view-on.html,"Betty Ford got mixed reviews inside and outside her family yesterday for her television interview in which she said she would not be unduly surprised if her 18‐year‐old unmarried daughter Susan disclosed that she was having an affair. The daughter, the Fords youngest child and only daughter, said she thought her mother had done a good job. But she said she did not have any affair to tell about. “Not yet,” she said. “I'll leave it at that.” Michael Ford, a theology student, reportedly told his mother that he was not sure he agreed with her views. The President's position, according to a spokesman, was that he has always told his wife to “speak her mind.” There was scattered criticism from some public figures. Mary Whitehouse, a British campaigner against pornography, said in London that she was appalled. She accused Mrs. Ford of encouraging sexual promiscuity and described the comments as irresponsible. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints (Mormon) held a news conference in Manila and discussed Mrs. Ford's statements, made in a CBS interview broadcast Sunday night. “We feel very strongly about this,” he said. “We deplore the deterioration of morality around the world. Chastity is to be observed before marriage and fidelity after marriage.” A spokesman for the Most Rev. Edwin Broderick, Bishop of Albany, said the Roman Catholic clergyman was “really shocked” at Mrs. Ford's state ment. “He feels very strongly that this type of philosophy should not be espoused by someone who has such a prestigious position in the country,” the spokesman said. Harriet Van Horne, the writer, in a column titled, “Candor Overdone,” said that if she had been a member of Mrs. Ford's family, “I'd have been saddened by the unseemliness of it all, a First Lady forfeiting a certain privacy, some mystique that keeps the vital luster on the First Lady image.” Mrs. Ford made her comments in answer to questions from Morley Safer, the CBS “60 Minutes” interviewer, about what she would do if her daughter Susan came to her and said, “Mother, I'm having an affair.” Would Advise Her “Well, I wouldn't be surprised,” said Mrs. Ford. “If she wanted to continue, and I would certainly counsel and advise her on the subject and I'd want to know pretty much about the young man whether it was a worthwhile encounter.” She said Susan was “pretty young to start affairs,” but added, “She's a big girl.” She also said she thought that premarital sex in some cases might lessen the divorce rate. A CBS spokesman said that the network had not received any reaction from viewers—neg ative or positive. Miss Ford, in Kansas, where she is a photography intern at The Topeka Capital‐Journal, said of the interview; “I think she did a good job. She talked about things people should tally about, like abortion. It should be brought out of the woods.” “Very Protective’ “I think my Dad agrees with that. He's very protective of, /lie, but he's willing to listen and if I feel strongly enough about it, he agrees.” She said her mother was apprehensive about her watching the interview. “Mother was really funny about it when I called her before they showed it,” she said. “She told me, ‘I may come across as a liberated woman or something.’ I told her, ‘Mother, I don't care. I care what your views are, and so do others.’ Miss Ford watched the interview on a television set at the governor's mansion in Topeka. Michael Ford, 25 years old, the oldest of the Fords’ three sons and the, only one who is married, was quoted by Mrs. Ford's press secretary as telling his mother he was not sure he agreed with her views on premarital sex. “I guess I'm more old‐fashioned,” he reportedly said."
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/13/archives/notes-on-people-careys-view-differs-on-teenage-affairs.html,"Gov. Hugh Carey, who has five daughters among his 12 children, indicated yesterday that he differed with Betty Ford, who said on a Sunday television program that she would not be surprised if her daughter, Susan, announced she was havirtg an affair. “I'm not an old‐fashioned parent—I'm not in the horseand‐buggy age,” Mr. Carey said when asked at a news conference to comment on Mrs. Ford's remarks. “I believe in the words of the song that Frankie Sinatra sings so well, ‘Love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.’” Stanley K. Hathaway, the ailing Secretary of the Interior who resigned July 15, is in Denver's Mount Airy Psychiatric Cerrter for treatment of “moderate” depression, after leaving the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., during the weekend. “It's just a continuation of treatment begun there except it's in a quieter setting —he is in fine condition,” said a spokesman for the center. Noting that Mr. Hathaway could have no visitors, he added, “If he were real fine, he wouldn't be here.” The former Wyoming Governor is still on an antidepressant drug that produces dizziness and headaches. Besides the 15 pounds he lost during his Senate confirmation hearings and sixweek tenure, he lost another five pounds at Bethesda as a result of a special diet for the diabetes that was discovered by Navy doctors. Mr. Hathaway remains on his $60,000 annual salary until a new Interior Secretary is nominated and sworn in. Wernher Von Braun's surgery last weekend was for removal of a cancerous tumor, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore disclosed yesterday. But they refused any discussion of where the tumor was located, including whether it was related to the 63‐year‐old scientist's recurring kidney ailment. A hospital spokesman said that Dr.‐Von Braun had now spent some time “up and walking.” Food assistance from the United States to developing countries has contributed to the world food shortage, Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Prize‐winning agronomist has told a Houston conference of agricultural scientists. Legislation providing such aid “was a good excuse for many developing countries not to invest in agriculture” despite the fact that some 30‐million tons of cereal grains must come from such countries, Dr. Borlaug said. The Bronze Wolf was awarded to Richard W. Darrow, of Sutton Place in Manhattan and Alden G. Barber, of Basking Ridge, N.J., yesterday at the world Boy Scout conference in Copenhagen. Mr. Barber, chief executive of the Boy Scouts of America, and Mr. Darrow, a member of the Scouts’ national board and chairman of the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton, were the only Americans among 12 Scout leaders who received the movement's highest award. Representative Sam Steiger of Arizona, a rancher and former horse‐breeder, says he killed two burros in self‐defense last weekend when “they suddenly took after me —they acted like they were going to run me down.” The 51‐year‐old Republican said that, armed with a 30‐caliber military carbine, he had entered a Chino Valley area where 14 burros had been rounded up, intending to check the brands on them, when they charged and he shot because “I was on foot and alone.” The local livestock inspector, Ross Perner, said he would file charges against the Congressman but he didn't say what they would be. The Devil, according to Ezra Taft Benson, former Secretary of Agriculture and a senior patriarch of the Mormon church, is “anxiously working to displace the father as the head of the home.” Speaking at a church conference in Manila, the 76year‐old president of the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints attributed children's rebellion and “the seeds of divorce” to working mothers and inattentive fathers. Mr. Benson, who was a member of the Eisenhower Cabinet, warned church “sisters” that abortion or sterilization jeopardizes their “future membership in the Kingdom of God.” “Any time you want beautiful world, with no flack from your friends, try it,” Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut suggested in Bridgeport yesterday, in enthusiastic reference to his three days last week in a Government‐research “hydrolab” on the ocean floor in the Bahamas."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/14/archives/books-of-the-times-lion-or-the-anthroposophist.html,"“There's the most extraordinary, unheard of poetry buried in America, but none of the conventional means known to culture can even begin to extract it … the agony is too deep, the disorder too big for art enterprises undertaken in the old way. HUMBOLDT'S GIFT. By Saul Bellow. 487 pages. Viking. $10. Now we must listen in secret to the sound of the truth that God puts into us.” This is Charlie Citrine, the protagonist of “Humboldt's Gift,” perorating over the grave of the poet Humboldt, who “failed” in his life and his art because he “performed all the stormy steps of that routine,” which Citrine has just described as obsolete. It is dismaying to hear from one of our most talented, intelligent and learned novelists that “the ideas of the last few centuries are used up.” Though the pronouncement is made by Citrine, we feel Mr. Bellow standing behind it, nodding agreement. Whoever wrote it, this grandiose piece of pessimism seems closer to a confession of purely personal dejection than an objective judgment, and its inadequacy reflects on both character and creator. In “Mr. Sammler's Planet,” Saul Bellow fashioned a strikingly successful art form out of these same used‐up ideas and stormy steps. I can't see that the world has declined so very significantly in the interval. Independent of the Senses Citrine reminds me of the author's “Hen derson the Rain King.” Henderson, too, was disillusioned in his romance with America and he went to Africa, back to man's beginnings, to try to learn to make rain, which, like art, is life‐giving, also. Henderson studied the lion, borrowed his grace and confidence, incorporatede them into his own personality until he once again became the king of beasts. Casting about for a resuscitating idea, Citrine can find nothing better than anthroposophy, which the New Columbia Encyclopedia defines as a philosophy which “attempts to explain the world in terms of man's spiritual nature, or thinking independent of the senses.” If “Humboldt's Gift” may be taken as fair sample of the benefits of anthroposophy, the author had better go back to those used‐up ideas and routines his protagonist so cavalierly dismissed. Mr. Bellow's lion could swallow his anthroposophist without so much as a belch. The Humboldt of the title, who is too plainly modeled after the late Delmore Schwartz not to be acknowledged, is the most solid inspiration, the “lion” of this book. But he is represented as a toothless one, caged by circumstance, tamed by the captivity of the human condition. In his last, unbalanced years, Mr. Schwartz was one of the most dazzling talkers of his—or any—generation. Since his poetry and his prose could not compare with his vocal flights, I assumed that Mr. Bellow was going to suggest that the talk came from different source, that in his “madness,” Humboldt, or Delmore, transcended both his art and his history and drew solely on his “spiritual nature.” But Mr. Bellow seems wantonly to have ignored this opportunity. Humboldt's “madness,” instead of issuing out of the conflict between his need and his “exhausted” art, is presented as nothing more than the abortion or afterbirth of his career. The book begs the question of why the poet could not harness his talent. It is not only Humboldt who makes Citrine, who is a playwright and historian, seem dull he is dull. When he is least dull, he is simply a spokesman for Mr. Bellow, almost a record of his free associations. Citrine's relations with other people are function of his dullness. Both his wife and his mistress, for example, are avant‐garde yentas, dominating mother types who persist in seeing the artist as an overgrown child. He responds to their incessant wisecracks at his expense as if they were aphrodisiacs. For him, sexual attraction seems to be inseparable from the threat of castration. He doesn't enjoy sex so much as survive it. While the random contents of Saul Bellow's mind make better reading than most novels, they do not make for a good novel in this case because they are not integrated into the action, such as it is. When the plot sags, as it all too often does, the author inserts a compensatory little essay on boredom, identity, beauty or sloth. “Universalizing was becoming a craze with me,” Citrine says and this is one of the book's weaknesses, too. In its relentless universalizing, “Humboldt's Gift” reminds me of an unpublished novel by a friend of mine in which the hero's psychological evolutions parallel the course of Western philosophy since the Greeks. Converting Risk Into Art When he is not parroting the author, Citrine is capable of saying things like “I couldn't have cared less,” or “I didn't have to wait long for the elevator.” While I have always pitied critics who call Saul Bellow an old‐fashioned novelist, I find him here in perverse collusion with them. He never settles on an expressive voice for Citrine, a style for the man or a man for the style. Citrine is rueful, yet he lacks Herzog's angst; He is thoughtful, God knows, but without Mr. Sammler's saving lyricism; he is daring now and again, but altogether lacking in Henderson's knack for converting risk into art. The “gift” of the title is an anticlimax. There are few things more damning than an inappropriate gift between close friends it implies either a fundamental misunderstanding of the recipient or a failure of imagination in the donor. I knew Delmore Schwartz and I feel that if Saul Bellow, who knew him far better, chooses to disinter his ghost, he ought to cover its bones with something more immortal than the feeble device that further disfigures the final section of the book. Delmore or Humboldt, was always seething with schemes for turning the tables on “them,” but his were poet's schemes, intrepid dreams. Delmore and Humboldt spent their lives searching for a philosopher's stone which would magically make their “madness” pay off in celebrity and hard cash. There is something both absurd and sublime about such a hope. It's a theme that is Calculated to bring out the best in Mr. Bellow, if he would only take up again the story steps of that old routine that once served him so well."
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/14/archives/notes-on-people-i-think-i-was-honest-mrs-ford-says-in-retrospect.html,"“I think I was honest,” said Betty Ford when asked yesterday if she had regrets about saying she “wouldn't be surprised” if her 18‐yearold daughter, Susan, told her she was having an affair. “I was asked a question,” Mrs. Ford said. “Perhaps I could have answered it with a little better judgement.” Asked how she was taking criticism of her views on premarital affairs, the Supreme Court decision on abortion and other matters, the First Lady said: “Fine. I think it's coming out very well, certainly as far as the family is concerned and our children. Our family was brought up on the fact that marriage is the greatest thing in the world.” But Mrs. Ford, in Vail, Colo., said some of the accounts of her remarks on the CBS “60 Minutes” interview last Sunday were “a little distorted.” Not all the reactions were critical. “You come across as the very best kind of liberated woman,” said a 122word telegram sent to Mrs. Ford yesterday. Thanking the President's wife for a “boost for millions of mothers and daughters,” the message said, “As the mother of a wonderful daughter of that age myself, I believe we can and must trust them to find their own new way.” It was signed “Warmly, Betty Friedan.” And 25‐year‐old Michael Ford, a theologocial student in Massachusetts, phoned to tell his mother, according to Sheila Weidenfeld, her press. secretary: “You'll get a lot of criticism. But I understand what you were trying to say and I am with you.” Roger Tubby, who served under three Democratic Presidents and was a press secretary to President Truman, was named by Governor Carey yesterday to a $35,759‐ayear job as deputy commissioner of operations and maintenance for the State Office of Parks and Recreation. Mr. Tubby, a 64‐year‐old resident of Saranac Lake, was Ambassador to the United Nations at Geneva during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations and an Assistant Secretary of State under President Kennedy. He is a former newspaper reporter, editor and publisher. Locked out of his house in Lenox, Mass., since July 15, William L. Shirer swore out a criminal complaint yesterday against his wife, Martha. The couple married three years ago and Mrs. Shirer, who is 60, has petitioned for separate support. The 73‐yearold former broadcast journalist, who wrote the World War II “Berlin Diary” and subsequently “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” told the court he hasn't been able to get his clothes, checkbooks or manuscripts since his wife changed the door locks. She was charged with larceny by means of a conversion, the technical term for such a lockout. Yesterday, Allan Chadburn, the Cape Codder who set sail across the Atlantic with 120 days’ food, had been gone 127 days. No sighting of his eight‐foot boat, The Dream, had been reported in 118 days. The Coast Guard's Atlantic Area Command here said that, while no official search is in progress, alerts have been sent to ships at sea as well as to rescue‐coordination centers in Western Europe and the Azores. The 29year‐old father of two young sons hoped to reach Portugal in 60 to 80 days. “If I'd really had any influence, the cities of the world would be in better condition,” said Lewis Mumford, whom Queen Elizabeth II has just made an honorary knight commander in the Order of the British Empire for the influence his writings have had on city‐planning in Britain. From his home at Amenia in Dutchess County. Mr. Mumford, a nonarchitect who has been architecture critic for The New Yorker since 1931, acknowledged yesterday the impact of his books — particularly “The Culture of Cities” (1938) and “The City in History” (1961) —on the planning of Britain's “new towns” since World War II. Besides a trip to Washington later this year to accept the honorary knighthood at the British Embassy, Mr. Mumford is looking forward to his 80th birthday Oct. 19. The milepost will bring the publication of two new books, “Findings and Keepings: Analects for an Autobiography” and “Architecture as the Home of Man,” a collection of his contributions to Architectural Record magazine. “I may have influence in a hundred years,” he said hopefully. “My calculations on the economy were wrong,” said Issac L. Levy, with what must have been unwonted conservatism. Listing debts of more than $98‐million, the 36‐year‐old Jacksonville lawyer had just filed the largest bankruptcy petition in Florida's history. He apparently made all the wrong moves in his speculative investments, Mr. Levy said, explaining: “These were the wrong times.” Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. received the Martin Luther King Jr. award of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at its 18th annual convention, held in Anniston, Ala. The New Jersey Democrat, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, received the award for leadership during the Watergate scandals and his efforts in the field of human rights. You might not be so tired of the whole subject of sharks this summer if you'd had 15,000 sets of their jaws collecting dust on the shelves of your marine novelties warehouse. Ralph Ferguson of Wilmington, near the Los Angeles harbor, said that “for years” he had been buying the jaws—and selling some of them, too, ‘in sizes frm six inches (50 cents wholesale) up to two feet. Now, thanks to a movie that shall be nameless here, all but 5,000 have been snapped up. LAURIE JOHNSTON"
The best double‐header all summer,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/17/archives/the-best-doubleheader-all-summer.html,"Eric Hoffer once wrote that the first thing he looked for when studying a certain period in history was what games they played. Much could be) learned, he advised, from the created leisure of civilization. Inadvertently (I am sure), the old dockwalloper has found disciples of his theory over the last decade—not least among the authors of several recent baseball‐as‐social‐history books. The Miracle at Coogan's Bluff By Thomas Kiernan. Illustrated. 284 pp. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co. $8.95. Nice Guys Finish Last By Leo Durocher with Ed Linn. Illustrated. 448 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $9.95. The granddaddy of these is Lawrence S. Ritter's unsurpassed “The Glory of Their Times.” Ritter, a professor of economics at N.Y.U., was moved to assemble the memories of players born before the turn of the century when Ty Cobb died in 1961, because he felt than an important piece of Americana was going to die out unrecorded. This book has fathered lively offspring: Roger Kahn's “The Boys of Summer” (the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1940's and early '50's) and Donald Honig's “When the Grass Was Real” (players from the 1920's to the '40's). Indeed. Honig, recognizing his debt, dedicated his book to Ritter. Of the two books under examination here, Thomas Kiernan's “The Miracle at. Coogan's Bluff” is a direct descendant of Ritter's in that Kiernan went back and interviewed the legendary 1951 New York Giants and some members of the opposing Dodger team. This nostalgic trek is welcome since the 1951 season, culminating with Bobby Thomson's home run in the third game of the playoff (the Dodgers and Giants ended the regular season tied), was baseball's most dramatic moment. Babe Ruth might or might not have called his fabled home run by pointing his bat toward the stands. Henry Aaron's 715th home run was inevitable, since he had a season to achieve it—he would make history by attrition. But Thomson's homer, coming after his team made up 13½ games August (not against a humpty Dodger team but the Dodgers of Cox, Reese, Robinson, Hodges, Campanella, Snider, Furillo, Roe, Newcombe, and Erskine) was so implausible it was beyond the pale of the most misty brained juvenile writer. According to Red Smith, writing in The New York Herald Tribune, it was even impossible to report the event. “The art of fiction is dead.” Smith wrote. “Reality has strangled invention. Only the utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible again.” Indeed. to a generation now past their midthirties, two disparate moments in life stand out: where you were when Bobby Thomson hit his home run, and where you were When Jack Kennedy shot. As for me, I was at the game with four other high school truants, sitting in left center field above the Dodger bullpen and unmercifully taunting Branca, a decisive factor (undocumented) in making ray Giants win. Still, I wonder if Bobby Thomson's winning home run was a stroke from above or a faux pas of bullpen coach Clyde Sukeforth who chose Branca, not Carl Erskine, to relieve Don Newcombe in the ninth inning. Unfortunately, my claim of being there has all the validity of saying you were in the Dublin G.P.O. in 1916, since my mother threw out my ticket stub in a fit of pique following one of my bummish escapades. Kiernan's book is a work of unabashed love and solid scholarship. He pins down the start of the summer “miracle” to August 12th, when the Giants played a double‐header with the Phils on “Wes Westrum Day.” Not to embarrass their catcher in front of his Poughkeepsie neighbors who were coming down for the game, they put out a little extra and won both ends. Thus, the beginning of the surge from 13% games back with 44 games to play. Kiernan documents the scope of the “miracle” with statistics I had long forgot or didn't know in the‐ first place. Sixteen straight wins, and from August 12th, 32 of 39, coming from behind 21 times! And amazingly, five‐and‐a‐half back of a great Dodger team with only 16 games left. Giant pitcher Jim Hearn claimed the real miracle was the dog weary pitching staff, who gave up a total of only four runs in the last four games “with our arms hanging off.” The book also Is filled with quirky observations. A taciturn Sal Maglie delivers a glorious non sequitur. Q: “Do you miss baseball?” A: “hope, not a bit. I miss pitchin,' though. I sure loved to pitch.” Whitey Lockman, who doubled in the ninth inning, offers an esoteric, madcap version of the essence of baseball as made up of “half‐inches and muscle memory.” To wit: if a pitcher throws the ball over the plate to “his” half‐inch area, he gets you out; but if he errs and throws to yours, you hit him. If the pitch is in no man's land (a quarterinch?), the mind is confused, but your muscles act from memories of similar past siutations, and it is possible to get a hit. There is also an odd exchange with shortstop and captain Alvin Dark: What did he think about Gii Hodges holding him on first base in the ninth when the Dodgers were three runs ahead, allowing Don Mueller's single to go through the unprotected right side of the infield? Dark places it all on the uppitiness of the Bums: “It's quite possible the Lord Celt they had lost sight of their place in the world. Their pride made them think they could get the double play and wrap up the game as fast as that. So maybe God wanted to teach them something about false pride.” Kiernan's book is a joy for all fans, a bible for Giant rooters; even Dodgers. fans will have the exquisite pleasure of reading their own obituary while they're still capable. Leo Durocher's (and Ed Linn's) “Nice Guys Finish Last” doesn't resemble Ritter's book—except in telling us about the social attitudes of the times during Durocher's career. Instead, it's the best sports spritz to be found this side of Muhammad Ali — the classic saga of a streetwise small guy (though Leo is listed at 5'10”, 160 pounds in the record book) on the make. Leo Ernest (“The Lip”) Durocher took on the world with the scrappy attitude of a David. His first two mentors in professional life were both little men, “Rabbit” Maranville and Yankee manager Miller Huggins (Durocher claims to have had as many fathers as Shirley Temple had in the movies); and on the social side he is consistent in lionizing Frank Sinatra. “The Lip” tells us that he realized early he had to use his brain and it seems to have worked fairly well, since with limited playing skills he lasted 17 years as a player. When he was with the Yankees, Babe Ruth dubbed him “the All‐American Out.” But looking at his .247 lifetime average and comparing it to the current Yankee shortstop Jim Mason's (.145 at this writing), Leo looks like Honus Wagner. And though Durocher, in the minds of most, is synonymous with the Dodgers, his greater glory came with the enemy Giants. As Dodger manager, he won one pennant (1941). When he crossed the river, he won in both 1951 and 1954, also winning his first and only World Series the latter year. Durocher's catechism, “Win any way you can as long as you can get away with it,” will probably offend the new sensibility; but the clubhouse back then didn't house sermons or soda water. “I come to play! I come to beat you! I come to kill you!” he would cry, adding today that he'd knock down his mother to win a game. And Leo is as wily as a Shavian devil in convincing the reader that morality equates with the mundane. But this is unfair. Durocher had a chivalric code, too, where a word or a handshake had more solidity than an ironclad contract conceived by super agent. And his tolerance of the “night riders” (boozers and womanizers) who played for him (as long as they did it well) bordered on sidewalk saintliness. He screws up the reader's timing with change‐ups of humility. A good manager is one who can get players to play to their potential. There are no alchemists in the dugout. The delight of the book is its exuberance, its sense of a life Iived at full tilt. In a time when most athletes sound like John Hancock agents, it's refreshing to meet one who is so full of himself and life. But “The Lip,” flashing a touch of the poet, puts it better when he says about Pepper Martin and Dizzy Dean: “The day wasn't long enough for them.” Durocher is a first‐class raconteur, whether the stories are about playing (the Gas House Gang segment is hilarious) or managing or fighting with umpires, the world or himself. And the stories and laughs seem endless, like a rally against the old St. Louis Browns. My favorite deals with umpire Bill Klem, who used to draw a line in the dirt with his spikes during a rhubarb and warn Leo he would be ejected if he crossed it. One day Durocher walked around the line and was ejected. He screamed he hadn't crossed the line but had gone around it, and Klem majestically intoned: “Sa‐a‐me difference. When I draw a line, it extends to infinity?” There is also Durocher's classic squelch of ump George Magerkurth, a giant of a man who, in Durocher's words, hovered over him “like a big mastiff over a puppy.” In a heated dispute, Magerkurth fiercely looked down at Durocher and said, “I'll reach down and bite your head off”; and Leo volleyed, “It you do, you'll have more brains in your stomach than you've got in your head.” The only knock on the book is that it goes on too long, with Durocher for the last 100 pages seeming like a man on his deathbed who is trying to settle every imaginable score. But this is a carp. The tout here is that these two books are the best double‐header you'll encounter all summer. The only shame is that they bow to that horrendous abortion of the grand old game — the day‐night double‐header. Crowell and Simon and Schuster insist on separate admissions. ■"
Parent and Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/17/archives/parent-and-child-the-business-in-business-in-babies.html,"Last April, when 2,000 Vietnamese orphans were brought into the United States, many Americans protested that there were plenty of American children waiting to be adopted—so why import more? Yet later that same month, Senator Walter F. Mondale's Subcommittee on Children and Youth heard two days of testimony about the severe shortage of adoptable infants and the existence of a black market in babies, who are being sold to waiting couples for as much as $25,000. And, in California, two couples unable to bear children because of the wife's infertility advertised in The San Francisco Chronicle for “babymakers”—women willing to submit to artificial insemination with the husband's sperm in order to conceive and bear a child for the couple. One of the couples was willing to pay up to 510.000 for this service, after learning that they would face a three‐to‐seven‐year wait to obtain a child through an adoption agency. The Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney says he can find no state law that is violated by someone who pays a woman to have a baby for purposes of adoption. It strikes many as offensive to talk about children as if they were a commodity for sale, but the truth of the matter is that the adoption market has never been immune to the forces of supply and demand. And at the present time there are both an oversupply and an undersupply of children available for adoption. There are too many of what the adoption agencies euphemistically call “hard‐toplace” youngsters—by which they mean children from minority or mixed racial backgrounds, children over the age of 3, those with physical. mental or emotional handicaps and those with 3rothers and sisters who want to be adopted with :hem. At the same time, the agencies report a great shortage of healthy, Caucasian babies. Precise figures documenting this over‐ and undersupply of babies are hard to come by. With regard to the oversupply, Joseph Reid, the executive director of the Child Welfare League of America, which sets voluntary standards for the 400 private and public adoption agencies in the United States and Canada, estimates that there are some 365,000 children currently under foster care. “At the present time, only about 1 or 2 per cent of these children are actually waiting to be adopted, but perhaps as many as 100.000 of them could be legally freed for adoption if we had the funds for the legal work and the permanent homes in which to place them.” Reid calls children in foster care “the orphans of the living” because so many parents who put their children in foster care, or are forced to do so by the courts, never make the slightest effort to reclaim them. And yet, because the children remain under the legal control of their parents, it is impossible to place them in a permanent family setting. Foster families are paid by the state to give children a temporary home, and even families who agree to undertake the long‐term foster care of a child are seldom as permanent as a real family should be. For example, foster families may have to give up a foster child if they move out of thc county where the child was originally placed. Children who are legally free for adoption live with foster families until families can be found to adopt them; however, if they pass the age of 2 or 3 without being adopted, they may in fact spend their entire childhood in a series of foster homes. The shortage of Caucasian babies is equally difficult to document with precision because many adoption agencies have simply stopped accepting applications from couples wanting to adopt them. As a result, these couples are turning increasingly to private channels. In 1973, there were approximately 57,000 nonrelative adoptions in the United States—that is, adoptions other than those in which a relative adopts a child or a new husband adopts his wife's children by a former marriage. Eighty per cent of these nonrelative adoptions were arranged by public and private agencies. The remaining 20 per cent were private—or what are called “gray market”—adoptions, arranged through lawyers or obstetricians who brought together an unwed mother wanting to give up her child and a couple wanting to adopt. Most of such intermediaries are perfectly honest and charge nothing more than the customary medical or legal fees, but a small percentage of lawyers are reported to he charging couples $10,000 to $25.000 for a healthy Caucasian baby, giving rise to fears that there is a growing “black market” in infants. When asked to estimate the size of this black market, Joseph Reid told Senator Mondale's subcommittee that he thought it might involve approximately 5,000 babies a year. The current shortage of white babies put up for adoption is often attributed to the combined effects of the pill and legalized abortion, but the explanation is actually a good deal more complex. The major source of adoptable infants has always been illegitimate births, which have increased steadily since the midnineteen‐fifties and which are continuing to increase despite the availability of birthcontrol devices and legal abortions. In 1973, there were 407.300 illegitimate births in the United States. 40 per cent of them to white mothers. Since half of these white unwed mothers were 19 years old or younger, one might assume that there would be a plentiful supply of adoptable infants. Yet, more and more unwed mothers are choosing to keep their babies. Elizabeth S. Cole, director the North American Center on Adoption, told Senator Mondale's committee, “Five years ago, of all unmarried mothers who came to an agency seeking help, about 80 per cent decided that they would release their children and place them for adoption. About 20 per cent of the mothers decided to keep their children. This situation has absolutely reversed in five years. In most agencies serving unwed mothers, about 80 per cent are now deciding to keep their children and about 20 per cent are relinquishing them.” Many believe that more unwed mothers are keeping their children because Aid to Families with Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.) is so readily available. But for many highschool, and ever junior‐highschool, students, it seems to have become the fashionable thing to do. Famous rock and movie stars and other culture heroes freely bear and raise illegitimate children, and hit songs, such as Paul Anka's “Having My Baby,” celebrate the trond. The social stigma that once attached to illegitimacy has been transformed into something glamorous. The Children's Home Society of California, a private adoption agency that was founded in 1891, made a film in 1970 called “I'm 17. I'm Pregnant . . . And I Don't Know What to Do.” It portrayed the true story of a girl who first decided to keep her baby but changed her mind 14 months later and gave him up for adoption. Written reactions to the movie reveal that while some students see it as a cautionary tale about not getting pregnant, and a few have said they were glad to learn how the adoption process actually works, many more think that the girl “really took a copout,” and “I'd really put down a girl who gave up her baby.” Partly in response to comments of this sort, the society has just released a new film, called “Growing Up Together,” which depicts the real‐life stories of four teen‐agers who have decided to keep their babies. The initial screenings of this film revealed that adults and teen‐agers have very different reactions to it. Adults tend to see the young mothers as either frighteningly unresponsive or ambivalent toward their children. One obstetrician commented. “I just delivered an 11‐pound baby boy to an 11‐year‐old girl. She's keeping the baby. I'm interested in anything anyone. is doing to call attention to what's happening.” A psychologist in a mental‐health clinic wrote, “Your film doesn't go far enough. Someone's got to do something to stop this stream of emotionally damaged 12‐ and 13‐year‐olds we get from homes headed by unwed mothers.” On the other hand, many high‐school students sce nothing wrong with the situations in which the four girls find themselves: “Now Annie's got someone of her very own to love. . . . The baby might fill Criss's life. She's lonely . . . [Anne]'s a cool and hep mother, like I want to be.” A different perspective on the large number of unwed mothers who keep their children is provided by David Leavitt, a Beverly Hills lawyer through an agency. “First of all, my wife and I are of different religions. I'm Jewish and she comes from a Catholic background. That meant we couldn't go to a Jewish agency, which would have asked her to convert—aside from the fact that there are almost never any Jewish babies available for adoption. A Catholic agency would have asked me to convert, but it probably wouldn't have accepted my wife anyway, because she has been divorced. So we went to a liberal private agency that was recommended by friends and after a great deal of hassle we agreed to register ourselves as Unitarians. The next thing the social worker wanted to know was how often we were going to church, and whether who handles many private adoptions. He argues that more than 90 per cent of the girls who come to him and other lawyers he knows in California and Florida give up their babies for adoption. “A girl comes to us because she wants to give up her child. She doesn't want to be given the fisheye, or be moralized over, or be given psychiatric counseling. I think most agencies end up talking girls out of adoption.” It may be, of course, that private lawyers see a somewhat older, more knowledgeable group of unwed mothers than the adoption agencies attract. But it is possible that Leavitt is right, and that social workers, in exploring with her all the possible ramifications of a girl's decision, have the effect of persuading her that keeping the child is the easiest; course of action. One of the great problems with the official agency approach to adoption is that it is child‐centered. Even in the best of times, when adoption agencies were not telling couples that they would have to endure a three‐to‐sevenyear wait for a Caucasian baby, agencies were notoriously hard on many would‐be parents. A former New York television producer still gets angry when he remembers what he and his wife went through trying to adopt we'd had the minister over for dinner yet!” Joseph Reid of the Child Welfare League points out that many agencies have no choice but to inquire into a couple's religious background, because 11 states (including New York) require religious matching of a child with his adoptive parents “when practicable.” According to the television producer, the phrase “when practicable” means that if the agency arranges a nonmatching adoption it must convince the judge legalizing the adoption that no better family was available. “Many agencies with religious affiliations are simply unwilling to do that because it alienates their constituencies, and of course now that there is such a shortage of babies, they don't have to look very hard for couples who meet their religious qualifications.” The state statutes requiring religious matching in adoptions are probably unconstitutional because a religion is imputed to the child either by his natural mother or by someone at the adoption agency who, for example, puts down ‘Protestant’ when the mother said ‘none.’ However, these laws have never been tested before the Supreme Court, primarily because a court suit would place an adoptive couple and the child Illegitimate births increase, despite birth control and abortion. For many high‐school pupils, unwed parenthood has become fashionable. they wanted in a legal limbo for several years. Most couples, like the television producer and his wife or Jewish couples who cannot get children from agencies that have no Jewish children to offer, turn to private adoption channels instead. David Leavitt, who has handled approximately 800 adoptions during the last 16 years, estimates that some 500 of these involved Jewish couples from New York who could not get a child through an adoption agency. “Not one in 50 of these couples expressed a preference for a Jewish baby. As for the natural mothers, the largest group of white girls placing babies is Catholic, and not one in 20 has a religious preference when it comes to a home for her child.” Leavitt charges his couples a flat fee of $850, and if the natural mother says she needs living or medical expenses he will take this up with the adoptive parents. But he is adamantly opposed to lawyers who “sprinkle girls with money” and who charge inflated fees of their own. “I'm not interested in rewarding a girl for getting pregnant. I'm interested in getting the girl's problem solved and seeing to it that she feels good about the solution.” Nevertheless, there are some lawyers who are willing to sprinkle girls with money if they will surrender their children for adoption. Lynne McTaggart, a reporter for The Chicago Tribune‐New York News Syndicate, described for Senator Mondale's subcommittee what happened when she posed as an unwed mother. “When I went to adoption agencies, they said I could not qualify for welfare. I was not indigent; I was just an upper‐middle‐class girl who was knocked up in New York.” By contrast, when she went to see a private attorney, “he said all my expenses would be taken care of and not to worry about it. He gave me money for tuition. Fie gave me rent money. He gave me money for food and a promise of money for clothing and hospital expenses. And when we totaled it up, being very frugal on the clothing expenses and some of the others, it came to over $4,000.” In addition, the lawyer himself charges his clients $2.500. To discourage exorbitant fees and payoffs, many states have passed disclosure laws, which require lawyers and adoptive parents to list all expenditures in connection with the adoption. However, parents who are desperate for a child are only too willing to pay lawyers part of their fees under the table, and an adoptive parent who has perjured himself in court is not likely to bring action or testify against the lawyer involved. During the nineteen–fifties, when similar practices were also common, the Child Welfare League lobbied vigorously in support of state laws that would make all independent adoptions illegal. Four states now have such laws—Connecticut, Delaware, Minnesota and Michigan—and Massachusetts is considering similar legislation. But so long as some states continue to have easy adoption statutes, it is always possible for unwed mothers and adoptive parents to move temporarily to a different state. David Leavitt and other legitimate lawyers who handle adoptions fear that current disparities in state laws will lead the Child Welfare League to renew its push to outlaw all independent adoptions or, worse in their opinion, that Senator Mondale may be moved to introduce a national law to this effect. One would think that the current shortage of white infants would lead to an increase in interracial adoptions, and this has certainly been occurring in the case of Vietnamese and Korean war orphans. But the interracial placement of black children has been stymied recently by the course of American race relations. There has long been a good deal of illegitimacy in the black community—over the past 35 years, blacks have accounted for anywhere from 52 to 65 per cent of illegitimate births, though they constitute only about 11 per cent of the U.S. population. However, blacks have not commonly turned to adoption as a way to deal with illegitimacy. Single black mothers have either kept their children or resorted to informal adoption — placing their babies with their own mothers, older sisters, or aunts and uncles, rather than surrendering them to state agencies. One result of such informal adoptions is that black couples are not accustomed to coming to adoption agencies for black children. For many years, adoption agencies did not interfere with this situation. The late nineteen – forties and early nineteen – fifties were also years when there was a great shortage of white babies available for adoption, and agencies were extremely selective in choosing adoptive parents: Couples were matched with children in terms of eye, hair and skin color, religion, I.Q. and temperament; adoptive mothers could not hold jobs outside the home; adoptive fathers had to have a certain minimum income, and the prospective home had to have a separate bedroom for the child. No doubt, agency standards of this sort indirectly helped to keep away black couples who might have been willing to adopt a child through formal channels. During the late nineteen–fifties and early nineteen‐sixties, in the backwash of the civilrights movement, a number of changes began to take place. Agencies began seeking out black children who needed to be adopted, and they modified many of their “middle‐class white values” about what constituted an acceptable adoptive family, hoping to attract more black couples. They also began to encourage interracial adoption. In late 1963, the Child Welfare League altered its stance on the desirability of matching a child with its prospective parents and urged instead: “Racial background in itself should not determine the selection of the home for a child. It should not be assumed that difficulties will necessarily arise if adoptive parents and children are of different racial origin.” Brave words, and indicative of the mood of America in the nineteen–sixties. Between 1968 and 1971 alone, the number of black children who were adopted more than doubled—from approximately 3,100 in 1968 to 7,400 in 1971—and the increase was almost equally distributed between black and white adoptive parents. And then, abruptly, attitudes toward the desirability of racial integration shifted again, and adoption policy followed suit. In April, 1972, the National Association of Black Social Workers denounced interracial adoptions as “a diabolical trick” and declared itself “in vehement opposition to the practice of placing black childre‐ with white families.” This remains the association's position today. Across the nation, public and private agencies, under pressure from black social workers on their staffs and members of the black community, abandoned their integrationist policies and went back to matching prospective parents and children. In theory, most agencies still maintain that they will consider an interracial adoption if no suitable adoptive family of the same race can be found, but in practice they tend to heed the Child Welfare League's 1973 warning that “in today's social climate, children placed in adoptive families with similar racial characteristics can become more easily integrated into the average family group and community.” And what has been the result for black children? Opportunity, an Oregon‐based program that has been encouraging and keeping track of black adoptions, found that in 1972 and 1973 the number of black children adopted dropped by 20 and 23 per cent over the previous years and that the decreases were almost as great for black families as they were for white families adopting black children. It is easy to understand why white families backed off from interracial adoptions, but it is less easy to explain why adoptions by black families declined at the same time. One reason is probably the decline in publicity about black children needing adoption. Another reason is doubtless the current recession and the high rate of unemployment among black families. Partly to offset the economic problems of couples who might be willing to take a hard‐toplace child, 36 states (including California, New Jersey and New York) now offer “subsidized adoptions.” Senator Alan Cranston has recently introduced a bill that would provide matching Federal funds for such programs. Most subsidized adoption programs provide that the adopted child must be over 3 years of age, have serious medical or emotional problems, a minority background or siblings who are adopted into the same family. The amount of the subsidy usually varies with the financial situation of the family and the age of the child. In California, the maximum is equal to the amount paid to foster families—$131 to $159 a month—and the initial subsidy is for three years, with a possible extension of two years. In New Jersey, the maximum subsidy amounts to 80 per cent of foster‐care rates but it can continue until a child is 18 if the financial need exists. One rationale behind these programs is to encourage poorer families to adopt hardto‐place children. Another is to encourage foster families to adopt a child they may have grown fond of, when they might otherwise be reluctant to give up the foster‐care payments. Subsidized adoption has been hailed widely as a scheme for freeing children from the “limbo” of foster and institutional care, but some experts have voiced misgivings. Martin Wolins, a professor of social welfare and an authority on foster care, says, “I favor it because for the moment it is the most sensible solution to the oversupply of black unadopted children, but one cannot ignore that it introduces some market components. In a sense, one is buying parenthood.” Aid to Families with Dependent Children is, of course, also a state subsidy of parenthood, and some critics have argued that it even promotes illegitimacy. But it is a niggardly subsidy if the state truly believes that real parents are preferable to foster parents or institutions. In most large states, a parent with one dependent gets a basic grant of approximately $200 a month (less if rent is paid separately), and after that, A.F.D.C. payments go up roughly $50 a month for each additional dependent. Yet foster parents will be paid anywhere from $130 to $180 a month for each child placed in their home. Many social workers argue that children who are placed in foster care—either voluntarily or under a court order—come from families so chaotic that no amount of additional money could have improved their home situation. But this sounds a bit like those 19thcentury pronouncements about the natural depravity of the lower classes. An even more clear‐cut and very common example of bias against a child's natural family occurs if a parent places him or When militant blacks protested, agencies stopped placing black children in white homes, but the number placed in black homes declined as well. her temporarily with a relative who is already getting A.F.D.C. payments. In that case, the relative can get only an additional $50 to care for the child, whereas if the child is placed with a stateapproved foster family, the payment is roughly three times as large. Even if subsidized adoptions and better social services for A.F.D.C. families reduce the oversupply of “unadoptable” children, they will not solve the problems of Caucasian couples who want to adopt. Some of these couples are now turning to the 2,000 Vietnamese “orphans” who have entered this country, but there are some real problems associated with the adoption of these children. Many of them are the wards of religious groups who will set the same sort of standards for adoptive parents that the former television producer and his wife found so onerous. In other words, Jewish couples, agnostic couples or couples from mixed religious backgrounds need not apply. Several left‐wing groups in California have also brought a class‐action suit against the Federal Government charging that the Vietnamese children brought to this country were not orphans but were “kidnapped from their homeland” and ought to be sent back to Vietnam. U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams, who is hearing the case, has given the Government 90 days to investigate and report on the children's backgrounds. It is of course ludicrous to complain that not all of the Vietnamese children brought to the U.S. are gen uine orphans, when few of the American children put up for adoption are orphans. The real issue is whether Vietnamese parents who placed their children in Saigon orphanages signed appropriate releases sanctioning their adoption. Neil Gotanda, an attorney working on the case, says that many Vietnamese parents used the orphanages as “live‐in day‐care centers” and had no intention of giving up their children. He also charges that “there was much psychological coercion and outright fraud during the waning days of the war to get parents to sign adoption releases. For example, there was all sorts of propaganda that children of mixed‐parentage would be killed by the Communists. Other parents were evidently told that their children were being sent to the U.S. for their education and nothing More.” Finally, Gotanda argues that there were many last‐minute name changes and altered documents. A legal release may not accompany the child whose parents signed it. One cannot help but recall similar irregularities in 1941, when Europeans struggled to get children to the United States and Canada. It is hard to see, now as then, how an overly legalistic approach can do anything but compound the tragedy for these children. However, American couples anxious to adopt a Vietnamese child should be forewarned that they may be drawn into a political‐legal battle. In sum, the current picture on the adoption scene is not an especially cheerful one—not for Vietnamese or black children waiting to be adopted and not for white couples trying to adopt a child. ■"
Decline in Major Faiths' Influence in City Reflects Last 10 Years of Urban Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/18/archives/decline-in-major-faiths-influence-in-city-reflects-last-10-years-of.html,"New York City's three major religious faiths, buffeted by theological, cultural and social forces, have undergone striking changes in the last 10 years. Religious leaders widely believe that since 1965, their institutions have lost both visibility and impact on public decisions. Fewer people now attend worship, religious spokesmen say they have lost leverage with public officials and income has generally gone down. This is the first of a fourpart series examining the impact of the last 10 years on Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism in the city. On the other hand, many congregations, though smaller, have a more dedicated membership whose per capita giving is up, their leaders say. They also describe a resurgence of more personal practices such as prayer and Bible study. And bold political power has reportedly given way to political know‐how at the neighborhood level. This portrait of change became apparent in interviews with scores of New York's Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders. It was evident that most of them have radically revised their perceptions of their own roles. No longer do religious figures assume that society at large understands who they are or what they espouse. Instead, they share a proclivity to see themselves as a minority increasingly set apart. But they tend to see this as a not entirely unwelcome development. Rather than being the spiritual guarantors of the nation's values, which are being rigorously questioned, religious leaders are inclined to see themselves in the role of “servants” exercising more of a leavening influence on events. Several developments in the city, as well as across the country, underlie this changing attitude. Among them are the following: ¶Demographic shifts, which shave accounted for much of the decline of many churches and synagogues and caused fundamental changes in others. ¶A “faith crisis” across cultural and religious lines, in part induced by Watergate and other domestic and foreign crises, which has paralleled ascendance of materialism, secularism and widespread criticism of religious values and traditions. ¶A rapid erosion of the partnership that was once thought to exist between religion and civic affairs. ¶A relative failure in interfaith collaboration to foster an ecumenical climate in the face of common problems. Combined, those forces have had formidable influence on the city's three major faith groups. The Catholic church, still in the throes of a major overhaul by Vatican H. has become increasingly Hispanic, and its leaders believe, it is increasingly lacking in political power. Moreover, they express concern. about what they see as competition from external, mortsecular schools of thought. Asked about declining mass attendance and financial trou bles, the Most Rev. Francis Mugavero, bishop of the diocese of Brooklyn, said, “Yes, I am, concerned, I am very concerned —but I am not worried. I feel good about the church's future.” The Protestant community is experiencing a striking growth of its black constituency and a concommitant “survival” mentality among many older white churches, coupled with repeated failures to build bridges between the two races within the faith. The situation among Jews has been most affected by their extended exodus from the city, and the results have been smaller, more elderly congregations. Intermarriage and loss of religious interest among the young have made further inroads. Singular Circumstances “There certainly is a growing secularism,” said Rabbi William Berkowitz, chairman of the board of governors of the New York Board of Rabbis. “They're just not coming to temple in the urban areas.” “The city has largely abandoned religion,” said the Rev. Dr. Bryant Kirkland of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, “and for that reason will pay a terrible moral price.” Some of these developments, such as the intensifying struggle against secularism, are felt in other parts of the nation as well. Most statistical yardsticks of religiosity, including church ‐ going, for example, have shown a gradual drop in commitment. In other respects, the picture is produced by New York's singular circumstances. No other city, for instance, has experienced quite the same demographic shifts. Still other factors are more difficult to compare. Many believe the city's ecumenical progless lags seriously behind the pace‐setting efforts of some reregions, such as some areas of the Midwest, but has forged ahead in several important fields. Similarly, the loosening of the tie between religion and civic affairs is more extensive in many Southern cities, like Dallas, but not nearly as much as in such Western cities as San Francisco. Beyond its importance as a center of Judaism and Christianity, New York has also become the locale for dozens of smaller, more informal or evangelical outcroppings of religious traditions from around, the world. Black Muslims, followers of Sun Myung Moon, Hare Krishna and Zoroaster, and hundreds of lesser known sects can be found here. More Protestants Hard data on the city's religious make‐up are not available, since the United States Census is barred from asking religious preference. Estimates are based on the widest criteria of ethnic and religious identification and do not reflect the numbers of people active in their churches and faiths. The Official Catholic Directory puts the combined total, of the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn at 2.9 million relatively unchanged from 10 years, ago. Catholic officials further estimate that anywhere between) one‐third and one‐half of ally Catholics in the city are Hispanic, whose concentrations pose problems of assimilation. Whereas Irish and Italian immigrants brought their own priests and an ingrained sense of religious obligation, Hispanics have arrived with few priests and a different style of Catholicism that is far more relaxed and family ‐ centered rather than institutional. The Rev. Leland Gartrell, di rector of church research at the Council of Churches of the City of New York, puts the number of Protestants at 2.4 million, up from a decade ago. Eight of 10, he estimates, are black, the remainder equally divided between Hispanics and whites. In 1965, the. Protestant percentages, according to Mr. Gartrell, were 65 per cent black, 27.7 white and 7.3 Hispanic. By Mr. Gartrell's figures, the leading white denominations have lost 46 per cent of their members in the last 20 years and black churches now represent the heart of Protestant strength. He calculates that 80 per cent of black Protestants belong to 28 churches in Harlem and the Bedford‐Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. They cdntinue to serve as broker between the community and the wider world, and have been less affected than white churches by secularism. Synagogues have been steadily dwindling since the end of World War II as a result of the Jewish exodus to the suburbs, although movement has slowed considerably in the last five years. Estimates by Jewish organizations of the number of Jews in the city range between 1.3 million and 1.5 million, which represents a substantial drop from 10 years ago. Remaining behind are thousands of elderly Jews whose poverty and desperation has only recently come to light and for whom religious organizations are now attempting to provide assistance. The impact of the “faith crisis” on religious institutions is harder to quantify than demographic changes, but in many ways is more deeply felt throughout all three major faiths. Catholics ate still in the process of adopting to the thorough revamping of Vatican II. The three‐year council, which ended in 1965, ushered in one of the most turbulent and stimulating eras in church history. Return to Basics Among other things, it increased the collective power of bishops, priests and laity toward their, superiors, overhauled centuries‐old rites, and ended practices such as nomeat Fridays. The council's objective of opening the church to the world resulted in the examination of a broad range of other issues as well: celibacy, the role of nuns, ecumenism and the authority of the hierarchy. In the ensuing controversy and tension, many priests asked to be laicized, nuns left their orders by the thousands and laymen, upset with the reforms, became inactive. Church‐goers have been further divided by debate over Vietnam, the social activism of clergy and laity, and the growth of experimental worship that utilizes such elements as guitars, drama and dance. These controversies have subsided somewhat in recent years, and many Catholics are experiencing a return to spiritual values. Some decry the trend as an escape from vital social concerns, but it is viewed more frequently as a search for basic beliefs in a period when society and the church are under great challenges. Catholic observers say that while the crisis is not over, the worst is past. “We are dealing in a difficult time in the church,” says the Rev. Philip Murnion, director of the archdiocese office of pastoral research and president of the Priests’ Senate. “We are asking how to put it together again. The Protestant community has continued to separate into distinct black and white spheres, with relatively little contact between them. The 400,000 whites counted by Mr. Gartrell are likely to shrink to 100,000 in the ensuing two decades, he predicts, while the black, must decide whether to break out of their immediate surroundings to become a greater citywide force. Thus far, no agency or interreligious council has been able to forge an alliance between white resources and the vitality of black church life. Such a coalition “could have gone far to improve the city,” argues the Rev. Dr. M. L. Wilson, pastor of the 3,200‐member Convent Avenue Baptist church in Harlem, “The results of that neglect have come to haunt us.” Numbers Disputed Protestants have been notoriously unsuccessful in banding together. The Council of Churches of the City of New York says it represents 1,700 churches, but its many critics contend that the number is grossly inflated and that the council is little more than a weak umbrella agency. Judaism has experienced both the quest for deeper faith and the turning inward toward pressing concerns. Religious leaders say the threat to Israel, exemplified by two Middle East wars in the last 10 years, and the possibility of assimilation of Jews in the United States are leading causes of the trends among a small but significant minority. “Since 1967 and again with the Yom Kippur War, there's been a heightened awareness of the importance of Israel that touches every level of congregational programing,” said Rabbi David Mersky, associate director of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues. “It has increased concern about ‘what it's like to be a Jew.’” The formation in recent years of havurot—communities of Jews who share religious and cultural interests—also testifies to the spiritual rebirth. Many rabbis report that their congregations are becoming increasingly decentralized, partly in response to a desire for greater spiritual growth. Rabbi Isaac Trainin director of religious affairs of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, cited two parallel developments a growth in neo‐traditionalism, and a corresponding rise in assimilation and seculariism. “One cannot overstress neotraditionalism,” he said. “It has la lot to do with refugees after World War II [who want their children to preserve their heritage]. Kids are wearing yarmulkas—you never saw that a few, years ago. And nine out of 10 are day‐school graduates.” But secularism, anti‐institutionalism and assimilation pose serious threats to Judaism. “It's the temper and tenor of the times,” said Rabbi William Berkowitz of the New York Board of Rabbis. “Young marrieds are alienated, angry, hostile. The synagogue is a symbol of authority—this too, is something they spew their anger on.” ‘Success Idiom’ Another contention, especially among Christians, is that religion lost whatever “fashionable” or “respectable” quality it had during the nineteen‐fifties, when membership reached its highest point in history. With that quality allegedly gone, thousands of “nominal” members are believed to have withdrawn. That analysis often coincides with a feeling that religion has depended too heavily on numbers to measure its success. The Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn's Concord Baptist Church terms it “idolatry” and calls for “a Christian success idiom” that emphasizes spiritual values instead. The same tendency has led to serious thought about the nature of religious life and a trend toward perceiving it in more personal, less institution‐, al terms. “We are not just some structure,” Terence Cardinal Cooke said emphatically. “We are the people of God.” Such terms as “secularism” and “paganism” are often code words for forms of modern thought that deny transcendence and place faith in material and sensual ideals. Like other ideologies and philosophies that oppose religious ideas, these thought systems ire seen as major threats to theology. The Catholic, Church generaly has adopted a lower political profile than that of a decade Igo. “Catholics thought this was a Catholic city, though I don't think it really was,” said Msgr. James P. Rigney, pastor of St. Patrick's. A seminary instructor summed it up this way: “We are no longer the privileged first estate.” Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. bolstered the impression that the city sought religious guidance. During his term, for example, he lunched every six weeks with Francis Cardinal Spellman, and contacts between the municipality and the church were frequent. Registration Drives Mayor Lindsay broke with that tradition, and during his tenure religious leaders of every faith were denied easy access to City Hall. Under Mayor Beame, some channels have again reopened. Stanley M. Friedman, a mayoral assistant, in perhaps the most significant gesture, has resumed the practice of meeting regularly with the Committee of Religious Leaders, a group of Christian and Jewish officials. “There is no longer an official Catholic in the Mayor's office,” notes the Rev. Robert Kennedy. a politically astute Brooklyn priest, referring to the church's close ties to Gracie Mansion in the days of Mayor Wagner. Instead, he says, the church has learned how to negotiate with city agencies for services and has taken more initiative. The impact of Judaism on city affairs is much more difficult to trace. While the over‐all Jewish perspective is recognized as a weighty factor, religion's role in creating that factor is relatively indiscernible, and the role of Abraham D. Beanie as the city's first Jewish mayor is not believed to make a significant difference in this regard. The Jewish “voice” in the city, it develops, is actually a composite of many secular and religious speakers. White Protestants, who at one time formed the substance of New York's upper crust, have by and large withered into insignificance as a religious political force. Their black counterparts, meanwhile, have yet to gain a position of power. Recognition of common spiritual obstacles has done little to foster an ecumenical climate in New York. Leaders regard the breakthroughs in restoring basic contacts as important steps. But aside from a few symbolic gestures, such as the recent decision by St. ‐Patrick's Cathedral and Temple EmanuEl to hold monthly colloquia, advances have been spotty and One reason offered is that all institutions have had to become more concerned with their own survival, though some leaders believe that hardships will eventually force them together. The Brooklyn diocese, for example, has conducted one of the nation's most progressive Catholic‐Jewish relations councils, while the New York Archdiocese has made only tentative steps in this direction. The abortion debate has seriously disrupted interfaith efforts. Many Protestants and Jews favor abortion, while most Catholics and sizable numbers of Protestants and Jews solidly oppose it. For that reason and others, the Catholic archdiocese has responded coolly to tacit invitations to join the Council of Churches. The council made the initial gesture at the height of ecumenical optimism in 1968 by removing the name “Protestant” from its title, theoretically clearing the way. The question of Israel also has hampered closer ties between Christians and Jews. Since the 1967 war, many Jews have been dismayed at what they consider a lack of support for Israel. ‘Much to Be Desired’ “Interfaith efforts are at very low ebb,” said Rabbi Ira Silberman, director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Planning and Research. “Since thi '67 war, it seems, Christians find it difficult to see Jews vis‐à‐vis the state of Israel.” Rabbi Marc Tannenbaum, director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, says ecumenical relations in the city “leave much to be desired.” “Compared to the extent .and depth of Jewish‐Christian, activity in, for example, Boston, Chicago or Los Angeles,” he said, “New York City is almost at a primitive level.” Interfaith collaboration consists mostly of behind‐the scenes meetings of religious officials, some self‐appointed, who act more as clubby individuals than organizational representafives. Remarked one observer: “They act as free‐floating icebergs who are tied to nothing and report to no one.” The most obvious example is the Committee of Religious Leaders, first convened in 1957 by Mayor Wagner. According to critics, its existence depends more on the whims of Gracie Mansion than upon a conviction by its members about the worth of ecumenism. The committee does act, as when it recently met to rebuke labor strikes and slowdowns during the city's budget crisis. But such action only confirms critics in their suspicion that the committee is being used for political advantage. Ecumenism is judged to have taken its best hold on the grass roots level—for example, in such cases where neighboring clergy of different faiths take part in the installation of a pastor. Some are deeply troubled by, the absence of greater accord., “In a secular age like ours,” said the Rev. David Bowman, a Catholic priest on the National Council of Churches' ecumenical division, “we badly need a united witness.” Tomorrow: The 10‐year effect of Vatican II on Catholicism in the city."
Catholic Church in City ‘Basically Very Healthy’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/19/archives/catholic-church-in-city-basically-very-healthy-catholic-church-is.html,"Among the cascade of changes pouring from Vatican II, none had more personal impact on the individual parishioner than the “Kiss of Peace.” The practice, which involves a pause in the mass for celebrants to exchange handshakes and embraces, stems from the earliest days of the church. When it was reintroduced, it was often greeted warily by worshipers accustomed to solitude during the mass. Now, in most places, it is commonplace and welcome. Second of a series. The reaction to the “Kiss of Peace” typifies the transition that the Catholic church has undergone in the last 10 years in response to Vatican II‐ gradual adaptation, but not without resistance. Particularly in New York, a Catholic stronghold, leaders stress that the adjustment period is far from over but that tensions have largely subsided. In interviews, they disclosed both a continuing concern over the church's difficulties and a confidence that they could be resolved. Taking an over‐all measure of his archdiocese, Terence Cardinal Cooke remarked: “Though it runs a temperature once in a while, it is basically very healthy.” The sweeping nature of the Vatican II reforms and their aftereffects have had several catalytic effects in the city: ¶The council's accent on self‐development has spawned not only greater individuality among persons but has also encouraged the emergence of distinct “personalities” in the adjoining Archdiocese of New York and the diocese of Brooklyn. The highlighting of differences is partly due to the varying styles of leadership. ¶An emphasis on consultative decision‐making has given priests and laity far greater weight in parish and diocesan affairs. ¶Concern for pluralism, especially as it applies to the concept of the church as “people” rather than “hierarchy” or “institution,” has led to an increased awareness of the needs of sub‐groups in the church. The continuing needs of immigrants and other cultures provides a tough test for fulfilling this aspiration, particularly since Hispanics now number almost half the number of Catholics in the five boroughs. The Ecumenical Council summoned by Pope John XXIII, ended three years of deliberations on a vast agenda of church issues in 1965 and ushered in one of the most remarkable eras of reform in church history. Its documents dealt with the nature of the church as the “people of God,” the use of “shared” or “conciliar” authority and the challenges of the modern age. Other sections addressed matters of everyday faith. Advisory Roles In the process, the church was extensively revamped. Bishops, priests and the laity were each given unprecedented, roles as advisers to their superiors, outer forms changed (the English‐language mass and the suspension of meatless Fridays among them) and formal contacts were established with non‐Catholics. Turmoil from this rapid transformation, added to frictions from debate over such volatile subjects as celibacy, race and Vietnam, turned thousands of priests and nuns away from their orders and left untold lay people angry or bewildered. The developments had differing effects on the city's approximately 3.3 million Catholics, who are contained in two separate entities: the Archdiocese of New York, consisting of Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties, and the Diocese of Brooklyn, made up of Brooklyn and Queens. The archdiocese, with 407 parishes, has long been a center of influence in the American church, serving as a port of entry for thousands of Catholic immigrants and often as a bellwether of change. Brooklyn is the smallest diocese (as opposed to archdiocese) in area in the country (179.5 scusre miles), the largest in population (1.1 million Catholics) and the most urban. History and circumstances have given each “see” a distinct, character, but the Vatican Council's emphasis on self‐development stimulated this tendency even further. The two dioceses are as different as they are similar and their responses to ?? reforms converge ?? Consultation Widened In the area of Catholic schools, for example, each diocese has organized clusters of Parishes to plot needs and resources. Each diocese has likewise entered into a broader consultation process. Cardinal Cooke and Brooklyn's bishop, the Most Rev. Francis J. Mugavero, are in regular contact with such new bodies as the Sisters' Advisory Council, the Priests' Senate and the most recent and representative instrument, the Pastoral Council. But each chancery has acquired an image of its own. The archdiocese, with a tradition of strong central rule, is regarded as a relatively tight ship, basically cautious in approach. Brooklyn, on the other hand, is widely viewed, as one chancery official put it, as “aggressively liberal.” It was among the first dioceses to ease annulment procedures, and it has encouraged civil‐rights work and interceded on behalf of illegal aliens. Much of the difference is directly traceable to the men at the helm. Cardinal Cooke and Bishop Mugavero took charge of their respective dioceses within months of each other in 1968. The Cardinal the handpicked choice of the late Francis Cardinal Spellman, has kept more in the background than did his predecessor and exercises far less political influence than Cardinal Spellman did in the days when the chancery was known as the “Powerhouse” Like Cardinal Cooke, who was trained as a social worker, Bishop Mugavero came from a background in social service (he was formerly head of Catholic Charities). He was the first Italian to assume the post and has proven extremely popular. More an extrovert than the Cardinal, he has been highly visible and accessible to priests and laity. Remarked one leading member of the Priests' Senate: “He's the only priest I know who actually could be elected bishop by his colleagues.” Whereas the Brooklyn prelate enjoys creating change and granting authority to subordinates, Cardinal Cooke has been inclined instead to allow change to take place. “He allows many flowers to grow,” said the Rev. Jame Connolly, pastor of Sacred Heart in Hartsdale, “ever though he may not like them all.” Both men, in separate interviews, expressed concern for the decline in mass attendance and institutional loyalty, a nationwide trend confirmed by several studies. But they agreed that the church was showing signs of emerging from an especially stormy era. Among other things, they indicated that the church was acquiring a self‐image that was less a triumphal institution and more a community of people in search of its mission. “The church after Vatican II sees itself very much as the people of God,” Cardinal Cooke said. “It is a pilgrim church, not having everything completed but perpetually on its way.” The upholding of abortion by the Supreme Court and defeats of parochial‐school‐aid measures have had sobering effects on the church, among them the recognition that the church holds little sway over public morality. Cardinal Cooke has spearheaded the United States Catholic Bishops' antiabortion campaign and has been outspoken on this issue as he has been on few other social concerns. Brooklyn priests are fond of contrasting his style with what they regard as a more “educative” approach by Bishop Mugavero. Meanwhile, the church has had to contend with other major factors: an aging constituency (70 per cent of the Brooklyn diocese is over 65), a continuing influx of immigrants (mostly Hispanic) and disunity over the church's moral teachings, such as birth control. Up to half the city's Catholics are from Spanish‐speaking backgrounds. In 1971, Brooklyn established an Office of Immigration to focus attention on their problems and others'. Since the nineteen‐fifties, the archdiocese has been training American priests in Spanish to serve Hispanic parishes. The astounding scope of ethnicity is particularly apparent in the Brooklyn diocese. A survey to determine the principal language spoken in the homes of children in St. Joseph's school in Long Island City, Queens, for example, found a total of 28, including Icelandic and Gaelic. A parish in Flushing, Queens, discovered a range of backgrounds from 31 countries. At Holy Cross parish in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, masses are conducted each Sunday for Haitians, Filipinos, Koreans and Hispanics. Differing Patterns Most Hispanics do not bring a pattern of Catholicism familiar to those of European descent: They are oriented more toward family than institution, less concerned for religious obligations and less inclined or able to support the church financially. For example, out of 8,000 Hispanics counted as members of the parish of Our Lady of Lourdes, on 142d Street in Queens, only 1,500 attend mass or are involved with the church in any way. Moreover, unlike their Irish or Italian predecessors, they have not brought priests with them. Those priests who serve them are either non‐Hispanics who have learned to speak Spanish or priests imported from South America or Spain. Brooklyn has 150 foreign priests (one out of seven in the diocese), called “externs,” and the archdiocese has 105. They pose a special problem, for most of them do not belong to the diocesan structure but instead have been granted permission to serve in parishes. Many are in the United States primarily to attend graduate school, and as long as they are merely externs, they cannot answer the need for Hispanics in leadership positions. There are signs of growing militancy among the new arrivals. For example, St. Emerick's parish in lower Manhattan, made up primarily of Hispanics, has been the scene of a protracted dispute involving the merging of the parish school with that of a neighboring parish. The Rev. Joaquin Beaumont, head of archdiocesan Spanish work, predicts “more friction in the future” as Hispanics “demand more and more of the action.” And the pressure of a large lower‐economic group on middle‐class Catholics could further hamper efforts toward church unity. The archdiocesan Pastoral Council, which was convened for the first time last month, represents the latest and most extensive expression of the “shared authority” concept. Headed by Cardinal Consisting of 97 members, a size some consider unwieldy, the council includes representatives from a broad spectrum of clergy and laity. It is headed by the Cardinal. A similar council has been meeting informally for several months in Brooklyn and hopes to tackle the diocese's most central concerns. The practice of lay participation in church affairs, once thought unusual, is now well entrenched. The chief means has been the parish council, where lay people serve terms of two or three years to assist with pastoral concerns. Eighty‐five per cent of suburban parishes, half of the urban parishes in the archdiocese and all but six of the Brooklyn parishes have councils. Msgr. Henry T. Mansell, who oversees the archdiocese's councils from the chancery, says that the laity have gradually learned “the ins and outs” and that as the councils have matured. they have moved from financial to spiritual matters. As has been the case with many other reforms, the key to a council's success is the ability of the pastor to adapt to the new concepts that have altered his role, and many have responded eagerly. Others, however, have resisted: there has been widespread clergy discontent in the past decade and much of it has to do with the sudden, dramatic transition. But the rate o?? priestly defections has declined in recent years as the worst of the shakedown period appears to he ending. Further, those entering seminary are a different variety than in the past: older (half of those in the entering class of 25 in the archdiocese are over 25 years old) and more experienced in the secular world. ‘Cultural Revolution’ “The time is still difficult for priests,” said the Rev. William Geraghty, an instructor of the Cathedral College in Douglaston, Queens. “There is such a cultural revolution going on that there is no role not up for grabs. “Fifteen years ago the Catholic world was cohesive and provided role models. Now that is gone. A priest used to be put together. Now he must put himself together.” Another difference results from the movement of a formerly immigrant Irish and Italian church into the mainstream of American life. The “immigrant” priest had a tightly defined set of sacramental and counseling functions. In the transition, many priests found themselves less in demand, forced to decide how to use their time. Priestly morale, which a 1967 archdiocesan study said had dropped to a perilous low, has by most accounts since risen. Contributing to a changed atmosphere have been two innovations: a priest assignment board, which consults with priests about moves, and a sixyear term for pastors, with a maximum of two terms in one location. Once priests In the archdiocese waited an average of 30 years for the one promotion from assistant to pastor. Now the normal wait is 14 years. The fact that there are fewer priests also improves chances for promotion. Various studies had shown that the long delays were a major source of frustration. Another common irritant, mandatory celibacy, is still a subject of anguished debate. “A lot of men feel it is a penalty attached to the priesthood,” said Msgr. Francis Leonard, head of the archdiocesan personnel board. ‘Fringes’ Object Among the laity, Vatican II overturned many cherished customs and replaced them with unfamiliar rituals. Catholic leaders generally express lay acceptance of such innovations as the English mass and lay participation. The most strenuous objections have been lodged by what one pastor called the “right‐wing and leftwing fringes.” Father Connolly, an instructor in liturgy at St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, spelled out the implication of the reforms. “In the older culture we relied on law. What changed when the Latin was removed was that you could no longer just watch the priest or remain extrinsic to [the mass] any more.” The Rev. James P. Rigney, pastor of St. Patrick's, defined, the “new mentality.” “It used to be ‘I am going to mass.’ Now it is ‘We are doing something together.’ “ After years of disruption and innovation, there appears to be a yearning for stability, and putting down new roots. The Rev. Philip Murnion, director of the Office of Pastoral Research for the archdiocese, said there was a “re‐institutional imperative.” Smaller Groups “Society lost the glue that held things together,” he said, and religion is affected by the social ambiance. “The effects of these forces remain, and countermovements are under way to try to restore fellowship: pentecostalism, marriage encounter and smaller groups for worship.” Msgr. Eugene Clark, public information officer for the archdiocese, believes that the trend toward “mystical and internal experiences” far outweighs the uproar over Vatican II. Like similar critics, he thinks the council concerned mostly secondary matters and has received “exaggerated importance.” There is little discord over the church's main worries. Mass attendance, though apparently leveling off somewhat, is still down. School costs are soaring and the parishes' ability to pay is further strained. Candidates for the priesthood are difficult to recruit, particularly among Hispanics. And social activists complain that the church has turned its back on the issues that made it relevant to young people in the nineteen‐sixties. “We don't give as many answers,” Father Geraghty said. “We are sadder but wiser, and healthier.” Tomorrow: Racial division in the Protestant church."
U.S. Court Upholds Steel Industry Pact To End Job Bias,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/19/archives/us-court-upholds-steel-industry-pact-to-end-job-bias.html,"NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 18 (UPI) — The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit today upheld two consent degrees against the steel industry. One ordered the establishment of a $31‐million fund for back pay for victims of alleged discriminatory hiring and promotion. The consent degrees were signed in 1974 by nine steel companies and the United Steelworkers of America on the same day the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Secretary of Labor filed suit against the companies and the union. The suit charged “massive patterns and practices of hiring and job assignment discrimination on the bases of race, sex and national origin,” the Circuit Court noted. Several groups, including the National Organization for Women, appealed the agreement. But the court ruled that the groups could not intervene in the case. Under a consent decree, the defendants agree to stop the practices that led to the suit. The nine companies that signed the decree were Allegheny‐Ludlum Industries, Inc., Armco Steel Corporation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, National Steel Corporation, Republic Steel Corporation, United States Steel Corporation, Wheeling‐Pittsburgh Stel Corporation and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. The second decree deals mainly with company‐controlled issues not subject to collective bargaining. In another ruling today, the appellate court struck down Florida law requiring unwed mothers to get their parents' consent and married women the consent of their husbands before having abortions. The court ruled in a class action that both requirements were unconstitutional."
Catholic Church in City ‘Basically Very Healthy’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/19/archives/catholic-church-in-city-basically-very-healthy.html,"Among the cascade of changes pouring from Vatican II, none had more personal impact on the individual parishioner than the “Kiss of Peace.” The practice, which involves a pause in the mass for celebrants to exchange handshakes and embraces, stems from the earliest days of the church. Second of a series. When it was reintroduced, it was often greeted warily by worshipers accustomed to solitude during the mass. Now, in most places, it is commonplace and welcome. The reaction to the “Kiss of Peace” typifies the transition that the Catholic church has undergone in the last 10 years in response to Vatican II— gradual adaptation, but not without resistance. Particularly in New York, a Catholic stronghold, leaders stress that the adjustment period is far from over but that tensions have largely subsided, In interviews, they disclosed both a continuing concern over the church's difficulties and a confidence that they could, be resolved. Taking an over‐all measure of his archdiocese, Terence Cardinal Cooke remarked: “Though it runs a temperature once in a while, it is basically very healthy.” The sweeping nature of the Vatican II reforms and their aftereffects have had several catalytic effects in the city: ¶The council's accent one self‐development has spawned not only greater individuality among persons but has also encouraged the emergence of distinct “personalities” in the adjoining Archdiocese of New York and the diocese of Brooklyn. The highlighting of differences is partly due to the varying styles of leadership. ¶An emphasis on consultative decision‐making has given priests and laity far greater weight in parish and diocesan affairs. ¶Concern for pluralism, especially as it applies to the concept of the church as “people” rather than “hierarchy” or “institution,” has led to an increased awareness of the needs of sub‐groups in the church. The continuing needs of immigrants and other cultures provides a tough test for fulfilling this aspiration, particularly since Hispanics now number almost half the number of Catholics in the five boroughs. The Ecumenical Council summoned by Pope John XXIII, ended three years of deliberations on a vast agenda of church issues in 1965 and ushered in one of the most remarkable eras of reform in church history. Its documents dealt with the nature of the church as the “people of God,” the use of “shared” or “conciliar” authority and the challenges of the modern age. Other sections addressed matters of everyday faith. In the process, the church was extensively revamped. Bishops, priests and the laity were each given unprecedented, roles as advisers to their superiors, outer forms changed (the English‐language mass and the suspension of meatless Fridays among them) and formal contacts were established with non‐Catholics. Turmoil from this rapid transformation, added to frictions from debate over such volatile subjects as celibacy, race and Vietnam, turned thousands of priests and nuns away from their orders and left untold lay people angry or bewildered. The developments had differing effects on the city's approximately 3.3 million Catholics, who are contained in two separate entities: the Archdiocese of New York, consisting of Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties, and the Diocese of Brooklyn, made up of Brooklyn and Queens. The archdiocese, with 407 parishes, has long been a center of influence in the American church, serving as a port of entry for thousands of Catholic immigrants and often as a bellwether of change. Brooklyn is the smallest diocese (as opposed to archdiocese) in area in the country (179.5 square miles), the largest in population (1.1 million Catholics) and the most urban. History and circumstances have given each “see” a distinct, character, but the Vatican Council's emphasis on self‐development stimulated this tendency even further. The two dioceses are as different as they are similar, and their responses to ?? reforms converge at ?? ??verge. In the area of Catholic schools, for example, each diocese has organized clusters of Parishes to plot needs and resources. Each diocese has likewise entered into a broader consultation process. Cardinal Cooke and Brooklyn's bishop, the Most Rev. Francis J. Mugavero, are in regular contact with such new bodies as the Sisters' Advisory Council, the Priests' Senate and the most recent and representative instrument, the Pastoral Council. But each chancery has acquired an image of its own. The archdiocese, with a tradition of strong central rule, is regarded as a relatively tight ship, basically cautious in approach. Brooklyn, on the other hand, is widely viewed, as one chancery official put it, as “aggressively liberal.” It was among the first dioceses to ease annulment procedures, and it has encouraged civil‐rights work and interceded on behalf of illegal aliens. Much of the difference is directly traceable to the men at the helm. Cardinal Cooke and Bishop Mugavero took charge of their respective dioceses within months of each other in 1968. The Cardinal, the handpicked choice of the late Francis Cardinal Spellman, has kept more in the background than did his predecessor and exercises far less political influence than Cardinal Spellman did in the days when the chancery was known as the “Powerhouse” Like Cardinal Cooke, who was trained as a social worker, Bishop Mugavero came from a background in social service (he was formerly head of Catholic Charities). He was the first Italian to assume the post and has proven extremely popular. More an extrovert than the Cardinal, he has been highly visible and accessible to priests and laity. Remarked one leading member of the Priests' Senate: “He's the only priest I know who actually could be elected bishop by his colleagues.” Whereas the Brooklyn prelate enjoys creating change and granting authority to subordinates, Cardinal Cooke has been inclined instead to allow change to take place. “He allows many flowers to grow,” said the Rev. James Connolly, pastor of Sacred Heart in Hartsdale, “ever though he may not like them all.” Both men, in separate interviews, expressed concern for the decline in mass attendance and institutional loyalty, a nationwide trend confirmed by several studies. But they agreed that the church was showing signs of emerging from an especially stormy era. Among other things, they indicated that the church was acquiring a self‐image that was less a triumphal institution and more a community of people in search of its mission. “The church after Vatican II sees itself very much as the people of God,” Cardinal Cooke said. “It is a pilgrim church, not having everything completed but perpetually on its way.” The upholding of abortion by the Supreme Court and defeats of parochial‐schoolaid measures have had sobering effects on the church, among them the recognition that the church holds little sway over public morality. Cardinal Cooke has spearheaded the United States Catholic Bishops' antiabortion campaign and has been outspoken on this issue as he has been on few other social concerns. Brooklyn priests are fond of contrasting his style with what they regard as a more “educative” approach by Bishop Mugavero. Meanwhile, the church has had to contend with other major factors: an aging constituency (70 per cent of the Brooklyn diocese is over 65), a continuing influx of immigrants (mostly Hispanic) and disunity over the church's moral teachings, such as birth control. Up to half the city's Catholics are from Spanish‐speaking backgrounds. In 1971, Brooklyn established an Office of Immigration to focus attention on their problems and others'. Since the nineteen‐fifties, the archdiocese has been training American priests in Spanish to serve Hispanic parishes. The astounding scope of ethnicity is particularly apparent in the Brooklyn diocese. A survey to determine the principal language spoken in the homes of children in St. Joseph's school in Long Island City, Queens, for example, found a total of 28, including Icelandic and Gaelic. A parish in Flushing, Queens, discovered a range of backgrounds from 31 countries. At Holy Cross parish in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, masses are conducted each Sunday for Haitians, Filipinos, Koreans and Hispanics. Most Hispanics do not bring a pattern of Catholicism familiar to those of European descent: They are oriented more toward family than institution, less concerned for religious obligations and less inclined or, able to support the church financially. For example, out of 8,000 Hispanics counted as members of the parish of Our Lady of Lourdes, on 142d Street in Queens, only 1,500 attend mass or are involved with the church in any way. Moreover, unlike their Irish or Italian predecessors, they have not brought priests with them. Those priests who serve them are either non‐Hispanics who have learned to speak Spanish or priests imported from South America or Spain. Brooklyn has 150 foreign priests (one out of seven in the diocese), called “externs,” and the archdiocese has 105. They pose a special problem, for most of them do not belong to the diocesan structure but instead have been granted permission to serve in parishes. Many are in the United States primarily to attend graduate school, and as long as they are merely externs, they cannot answer the need for Hispanics in leadership positions. There are signs of growing militancy among the new arrivals. For example, St. Emerick's parish in lower Manhattan, made up primarily of Hispanics, has been the scene of a protracted dispute involving the merging of the parish school with that of a neighboring parish. The Rev. Joaquin Beaumont, head of archdiocesan Spanish work, predicts “more friction in the future” as Hispanics “demand more and more of the action.” And the pressure of a large lower‐economic group on middle‐class Catholics could further hamper efforts toward church unity. The archdiocesan Pastoral Council, which was convened for the first time last month, represents the latest and most extensive expression of the “shared authority” concept. Consisting of 97 members, a size some consider unwieldy, the council includes representatives from a broad spectrum of clergy and laity. It is headed by the Cardinal. A similar council has been meeting informally for several months in Brooklyn and hopes to tackle the diocese's most central concerns. The practice of lay participation in church affairs, once thought unusual, is now well entrenched. The chief means has been the parish council, where lay people serve terms of two or three years to assist with pastoral concerns. Eighty‐five per cent of suburban parishes, half of the urban parishes in the archdiocese and all but six of the Brooklyn parishes have councils. Msgr. Henry T. Mansell, who oversees the archdiocese's councils from the chancery, says that the laity have gradually learned “the ins and outs” and that as the councils have matured, they have moved from financial to spiritual matters. As has been the case with many other reforms, the key to a council's success is the ability of the pastor to adapt to the new concepts that have altered his role, and many have responded eagerly.

Progress Cited in Heredity Research,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/21/archives/progress-cited-in-heredity-research.html,"HARBOR SPRINGS, Mich., Aug. 20—Scientists are making rapid progress in mapping the basic sructures of human heredity, according to a report presented oday to a conference sponsored by the National Foundation‐March of Dimes. Dr. Frank H, Ruddle of Yale University's School of Medicine told the Science Communicators Conference at the Boyne Highlands Inn here tha.t the number of genes’ mapped appeared to be passing 100. The conference‐IS designed Primarily for science reporters. Such genetic mapping is expected to have important future uses in promoting understanding of human development, diagnosing birth defects early in fetal life and predicting a person's inherent susceptibility to diseases. The basic stratures of heredity are the chromesomes, “the strands of genetic material the nucleus of every living cell. Ranged along the chromosomes are the genes, the specific hereditary determinants that tell every living cell what it can make and whatit can become. The genes govern every imaginable hereditary trait, from hair color to innate resistance to disease. Until relatively recently, the location of individual genes on a human's 23.pairs of chromosomes was unknown. As recently, as 1970, only one or two genes could be assigned specific chromosomes and specific locations on the chromosome, according to Dr. Ruddle. He predicted that within five years, scientists would know the location of 1,000 genes, a significant, portion of the approximately 100,000 believed to exist on a single complement of human chromosomes. The rapid advances in mapping human genes has been achieved by scientists at many laboratories, with the aid of many recently perfected tools of biological research, Dr. Ruddle said. Notable among these is the ability to grow cells in laboratory, flasks that are hybrids between such distant species as man and mouse. The hybrid cells contain some of the chromosomes from each species. Sophisticated methods of staining these chromosomes to accentuate certain regions and certain chemical characteristics allow the human chromosomes to be distinguished from those of a mouse. Aided by batteries of cells with known abnormalities, in chromosomes and known propensity for making certain’ chemical products, the locations of the genes governing those ‘products can be pinpointed, the scientist ‘said. Defense Against Virus One gene that has been successfully mapped in recent research is the gene responsible for controlling production of a substance called interferon. This substance is one of the body's major defenses against virus infection. The ability to pinpoint this gene offers opportunities to study some of the basic factors controlling its activity and potency in the body and, hence, some of the key factors that make a person naturally resistant to or susceptible to virus infection. In the future, Dr. Ruddle and other scientists here said, genetic mapping should also broaden doctors’ ability to detect genetic abnormalities in the human fetus. This is done through the analysis of fetal gathered by a technique called amniocentesis—taking small sample of fluid surrounding the, fetus after puncturing the womb with a hollow needle, and studying the fetal cells in the fluid. Amniocentesis is already used for studying a substantial num, ber of potentially damaging genita abnormalities, such as the chromosome defect that goes with a serious type of mental retardation called Down's syndrome, or Mongolism. In another talk to the conference here, Dr. Henry L. Nadler of Northwestern University and Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago said amniocentesis was being used for only small fraction of pregnant women who faced an abnormally high risk of giving birth to a child with a congenital defect. As one example of probably underused prenatal diagnosis, he cited the usefulness of amniocentesis in detecting defects that could leave the’ baby with an improperly closed spine. Dr. Arthur J. Salisbury, the National Foundation's vice president for medical services, reported the results of a recent survey showing that more than 97 per cent of a sample of 2,000 pregnant women who sought amniocentesis found the fetal defect over which they were worried was not present in their baby. In most cases, therapeutic abortion is the only alternative to birth of ‘a baby marked with a birth defect, but doctors here emphasize the importance of reassurance to those women who are at risk and yet find that the unborn baby is entirely normal."
Excerpts From Deposition Taken From Nixon by Lawyers,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/21/archives/excerpts-from-deposition-taken-from-nixon-by-lawyers.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 20‐Following are excerpts from a deposition taken from former President Richard M. Nixon by lawyers for the Government, which is the defendant in Mr. Nixon's suit to gain custody of his Presidential tapes and documents, and intervening defendants: Q. Now, as President, can you estimate how much of your time was spent in preparing yourself written documents? A. When the Presidency, as you know, became a much more burdensome office, in terms of various duties to be carried out. As you know there was a time in our history when Presidential speeches might be better because Presidents like Lincoln wrote their own, Jefferson and so forth. In this century, I would say I have spent more of my time preparing my own speeches and other public statements than any President since Woodrow Wilson. I would say he prob ably spent, in this century, more time than any other President for that purpose, with the possible exception of Theodore Roosevelt. But I would suggest here again that it depends on ‘the individual. It depends on what other duties he has. When the country was younger, when the country didn't have the responsibilities that it has in the world today, when the Government was much smaller, the President had the luxury of preparing speeches and materials and did so. I had always had the custom, before I became President, of doing virtually all of my own work. I carried on as much as I could on any important speeches; I did most of the preparation myself with very good assistance from staff suggestions. But when it came to the final drafts I had to do them myself. I realize that I am not answering your question specifically.’ But I cannot at this time say I spent 5 per cent of my time or a third of my time preparing speeches. I do say, however, that spent a very great'proportion of my time, more than any President in modern history, doing my own work, because it had been my custom. And I don't say that critically of previous Presidents, because it is very likely those who wrote speeches for them may have written better speeches than they would have for.themselves. ‘Demands on Your Time’ Q. There were great demands on your time? A. That is true, great demands on a President's time in this period when the United States has reached the status of a full‐fledged world power, particularly when other powers that used to be in that category, for example the European powers, no longer can carry their share of the load. Q. We discussed a moment ago the fact that there were great demands on your time as there are on the time of any other President. Did you establish procedures designed to insure that you only were presented with the documents that were essential for you to read? A. Oh, yes. The procedures were to have'advisers in various areas who would screen the flow of paper work coming into the President's office or coming in for his, at least, consideration, and then to have those documents put into what I called my reading file. Some of them, of course, required reading almost immediately. If, for example, a veto message was involved, something of that sort, where there was a time limit. Some of them might require—didn't have the same urgency —decision far down the line, and I asked for that too. So in the, field of foreign affairs I would rely on Dr. Kissinger to screen the great amount of material that came in from the various agencies who ‘ had interest in foreign affairs and that included others in the State Department, as you well know, and also from various private groups and private citizens who had views which I valued. I might not always accept them. Mr. [John D.] Erhlichman, he was head of the Domestic Council, and Mr. Moynihan [Daniel Patrick, domestic adviser] would screen the documents in that field and in the political area generally Mr. Haldeman [H.R., chief of staff] might screen the documents. And I also had ways in which individuals who felt they couldn't get through the so‐called palace guard could get to me directly. And a number of friends, former advisors, when I was a Senator, Congressman or Vice President or out of office and so forth, would send their materials to my personal secretary, Miss [Rose Mary] Woods. And a great amount of material came through her to me. In my view this principle of confidentiality, which realize is not in vogue these days in many quarters, is indispensable for making of great decisions. There would have been no opening to China without total absolute secrecy and confidentiality. Not because anything wrong was involved but because any leak would have destroyed the fragile framework that we had built up over a period of years starting from the time I ventured that opinion, before I became President, in an article to Foreign Affairs. There was a situation there would have been also in the domestic field very great difficulty in implementing the program that we had for desegregation of schools in the South unless it had been done with some degree of confidentiality and the assurance so that a President could have candid, very frank discussions with people on both sides with regard to the problem and by gaining their confidence, then be able to make decisions would enable him to move forward on an issue. There also comes to mind the new economic policy, which was announced on Aug. 15th, 1971. It was developed in the first instance in a long conversation that I had with Connally [John B., Secretary of the Treasury in the Oval Office. It was discussed in great length in memoranda from people within the Administration who had diametrically, opposed views and who wrote those memoranda to me, all of which I read, and who then when they were together when we met at Camp David, expressed those views. I made the decision. The views resulted in the floating of the dollar, wageprice controls, the freeze. And the other matters, particularly the imposition of the 10 per cent import duty, as you recall, on foreign cars and so forth. I give those two examples and there are others, only to show that while the word secrecy is one to us in a free society is abhorrent, that in terms of decision making it is indispensable. Different Points of View For example, the long and tortuous process which resulted in ending the draft and ending the Americaninvolvement in Vietnam and ending the press of war required secret negotiations over many, many months. At anytime had there been disclosure thereof of it at any time the individuals with whom we were in contact had thought that their preliminary reviews would be made public, the American involvement I think would not have ended as soon as it did. I am not suggesting that as far as a President or any other officeholder is concerned, that to the greatest extent possible not only his decisions but how he Teaches those decisions should be made public, but I am suggesting that, and I know that if individuals who advise President do not assume that their advice is going to be given in confidence, they are going to be giving advice that has a unique quality. Some did anyway. But the best advisers I had, I must say, were those who expressed views far, far apart. And I speak here not only for my own office, my own tenure in office as an individual but for the office of the Presidency in the future and for that matter for all of those who hold office, because once this precedent is established of appropriating not only the President's private thoughts and papers and diaries, et cetera, but also all of the information that comes into him with the assumption that it is to be secret, once it happens here then inevitably, in my opinion, it will move on and affect future Presidencies. It could move over possibly even to the judiciary, very unlikely to the Congress because the Congress, as you know, is quite jealous of its prerogative, in a sense. Q. Do you believe, Mr. Nixon, that the public is entitled to full disclosure of everything that is in the Presidential materials that relate to the break‐in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters on June 17, 1972, and subsequent efforts by anyone to conceal the involvement of the Committee for the Re‐election of the President with that break‐in? A. Well, the answer to your question at this point is not at this time, in view of the legal proceedings that are under way… I find that less than per cent of the Presidential materials, they number 42 million documents, conversations and so forth, is Watergate‐related in any resinct. But we are not talking about a great deal of material. Q. When’ should this material be made fully public? You said not at this time. A. Well, first of all we have to get the decision made withregard to this action that We have brought so that I can have the opportunity to obtain the material and to segregate those portions that are private and personal. And, of course, whatever portions that might involve the national security, there has to be a check. I notice, for example with regard to tapes, tliat President Johnson placed a 50‐year limitation, as you probably know, with regard to his tapes. Q. My question is still with Watergate. A. I am not quite through and I have not interrupted counsel n his counsel's questions. And if counsel will show me the same regard I would appreciate it. President Johnson has placed a 50‐Year limitation with regard to any materials that were on tapes and now that he has passed away, of course whether or not members of his family or others may decide to move before that time, to make some of them public remains to be seen. But I think that is too long. In the agreement that have, that I will eventually work out, the letter of intent with the University of Southern California and so forth, I intend to provide for making first, of course, for proper review of the tapes, which can only be undertaken by me and members of my family, because of the private and personal considerations that are there and for making them public as soon as those reviews are completed. Q. Let me ask the question then, Mr. Nixon. Do you have a time period that you expect, within which to make full disclosure of all the Watergate matters? A. No. Q. Do you expect it to be longer than five years? A. I can't tell until I see how big the task is. Q. How long do you expect It will take for you and the members of your family to review all the tapes,’ Mr. Nixon? A. I don't know. But we will do it as expeditiously as possible. President's Responsibility Q. Do you believe that the President has an’ ongoing constitutional responsibility to protect the confidentiality of communications? A. I certainly do. 0. And does that responsibility extend to communications with former Presidents —of former Presidents? A. It always has. Q. And did you not seek to protect that interest when you sought, when you authorized the litigation to prevent the publication of the Pentagon papers? A. Yes, that is correct. I should point out that from a political standpoint, some of the members of my staff totally disagreed. In fact, most of them were against My decision to litigate ‘ on the Pentagon papers matter, because it was no skin off our back. After all, when we came into power there were 300 men being’ killed every ‘day and 550,000 in Vietnam at that time. We were ‘drafting 34,000 a month, and this all reflects on the previous Administration. Well, the way I’ saw it was that far more important than who the Pentagon papers may have reflected on, as to how we got’ in Vietnam and what we had done in Vietnam was the office of the Presidency of the United States, that is why I felt that for the individual who removed the papers, top secret papers, although most of them were not particularly important some were vitally important, should not have been given a badge of honor and the paper that published them should not have received the Pulitzer Prize. A. A very good example of that occurred when during the course of the tortuous proceedings the story appeared in major newspapers. to the effect that in a conversation with Mr. Dean [John W. 3d, Presidential counsel] a taped conversation on Feb. 28th, that he had said, had told me that according to the transcript Judge Sirica was a very, effect, tough judge and that I responded by saying, “He is a God darn wop.” That was not only printed in The New York Times. It was on television and on radio. It was never adequately retracted. What the tape actually was when I listened to it, because I recall, I knew that I had never used that term; I knew I didn't have that opinion. What the tape actually said when he said, “He is a tough judge,” was, “That is the kind I want.” Reason for the System What I believe I testified to, and thiS will save the reporter going back to have to read his notes, was this: That the question which was raised as to’ whether or not the taping system recorded primarily for purposes, of writing my memoirs. I pointed out that President Johnson had mentioned that particular factor in recommending that one be put in. I said as far as I was concerned I considered it important from the standpoint of making the historical record, having in mind also certainly as a subsidiary but not then the most compelling reason the possibility that sometime in the future I might do some writing and that having available the tapes would be helpful in seeing that it was accurate. I pointed out that as far as I was concerned, too, that I was particularly interested in the national security area but I did not limit it to that because there are other areas which I have also indicated, the matter of welfare reform, the desegregation issue, the issues which seemed so miniscule but are so important. Some like abortion, et cetera. All of these, of course, are on tape. Q. If the contents of the recordings made in the White House during your term in office were disclosed, would it have any impact upon your ability to associate with individuals who you had previously associated with? A. Oh, yes. Q. Would you exnlain what impact that would have. A. Well, the discussions that occurred in a President's office. Particularly when the individual who was talking to the President feels that he can talk in confidence, as our affidavit indicates not only free‐wheeling but‐sometimes blunt and sometimes clearly apart from what we would use, we would describe in the narrow way of being personally embarrassing, they would be quite honest in giving their views. For example, this would be particularly the case where an appointment was being made for the judiciary or to the Cabinet or to other top Government positions. Here are all the files, the raw files of the F.B.I. and letters would come in from various individuals. Direct Statements Members of Congress would either come in or write indicating their pros and cons and so forth and so on. And the individuals who Wrote or talked to me, would write and talk to me in a very direct way and say things. And if they became public, it would not only be personally embarrassing to them but more likely would make it impossible for me to have a continuing association with them in the future on the basis as I have had in the past. I don't mean by that that the Presidency in the White House listens to and expresses rather derogatory opinions, about every individual whose name is up, but in order to make the right kind of appointment, for example, you have got to consider where a lawyer is concerned. not only his legal qualifications but his relationships with his family, his personal habits, his reputation in every respect, and all of that of course would be considered before a decision was made. Political Issues The same would be true with regard.’ to some of the very controversial political issues, and I mean personal issues that came in. I am sorry, domestic issues as distinguished from foreign policy issues. Needless to say, foreign policy, the enormous division in the country with regard to the war, all of that, it was bluntly discussed and is well known. But the country also has had very, very strong disagreements with regard to such volatile subjects as busing, desegregation, welfare reform, et cetera. And I have had discussions, for example, with members of Congress, both the House and the Senate, of both parties, some of whom have been my friends going back over 25 years, where they thought they were talking in confidence and where if what they said got out it might not only affect what they would feel is their right to express themselves freely in the future, because every man must live with his public statements. He has great enough difficulty doing that But having to live here with private statements that he thought were off the record would be more difficult. But, insofar as I am concerned, of course, it would have a most devastating effect in terms of many of the individuals who talked to me or wrote to me in confidence and then found their confidence has been destroyed."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editors: Your Aug. 12 editorial advocating that the Federal Government assume an additional 25 per cent of New York's A.F.D.C. and Medicaid costs is politically unrealistic. New York's share of the Federal Ikelfare dollar already exceeds its share of the nation's poor by quite a bit. The discrepancy in the case of Medicaid is even greater: With less than 8 per cent of the country's low‐income population, the state absorbs 20 per cent of Federal Medicaid outlays. Letters to the Editor The rest of the country, as represented in the Congress, is certainly not about to increase its subsidization of New York's high benefit levels and sloppy administration. After all, for nearly a decade welfare reform has been advocated to reduce interstate benefit and eligibility differences, not to underwrite them. The question of political realities also arises in connection with New York's advantage from the “nationalization” of welfare. Like President. Nixon's ill‐fated Family Assistance Plan, the formulas devised in recent years by H.E.W. and the Congress offer a standardized benefit scale far below the New York State level—yet this benefit is supposed to replace not only A.F.D.C. but food stamps and possibly other Federal assistance programs as well. Far from providing “full” Federal funding, a program that carries an acceptable price tag will require heavy supplementary funding by states like New York if present benefit levels are to be sustained. Unless the trade‐offs are carefully calculated, New York might end up a net loser. More probably, the Congressional delegations from the high‐benefit states could prevent enactment of a disadvantageous bill, but does The Times seriously suppose that an advantageous bill can be passed? Of all imaginable means to fiscal relief of New York City, few seem less promising than asking taxpayers from other states to pay a larger share of the costs of a welfare (and Medicaid) operation with such a notorious national reputation. I suggest that The Times concentrate its attention and rhetoric on Albany, and forget about Washington. JANE NEWITT Briarcliff Manor, N. Y., Aug. 12, 1975 To the Editor: I wish to register my shock, indeed outrage, at the immoral comments of the First Lady, Betty Ford, in her CBS television interview. I am ashamed for my country, the President, responsible parents and all who hold the Judeo‐Christian ethic sacred. What kind of hypocrisy was Mrs. Ford foisting on the American public last year as she held the Bible in her husband's oath of office ceremony? She obviously flouts the basic tenets it contains. Our society is ill and troubled for just this reason. So‐called responsible people, in the age‐old rage to be modern, are playing fast and loose with the sanctity of human life (abortion and drugs) and the concepts of chastity and fidelity (premarital sex). A great many Americans are more “old‐fashioned” than she is, and for one object to her using the public platform available to the wife of the President to noise her views. If we so desire, we can get such tripe from the latest pulp novel. Our Constitution proclaims us to be a nation under God, a people bound by His precepts. Mrs. Ford would do well to reflect quietly on the import and weight of those beliefs before holding forth in her next interview. We are surfeited and weary of vociferous liberated women. Have we not the right to expect a more genteel, lofty moral code in the woman who, willingly or not, represents American womanhood? Our long national nightmare is not over. A flout‐morality Watergate canker still exists in high places. Mr. Ford, who “has always told his wife to speak her mind,” is most illadvised and will not get my vote in 1976. SUSAN F. FEELEY Tenafly, N. J., Aug. 12, 1975 To the Editor: It is time to start a “Let's Keep Betty Ford in the White House” campaign. Surely she will do more for womankind than any woman occupant has done within my memory, and she promises more than do any women behind the Presidential hopefuls on the horizon. Why am I a Betty Ford fan? I am certainly not a Republican, much less a conservative. Without Betty Ford “on the ticket,” I would not vote for Gerald Ford, but because he recognizes her right to speak for herself, because he doesn't panic when she makes candid remarks that might among some political or religious conservatives lose votes for him, because he enjoys and appreciates the great privilege and honor of being the President of the United States, and because I have some hope that the Democratic‐Liberal Congress will get together and carry out its elected mission, I'll take Gerald Ford, too, in order to keep Betty Ford. It is a relief, at long last, to find that we have in the White House a couple who understand equality, who are not threatened by each other's independence and personhood and who are able to show to the public that they have respect for each other. I think that sets an excellent example for all of us and is also supportive of marriage as an institution. We may not be ready for a woman President, but the time has come for a woman in the White House who supports and represents the women of the country. If Betty Ford continues to speak out as an independent, liberated woman, and if her husband continues to support her, I predict that Gerald Ford will be a shoo‐in in ‘76, and I hope he will prove to be liberated‐man enough not to mind coming in on apron strings. MILDRED ZIMMERMANN Voorheesville, N.Y., Aug. 13, 1975 Commuters and Taxes To the Editor: In your Aug. 11 editorial on commuter income taxes, Westchester and Long Island sources point out that suburbanites are not iulfilling their obligations to the city that provides their employment. I would like to call to your attention two differences between Westchester/Nassau commuters and their New Jersey/Connecticut brethren. First, though we out‐of‐staters get a break on city taxes, we pay the full rate of the substantially higher New York State taxes. Unlike the Westchester and Nassau folk, however, we are ineligible for most state services. In effect, the state income tax is for us a city income tax. By this definition, I'm sure I pay more personal income taxes to New York City than 99 per cent of the residents or in‐state commuters. If New York City wants more of my money, New York State has plenty of it which should be available. Second, we out‐of‐staters have no vote. We have no control over the tax rates set for us or the ways in which our “contributions” are spent. We can't even participate in as fundamental an electoral decision as the fate of a proposed bond issue. We are represented only to the extent that in‐state groups share our interests, and then certainly not in proportion to our number. In these circumstances, the New Jersey and Connecticut taxpayers have certainly given enough to support New York City. As the municipal union leaders would say, “It's someone else's turn.” F. ALLEN SPOONER Park Ridge, N. J., Aug. 12, 1975. Revenue‐Sharing Shortcut To the Editor: Ever since revenue sharing went into effect I have had basic questions about it: Why should the Federal Government set income taxes so high that $30 billion or $40 billion can be budgeted to return to local communities? It would seem more reasonable and much more direct, as well as less expensive in regard to general overhead, to reduce the Federal income taxes by that amount and let each community care, in its own way, for the financial needs which revenue sharing now underwrites. CAROLINE T. WHITE Philadelphia, Aug. 10, 1975 To Save a TB Hospital To the Editor: For many years tuberculosis had been on the decline in New York City. In 1974, however, new cases of tuberculosis in children under the age of 10 increased by 25 per cent, and tuberculosis plurisy in adults, often a sign of recently acquired tuberculous infection, almost by 40 per cent. In the first four months of 1975, there was a 15 per cent increase in newly reported cases of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is primarily a disease of the poor today and is often associated with alcoholism and narcotic addiction. The only place in the Bronx and one of the very few places in New York City with comprehensive treatment facilities for the indigent tuberculous patient is Van Etten Hospital. It has an in‐patient service backing up the out‐patient chest clinic and the methadone chest clink; it has a special ward and clinic for alcoholic patients, including those who suffer from tuberculosis; it has a day‐care facility which extends medical care for the tuberculous patient into the home by providing delivery of medication, patient transportation and intensive social service. These services save the city thousands of dollars every year because the intensive supervision by the specialized follow‐up clinics permit earlier discharge of patients. The effectiveness of the chest clinics of the Health Department has been decreased in recent years by elimination of social service and by diminishing nursing and medical service. Examination of contacts of tuberculous patients and preventive treatment of contacts have suffered severely from the deterioration of services. If, as planned, Nan Etten Hospital, the only facility offering comprehensive care for the indigent tuberculous patient in an entire borough, is closed, patients will suffer severely. They will have to travel long distances to Manhattan or Queens to seek hospital and ambulatory care. Experience in large cities has shown that patients are reluctant to travel hours to seek care for a chronic condition and frequently do not complete their treatment. To treat a patient far away from his residence and family is poor medical and public‐health practice. We can expect that the already worsening care for patients with tuberculosis will deteriorate further by closing Van Etten Hospital and lead to even greater spread of a disease for which effective treatment could be made available. H. ABELES, M.D. Director, Van Etten Home Care Bronx, Aug. 15, 1975. The Apartheid Backer To the Editor: Anthony Harrigan, author of the Aug. 11 Op‐Ed article “U.S. Interest in Southern Africa,” is described as executive vice president of the United States Industrial Council, a nationwide association of conservative businessmen. An accurate characterization of his position would be cold‐war jingoist and racist. A long‐time friend of white South Africa—he has even lectured at the South African Defense College—. Harrigan is now pushing for a policy that would establish the closest possible military alliance with that regime in an effort to “maintain access to the gold, uranium … and other strategic materials in the area.” Underlying his proposals for a U.S. policy in Southern Africa are a set of assumptions which include the false belief that: (a) The elimination of colonial rule and establishment of independent African states marks a “steady deterioration of the situation in Southern Africa.” (b) It is impossible to have “economic cooperation between Free World countries and African socialist regimes” — and in this connection Zambia is singled out as an example of the kind of country with which the U.S. cannot possibly establish mutually beneficient links. (c) “South Africa is the strong stabilizing force on the African Continent.” For Harrigan, the oppressive, racist nature of the South African regime is irrelevant. He accords South Africa ful membership in the Free World and does not mention apartheid once. Yet it is the incredible maze of racist laws, which transform all blacks into nonpersons, invisible except as labor units to be shunted around like work animals, that is the central pillar of the state in South Africa—and it is the constant struggle of the majority of the people of South Africa against such enslavement that makes the situation so explosive and inherently unstable. If Harrigan had his way, apartheid would last another 1,000 years, but recent history has already shown the unreality of such a vision, both in Africa and elsewhere. It is true that giant corporations often find very profitable homes in environments like Southern Africa; that they will invest massive political and economic capital in seeking to maintain such regimes. But it is surely time to reject the myth that general U.S. interests, the interests of the American people, can only be served by alliance with the reactionary police states of the world.

A Portuguese Crowd Attacks Building Of Pro‐Communist Party in Coast City,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/25/archives/a-portuguese-crowd-attacks-building-of-procommunist-party-in-coast.html,"LEIRIA, Portugal, Monday, Aug. 25 — A furious mob assaulted the headquarters of the pro‐Communist Popular Democratic Movement here shortly before midnight last night, sacked it and burned all the furnishings and documents in a huge bonefire in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral. Troops and firemen arrived too late to halt the attack. The soldiers dispersed the crowd and made a number of arrests. There were shots in the air and at least one person was wounded by gunfire. Several soldiers used their rifles to beat demonstrators and journalists. The attack on the Democratic Movement building came after a charge on the Communist party headquarters here earlier in the evening was repulsed by troops. The Democratic Movement expected trouble when Catholics announced plans to hold a demonstration here yesterday calling for religious freedom. In a statement, the leftist party warned that it would hold the Bishop of Leiria, the provincial Governor and the Armed Forces Movement responsible for any violence. The attack was led by strongly anti‐Communist peasants from the nearby town of Marinha Grande. They smashed their way into the three‐story building and destroyed everything inside, ripping out doors and windows. They threw chairs, tables and archives out into the street where the crowd set fire to them. The mob applauded as the furnishings went up in flames, and there were shouts of “Victory!” Then troops arrived and fired into the air, and the crowd dispersed in panic. Many townspeople expressed disapproval of the violence and blamed “uneducated peasants from outside.” This city is considered liberal politically and voted heavily Socialist in the last elections. The crowd turned its anger against the Popular Democratic Movement after the attempt to storm the Communist party headquarters earlier in the evening was halted. Several hundred people brandishing tree branches marched on the Communist building at the end of a rally and demonstration in which about 7,000 Catholics calling for freedom of religion, education and the press marched through this important commercial center on the Atlantic coast 80 miles north of Lisbon. The Communists took shelter in the garden behind the headquarters and threw hand grenades to frighten the demonstrators. Three truckloads of soldiers took up positions to hold off the demonstrators. The crowd, mostly farmers from the surrounding area, taunted and insulted the soldiers for not letting them attack the Communist headquarters. The major in charge of the troops then ordered his men to fire into the air and throw tear‐gas bombs. Members of the crowd ran across two bridges to the other side of the Liz River, where they regrouped and waited for friends who were expected to arrive from the nearby towns of Batalha and Marinha Grande. More than 50 Communists fled the headquarters and took shelter in a riverside municipal park, protected by the troops. At least two persons were injured in the violence. One man was beaten by the crowd with sticks and another was shot in the hip when he approached a group of Communists guarding one of the bridges leading to the park. The demonstration that preceded the clashes was peaceful. There were hymns and chants and slogans opposing pornography, divorce and abortion."
Study Indicates a Trend to Higher Birth Rate in U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/26/archives/study-indicates-a-trend-to-higher-birth-rate-in-us.html,"BERKELEY, Calif., Aug. 25—The low birth rate in the United States seems to be “bottoming out,” and it looks as if the country is about to experience a “mini” baby boom, according to a team of California demographers. The reason: Many young women who have postponed bearing children are now in their late 20's and early. 30's and if they wish to have two or more children they cannot delay much longer. The evidence suggests that these young women do plan to have families, the demographers say, and within the next few years they will begin “making up” the births they put off In previous years. The most recent figures from California indicate that despite adverse economic conditions the birth rate for women of child‐bearing age rose 2.3 per cent in 1974. This means 311,650 babies were born in California in 1974 while 279,834 were born in 1973—a difference of almost 14,000 babies. Published in Science The findings come from June Sklar of the University of California's International Population and Urban Research Group in Berkeley and Beth Berkov of the California State Department of Health. Their report, entitled “The American Birth Rate: Evidence of a Coming Rise,” appears in the August 29 issue of the journal Science. Noting the birth rate in California last year, Dr. Sklar and Mrs. Berkov asked, “Does this rise signal the start of a trend? Or is it a temporary reversal such as occurred in 1969 and 1970?” They wrote that recent California statistics suggest “that the decline in the nation's birth rate is coming to a halt and that an upturn is in the making.” In 1973, the latest year for which nationwide data are available, the country's fertility rate hit the lowest point ever recorded for it—,69.2 live births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44—the demographers said. A Risky Business The decline has been traced to several social factors, they said, including a declining marriage rate among persons aged 15 to 24, a rise in the proportion of women whose marriages were disrupted, a shift towards smaller families, a change in timing and spacing of births and the legalization of abortions. Mrs. Berkov and Dr. Sklar state in their paper that “forecasting the American birth rate is a precarious undertaking.” “This is especially true,” they said, “when the nation is faced with social, economic and political uncertainties, and when significant changes apparently are occurring in sexual atti tudes and behavior, women's roles, and the family.” Given some current attitudes that question marriage and the rearing of a family, they said, it is tempting to assume that birth rates will remain low. But attitudes change, they noted, and “in our view there are certain demographic realities that are providing a stimulus for a renewed increase in birth rates.” They gave the following reasons for interpreting the latest California figures as part of a reversing pattern: ¶The 1974 increase occurred in the face of high rates of legalized abortion. ¶The increase occurred even though the economic outlook in the period affecting 1974 births was markedly worse than in 1969 and 1970. ¶It occurred even though there had been no increase in the marriage rate. (Such increases temporarily pushed up the birth rates in 1969 and 1970.) ¶By 1974 the proportion of childless married women had reached very high levels. Almost one–third of all women under the age of 30 who had ever been married had not yet borne any children. In 1970 the proportion was one– fourth and in 1960 it was one– fifth. 25‐to‐34 Age Group The demographers argue that it is not likely that such large numbers of married women will remain childless. They base this outlook on the results of recent surveys that document the aversion of most Americans to childlessness and even to the one‐child family. This means, the researchers said, that if many childless women between the ages of 25 and 34 are to have the number of children they wish, they must start soon. The figures cited in the study support this view. The largest increases in the birth rate of married women in California last year occurred among women in the 25 to 34 age group, the demographers said. It appears as if women are indeed making up the births they postponed. Recent figures from New York, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon support this trend, the researchers said. Other findings from their, study included the following: ¶Out‐of‐wedlock child rearing will continue at relatively, high levels in the next few years. The greatest increase comes from teen‐agers, who despite the increasing availability of contraceptive devices and legal abortion appear to choose unwed motherhood. ¶For the country as a whole, legalized abortion accounted for about one–fifth of the decline in births to married women."
Dissension Among Feminists: The Rift Widens,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/29/archives/dissension-among-feminists-the-rift-widens.html,"For the last several months, much of the feminist movement has been shaken by dissension. There have been debates over ideological questions, with some women declaring that the movement has taken too liberal and reformist a direction, losing sight of its radical origins. There have been personality clashes, with some quarters asserting that “media stars” have stolen the movement from those who spearheaded feminism. And there have been accusations and counteraccusations that Government agents or agitators from rival groups have infiltrated the movement in order to disrupt and destroy it. In one manifestation of the splits, Gloria Steinem, who has been under attack by a group of radical feminists charging that she is part of a Central Intelligence Agency strategy to undermine the women's movement, has issued a long statement calling the charges “fantastic” and a “McCarthite” attempt to destroy the progress of feminism. Feminists who have supported Miss Steinem endorsed the response, expressing the hope that it would end the controversy, and her detractors criticized it as inadequate, accusing Miss Steinem of insulting the movement by dismissing the charges as absurd. A longstanding dispute between Miss Steinem and Betty Freidan, who helped launch the women's movement, has recently flared again. A debate over Jane Alpert, a convicted bombing conspirator who surrendered last winter after nearly five years underground, has split feminists into two camps. There has also been much argument over whether women should go to jail rather than cooperate with law enforcement authorities or grand juries investigating the harboring of radical fugitives. NOW Split Averted A split in the National Organization for Women over whether the organization's politics were radical enough was narrowly averted. And a rift among the staff of Ms. magazine developed over whether Miss Steinem, one of its co‐founders, should answer or ignore the charges of C.I.A. involvement. Ironically, in the midst of the C.I.A. controversy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation designated Miss Steinem a security risk. Considering Miss Steinem for a consulting position on its program of sex‐discrimination legisla‐. tion, the Justice Department's civil rights division asked the F.B.I. to conduct a securityclearance check. The F.B.I. concluded that it would be inadvisable to hire her because of what it called her leftist associations. Despite all of this, Blanche Boyd, a co‐founder of a new feminist institute called Sagaris, called the movement's troubles nothing new “Like in any left movement, there have always been differences, it's just more visible and destructive this time.” Protest Walkout Some of these festering differences came to a head last week at Sagaris, which is situated in the tiny upstate Vermont village of Lyndonville. The school which brought in faculty and students for the summer from all over the country, had become, when it was well into its first session in July, one of the leading feminist events of the year. By the time it limped to a close last week, it had become a kind of psychodrama for the movement's About a third of its students and faculty, led by the feminist writer Ti‐Grace Atkinson, marched out of the mountaintop headquarters in protest against the institute's funding for the August session which came from the Ms. Foundation. The walkouts formed an alternative conference down in the valley. Many of the Sagaris supporters felt that although the group disagreed about accepting the Ms. money before Miss Steinem had answered the C.I.A. charges, the differences had been exploited and intensified by two or three women who seemed to act like “agent provocateurs.” One feminist pointed out that the Rockefeller report on C.I.A. domestic activities listed the “women's liberation movement” as a target of concern of the agency's “operation chaos” project. The women under suspicion were finally confronted and accused of acting destructively, of spreading misinformation, of manipulating people, and of slipping silently back and forth between the two sides. They denied being agents, Government or otherwise. “I'm worried that there are elements working out of our control and I'm afraid Gloria's statement, although it has answered a lot of questions, will not end all this,” said Barbara Seamen, a writer on women's health matters who left Sagaris early because of the growing rancor. “The movement is being ravaged, and no one is getting any work done. It is clear to me that there are agents working to bust us up.” Miss Steinem did not attend the school, and her statement came during the final days of Sagaris, too late to heal divisions there, but in time to be read anxiously elsewhere in the feminist community, where the charges leveled against her have been the topic of spirited debate for months. In 1967, Miss Steinem disclosed that she worked for a C.I.A.‐supported foundation, the International Research Service, that sent students to Communist‐sponsored international youth festivals in 1959 and 1962. She said then that she saw nothing wrong with her job, since the agency had no influence on policy decisions and that it showed that there were liberals in government. Last May, however, a handful of women who said they were members of Redstockings, one of the first radical women's organizations formed in the late sixties and later disbanded, distributed a 16‐page tabloid‐style statement labeled a “press release” and devoted to presenting evidence purporting to indicate Miss Steinem was involved in a C.I.A. plot to subvert the radical wing of the movement with the reformist politics of Ms. magazine. Only four members of the reconstituted Redstockings, which calls for a new radical offensive to deliver the movement back to its militant originators, have been identified and it is not known what following they have. Miss Steinem at first tried to ignore the Redstockings charges, privately calling them too fantastic to warrant a response, but pressure mounted for her to reply. Concedes Making Mistake In her six‐page response, Miss Steinem concedes for the first time that her association with the International Research Service was “a mistake . . . but I didn't realize it at the time.” But she turns the accusation around on Redstockings, hinting that their motivation and origin—only one of four is an original Redstockings founder—are suspicious. She offers answers to the charge that she covered up and misrepresented her C.I.A. association. The Redstockings presented photographed copies of pages in the 1968–1969 edition of “Who's Who in America” that listed Miss Steinem as a member of the board of directors of the International Research Service at the time she entered the women's movement. Miss Steinem said that “Who's Who” had made an error—one of the many, she said, that have appeared in various biographies of her—and that her involvement with the International Research Service anded in 1962. The Redstockings statement contains sample pages from a Research Service pamphlet on the 1959 Vienna Youth Festival that gives what Redstockings term “political dossiers” on the Communist festival organizers. Miss Steinem replies that these dossiers were simply biographies in an information pamphlet that was made available in libraries. Miss Steinem said in her reply, “Both the [Redstockings] release and McCarthyite diatribes attempt to disqualify people and groups working for political change by simply declaring arbitrarily that they are connected to whatever the most fearful, disreputable label of the day may be . . . in this case . . . a ‘C.I.A. strategy.’” Support From Feminists Miss Steinem's statement was accompanied by letters of support from such prominent feminists as Rita Mae Brown, Caroline Bird and Robin Morgan, the lastnamed an original Redstockings member who said the “release” had besmirched the group's good name and was a sinister attempt to divert the women's movement. Elsewhere, however, there were other opinions. Betty Friedan, an ally turned antagonist, still had questions about Miss Steinem's actions. “By dismissing the Redstockings charges as ‘McCarthyism,’ I don't think she shows respect for the women's movement,” said Mrs. Freidan. “She doesn't answer the charges sufficiently and it's dangerous to dismiss real evidence of infiltration. “We are in a period where there are forces massing to undermine the Equal Rights Amendment, the Supreme Court abortion ruling, and sex‐discrimination legislation. I feel a sense of urgency here.” Ellen Willis, the rock music critic for The New Yorker and a former contributing editor of Ms. magazine who recently resigned because of the magazine's politics, said Miss Steinem's statement did not face up to the underlying political differences taking shape in the movement. “I feel Ms. is ideologically going the wrong way,” she said. “It's promoting a ‘mushy sisterhood’ and tells its readers to work within the system for individual liberation rather than for economic radicalism and integration of feminism with the revolutionary left.” (The ideological attack on Ms. is but one of its and Miss Steinem's problems.) (Elizabeth Forsling Harris has filed suit against Ms., Miss Steinem, and another founder, Patricia Carbine, asserting that they fraudulently misrepresented the value of Ms. stock and induced her to sell her shares one year after she had conceived the idea of the magazine and spent her own time and money trying to get it off the ground.) The charge has been denied by Ms. magazine. Defends One Accuser Miss Willis, who was an original Redstockings member who later dropped out of the group, said that she knew and respected one of the authors of the statement, Kathie Sarachild, and felt that it had aired some basic issues. “Part of the controversy here involves Jane Alpert and her cooperation with the authorities and her rejection of the left,” said Miss Willis. “All of it is tied up together and it boils down to the question of—‘Are you a radical or are you not a radical, and what do you think of the male left?’” The debate around Jane Alpert, who publicly denounced what she called the male chauvinism of the Weather Underground and the Melville bombing conspiracy, which she participated in, has been bitter. Although Miss Alpert, now serving a 27‐month jail sentence, said she had told authorities only about her own travels and nothing that would lead to the arrest of other radical fugitives, her alleged co‐conspirator, Patricia Swinton, was picked up several months after Miss Alpert's surrender. Her critics say she turned informer under the guise of becoming an anti‐Marxist feminist. Her supporters say she did not inform and point to a motion filed in May by the Government saying it doubted Miss Alpert's candor when she told authorities that Patricia Swinton was not involved in the conspiracy and calling for a hearing to force her to testify against Miss Swinton or face contempt charges. The Swinton‐Alpert debate, like other areas of feminist controversy, seems unlikely to abate, for the issues are deep and unresolved. “The age when sisterhood alone was powerful has passed,” said Joan Peters, one of the founders of Sagaris. “What we're seeing in one sense is a kind of primeval rage that comes from centuries of oppression. We are engaging in ‘horizontal hostility’ — acting out our anger among each other, getting mad at the people it's safest to get mad at. “One thing is certain, though. When it's all played out, we'll be stronger. We're more than 50 per cent of thepopulation. These things might slow us down, but they'll never kill us.”"

The suspect escaped on Aug. 5 from the Hernando County Courthouse, Brooksville, Fla. 5 in Family Die in House Fire Upstate A young couple and their three children died in a fire that swept through their wooden ranch‐style house in the northeastern New York village of Hudson Falls. The victims were identified as Claude Mead, 25 years old; his wife, Joanne, 24, and their children, Daniel, 6; Thomas, 3, and Scott, 6 months. Michael Mead, 20, a brother of Claude, was hospitalized in nearby Glens Falls for shock. 3 Shot in Backyard Ball Game Two youths and an adult were shot during a backyard basketball game at 1990 Lexington Avenue at 121st Street, in East Harlem. The shots were believed to have been fired by a youth, possibly a gang member, who escaped. George Santana, 16 years old, of 2034 Lexington Avenue, suffered a chest wound; a 15‐year‐old boy, whose identity was withheld, was shot in the left side, and Charles Robertson, 25, of 1990 Lexington Avenue, was shot in the left leg. Railroad Fire Under Control Eleven Ulster County fire companies brought a spectacular fire under control after it erupted from a railroad tank car carrying compressed gas in the community of Mount Marion, near Kingston, N. Y. The tank car was one of 15 cars of a 135‐car train that had been derailed. The police said that the freight train, carrying mostly grocery items, had been heading from Weehawken, N. J., to Selkirk, near Albany. No injuries were reported. Bergmans Told to Visit Jersey Jury Irving Lang, an acting justice of the State Supreme Court, directed Bernard Bergman and his son, Stanley, to appear before a state grand jury in New Jersey that is investigating Medicaid fraud and abuse in the nursing‐home industry. The Bergmans had sought to quash a subpoena seeking all records and documents concerning three New Jersey nursing homes. The records were kept in Mr. Bergman's Manhattan office. Connecticut Weighs Medicaid Curb Connecticut's Social Services Commissioner, Edward Maher, said he planned to meet with Federal officials next week to determine whether the state might properly withhold Medicaid funds from welfare clients seeking abortions. Under a plan of Gov. Ella T. Grasso, Medicaid payments would be refused for abortions unless the woman's life was endangered by the pregnancy. State Bars George Washington Statue A statue of George Washington cannot be placed in a downtown Buffalo park as a Bicentennial project, according to a ruling of the State Department of Transportation. The agency, which controls the Church Street Park because it was built in connection with a state arterial highway, agreed with a Chamber of Commerce committee that the statue would conflict with the park's landscape design. The Erie County Masonic Foundation was to erect the bronze statue. From the Police Blotter: Bruce Brabbam, 21 years old of 219‐20 143d Street, Rosedale, Queens, being trained as a teller by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company branch at 855 Avenue of the Americas, at 30th Street, was arrested with two alleged accomplices on a charge of stealing $300 from the branch. ¶In two unrelated incidents, Steven Lofgren, 25, of 43‐17 48th Street, Long Island City, Queens, was arrested on a charge of robbing a Flushing, Queens, branch of the First National City Bank of $13,000; and Peter Quinn, 24, of 35–58 65th Street, Woodside, was arrested on a charge of stealing $4,093 from a Long Island City branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank."
Wit of Glaser Adds Snap To Graphic‐Design Show,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/30/archives/wit-of-glaser-adds-snap-to-graphicdesign-show.html,"Milton Glaser is a witty fellow. This in itself would not qualify him for an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, but it adds a most welcome fizz and snap to the show of his graphic designs — posters, record sleeves, stationery, book jackets and many other things besides—that is on now at the Modern Museum and will be there through Sept. 14. Graphic design is often thought of as second‐class art. And graphic designers, by a logical extension of that concept, are often thought of as second‐class artists. But it is by way of graphic design that the energies of art make their impact in everyday life. If people are amused, provoked and enlivened by graphic design, they are in touch at one remove with the exhilarations of high art. They may never get to the original source, but if they have had a memorable moment with one aspect or another of graphic design they are by that much more ready to try. The Modern Museum has always known this. It has many great paintings from the nineteen‐twenties, for instance, but it also has graphic designs by Herbert Bayer, A. M. Cassandre and others, in which the spirit of the age speaks out no less clearly. This is the context in which Mr. Glaser's exhibition should be looked at. • It is easier to do this because much of Mr. Glaser's work has already moved into history. Its general attitude could be defined as eclectic, defocused, and affluenceoriented. It is eclectic, because Mr. Glaser comes of a generation that felt free to pick whatever it pleased from the iconography of the past. It is defocused, because Mr. Glaser does not wish to impose any one particular style, let alone to set up a dictatorship of taste. And it is affluence‐oriented, because most of the work posits a society in which art schools breed like rabbits, advertisers can afford the softest of sells, and even the concept of the poison pen is matter for a joke. “Peace Works” (1972) is an image that contradicts all this, so deftly does Mr. Glaser metamorphose hand into dove. But most of the work in the show has to do with satisfactions of one kind or another; and we may remember, as we count up the varieties of harmless pleasure Mr. Glaser sets before us, that a song called “Satisfaction” was one of the key products of the period in question. Mr. Glaser cart be wonderfully oblique. There is, for instance, a poster of his for that most racy of typewriters, the Olivetti Valentine. Does he push the most evident feature of that machine—the brilliant scarlet of cover and typewriter alike? He does not. He takes a large and melancholic dog from old master painting and makes it the most important element in the image. You have to look to find the typewriter at all, and when you do find it you would never know that it comes in red. • He can also be very direct. When he shows us a huge treble clef that turns into a bunbh of flowers, we can all get the message that the Ambler Music Festival is the place to have a good time. We are all sold on coffee by the time that (in “Grounds for Delight”) he has shown us not only a king‐size pot and a cup of steaming coffee, but also a group of happy people who have actually gotten into the cup and are dancing around in the enticing liquid. The “Baked Potato” record sleeve somehow suggests that a baked potato is not only one of the great all‐time standard foods but also (quite a feat, this) a locus of visual excitement. The ingredient of play comes out strongly. The work could not be more professional, and its borrowings from the art of all places and times are carried off with an insolent vivacity that at once communicates itself to the observer. The images may be presumed to have worked, from the clients' point of view, since Mr. Glaser is still very much in business. But they also work as a superior distraction, and one that will appeal especially to those who know the Modern Museum well. (It takes a particular kind of gall, for example, to put Mr. Glaser's “Big Nudes” poster on walls long sacred to Matisse.) • Below stairs in the Auditorium Gallery the Modern has on view through Oct. 30 a series of seven hour‐long programs of documentary videotapes. Each day has its own program and the hours are 11 A.M. to 2 P.M., except on Sundays, when they are 12 to 2 P.M. The programs relate primarily to video in its less freaky aspects. Many of them have to do with individuals or with whole societies that in one way or another have been done down or disinherited: Some of these make grim viewing — above all, perhaps, the account of an enforced abortion in Cara DeVito's “Always Love Your Man”—but they also change the pace of museum life in ways that are wholly salutary."
Illinois Abortion Bill Vetoed,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/31/archives/illinois-abortion-bill-vetoed.html,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Aug. 30 (UPI)—An abortion bill requiring parental consent or a husband's approval before an abortion is performed has been vetoed by Gov. Daniel Walker. The Governor said yesterday he was forced to veto the measure because there would have been two overlapping abortion laws in Illinois if he had signed it."
And then there's Mary Cassatt—she must not be left out,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/31/archives/and-then-theres-mary-cassatt-she-must-not-be-left-out.html,"One of the best ways to get run out of town is to suggest to admirers of Mary Cassatt that she was a good minor artist to whom quite enough homage has lately been paid. Mary Cassatt By Nancy Hale. Illustrated, 300 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $10. Consider the evidence, however. Mary Cassatt's graphic work was catalogued in detail by Adelyn Breeskin in 1948, with 232 illustrations. In 1966 there appeared two books on her: a biography by Frederick A. Sweet, which is really very good indeed, and a shorter study by Julia M. H. Carson, which is intelligent, informed, un‐gushy and moves at a commendable clip. In 1970 Miss Breeskin published a catalogue raisonné of Mary Cassatt's paintings, drawings, pastels and watercolors. Books by Ellen Wilson (1971) and E. John Bullard (1972) should also be noted. Taken together, these publications tell us what we need to know about Mary Cassatt, and they set it out in orderly and disciplined style. Hers was in many respects a most enviable life. Contrary to legend, she was not born to great riches. Nor was she in any way an outstandingly gifted beginner. She was 30 and more before she really got going as a painter; but it had always been her ambition to achieve artistic, moral, social and financial independence by her own exertions alone, and by the time she was forty‐eight, in 1892, she had done it. With money earned from the sale of her work she had bought the Chateau de Beaufresne, a large country house in a part of France that she had always liked, and she lived out the rest of her life there. Her position in France in 1892 was really quite remarkable. Sire had come from nowhere, in French terms, to become a person to be reckoned with among the most discriminating of French judges of painting. Emile Zola and J.‐K. Huysmans doubled as art critics when they were not writing novels, and both of them had singled her out. When Stdphane Mallarrné was asked to name the major Impressionist painters he brought out the obvious French names and went on to say, “And then there's Miss Cassatt. She must not be left out.” She was a close friend of Degas. Camille Pissarro could not speak too highly of her technical skill in printmaking. Gauguin reputedly compared her to Berthe Morisot and said, “Miss Cassatt has just as much charm, but she has more strength.” Accolades of this sort are not won easily in France, and Miss Cassatt won them quite straightforwardly, without ever pushing herself forward. Jean Renoir remembers that “she even carried her easel like a man”; and when she steeled herself to go down into the marketplace and push and shove with the others she could be very effective. “It was with a kind of frenzy,” Ambroise Vollard wrote, “that that generous Mary Cassett labored for the success of her comrades: Monet, Cdzanne, Pissarro, Sisley and the rest. But where her own painting was concerned she would never raise a finger” Vollard was the foremost dealer of his day, and he knew what he was talking about. Every New Yorker is indebted to Mary Cassatt not only for her own work but for the primordial role which she played in the formation of the Havemeyer Collection. If she had not given her time and her knowledge so freely—and with no thought of the percentages which would now be normal practice—the rooms devoted to French painting at the Metropolitan Museum would now look very different. The best was none too good for her; directly or by implication she formed the taste of an entire generation. Mary Cassatt lived to be 81, but for the tatter part of her life she was largely or entirely blind. Her effective career as an artist of consequence was quite short, therefore; but her effective career as a “character”—as someone who had a mind of her own and used it—was very long indeed. It is amply documented, moreover. The Cassatts were a large, active, scattered family who kept the mails busy at all times of the year; and we have no difficulty in seeing what the English writer Vernon Lee meant when she wrote to a friend in 1895 that “Miss Cassatt is very nice, simple, an odd mixture of a self‐recognizing artist, with passionate appreciation in literature, and the almost childish garrulous American provincial.” Yet the record, though bulky, is curiously opaque. Reading the books I have listed above, and reading Nancy Hale's new biography, we soon become conscious that the same standard materials are being drawn on again and again. They are all authentic: Mrs. Havemeyer's privately printed memoirs, the letters of Degas, the letters of Camille Pissarro, the letters of Berthe Morisot, Ambroise Vollard's memoirs, John Rewald's “History of Impressionism.” But there is a limit to the number of ways in which this Patchwork can be reassembled; and the argument for a new full ength book on Mary Cassatt must be based on the extent to which it has new things to say either about Miss Cassatt herself or about her work—and, more especially, about the period of her maximum achievement. Neither of these is an easy subject. Nancy Hale goes about them with a gabby assurance which does not quite carry conviction either in the private or in the professional context. Undeniably she has filled out the family background in ways not attempted before; the very considerable length of her book is based not so much, however, on an abundance of new material as on a readiness to digress, to mark time with broad splashes of local color, and to proffer her own particular brand of folk‐wisdom at points in the narrative at which absolutely nothing is known for certain and speculafion can run free. Quite often we switch from the life of Miss Cassatt to the life of Miss Hale, with results which have their own fascination but do not contribute to the main subject in hand. The fact that Miss Hale comes of a family of painters and has published a number of novels must be said to have given her delusions of competence both as to the nature of art and as to the motivation of complex and altogether exceptional human beings: whence many a passage of unintended comedy. It would not necessarily matter, for instance, that Miss Hale gets names wrong. If Agnes and Elisabeth Mongan are listed in the acknowledgments as the Misses Mangan, those two formidable ladies will undoubtedly live it down. If Leon Bonnat turns up as both Binnat and Bonnat in both text and index, that too could be a venial slip. If the Bizet whom Miss Hale mentions as one of Degas's young painter‐contemporaries in Rome was not a painter at all but the future composer of “Carmen,” that also can be classed as a peripheral error. If someone points out that it was not “words” but vowels which had specific color‐associations for Arthur Rimbaud, that again would not invalidate Miss Hale's account of Mary Cassatt's career. A tremor may shake the informed reader, on the other hand, when Miss Hale consistently refers to Manet's “Olympia,” one of the most famous of all 19th‐century paintings, as “Olympe.” The relationship between Degas and Mary Cassatt is one which quite rightly preoccupies Miss Hale, and she makes excellent use of that little masterpiece of editing and translating, Mina Curtiss's version of Daniel Halévy's “My Friend Degas.” But given the consummate wryness and the total privacy of Degas's attitudes in such matters we may well wonder whether Miss Hale adds to our understanding of them when she tells us that “Being who they were, artists, there was sex in everything they did; sex is in everything babies do, too.” Who would not give a silver dollar to hear Degas's comments on that? Miss Hale casts her net very wide, and her net has a thin mesh. The reader can therefore count on finding much curious information in her book. Many things remain unresolved in Mary Cassatt's private history: not least the repeated accidents which overcame this excellent horsewoman at a critical moment in her life, and the enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution which went in tandem with her friendship with Marcel Cachin, leader for many years of the French Communist party. Miss Cassatt's was a strange, violent, uncompromising nature—“Mary fumed” is one of Miss Hale's favorite interpolations—and one can never learn too much about it; we must also applaud Miss Hale for her pertinacity in tracking down the irreplaceable old people who are (or were) still around to say how Mary Cassatt seemed to them when they knew her. Miss Hale has no time for art critics and art historians, though she is ?? straightforward a character not to acknowledge their help. Any art historian who reads this book is entitled to think that Miss Hale sometimes lashes out with an unfounded self‐satisfaction. We read for instance of Claude Monet that “angel in art and devil in sex, he exploited his lovely model, later his wife, for years: sleeping with her, impregnating her, exacting abortions of her, from the time she was eighteen till she died at thirty, exhausted and no longer beautiful.” Madame Monet had precisely two pregnancies during the 12 years in question. Talk of “exacting abortions” is pure speculation. Madame Monet died of cancer of the uterus which had spread to her digestive and urinary apparatus. Monet worked like a dog to feed and house his family during his wife's lifetime. If the known facts make him “a devil in sex,” few among us would not sport horns and a tail. This is not the way that very great human beings should be written about; and it points up the fact that in the present state of the Cassatt literature. and of the literature of Impressionism in general, this book should not be taken too seriously. ■"
Increasing Number of Women Are Seeking Help at Brooklyn Infertility Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/31/archives/increasing-number-of-women-are-seeking-help-at-brooklyn-infertility.html,"With adoptions becoming scarcer because of relaxed abortion laws, business has been on the increase at the Downstate Medical center's Infertility Clinic at 455 Lenox Road in Brooklyn. Each year, more than 300 women go to the clinic for help and at least 25 per cent of them eventually become pregnant. Sometimes, the infertility is caused by a correctable problem, such as a blocked fallopian tube or a hormonal condition. But in about 25 per cent of the cases, there is no explanation for the infertility. Physicians at the center estimate that 10 per cent of all marriages are infertile and that the majority of these cases are the result of hormonal‐related disorders. Hormonal Injections Dr. James R. Jones, director of Downstate's endocrinology section, said that in many cases these disorders could be successfully treated by injecting the woman with hormones at various times during her menstrual cycle. Dr. Jones warned, however, that this treatment could be both expensive and inconvenient, sometimes requiring daily visits to the hospital. “It requires diligence,” Dr. Jones said. “The patient must be sufficiently motivated to see it through.” Patients with ailments that are nonhormonal in origin are treated by the clinic's director, Dr. Alvin M. Siegler. The treatment for these disorders may be surgical or medical, depending on the problem. Since fewer children are available for adoption these days, couples are becoming more eager to have children of their own. “Some people come to me and say, ‘Doctor, I'm desperate. I'll do anything to have a baby,’ ” said Dr. Siegler. He warned couples to beware of physicians and friends who prescribe such unscientific cures as a change of scenery. “There's a great deal of mythology regarding infertil ity,” he said. “Doctors who tell patients to go to Florida and take a vacation are doing a disservice to their patients.” Couples interested in visiting the clinic should call Downstate for an appointment. Each clinic visit costs from $2 to $35, depending on the couple's ability to pay. Dr. Siegler said that most patients required about six visits to the clinic. Comparable services from a private physician could run as high as $250, he said. Dr. Siegler urged couples who wanted more information or a list of reliable doctors to write the American Fertility Society, 1608 13th Avenue South, Birmingham, Ala. 35205."
The Forgotten Civilities,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/05/archives/the-forgotten-civilities.html,"If you watch the news on television these days, you can hardly avoid the feeling that the United States is a nation of selfish factions, lobbies and squabbling tribes that have lost their concern for the national interest and even abandoned the tradition of public civility. It is not quite that way, but that is often how it looks. The financial crisis in New York City, the teachers' strikes in many parts of the country, the wildcat strikes in the coal mines, the public demonstrations against busing in Kentucky and abortion in Massachusetts—all this and much more, day after day, creates the impression on the TV screens that we have lost our sense of the common good and are breaking down into factional, class, religious and racial strife. Two facts tend to distort the picture. First, the economic recession and the inflation have obviously created genuine grievances and inequalities and heightened tensions all over the country. And second, television has adopted the old newspaper technique of concentrating on the news of conflict, and dramatizing this conflict with vivid pictures that go into almost every home in the nation. Yet, we will probably misunderstand the discontent troubling the nation if we blame it on the temporary struggles of inflation or on the tendency of television and the press to emphasize the news of conflict. The problem is much deeper than this. The news is the atmosphere of what we see and hear and almost breathe, and it is often excessively polluted and depressing, but it is still an important part of the truth. And the truth is plain for everybody to see: There is a rise of factionalism in America, something beyond the old battles beween management and labor, a feeling even among teachers, policemen, firefighters and other “public servants” that they can protect their own interests only by fighting the public they are supposed to serve. After a generation of cold war between the Communists and the nonCommunist nations, which began to threaten the security and even the existence of both, it was proclaimed from all the major capitals of the world that we were entering a period of “negotiation rather than confrontation,” and that the growing “interdependence” of the nations required at least a reduction of tensions. Something of this same spirit of compromise, if not of reconciliation, prevail in the United States after the savage insistence on “unnegotiablo demands” during the 1960's; but with the rise of inflation and unemployment, the tensions are soaring again, and we seem to hav,e no larger vision of the national or common interest to fall back on. The specific issues in dispute in Washington and in New York are clearly complicated and maybe even intractable, but they have come to point now where they threaten the rational continuity of community and even national policy. In civilized societies, where there is such a “clear and present danger,” private and factional interests give way, at least temporarily, to the general interest, but this is not what is happening in America at the present time. For there is apparently no generally accepted “public philosophy,” no common conviction of what is right or wrong or fair, and no definition by the national leaders of either party, or even by the leaders of the churches, the universities, or the press, that will clarify the problem, override the factional interests and unite the nation. This is not, of course, a new problem. It has tormented thoughtful men and women for ages, for it involves the fundamental question of whether civilized people can accept the disciplines essential to the effective operation of a free society, and can agree on the compromises necessary for sensible community and national life. Long ago, Walter Lippmann wrote: “The tragic ordeal through which the Western world is passing was prepared in the long period of easy liberty during which men forgot the elementary truths of human existence. They forgot that their freedom was achieved by heroic sacrifice; they became so accustomed to freedom that they thought it was as normal as the air they breathe. . . . They forgot that their rights were founded on their duties and they thought that to get while the getting was good, whether by private smartness or by collective pressure, was a normal and natural thing to do . . . . WASHINGTON “They had become too comfortable and too safe and too sophisticated to believe the first things and the last things which men had been inspired to understand through generations of suffering, and they thought it clever to be cynical and enlightened to be unbelieving, and sensible to be soft. “What is left of our civilization will not be maintained, what has been wrecked will not be restored, by imagining that some new political gadget can be invented, some new political formula improvised which will save it. Our civilization can be maintained and restored only by remembering and rediscovering the truths, and by re‐establishing the habits on which it was founded. There is no use looking into the blank future for some new and fancy revelation of what man needs in order to live.”"

BISHOP DELETES PRIEST'S COLUMN,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/07/archives/bishop-deletes-priests-column-dispute-centers-on-writers-praise-for.html,"SAN DIEGO, Sept. 6 — The Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego this week ordered the suppression of what he called pro‐Communist agitation by a priest who has been advocating “liberation theology” among MexicanAmericans who make up nearly half of the diocese's 540,000 parishioners. Liberation theology, which is challenging established Catholicism in Mexico and other LatinAmerican countries, calls for the overthrow of oppressive political and social structures that deny an equitable sharing of wealth, education and other opportunities for alleviating poverty and achieving human dignity. Recently involved in a widely publicized dispute with Catholic adherents of the women's liberation movement over “free choice” abortion, the conservative 59‐year‐old Bishop, the Most Rev. Leo T. Maher, incurred the anger of many Mexican‐Americans by deleting from the diocesan weekly newspaper a Spanish‐language column written by the Rev. Luis Bernal. Comparison With China The Bishop ordered the social‐political column dropped from the newspaper, The Southern Cross, after first censoring two paragraphs in the Aug. 14 issue in which Father Bernal compared conditions in the United States and China. The censored paragraphs aid: “In China, no one is rich, no one is poor, everybody works and eats and all have everything that is necessary for living a rightful human life.” “The United States is independent but its independence is used by Iarge corporations to amass unjust proportions of wealth.” Bishop Maher found many defenders among members of the Mexican‐American clergy, however. One of those approving his action was the Rev. Manuel Elizalde, assistant pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church in San Ysidro at the Mexican border, who said Father Bernal had given a distorted picture of life in Red China. Father Bernal, who subscribes to the belief of Catholic liberation theologians that the early Christian church and its apostles were communistic, is a 57‐year‐old priest of the Salesian Order who came to this, country three year ago from Colombia to loin the staff of San Diego's Hidalgo Center as a program coordinator. The center is an educational and social project under the Catholic Community Service serving 5,000 Catholics, almost all of whom are MexicanAmerican's. The priest said he was preparing to appeal Bishop Maher's decision to the Peace and Justice Commission of the American Catholic Conference in Washington. The editor of The Southern Cross. Michael Newman, said that, before the censoring incident and after complaints from priests and laymen, it had beery decided to drop the Bernal column and replace it with a Spanish‐language feature devoted to biblical instruction."
"Alice Evans, Who Found Cause Of Undulant Fever in Man, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/07/archives/alice-evans-who-found-cause-of-undulant-fever-in-man-dies.html,"Dr. Alice C. Evans, a pioneer bacteriologist who helped identify raw milk as a common source of undulant fever in man, died Friday of a stroke. She was 94 years old and lived in Goodwin House, a nursing home in Alexandria, Va. At a time when milk was not routinely pasteurized, Dr. Evans discovered the similarity between the bacteria causing contagious abortion in cattle and the organism responsible for undulant fever in man. Her research helped clarify the cause of the disease, also called Malta fever, which for many years had been misdiagnosed as influenza, typhoid fever, tuberculosis and malaria. She was a leading advocate for mandatory pasteurization in the United States. Dr. Evans, who became the first woman president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1928, .contracted the disease herself in 1922 while working as an assistant bacteriologist at the United States Public Health Service's Hygien. ic Laboratory, the forerunner of the National Institutes of Health. “It seems as if those bugs had a special animosity toward me, since I made that discovery,” Dr. Evans once said. Born in Neath, in northern rural Pennsylvania in 1881, Dr. Evans graduated from Cornell in 1909 and received a Master of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1910. Later she received an honorary medical degree from Woman's Medical College in Philadelphia and an honorary doctorate of science from Wilson College and Wisconsin. After studying methods of cheesemaking for the Department of Agriculture at Wis. consin, Dr. Evans moved to Washington in 1913 to become the first woman scientist holding a permanent appointment in the dairy division of the department's Bureau of Animal Industries. It was there that she first studied the bacteria present in the udder of an infected cow."
Scientists Now Can Make Human Genetic Maps,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/14/archives/scientists-now-can-make-human-genetic-maps.html,"The world's oceans have been charted and its continents mapped. Today, a new kind of cartography is in progress, the mapping of the human genes and chromosomes, the microscopic biological structures that are the chemical basis to human identity. The effort is one of the key expressions of a revolution in genetics, and is facilitated by recently perfected tools of biological research and impelled by the hope that the new knowledge new research yields will help in the detection of genetically based disorders. The current estimate is that 200,000 babies are born a year in the United States alone with one or another form of birth defect, some minor, some tragically crippling. At any one time, several million Americans are affected by such conditions. Every year more than one million are hospitalized because of them. Ultimately, understanding and coping with these problems rest with knowledge of the chemistry of genetics—of the master chemical, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which makes up the genes in which the messages of heredity are universally encoded; and of the 23 pairs of tiny tangled threads called chromosomes. Genes are located in the chromosomes; in the chromosomes in every cell is embroidered the full set of instructions that tell body chemistry how to make the individual human being. It was fewer than two decades ago that scientists first learned the correct number of those chromosomes (for years it had been thought that there were 48). It was also only 20 years ago that the full importance of DNA as the hereditary material started to become clear. Only in 1961 was Dr. Marshall Nirenberg, a young scientist from the National Institutes of Health, able to report that the universal code of life through which DNA functions had at last been broken. He had matched the components of DNA with their chemical functions within a cell. The epochal discoveries of the fifties and sixties have led to a growing sophistication in scientists' and doctors' understanding of heredity and its expression. Today more than 100 specific genetic disorders are known, each caused by just one error in the body's chemistry of heredity — a different error for each condition. Because such “errors of nature” leave traces in fetal cells, many of them can be detected long before a baby is mature enough for birth. The genetic component in other disorders that arise from a combination of factors is also better known. At least 40 metabolic mistakes can also now be detected early in a baby's gestation. Among the many genetic errors now detectable early is the rare heredi?? disorder called Tay‐Sachs disease. It can doom a baby to irreversible mental and physical retardation, and death, after a few years of life. The not‐so‐rare blood condition called sickle cell anemia can have enervating effects when a child inherits the trait for it from both parents. Many scientists hope mapping the human chromosomes will help in the detection—and eventually in the repair and treatment—of genetically based diseases. At a recent meeting sponsored by the National Foundation ‐ March of Dimes, specialists in medicine and genetics discussed the developments in laboratory science that have resulted in rapid progress in understanding the genetics of body chemistry Just a few years ago, some of the new techniques would have seemed incredible. Cells of man and mouse can now be fused and grown in the test tube as man‐mouse hybrid cells that carry some of the chromosomes of each species. Batteries of such cells can be prepared, each containing a different selection; the aim is to determine which chromosome is responsible for what chemical process. Sophisticated methods of staining or otherwise marking chromosomes brings out the unique structure of each. Study of the structures allows geneticists and chemists not only to find the specific chromosome, but to locate on it where the gene for a given chemical trait is to be found. In the past several years, such studies have contributed to a growing gene map that now incorporates about 100 specific sites, with one or more on almost every chromosome. Scientists predict that more than 1,000 gene locations will be known within the next decade. Even 1,000 is a small number balanced against the 200,000 or so scientists believe each baby inherits from its two parents. But the catalogue of 1,000 alone is expected to have a major impact on the knowledge of genetic disease. Scientists are also learning that the chemistry of heredity can influence behavior as well as structure and metabolism. How strong that influence can be is epitomized by on rare disorder, based on a single chemical defect, which endows the newborn baby with an irrepressible urge to bite itself or anything else that comes within reach. The behavior pattern, called Lesch‐Nyhan Syndrome after the doctors who discovered it, terrifies the victim as much as it does the family. Recent studies of body chemistry have led doctors to a drug treatment regime that does not eliminate but at least tamps down the symptom. During the past several years scientists have learned too how errors are brought into the code of life by chance, by chemicals, by radiation and by the action of viruses. They have found that the master chemical has several means of self‐repair. They know that each normal living cell carries the genetic instructions for the whole being and that intricate mechanisms keep most of these instructions turned off most of the time. So, for example, a liver cell reproduces only as a liver cell and does not beget a whole new person. Geneticists also realize that, in theory at least, changes in genetic endowment could be made deliberately. The hypothetical procedure has been given the name “genetic engineering.” Conceivably a whole person could be grown from a single cell. The process is called cloning. It has actually been achieved in some lower animals, the frog, for instance, under very special circumstances. Most specialists believe that the engineering or cloning of humans will remain the subject of no more than theoretical discussion for decades, perhaps far longer. But the current revolution in genetics has also raised important issues that confront society today. They include the uses and potential abuses of genetic screening and the combination of prenatal diagnosis with elective abortion to avoid the birth of a defective baby. Many geneticists would like to see the public better informed on these issues because, inevitably, society must make a decision concerning them, even if by default."
3 Democratic Contenders Give Views To a Party Liberal Group in Midwest,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/3-democratic-contenders-give-views-to-a-party-liberal-group-in.html,"MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 14—The first of five regional meetings of Democratic liberals focused somewhat fuzzily this weekend on three candidates for the 1976 Presidential nomination—Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana and former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma. More than 1,000 party activists from 10 Middle Western states gathered to grope together toward consensus on a liberal favorite in next year's primaries. Conceived by Representative Don Fraser of Minnesota, and sponsored nationally by a self‐appointed “Democratic Conference,” the process will be repeated in Springfield, Mass., two weeks hence; in Baltimore and Atlanta on October weekends, and in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 and 9. These are open forums, without scorecards or votes. Five candidates showed up for the opener here; five other Democratic candidates felt free to stay away. Clarification s Sought But the hope of the sponsors is that the conference will accelerate and clarify a selection process that was described yesterday as “haphazard and irrational” by Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, an early dropout from the Democratic Presidential race. And to judge by the lobby conversations in the Leamington Hotel this weekend, the winnowing process is well under way, providing bad news for two candidates—Gov. Milton J. Shapp of Pennsylvania and former Gov Terry Sanford of North Carolina, who spoke here but were widely disparaged as “irrelevant” to the choic of Middle Western liberals. Here in the upper Middle West, activists are mostly white and middle‐class. Teachers appeared to form the largest subgroup at the meeting here, followed by organizers from the more liberal unions—notably automobile and communications workers. Women had the nearest thing to an organized caucus here. And significantly, the activists here include a number of new party “regulars” who were insurgent “reformers” four years ago—like Tom Whitney, the young Democratic chairman from Iowa. Activists have tasted power in this region, and the tone of their Presidential forum suggested that they were pragmatically interested in power, not moral gestures, in the 1976 campaign. The discussion of issues was marked by a sharply declining interest in foreign policy questions that divided the party in the Vietnam era. The theme that won applause was antiinterventionism — best illustrated by Mr. Harris's assertion that the United States could have only “marginal” influence in preventing a war between the Soviet Union and China. Candidates generally regretted—but were not pressed to renounce—increased defense spending, Unemployment was the central domestic issue, but one on which the Democratic candidates all deferred to Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey's pending jobs bill. The discussion of civil rights and minorities related to women, not to blacks and other ethnic groups: Most of the candidates made explicit pledges to put a woman on the Supreme Court and to fight a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion. Crime was barely mentioned. In other social issues liberal positions are no longer hotly controversial. Mr. Sanford, Mr. Udall and Mr. Bayh all pledged to accept a ban against job discrimination based on “sexual preference.” Mr. Udall was widely credted with the most detailed command of a wide range of issues and was applauded for his definition of a sobered but resolute liberalism in what he called the coming era of “thrift, conservation and common sense.” Mr. Harris brought the biggest personal cheering section to the meeting and generated the only excitement at yesterday's session with a booming rendition of his populist attack on “privilege” and economic concentration. Mr. Bayh, on the verge of an official announcement of candidacy, spent most of his allotted 75 minutes reciting his legislative record in the Senate, in a speech that seemed to disappoint many listeners. But he is taken seriously, nonetheless. Among the five candidates who came to Minneapolis, his supporters were pointing out, Mr. Bayh is the only one invited to address the convention in San Francisco of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in October. Jimmy Carter, the former Governor of Georgia, and Sargent Shriver the former Peace Corps director, both Democratic hopefuls who wee not here this weekend, have accepted the Democratic Conference's invitation to speak in Massachusetts on Sept. 27. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington and Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas say scheduling conflicts may keep them from any of the five conference sessions. Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama has indicated no interest in the conference."
Thousands at Maryland Shrine Pay Homage to Mother Seton,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/thousands-at-maryland-shrine-pay-homage-to-mother-seton.html,"EMMITSBURG, Md., Sept. 14 (UPI) — Some 35.000 pilgrims crowded this tiny mountain hamlet today to pay homage and visit the shrine of Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton on the day of her canonization. “She has been deciared a saint.” the Most Rev. Joseph H. Hodges, Bishop of WheelingCharleston, W. Va., said in his homily at the first of six masses honoring the canonization of the first American‐born saint. The Bishop said that he preferred to call her by the title “mother.” “She was the mother of a human family,” he said. “As such she is an example in this day of increased divorces, homeless children and pleasure without children by sterilization, pills and abortion.” A newly composed carillon mass was played during the celebration here. The mass was commissioned by the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's and was composed by Robert Grogan, assistant director of music at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. D.C. The Sisters of Charity order was founded here by Mother Seton in 1809. Thousands of pilgrims today visited the shrine that contains Mother Seton's remains in a bronze coffin, beneath an altar. For the first mass 1,200 people crowded into the marble shrine, some on folding chairs, others standing. Some Schools to Close Today the Roman Catholic parochial schools in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester. Rockland and five adjacent counties that are in the New York Archdiocese will be closed to mark the canonization of Mother Seton. Parochial schools in Brooklyn. Queens and Long Island will be open and will begin a three‐week period of programs dealing with the new saint's life and her work with the poor. In the New York Archdiocese, special services in honorof St. Elizabeth Ann Seton will he held on Sunday, Sept. 28. The Brooklyn Diocese will hold its official observances on Sunday, Oct. 5, at Cathedral College in Douglaston. Yesterday was proclaimed St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Day in New Jersey by Governor Byrne."
Spanish Pilgrims Clash With Vatican Protestors,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/spanish-pilgrims-clash-with-vatican-protestors.html,"ROME, Sept. 14 (UPI)—A group of Spanish pilgrims in Rome for a Holy Year visit clashed outside St. Peter's Square today with demonstrators demanding legalized abortions. The encounter, halted immediately by the police, went unnoticed by the more than 100,000 people attending Pope Paul VI's canonization of Mother Seton. When about 30 women unfurled banner's protesting the Vatican's stand against abortions, the Spanish group, including some priests, tried to pull down the signs. The women said that their demonstration was not aimed at the canonization but at the celebration of International Women's Year."
Is This Big Parking Lot Where Brazil Used to Have the Amazon Region?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/15/archives/is-this-big-parking-lot-where-brazil-used-to-have-the-amazon-region.html,"“The largest of the remaining natural areas left on this planet to succumb to man's insatiable hunger for power and domination, or to civilization's alleged material needs, is the vast Amazon region with its great, yet extremely fragile, rain‐forest ecosystem.” So writes Dr. Harald Sion, the renowned director of the Max Planck Institute of Limnology, in West Germany, who has spent 17 years of his scientific career in the vast world of equatorial jungle and river in Brazil called Amazonia. The factor that is responsible for this irreversible destruction is, of course, the approximately 8,000 miles of highway that the Brazilian Government is pushing through this primeval jungle, from the Atlantic Coast to the Peruvian border. Recently, with Dr. Howard S. Irwin, president of the New York Botanical Garden, I completed an environmental assessment of the effects of Brazil's highway‐building program. So far as we are aware, this is the first study that has tried to measure the impact of the large‐scale construction program on all aspects of the environment: on vegetation and agriculture, on the native Amerindian tribes, on wildlife, fish, disease, industry, and on many other aspects of ecology. We also have put forward a series of recommendations to mitigate the damage before this last of the world's great wilderness areas is totally obliterated, with incalculable consequences for the world balance of nature, by highways being built in the Amazon. The basic theory of Brazil's highway program—that the Amazon jungle can be cleared and turned into productive farmland by hungry colonists from the country's drought‐devastated northeast—rests on a tragically false premise. To be sure, the lowland tropical wet forest manages to be the most productive ecosystem in the world in spite of sterile soils, excessive rainfall and a superabundance of diseasecausing organisms, and pests. This is so because photosynthesis is rapid in the jungle under the propitious combination of light, moisture and temperature that commonly prevail, while elevated carbon‐dioxide concentration speeds photosynthesis in the shade beneath the heavy of leaves. However, the soil that supports this seemingly lush vegetation is singularly deficient in nutrients. Scientific evidence shows that once the jungle land of the Amazon is cleared by burning, it promptly loses fertility. Crop yields have been declining inexorably from cleared forest plots in Amazonia. When the forest canopy is rent by clearing, the decline in soil fertility begins and is accelerated at a rate commensurate with the decrease in the over‐all amount of transpiration. Sunlight piercing the hitherto protected forest floor rapidly dries and oxidizes the litter and humus. Eventually, this stops the normal decay, which reduces the return of nutrients to the soil. Then rain leaches some nutrients from the soil and burning vaporizes others. Furthermore, this clearing and burning practice upsets the natural controls of pests and predators, with obvious implications for farming efforts. Moreover, growth of weeds is stimulated, which further depletes the soil and creates still another obstacle for agriculture. In sum, the popular idea that Amazonian soil is rich and simply needs to be cleared to be exploited is a dangerously erroneous illusion. The native Amerindians evolved farming methods that were adapted specifically to the jungle soil, but the same land cannot support intensive modern commercial agriculture. Indeed, there is much truth to the aphorism that “the tropical wet forest is ecologically a desert covered by trees.” Soil as poor as this obviously offers no solution for Brazil's admittedly serious problems of overpopulation. The one million colonists that the Amazon basin might be able to absorb represent much less than a single year's growth of Brazil's population, which is increasing at the rapid rate of 2.8 per cent each year. Actually, it would make much more ecological sense for Brazil to cultivate her vast uplands or, failing that, to confine Amazonian farm expansion to the periodically flooded land along the rivers of the area and the numerous patches of cultivable soil within the rain forest. The trans‐Amazon highways are also destroying one of the last original human culture groups to be integrated into “civilization,” the Amerindian, whose many distinct tribes have shown an astonishing ability to persist and thrive in the “green hell” of the Amazon over many thousands of years without destroying it. From well over one million individuals and 230 tribal groups in 1900, the Amerindians now are reduced to a meager 50,000 people and only 143 tribes. The highways threaten to cause extermination of entire remaining tribes, mainly by diseases and malnutrition attributable to the influx of highway crews and settlers and the upheaval of an age‐old aboriginal way of life. Such relatively mild ailments of whites as colds, influenza, measles and chicken pox are lethal to the unresistant Amerindian. Pneumonia, tuberculosis and smallpox can become exaggeratedly virulent epidemics among aborigines already enfeebled by malnutrition. Mere fleeting exchanges with ostensibly healthy white laborers can thus annihilate whole villages. An obvious remedial step is for Brazil to comply with the provisions of its own Constitution that guarantee the rights of aborigines. Amerindians are the only societies with the necessary knowledge, expertise and tradition to prosper in the Amazon jungle. Amerindians not only profoundly appreciate what exists, but also understand the intricate and intimate ecological interrelations of the various components of the Amazonian ecosystem far better than do modern ecologists. Amerindians perceive specific relationships that biologists only now are discovering to be accurate. And since the Amazon jungle is the most complex, richest and ‘east‐understood ecosystem in the world, the Amerindians' knowledge of it is of inestimable value. We remain in abject Ignorance of the identity, location and mode of use of myriad Indian drug plants, cures for specific ailments, contraceptives, abortion‐producing agents, arrow poisons and fish‐stunning substances. Only the Amerindian possesses the knowledge to survive in the forest; we only know how to destroy the forest, without even making an attempt to maintain it. The sustainable exploitation of the forest is likely to require or be based on Amerindian knowledge. Against the day when this knowledge can be perceived and analyzed, it must be preserved. At stake in the Amazon is the future of an area of one‐half million square miles, larger than all of Europe and containing one‐third of the world's remaining forest land. Under, Brazil's present development policies, it is being obliterated. The derisory short‐term gains that the developers are seeking surely will he supplanted by desperate long‐term problems, unless remedial action is undertaken soon. Brazil still has time to stop the blind and irreparable destruction of a life‐filled area, unmatched in all the world, with its multitude of irreplaceable forms of plant and animal life, its exquisite biotic communities and the last survivors of a unique and once great human culture. The question that must be faced is: For what is this area being destroyed? There is no satisfying answer to that question—certainly none based on scientific insight and rational thought."
76 LAG IN UPTURN IS CALLED LIKELY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/17/archives/76-lag-in-upturn-is-called-likely-forecast-of-congressional-budget.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16—The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said today that the economic recovery, which now looks very strong, is likely to slow appreciably by the middle of next year, leaving 7 to 7.5 million Americans still unemployed at the end of 1976. The forecast was at variance with those being made by Administration officials, who have avoided making specific statistical predictions about unemployment but increasingly have emphasized their belief that the recovery is stronger than they expect, Excerpts from the economic analysis are on Page 72. [In a speech in New York, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that the double‐digit inflation of summer was “an aberration” and probably not the start of another “major upsurge” in prices. Page 63.] The Congressional Budget Office agreed that the recovery, at the moment, is unexpectedly vigorous. But it recited a number of reasons for doubting that the strength would continue past the early part of 1976. In addition, the study set forth two different situations in which the recovery might “abort,” that is, in which economic growth would stop and a new downturn might even start. Such an abortion of the recovery could occur, the Budget Office said, if increases in food and fuel prices “triggers a new round of wage, cost and price increases.” In addition, the group said, a failure to re‐enact the expired oil price controls, a??l by itself, “would add nearly 2 per cent to the general price level and could retard or even abort recovery.” The Budget Office, a staff group of economists and other experts in government finance, was created earner this year to make studies that would give Congress a better framework of knowledge within which to make its decisions about Government spending programs and tax policies. The office is headed by Alice M. Rivlin, an economist. The current Budget Office report, entitled “Recovery: How Fast and How Far?,” examines the basic economic outlook and was specifically timed to be available before Congress begins its final debates of the year on appropriations and tax measures. In addition, the report has more or less accidentally come at the very time that Congress and the Administration are attempting to work out a compromise plan for reimposing price controls on the oil industry and then getting rid of them in stages, instead of all at once. Even if oil prices are put back under controls, the Budget Office takes a pessimistic view of the outlook for inflation. For example, it predicted continued increases in food prices at a rate of 9 per cent a year, partly because of last, year's disappointing American corn crop, which is lending to higher meat prices, and partly because of the impact on domestic grain prices of the big grain sales this year to the Soviet Union. Unlike the Administration, the Budget Office did not identify high Government spending or large Government deficits as a probable cause of future inflation. In fact, the Budget Office's report said what amounted to the opposite, arguing that it would be 1978, at the earliest, before total Government and private spending in the economy would even aproach the point where they could start to push prices up. Among the reasons that the Budget Office gave for expecting a weakening in the pace of recovery around the middle of next year were the following: ¶The big upturn so far in production, employment and other economic indicators has come from the fact that businesses are no longer liquidating inventories. A “rapid rate of increase in output, stemming from an end to massive inventory liquidation, is not a symptom of underlying strength in the economy but rather a sign of the depth of the recession,” the report said. ¶A strong continued upturn, must rest on an increase in consumer spending, and the prospects for this are doubtful. There has been an increase in consumer saving, because part of the 1975 tax cuts and special Social Security payments have been saved, but wage and salary payments have not kept up with the inflation and the prospect of renewed inflation will dip further into consumer purchasing power. ¶Homebuilding, though up, is up less than in most other recent recovery periods and is threatened by renewed outflows of money from savings and loan associations as other interest rates rise. ¶There are no signs of strength in business investment in new plant and equipment. ¶Increase in Government spending, which contributed to the strength of demand in the economy In the first half or this year, will probably slow down. In keeping with the Budget Office's statutory responsibility, for providing non‐partisan analyses to Congress, the study made no policy recommendations. But it analyzed a number of different policy alternatives to see what their results would be. For example, with an “expansionary” policy that would hold interest rates steady, pile an extra $15‐billion tax reduction on top of continuation into next year of this year's tax cut, and also add $10‐billion to Government spending, unemployment would be about 700,000 lower by the end of next year than it would be under the policies that are now in prospect, the study found. Inflation would be no worse by the end of 1976, but would he about four‐tenths of 1 per cent worse by the end of 1977, under this option, the budget office said. At the other end of the spectrum, a “contractionary” strategy that would allow the tax reductions to expire at the end of 1975 and cut Federal spending by $10‐billion below present targets would increase unemployment by about 600,000 by the end of 1976. There would he no impact on inflation by the end of next year but by the end of 1977, basic price indexes would have risen two‐tenths of 1 per cent less than under present policies. In its examination of the continuation of present policies, the Budget Office assumed that oil prices were put back under controls, that the present Congressional budget target ceiling of $367‐billion in spending was met and that the 1975 tax reductions would be extended into 1976. A change In Just one of these factors—Immediate and permanent decontrol of oil prices—would increase unemployment by about 500,000 persons by the end of next year and increase inflation by 1.5 per cent the report said. Even without permanent, onestep decontrol of oil prices, the Congressional Budget Office predicted an increase in the general price level of 6 to 7.5 per cent in 1976 and 5.5 to 7 per cent in 1977."

Inflation would be no worse by the end of 1976, but would he about four‐tenths of 1 per cent worse by the end of 1977, under this option, the budget office said. At the other end of the spectrum, a “contractionary” strategy that would allow the tax reductions to expire at the end of 1975 and cut Federal spending by $10‐billion below present targets would increase unemployment by about 600,000 by the end of 1976. There would he no impact on inflation by the end of next year but by the end of 1977, basic price indexes would have risen two‐tenths of 1 per cent less than under present policies. In its examination of the continuation of present policies, the Budget Office assumed that oil prices were put back under controls, that the present Congressional budget target ceiling of $367‐billion in spending was met and that the 1975 tax reductions would be extended into 1976. A change in just one of these factors—immediate and permanent decontrol of oil prices—would increase unemployment by about 500,000 persons by the end of next year and Increase inflation by 1,5 per cent, the report said. Even without permanent, one‐step decontrol of oil prices, the Congressional Budget Office predicted an increase in the general price level of 6 to 7.5 per cent in 1976 and 5.5 to 7 per cent in 1977."
Hearing Set on Removal of Devices Keeping Girl in a Coma Alive,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/17/archives/hearing-set-on-removal-of-devices-keeping-girl-in-a-coma-alive.html,"MORRISTOWN, Sept. 16—Superior Court Judge Robert Muir Jr. today set Monday as the tentative starting time for a hearing on whether a court can authorize the withdrawal of life‐sustaining medical processes from a person whose condition is considered hopeless and whose chances of recovery deemed nonexistent. The case, which is attracting wide attention, is expected to go eventually at least to the State Supreme Court and to involve many more legal and medical witnesses than the few who will begin the debate that could become the keystone for a national consensus on a legal definition of death. Show‐Cause Order Expected A spokesman for the State Attorney General's office, which has been monitoring developments in the case, said: “As fart as we can determine this case is novel; our researchers failed to find anything like it anywhere in the country.” The court is expected to sign a show‐cause order tomorrow that will set the stage for legal arguments over whether a parent should be given legal permission to authorize the termination of a mechanical respirator that has been sustaining his daughter, who has been in a coma since April 15. The case was brought by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph T. Quinlan of Landing, who have watched the condition of their 21‐year‐old daughter, Karen Ann, deteriorate steadily since she went into the coma and who have been advised by attending physicians that her condition is hopeless. Discontinuance of Life Mr. Quinlan has asked the court to declare his daughter mentally incompetent and to have him as her guardian for the express purpose of authorizing the “discontinuance of all extraordinary means sustaining vital processes.” The case is considered unusual, according to attorneys, because it breaks from the pattern of past cases dealing with abortion or euthanasia that were argued after the fact and usually is the result of a criminal complaint. The Quinlans are asking the Superior Court, through a civil suit, to condone in advance the cessation of life‐sustaining medical procedures. Instead of being asked to sit in judgment of a past and irreversible act, the court in this case is being asked to become a party to the act. Although some attorneys as signed to the case say they believe it will turn on whether the court finds the girl is legally dead, the papers do not contend that Karen Ann is dead. In fact, Paul W. Armstrong, the attorney for the parents, has said that Mr. and Mrs. Quinlan want the mechanical aids removed so that the girl may die naturally “with grace and dignity.” Broad Legal Discussion Seen Dr. Donald Burt, president of the Morris County Medical Society, said the suit by the Quinlan's would force a broad legal discussion of a problem “that doctors have been facing along for years and we're glad to get a little help from society and the courts.” “The doctor in this case, whoever he is, really human and not God,” Dr. Burt said. “And he shouldn't be the one to make the judgment to pull out all the stops.” The county medical society issued a statement through its Humanities Committee that said laws may have to be enacted establishing committees of doctors, lawyers, patients and their families to make decisions in cases such as that brought by the Quinlens. The couple, who have another daughter and a son, are Roman Catholics; they said their request to allow their daughter to die naturally was being made in line with moral precepts taught them by their parish priest and a theologian who had advised them. Mr. Armstrong said the Quinlan's request did not call for euthenasia—the taking of the life of someone incurably ill or in great pain—but what he termed dyasthamasia, the withholding of extraordinary life‐sustaining processes from someone who has no chance of recovery. Legal Definition of Death The courts around the nation are being asked to establish legal definitions of death, because few states have written legislation on this subject. Last spring Justice Mary Johnson Lowe of the New York Supreme Court ruled that “brain death” was the legal end of human life, but her ruling was not binding on other New York courts until upheld by the Court of Appeals. The American Bar Association recently issued its definition of death: “For all legal purposes a human body with irreversible cessation of total brain functions, according to usual and customary standards of medical practice, shall be considered dead.” The case brought by the Quinlan's is dominating the lo cal press and has attracted the attention of national and even international news organizations. The British Broadcasting Company and a German radio organization have asked local broadcast and print newsmen to provide taped interviews, and newspapers from as far as Chicago and Boston have telephoned the County Prosecutor's office and legal aid offices. The picture of the parents and the pretty long‐haired teen‐aged girl on the front pages of the local newspapers have spurred ongoing discussions. The proprietor of The Garden State News Store on South Street said, “Everyone has been talking about it; they're even discussing it over breakfast.”"
COLBY DESCRIBES C.I.A. POISON WORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/17/archives/colby-describes-cia-poison-work-he-tells-senate-panel-of-secret.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 —The Central Intelligence Agency operated an 18‐year, $3‐million super‐secret project to develop poisons, biochemical, weapons and such devices as dart guns to administer them, the agency's director testified today. William E. Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that pursuant to a Presidential order the project. code‐named “M.K. Naomi,” was halted in February, 1970. Mr. Colby showed the committee a dart gun patterned on the Army's Colt semi‐automatic pistol but electrically fired. He said it could shoot a dart 100 meters and was “almost silent.” The dart gun, brought before the committee at its request, was described in a C.I.A. memo as a “nondiscernible microbionoculator.” The committee made public C.I.A. documents showing that the agency had a vast array of poisons, including many that would cause deadly diseases, and systems for destroying crops. The documents also showed that the C.I.A. had used the New York City subway system as a “trial model” for a study on the vulnerability of subway riders to covert attack. According to Congressional cources, C.I.A. officials have said they flooded the New York subways with a “harmless simulant” of a disease‐carrying gas. It was in the secret project that two poisons, one a toxin made from shellfish, the other a derivative of cobra venom, were stockpiled by the C.I.A. in violation of President Nixon's directive, Mr. Colby said. Later in today's hearing—the Senate Committee's first public session — Dr. Nathan Gordon said that, at his direction, the two poisons were not destroyed in 1970. He said that he had received no specific order from the C.I.A. hierarchy to get rid of the material. Dr. Gordon, a chemist who retired from the C.I.A. in 1973, said that he had been aware of the Presidential directive ordering the destruction of biological and chemical weapons. However, he said he felt that the shellfish toxin was not covered on the ground that the order was directed at use of chemical weapons by the military and that the C.I.A.'s shellfish toxin didn't fall into that category. Explains Hiding of Poisons He said hat he did not ask permission to save the materials rather than destroy them, nor did he tell his superiors that he had secreted the poisons in a vault at his Washington laboratory. He said that he and two members of his section planned to reveal that they had the poisons if “higher authority” at the C.I.A. had asked them for suggestions for an effective poison. Much of what was told to the committee about C.I.A. operations at the public hearing today had been reported previously, based on information from sources familiar with testimony given to the committee in secret sessions. Mr. Colby said that in May, 1952, the C.I.A. began a joint project with the special operations division of the Army Biological Laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md. During the course of this project, his testimony and documents disclosed, the C.I.A. stockpiled substances that would cause tuberculosis. anthrax, encephalitis (sleeping sickness), valley fever, salmonella food poisoning and smallpox. Development of Darts He said the C.I.A. had developed darts that could shoot poison into a person without an autopsy or physical examination of the victim easily discovering that a dart had been fired. Mr. Colby said that the project had beer subject to a high degree of secrecy within the C.I.A. Only two or three officers at any given time were cleared for access to Fort Detrick activities, he said. Though some C.I.A.‐originated documents “have been found in the project files, it is clear only a very limited documentation of activities took place,” he added. Mr. Colby acknowledged under questioning that because of the paucity of records on the project he could not rule out that the poisons had been used for a substantial number of aggressive operations. He said that a technical aide had once suggested to him that poison be used in a C.I.A. operation but that he had rejected the idea. An October, 1967, memorandum on the Naomi project said that there were silent electrical delivery systems, mechanical launchers and anti‐crop “dissemination kits.” Situation Report The memorandum was a standard end‐of‐year situation report on a project. According to the memorandum, the purposes of the Naomi project were to “stockpile severely incapacitating and lethal materials for the specific use of TSD [Technical Services Division]” and to “maintain in operational readiness special and unique items for the dissemination of biological and chemical materials.” Mr. Colby said that part of the operational use might have been to prepare fast‐acting suicide pills for American agents and nonlethal incapacitating substances that would prevent a captive from taking his life or a terrorist from carrying out his intent. He also said that the agency had done substantial research on how to incapacitate guard dogs. Mr. Colby acknowledged, that “these materials” had been prepared for one operation, but said “we are aware that that operation was not in fact completed.” Sources familiar with the Senate investigation, however have told The New York Times that the committee has testimony of at least two incidents in which poisons were prepared in connection with a planned political assassination. In one case the agency contemplated doing away with Patrice Luniumba, a Communist‐backed Congo leader who later died in an unrelated episode, according to these sources. The other case reportedly dealt with Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba. The Naomi project operated in such secrecy, Mr. Colby said, that he learned of it only earlier this year when a former agency emploe brought to his attention that two poisons had been kept in defiance of a Presidential order. Mr. Colby ordered an investigation by Dr. Sayre Stevens, deputy director of the science and technology division. The investigation discovered that an 8‐by‐10‐foot, seldomused room in a C.I.A. laboratory building near the State Department in Washington con rained the shellfish toxin as well as the cobra venom. A search of the room netted 19 other lethal substances in addition to the shellfish toxin and cobra venom. These included poisons such as strychnine and cyanide pills as well as a material that causes abortions in animals. There was also a wide range of “incapacitating” materials including those that lower blood pressure, cause temporary amnesia and impair kidney function. Mr. Colby has asked permission from the Senate committee to destroy most of the substances after the investigation is completed. Dr. Gordon testifed that after the Presidential order was issued in 1970 for the destruction of biochemical warfare agents, he went to his superior, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, and suggested that the C.I.A. transfer its stock of such materials to a private laboratory in Baltimore. He identified himself as the, author of a memorandum submitted in evidence that made this proposal to Thomas Karamessines, then chief of C.I.A.'s covert actions. The memorandum showed that the C.I.A. had some 5.9 grams of the deadly shellfish toxin at Fort Detrick. Mr. Karmessines has told committee staff members that he never received the memorandum. Transfer Reported Vetoed Dr. Gordon said that Dr. Gottlieb had overruled the idea of transferring the materials to a private laboratory and had told him to let the Army's laboratory at Fort Detrick have the C.I.A.'s stockpile. Instead, however, Dr. Gordon said that he and his staff had decided to store two of the poisons. Senator Richard S. Schweiker, Republican of Pennsylvania, saidthat there was an apparent discrepancy concerning the amount of shellfish poison given to the C.I.A. The agency has said that it has some 11 grams of the poison, yet Dr. Gordon's 1970 memorandum said there were about 5.9 grams on hand. Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, chairman of the committee, said that the committee would ask Department of Defense officials if more tanh the C.I.A. portion of shellfish toxin wastransferred to the C.I.A. in an effort by other agencies to subvert the intent of President Nixon's 1970 order. The C.I.A. shellfish toxin about two teaspoons full, constitutes one‐third of all shellfish poison ever produced, Mr. Church said. He said that administered in one manner it could kill 14,000 persons and if used in another fashion could be lethalto “hundreds of thousands.” The original production of shellfish toxin was made by the Department of the Army. Portions were later used by the C.I.A. and the Foodand Drug Administration. Mr. Church saidthat the committee will ask Richard Helms, former Director of Central Intelligence, tomorrow why clear orders for the poison's destruction had not been issued."

8 Efforts to Curb Legalized Abortions Defeated in Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/18/archives/8-efforts-to-curb-legalized-abortions-defeated-in-senate.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 (UPI)—A Senate subcommitte defeated today all efforts to overturn the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion on demand, effectively ending the controversy for this Congressional term. The panel rejected eight proposed amendments to the Con stitution, ranging from one to outlaw abortion outright to one that would allow each state to lay down its own rules for terminating pregnancy. Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, who is chairman of the Senate Constitution al Rights Subcommittee, said after the votes in a closed session, “I think the committee has spoken, at least for the duration of this Congress.” The votes followed 18 months of hearings, during which all aspects of the emotional “right to life” issue were aired. The broadest support was given to an amendment to leave to the states all questions involving life—including abortion and euthanasia. This failed on a tie vote of 4 to 4. The proposal was supported by Senator William L. Scott, Republican of Virginia, Quentin N. Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota, Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, and James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi, who voted by proxy. Opposed were Senators Bayh and Hiram L. Fong, Republican of Hawaii, James Ahourezk, Democrat of South Dakota, and Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland. Two amendments by Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative Republican of New York, would have prohibited abortion except to save the life of the mother. Each was defeated on a 5 to 2 vote, with Senators Fong and Thurmond voting “yes.” The Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 22, 1973, that the decision on abortions must he left to the woman and her doctor—without stale interference—during the first three months of pregnancy."
Hysterectomy is the second most frequently performed major operation. Should it be so frequent?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/21/archives/hysterectomy-is-the-second-most-frequently-performed-major.html,"The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that more than 690,000 women will have hysterectomies in the United States in 1975. This procedure for removal of the uterus will be the nation's second most frequently performed major operation. Only tonsils will be taken out more often. At a time when lowered birth rates and control of fertility and childbirth have vastly reduced uterine disease, almost half of all American women over 40 will be advised to have their wombs removed; 378,000 will have their ovaries and Fallopian tubes taken out. These women will pay a total of $400‐million in gynecologists' fees alone, and the operation will end in death for about 12,000 of them. There is evidence to suggest, however, that not all of these operations will be warranted, that some will be unnecessarily extreme and therefore unnecessarily hazardous and that an increasing number of surgeons are rushing their patients to the operating tables more out of considerations of monetary gain than of sound medicine, Indeed, just such accusations are now being made by many public‐health experts, consumer advocates, hospital administrators and even some of the gynecologic surgeons themselves. The issue would appear to be raised particularly by the wide variation, Pram region to region, class to class, group to group, country to country, in the numbers of hysterectomies performed and in the standards used to justify them. For example, on a national average, the number performed for insured persons is double that for the uninsured. In prepaid health plans run by unions or groups like the Kaiser Foundation, where peer review discourages unjustified surgery, rates of operation arc as much as a fourth lower than in fee‐for‐service plans like Blue Cross‐Blue Shield. Hysterectomies are performed two and a half times as often in the United Staes as in England and Wales and four times as often as in Sweden, where, because medical care is state paid, doctors stand to gain little financially for performing more hysterectomies. In this country, such operations have been undertaken in some cases to correct overstretched pelvic ligaments that hold the uterus in place, when a tighter girdle might have brought the same relief from discomfort. Surgeons and patients frequently have options far less radical than hysterectomies. Tubal ligation will sterilize just as well as hysterectomy. Local excisions and drugs can handle many fibroids and cases of endometriosis, a scarring of the uterine wall. Often there is no need for surgery at all. Dr. Walter Alvarez of the Mayo School of Medicine, for example, reports at least 100 hysterectomies have been performed to treat migraine headaches without the slightest scientific justification. And a large number of salpingo‐oophorectomies (removals of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes) are done “preventively” where there is no evidence of disease. This is not to imply that the female reproductive organs are always by any means trouble‐free, and there are often good, universally accepted reasons for their removal. The uterus, whose principal function is to provide a place in which the human fetus can remain and grow until birth, is at most other times about the size and shape of an upsidedown pear—hung, by ligaments, in the pelvic cavity between the bladder and the rectum. It has enormous powers of elasticity, but is expected to withstand enormous rigors. It must each month thicken and form added muscle, connective tissue and blood vessels in preparation for a fertilized egg. During pregnancy, it is stretched, high up into the abdomen, to the size of a large watermelon. Or, during menstruation, if there has been no fertilization, it must slough off its own inner lining of blood and cellular debris down through its cervix, or neck, to the vagina for discharge. The narrow cervix is thus a frequently, and sometimes roughly, used passageway for menstrual discharge, or exiting fetus, or sperm or for any infectious organisms that can, and do, find their way there. Connected to the top of the uterus are the Fallopian tubes, where sperm meets egg. At the other end, the tubes open to the ovaries, where the eggs and the female hormones are manufactured. These delicate organs and supporting structures are susceptible to cancer, infection, cysts, fibroids, scarring, hemorrhage and obstruction. Moreover, there are among them not infrequent malfunctions: excessive uterine contractions and cramps, uterine tilt (which may lead to infertility and painful intercourse) or prolapse (slippage well out of proper position—which interferes with blood flow and may cause pelvic congestion, back It's hard to hide your pride when you show this new Pulsar to your friends.

Fertilized eggs can block the tubes; hormonal imbalances can sabotage the entire system. Incomplete miscarriages can occur and contraceptives — the intrauterine devices, the pill, the diaphragm—carry with them a whole range of potential irritants, infectious organisms and hormonal upsets. Finally, these organs have a direct association with a woman's emotions, which themselves may lead to psychosomatic complications and gynecologic disorders. In cases of cancer, infection or other pathologic conditions that threaten life, hysterectomy and salpingo‐oophorectomy are usually clearly indicated. However, only 10 to 20 per cent of these operations are performed for cancer or other life‐threatening disorders. The American Cancer Society estimates only 67,000 new cases annually of uterine, ovarian and invasive cervical cancer. Well aware of the criticism that some doctors have been performing unwarranted surgery in many of the remaining 80 to 90 percent of the cases, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has asked its gynecologic‐practices commission to formulate better standards. But generally physicians are persistent in their defense of the high rates of surgery done in the United States. Dr. John McCain, chairman of the American College of Surgeons, says, “We believe in keeping surgical risk to a minimum—but we must consider realities.” Dr. Arthur Haskins, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Maryland, puts it more bluntly: “What would you do with a woman who comes in with her uterus hanging down to her knees, and you remove it, only to have some pathologist or review committee tell you you were wrong because her uterus was ‘normal’ It's just not as simple as ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’ ” The doctors argue that the charges against them are usually inspired by healthcare reformers who don't understand the complex social, medical and personal interactions between patients and doctors, and who want to create such controversies to promote national health insurance and public control of medical practice and costs. They say British and Swedish surgeons do too little surgery and that the quality of life of thousands of women may be compromised as a result. And they charge that the issue is emotionally overdone by the “lunatic fringe” of the women's movement, which, as one Johns Hopkins University gynecologist put it, “sees an unsympathetic, greedy chauvinist behind every Kelly clamp.” Twenty ‐ five years ago, gynecologists point out, hysterectomy was not safe enough to perform in any but life‐threatening situations, but today, with safer anesthetics, earlier diagnosis of problems, antibiotics and life‐support systems, the benefits for less than life‐threatening conditions far outweigh the risks. Most gynecologists insist that the womb and its accompanying organs are useless after childbearing anyway and are prone to trouble. Hysterectomy, they note, has half the death rate of appendectomy. Moreover, they add, less radical treatments that can substitute for hysterectomy—such as subtotal operations on the uterus to repair prolapses, radium therapy for uterine bleeding and even tubal ligations for sterilization—often lead to surgical complications, scarring, adhesions, more operations and worse dangers than hysterectomy ever presented. Gynecologists also maintain that the death rate from ovarian cancer is so high, and the diagnosis so difficult to make, that failure to remove the ovaries—even if they appear healthy—at the time of hysterectomy in a woman approaching menopause borders on “criminal negligence.” Removing them, they say, reduces total cancer risk by an estimated 20 per cent. The physicians also contend that rising malpractice suits and insurance costs are pushing them into defensive practices that encourage more, not less, radical surgery. They fear that conservative approaches, such as subtotal operations or drug therapy, may prevent a cure for an early case of cancer or lead to other problems that later become the basis for a serious illness—and a lawsuit. Medical ailments don't usually arise in organs that aren't there. There is also a class angle to the controversy. The surgeons are being accused of performing hysterectomies, without clear need, on poor blacks, Puerto Ricans and other indigent minorities In charity wards who are too ignorant or powerless to insist on alternatives. The acting director of a large New York municipal hospital says it is “unwritten policy” to do “elective” hysterectomies for sterilization on such patients (instead of the safer, simpler tubal ligation) and adds that these operations probably account for 10 per cent of all gynecologic surgery in New York. If this is so, the medical people reply, it is because there are no alternatives for such women One Emory University gynecologist says, “They are unreliable patients who need one‐shot, get‐themwhen‐you‐can treatment to prevent unwanted pregnancies, family disintegration and disease born of neglect, ignorance and poor personal hygiene. Long bouts of conservative therapy won't work.” Finally, there is the question of special circumstances. Several doctors interviewed for this article offered case histories in their defense, like the woman who was so obese that her ovaries could not be examined properly, and who feared she would die of incurable ovarian cancer; or like the mother of four who was the sole support of her family but lost time from work because of cramps and heavy menstruation. Others described the personal tragedies born of repeated contraceptive failure, abortions and the innocent promiscuity of retardates who could not cope with pregnancy or even menstruation—all preventable with hysterectomy All things considered gynecologists say, hysterectomy in the middle‐aged or older woman is safe and solves more problems than it causes. If hysterectomies and related operations were as safe and sure as most surgeons say they are, there would be little argument. But even a cursory look at the medical literature suggests they are not. Hysterectomy is major surgery, and, like all major surgery, it can be associated with a host of unexpected complications. In a study of 12,000 patients at the University of Michigan, Drs. William Ledger and Mar. garet Child found that 16 per cent needed blood transfusions after abdominal hysterectomies and 48 per cent required antibiotics, which can themselves cause Illness, or even death, in certain patients. The Lancet, a British medical journal, reports that many padents take 11 months to regain fitness after hysterectomy and worry they are not recovering fast enough because doctors keep telling dim that “normal” recovery time is less than three months. A fifth of patients in some hospitals, reports show, develop urinary tract infections and three‐fourths, anemia. Thrombophlebitis is not uncommon. Doctors at Yale University report that vaginal hysterectomies (those in which the uterus is removed through the vagina instead of the abdomen) are associated with 50 per cent more fevers and 40 per cent more urinary tract infections than abdominal procedures. Surgeons often tout the “vag hys” as safer, less painful and easier for the patient, yet 5 per cent of the 600 operations the Yale doctors reviewed at their own medical center resulted in reoperations and 3 per cent in rehospitalization for complications ranging from surgical injuries to the bladder and from lung collapse to blood clots, shock and intestinal obstruction. Vaginal hysterectomy may lead to scarring (and painful intercourse). Vaginal changes from oophorectomy, which cuts off estrogen output, may cause similar problems. The rate of posthysterectomy depression (a third to a half of some groups studied) is so high that some doctors recommend psychiatric consultation beforehand in any woman under 45. And there are side effects medical science is only beginning to uncover. Dr. Sergio Stone at Louisiana State University has found that hysterectomy may have an acute effect on the production of hormones by the ovaries. Dr. D. H. Richards in England believes a hormone imbalance can be produced by removal of the uterus and cause headache, dizziness, insomnia, hot flashes and depression even if the ovaries are left alone. Joan Goldstein, former chairman of the task force on women and health for the National Organization of Women (NOW), gets dozens of calls a year from women who “tell me they were never prepared for the pain, discomfort and problems after their operations, or for the emotional reactions they had to loss of their ability to have children.” Because of such complications and complaints, surgical decisions once accepted without question are increasingly challenged and condemned by health‐care researchers. Studies by researchers in California, New York (at Cornell and Columbia Universities), in Maryland, the Midwest, and throughout the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, have put the number of questionable hysterectomies in the 15 per cent to 40 per cent range. In interviews with gynecologists throughout the country, chiefs of obstetrical and gynecological departments in leading medical schools, representatives of national surgical associations, women's rights leaders and health system experts, several possible explanations for the excessive number of female operations turned up. Chief among them is economic pressure. Dr. John Bunker, a Stanford and Harvard anesthesiologist who is studying surgical‐manpower problems, has concluded that there are too many surgeons in the United States now, and that half of all young doctors in residency training plan surgical careers. This situation, combined with a 50 per cent decline in birth rates in some areas, is shrinking the market for many obstetrician‐gynecologists. “Some of us aren't making a living,” says a Baltimore specialist “so out comes a uterus or two each month to pay the rent.” Other studies show that the amount of surgery performed is directly related both to how many hospital beds and surgeons are available and the patients' ability to pay. Drs. John Wennberg of Harvard University and Alan Gitteisohn of Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health studied surgical rates in Vermont and found ‘Surgeons are rushing patients to the operating table more out of considerations of monetary gain than sound medicine . . . . Researchers have put the number of questionable hysterectomies in the 15 to 40 per cent range.’ a three‐fold difference in the number of hysterectomies performed around the state plus a 10‐fold difference in the number of days spent in the hospital after surgery. Nationwide, 10 per cent more hysterectomies are done in the South than in the Northeast, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, and twice as many in the South as in the West. Yet there is no evidence that women in the South have more gynecologic problems than women in the North or that surgeons in East Vermont know something their colleagues in Central Vermont don't. “We can't say for sure what is happening,” says Dr. Gittelsohn, “but where you have a three‐times higher rate in one area over another, in a single state, it calls for some kind of explanation.” In New York and other major cities, a hysterectomy which renders a patient sterile costs up to $800, while a tubal ligation, which does the same thing, pays only $250 to the surgeon, increasing the motivation to do the more extensive operation. Medicare, Medicaid and other health plans for the poor and the affluent both will reimburse a surgeon up to 90 per cent for the costs of any sterilization procedure, and sometimes will allow nothing for abortion. As a consequence, “hyster‐sterilizations” — so common among some groups of indigent blacks they are referred to as “Mississippi appendectomies” — are increasingly popular among surgeons, despite the risks. Twenty times more likely to kill a patient than simply tying off the Fallopian tubes, or tubal ligation, hyster‐sterilizations expose 100,000 women a year—unnecessarily—to the risk of hepatitis from contaminated fluids, needles and tubes used in transfusions during and after the surgery. “It's like killing a mouse with a cannon,” says Dr. Charles McLaughlin, president of the American College of Surgeons. Hysterectomy for sterilization alone is “uncalled for.” Yet gynecologists widely admit the increase in these operations, especially among Cath olics, who use it as a subterfuge, a means of getting around church proscriptions of birth control and sterilization. Other underlying reasons for the high number of operations have to do with surgical‐training needs. A Boston City Hospital gynecological resident speaks for many of his fellow‐students when he says a “trained chimpanzee” can do a tubal ligation and what he needs to challenge him and teach him required skills are more hysterectomies. American surgeons have a worldwide reputation as “aggressive cutters,” men trained under the notion that “every person has at least three surgical diseases—all you have to do is find them.” Any United States doctor licensed to practice medicine can practice any kind of surgery, whether he's specially trained or not (unlike the British system where only specialists can). Studies show that doctors who practice gynecologic surgery, but are not certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, do three times the number of operations as surgeons who are certified, and only 16,000 of the 22,500 physicians who practice gynecology in the United States full time are board‐certified. One of the ironies of the hysterectomy controversy is that if there is any group to blame for an excessive rate of pelvic operations, the list must include women themselves. During the nineteen‐fifties and sixties, the “feminine forever” concept put thousands of women on hormones to delay the aging effects of menopause and brought with it hormone‐induced uterine bleeding, the threat of endometrial cancer and many hysterectomies. The risk of the hormone therapy, particularly for women who were still producing some hormones of their own, was often ignored by patients and physicians. It is in these women that the complications described generally arise. Women of today, moreover, are unwilling to put up with the discomforts of genital pro He tried to express his feeling for man and nature by becoming a minister, but his fervor ala??ned his superiors. He fell in love with two women of his own class and they fled from him as from a dangerous lunatic. The famous incident in which he cut off part of his ear and gave it to a prostitute was only one more attempt to give something of himself to anyone who would accept it. This torrent of emotion—for which society had no use—turned Vincent Van Gogh into one of the greatest painters of all time. Never has a man poured so much pure responsiveness into his art. You can see in it everything from salvation to suicide. Sacrificing his sanity and his life to his work, he burned himself up in a blaze of perception ... in a controlled riot of color that washed over modern art like a tidal wave of lyricism. Love, for Van Gogh, was a means of seeing ... of fusing himself with his subjects. Even the lavish way he squeezed a tube of paint directly onto his canvas symbolized a generosity that knew no limits. To the humblest subject—an old pair of boots, an empty chair—he brought the special light of his own fervor. As one critic put it, Van Gogh had the courage to look the sun squarely in the face and steal its radiance. Beside almost 1,700 works of art, Van Gogh also bequeathed to the world—in 661 letters to his brother—one of the most moving autobiographies ever written. It shows this dauntless man trying to learn Greek in order to be allowed to preach to Dutch coal miners. You find him, his hatband stuck full of candles, painting the stars at midnight. You trace letter by letter, canvas by canvas, the collapse of his sanity and his subsequent suicide. The World of Van Gogh is your introduction to the Turz‐Lzez Library of Art... a magnificently illustrated series that shows you—and helps you appreciate—the most important achievements in 700 years of Western painting and sculpture.

Hysterectomy and oophorectomy are viewed by many of them as a quick easy way to end the nuisance of menstruation and use of the pill or other contraceptives and to eliminate the danger of cancer of the reproductive tract. Others believe that hysterectomy will relieve emotional problems of middle age, menopause and the “empty‐nest syndrome.” Often they'll find a surgeon willing to go along. The doctors say they cannot ignore women's changing lifestyles. “If a woman wants a hysterectomy for sterilization or convenience,” says Dr. Paul Weinberg of the University of Texas, San Antonio, “and she knows and understands the risks and is willing to take them, we have no right to deny her the operation if it is at all within medical reason.” Gynecologists believe that, as a rule, women do not mourn the loss of their reproductive organs and capacity the way a man might. Dr. James Nelson of the University of California, says, “In the 16 years I have been in practice, I have yet to find a woman who really enjoyed menstruation.” Another surgeon boasts: “I have never in 30 years had a woman tell me she's sorry she had a hysterectomy done.” Views of that kind are contested strongly by the militant feminists and their sympathizers—including a few gynecologists—who believe there are sexist reasons for the great amount of gynecological surgery being performed by those who regard themselves as godlike figures presiding over physiologically or psychologically inferior beings. “Biology is destiny,” is still a strong, unspoken premise for much behavior of the largely male medical profession, says gynecologist Irwin Kaiser. Yet, psychiatrists like Dr. Malkah Notman of the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston who treat posthysterectomy depression say that the male domination of gynecology is such that women are unlikely to complain or challenge the doctor's convictions. Gyneco logists, she says, sometimes play into the hands of women with emotional trouble, because they view themselves as saviors and protectors, rather than partners in health care with their patients. “A woman becomes depressed about something in her life and it takes the form of either not caring about life or being overly sensitive to even minor pain, She looks to a surgeon to ‘relieve’ her ‘suffering’ and he treats her with a hysterectomy or whatever. She may not really have wanted or needed that operation.” Joan Goldstein of NOW challenges the notion “that the postmenopausal uterus is a useless organ or that hysterectomy is routine at such and such an age or that a woman doesn't get upset at the thought of castration or sterility the way a man does. There is nothing routine about it,” she says. “Women are being talked into things they may later regret and medical science doesn't even know what ultimate function the womb may have after childbearing. . . . and to argue that removing ovaries and uteri reduces cancer risk is, if logically followed to its extreme, to say we should do bilateral mastectomies on all women at age 35 to reduce the risk of breast cancer 100 per cent.” The hysterectomy controversy encompasses nearly every facet of the American health‐care problem, from rising costs to physician competence; from patient abuse of insurance to human greed; from the surplus of surgeons to the uneven application of medical knowledge, Harvard's Dr. Bunker says, “The risks of operation can be documented with mortality data, but comparable controlled data on the real risks of not operating are, for most surgical diseases, not available. So how does a surgeon really know if his patient is better off with or without an operation?” And Johns Hopkins's Dr. Gittelsohn adds that the “burden of proof is on those who do more operations to show that they are prolonging morel lives. There is no good study to show that is the case.” Until there is, the likelihood remains high that American women will be advised and will agree to have their reproductive organs removed for less than compelling reasons. ■ ‘Operations have been undertaken to correct overstretched ligaments . . when a girdle might have brought the same relief . . . . At least 100 have been performed to treat migraine headaches‐without justification.’ Van Gogh sought peace in painting this church at Auvers."

Black, Chancellor of the State Board of Regents, announced that he would urge his colleagues to eliminate a provision in the new teachers' contract that allows for cuts in instruction time for New York City public schools. The contract provision which cuts two 45‐minute periods a week from the schedule has been opposed by several parents groups and officials of community school hoards and was a major issue in the settlement last week of the five‐day teachers' strike. Artist Sues Parker Over Game Christian Thee, a self‐employed artist and part‐time developer of games, contended in a $20‐million suit in Federal Court in Brooklyn against Parker Brothers, Inc., the company that sells Monopoly and other adult games, that the company had stolen his idea for a game. The artist said Parker Brothers turned down his idea and later brought out the game under the name Masterpiece. Randolph A. Barton, president of the company, said it had looked at more than 100 games on art and the one marketed had been developed entirely by Marvin Glass Associates of Chicago. Englewood Teachers End Strike Public school teachers in Englewood, N.J., and most of their 4,000 pupils returned to classrooms after the settlement of a strike by the teachers association that had closed the city's seven schools for two weeks. The major elements of the settlement were a 7.5 per cent salary increase, which could go as high as 8 per cent with certain minor pay benefits, and a strong new clause in the contract spelling out a “reduction in force” procedure. It guarantees preference on the basis of seniority in case of layoffs, according to a spokesman for the teachers. School Strikes End and Start Upstate Three school strikes in upstate New York were settled, while three teacher walkouts were started and two others continued. Teachers returned to classrooms in Niagara, Newfane and the Albany Suburban South Colonie School District, and teachers in the Erie County and Springville School Districts agreed to end their strike. Strikes began in Niagara Falls, Williamsville and Plattsburgh, and walkouts persisted in Schenectady and the Saratoga County village of Ballston Spa.

Judge Brought Into Case These issues are further complicated by the tact that a judge has been asked to become a party to an act that may he a crime. It is well established in criminal law that an affirmative act of euthanasia—the taking of the life of someone who is suffering from a painful or terminal illness — constitutes homicide. It must he decided whether the withdrawal of extraordinary life ‐ sustaining procedures should he treated in the same euthanasia. Under the traditional test of death, life does not end so long as breathing continues and the heart beats. But this definition has been under increasing challenge since modern medical technology has made mechanical manipulation of these vital functions possible. A few states—but not New Jersey—have adopted the definition that brain death, or the loss of organized brain waves, is the legal end of life. However, this definition was not intended to resolve the issue of when the loss of certain capacities or functions would justify termination of treatment. And that is exactly the situation in the Quinlan case. After reviewing the available medical literature, Norman Cantor, a Rutgers University law professor who is advising Miss Quinlan's court‐appointed guardian, wrote in a recently published book, “The Dilemmas of Euthanasia,” that “the closer the salvageable existence is to a purely vegetative state, the more consensus, there is on the dispensability of further active treatment.” But that is by no means the legal test. Precedents are not available, and there is no record of an American court ever authorizing the cessation of supportive medical devices to sustain life, regardless of whether brain death has oc curred. At best, some general principles can he extracted from an examination of related areas. The law generally requires adults to care for their dependents, but it does not require an adult to care for himself. A long line of cases has emerged from the Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religion forbids blood transfusions. In these cases courts have upheld the state's interference with parents to safeguard children, but have been divided on whether an adult has the option of declining critical medical treatment. The sanctity of life is considered to be in the state's interest, and despite the individual's right to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion, there are areas of the law—such as the statutes requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets —where the state has seen fit to protect individuals against their own wishes. Finally, in its 1973 abortion decision, the Supreme Court suggested that a woman did not have total control over her body and that the states could prevent the destruction of potential life. But these legal principles can only offer guidance, since the Quinlan case is unique. As Professor Cantor points out in a 1973 law review artole, the disconnection of lifesustaining equipment falls in the spectrum between a doctor's passive withholding of treatment and his active administration of a fatal narcotics injection. The legal status of la physician who merely withholds treatments is in great dispute, but the injection is clearly illegal. The question then becomes: is the disconnection an affirmative act? Classifying disconnection in this way, Professor Cantor said, “will condemn some patients to an existence which is agonizing both for them and their families.” Ultimately, it will be Judge Muir's choice to decide who shall decide whether Miss Quinlan will live or die. As Charles D. Breital, New York's chief judge said in an other context this week, “there is an almost universal public expectation of courts that theirs is the obligation and the capacity to solve all the difficult problems that have defied solution or stubbornly resisted solution.” And, as a general principle whether the issue be abortion, euthanasia or the death penalty, courts have been reluctant to assume lithe role of making life and death decisions."

Gun Control Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/27/archives/gun-control-problem-little-chance-is-seen-for-strong-law-because-of.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 —The two alleged attempts to shoot President Ford have generated new demands from commentators law‐enforcement offices and private citizens for stiff Federal guncontrol legislation. Yet, predictably, the response in Congress has been barely discernible. and there is little chance that strong firearms regulations will be enacted in the forseeahie future. To he sure, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat with limited influence, proposed a bill that would outlaw the private ownership of pistols, and a Republican colleague, Robert McClory of Illinois, offered legislation to require the registration of firearms and the licensing of gun owners. But, no sooner had these proposals been introduced this week than Carl Albert, the (Speaker of the House, announced that he saw “constitutional problems” with the Conlyers bill and had no reason to believe that registration or licensing would deter “anyone with a gun crazy enough to try to kill the President.” ‘Frightening’ Statistics On the surface, the issue of gun control appears to he one tailor‐made for rapid Congressional action. The crime statistics are truly frightening three out of every four murders are committed with pistols, and such weapons are responsible for 10.000 deaths a year. On the average day, for example firearms are involved in two murthrs, 60 robberies and ‘22 assaults in New York City alone. Moreover, for years, George Gallup and other pollsters have reported that more than 70 per cent of Americans favor stricter gun laws. But, as almost any politician who has encountered them will acknowledge, the people who oppose gun control wield political power far out of proportion to their numbers. The reason is the intensity of their feeling on the issue. For the vast majority of Americans—the 70 per cent in the Gallup figures—a candidate's position on gun control Is but one of many factors, land seldom the most important one, taken into account in deciding for whpm to vote in an election, political analysts believe. For the most part, they say, these voters weigh a candidate's party affiliation and his position on a variety of national issues before they cast their ballots. But, many of those Aim oppose gun‐control legislation apparently vote on the basis of a candidate's stand on that issue alone. No one knows lust how many people fall into that category, but, even if it is only 5 per cent or 6 per cent of the electorate, it could make the difference between a politician's having a safe seat In Congress and losing an election. Take, for example, the 1970 Senate race in Maryland. J. Glenn Beall Jr., the Republican, defeated Joseph D. Tydings, the incumbent Democrat, by 51 per cent to 48 per cent, with 1 per cent of the vote. going to a third‐party candidate. Mr. Tydings had been a champion of gun‐control legislation in the Senate. Dr. C.P. Chanconas, a Maryland dentist, organized a group called Citizens Against Tydings that campaigned vigorously against the incumbent solely on the issue of gun control. “We didn't care what else he stood for,” Dr. Chaconas was quoted as saying after the election. “We didn't care whether he was God incarnate.” Although there were, of course, other issues in the campaign, Mr. Tydings is said to believe that he would have won handily had it not been for the matter of gun control. Surely, he picked up few votes just because of his position on guns, since, for proponents of gun control, the issue is rarely the decisive one. But, if he lost 2 per cent of the vote to Mr. Beall because of the gun‐control issue, it was the difference between victory and defeat. A Singular Issue Senator Frank Church, Democra I of Idaho, normally votes with big‐city Democrats. but he has consistently opposed gun‐control legislation. He won re‐election last year with 57 per cent of the vote, a comfortable margin. In his rural state, had he taken the wrong position on gun laws, it might have swung the 18,000 votes that would have been needed to defeat him. There arc, of course, other issues—hosing and abortion, for instance—that can make or break a candidate. But, in the opinion of most political analysts, politicians’ positions on those issues tend to reflect their over‐all political philosophy. Gun control, the analysts say, stands as an issue that, by itself can cause a candidate's defeat. “In private, my boss would probably agree that private citizens have no business owning concealable pistols,” said an aide to a Western Representa five. “But he could never dere say so in public. There's something special about guns to the people who own them.”"
Confusion Of Loyalties,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/28/archives/confusion-of-loyalties.html,"In recent days, we have had strikes of teachers in New York and many other places, of policemen in San Francisco, and of professional football players in Boston. Also, spectacular kidnappings, murders, demonstrations against busing and abortion, and two threats on the life of the President of the United States. It is hard and maybe even silly to try to generalize about all these events, which run from madness to justifiable grievances and to honest expressions of conscience, but coming together within the short space of a few weeks, they seem almost absurd. Is there any way to explain all this disorder, and reduce all this inexplicable diversity to some kind of identity? One thing is fairly obvious. A great many people in this country are now modifying their loyalty to the authority and purposes of the Federal, state and local governments, and transferring it to personal commitments or to unions, business associations, or social cults of various kinds. After all the analysis of the Watergate and Vietnam tragedies, there seemed to be a general consensus that the men around Johnson and Nixon had somehow got trapped in a confusion of loyalties. But despite all the mystifying clarifications of these two events, the confusion of loyalties seems to go on. The loyalty of the striking policemen in San Francisco and even of the striking teachers in some cities was not to the law but to their own associations and personal interests. The workers who refused to load the grain for the Soviet Union substituted their own foreign policy for President Ford's and Secretary Kissinger's. The Boston Patriots put “union solidarity” ahead of their obligations to their “loyal fans,” who pay high prices to park and watch their heroes, and the Washington Redskins, averaging over $50,000 a season, joined the strike. Defiance of the law may not be as general or violent now as it was in the sixties, but it is fairly clear that we are still in an era of confrontation rather than negotiation, despite all the Presidential promises of the last few years. Individuals and associations of individuals are acting on their own notions of what the laws should be, and ironically, they all seem to feel the need to be loyal to something. Squeaky Fromme pulls a gun on the President in Sacramento apparently because she feels lost in her private life, has no family of her own, but is loyal to Manson's bizarre collection of defeated and frustrated souls. Patty Hearst was either captured or captivated by the Symbionese mystique, and gives her clenched fist “loyalty” salute to what she calls “revolutionary feminism.” It is all a little odd. She will not be a “prisoner” in her parents’ home, she says, apparently forgetting that her parents have been prisoners of her own madness for the past year. “Do your own thing” seems to be the motto of the contemporary counter‐culture, and it is not limited to the kooks. Not only Nixon's gang, but other top officials of the Federal Government, we now know, have not only been following his illegal practices, but even disobeying his legal authority‐hiding the most lethal military poisons and weapons, even after he ordered their destruction. So it is obviously not merely the human wreckage of our society that substitutes its own selfish interests for the law. The record has been laid out on Capitol Hill in the last few days and even admitted that big American corporations made illegal and concealed political payments to political parties In the United States and that they paid out millions to get contracts for planes and tanks and missiles overseas. The United States Is now both the foremost advocate of peace and disarmament in the world and the most successful peddler of the most sophisticated military weapons ever invented. In the Middle East alone, Henry Kissinger is the principal mediator for peace, but the Pentagon is the major arsenal for planes, tanks and missiles not only for Israel but for the Arab world. An argument can be made for all these seemingly contradictory decisions by the Ford Administration, but President Ford is not making it. He has his own confusion of loyalties. For almost 25 years, he has been a Capitol Hill man, a leader of the Republican party, a member of the Armed Services Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, a philosopher and darling of the Republican conservatives at political rallies. But he has not convinced either the labor unions, or even the conservative business community, let alone the revolutionary crazies, that he has a program for America's problems. So they all operate on their own. Lacking confidence in either the Republican or the Democratic leaders, they create their own associations to confront and even defy the authority of government. This is the central problem: Increasingly, individuals and associations are giving loyalty to themselves, and forgetting about the common problems of the nation."
"SWEDISH SCIENTISTS WIN $25,000 PRIZE",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/29/archives/swedish-scientists-win-25000-prize.html,"Two Swedish scientists were named yesterday to share the $25,000 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize for their work with prostaglandins, body chemicals that affect high blood pressure, pregnancy, fevers and ulcers. Dr. Sune Bergstrom and Dr. Bengt Samuelsson, biochemists at Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, will receive the award in Columbia University's Low Memorial Library Wednesday night. Dr. Kenneth Akins, an associate professor of pharmacology at Columbia, said that the Swedish scientists had done “a pretty fantastic thing”—I determining the structures of the prostaglandins and then synthesizing them chemically. “Certain of them already have clinical applications,” he added. “They can produce ‘chemical abortions’ by inducing labor, and they have potential use in the treatment of stomach ulcers by inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach.” Dr. Bergstrom, 59 years old, is a professor of chemistry at the Karolinska Instituter; Dr. Samuelsson, 40, is a professor of medical and physiological chemistry there."
Panel of Judges Gives In to Pressure And Names a Man at the Last Minute,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/29/archives/panel-of-judges-gives-in-to-pressure-and-names-a-man-at-the-last.html,"The new judicial‐screening committee for Manhattan and the Bronx bowed to the pressure of black Democratic leaders in Manhattan last week and qualified at the last minute a judicial candidate who had earlier been rejected by the committee when it drew up a list of 31 judicial prospects qualified for the State Supreme Court bench. Judge Arthur E. Bell of Civil Court was rated qualified in a telephone poll of the 13‐member screening panel mere hours before the Democratic judicial district convention met to nominate Supreme Court candidates. New York Political Notes The Manhattan Democratic leader, Frank G. Rossetti, at the behest of Democratic district leaders in Harlem, insisted that the screening panel reconsider its earlier rejection of Judge Bell—a full week after the committee had released its list of qualified judicial prospects and supposedly ended its work. The stage was set for the arm‐twisting when another black Civil Court judge, Fritz Alexander, withdrew his bid for a Supreme Court nomination after he had been approved by the screening panel. He withdrew after being told by black leaders that they preferred Judge Bell. The judcial district convention could have drawn from a list of 30 other judicial candidates who had been approved by the screening panel, but none are black and Mr. Rossetti had agreed to nominate A black in exchange for the support of black district leaders for his reelection as county chairman 10 days ago. Thus the screening panel was pressured to qualify Judge Bell even though it was not supposed to consider color, sex, religion or any factor other than competence, according to its chairman, Peter James Johnson. An obviously chagrined Mr. Johnson, after being run over by the political steamroller, conceded that the panel's work had been “clouded” by political pressure. “The way it happened is unfortunate,” he said. Mr. Johnson, who had been considered an independent Democrat, said that he would move to close “the loophole” in the party rules setting up the screening panel. The rules permit a judicial prospect to withdraw after he has been tound qualified by the sceeening panel, thus giving political leaders the lever to exert pressure on the panel for a replacement. “If this committee is to continue, that loophole must be closed,” Mr. Johnson said. • Bronx Democrats know how to use loopholes, too. City Councilman Anthony Mercorella, who has been nominated for the Civil Court, resigned from the Council this month, although he did not have to until after his election to the bench. His Liming was significant. however. Resigning after the Sept. 9 primary, he made it sure that his successor could be nominated for an interim term by Bronx Democratic leaders without any possibility of a challenge in a primary by anti‐organization Democrats. The successor as Councilman is expected to be Gennaro L. Crispino, a Democratic organization stalwart. • Top aides of Governor Carey are miffed that he was not selected as the major speaker at the prestigious annual Alfred E. Smith dinner at which Cardinal Cooke is the host, although Mr. Carey is the first elected Catholic Governor of the state since Mr. Smith. A neighboring Catholic Governor, Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut, will be the major speaker, along with the Cardinal, at the Oct. 16 dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Carey aides are speculating that one reason for the selection of Mrs. Grasso night be that Mr. Carey did not take as hard a position on such issues as abortion. A spokesman for the New York Archdiocese said he did not know the basis for Governor Grasso's selection. • In case there was any doubt about who is running the Republican party in this state. Vice President Rockefeller played host to the Governor's Club, a major G.O.P. fund‐raising operation in the state, at his Pocantico Hills estate Friday evening. The club is composed of 1,000 Republicans who pay $1,000 a year “dues.” Earlier Friday. the Vice President entertained Republican county leaders at his estate. The county chairmen are not used to such opulence. • The Stevenson Democratic Club in Brooklyn conducted a forum last night on “The American Revolution of 1776 As Seen Through the Eyes of Reform Democrats.” A highlight was a speech by Milton Goldner, an insurgent Democrat, on the similarities between “the four leading factions of the Colonial revolutionists against England and the four lending factions among the Democrats and reform Democrats today.”"
Several of New Hampshire's Key Moderate Republicans Are Shifting Toward Reagan in February Primary,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/29/archives/several-of-new-hampshires-key-moderate-republicans-are-shifting.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 28—Afterthoughts on John A. Durkin's Democratic victory over Republican Louis C. Wyman in New Hampshire's re‐run Senate election this month dwell on a variety of implications for the Presidential race in 1976, and particularly on the hazards for President Ford. The for mer New Hampshire House. Speaker, Stuart Lamprey, former Governor Hugh Gregg and a former state party chairman, David Gosselin, are among the “moderate” Republicans in the state now on the verge of joining Ronald Reagan's organization for the February primary. Campaign Notes Mr. Lamprey managed Richard M. Nixon's New Hampshire primary victory in 1968, and he would supply the Reagan campaign (for a price) with the only computerized list of all the state's voters. Mr. Gosselin, as G.O.P. chairman in 1974, did battle for the moderates against the archconservative Republican Governor, Meldrim Thomson Jr. Rut, he is moving to the Reagan camp not only out of trustration with President Ford's staff but also because of a conviction that Mr. Ford's “center of the party” cannot hold. William Loeb, publisher of The Manchester Union Leader, would have favored Mr. Reagan in any event, but he also argues that the former California Governor looks stronger against Mr. Ford after the Wyman defeat. “Reagan campaigned very briefly for Wyman,” Mr. Loeb said in an interview today. “Ford's trip across the state left him open to some devastating town‐by‐town comparison of the Republican vote for Wyman in 1974 and then in 1975. Nobody's mad at Ford, but nobody takes him seriously. That's what the vote showed.” • Patrick J. Cadell's last poll for the Durkin campaign found New Hampshire Republicans divided on the Presidential race as follows: 36 per cent for Mr. Ford, 30 per cent for Mr. Reagan and 34 per cent undecided. “If Eugene McCarthy had that kind of poll against Lyndon Johnson months before the 1968 primary,” said Richard G. Stearns, a Democratic strategist who worked in the Durkin campaign, “he would have gone out and started ordering his White House furniture.” The same pollster's New Hampshire survey on Democratic candidates gave the lead, at 14 per cent, to Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, who has been inclined to avoid the New Hampshire primary. Sargent Shriver placed second, with 10 per cent; Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana third with 6 per cent. Nobody else had more than 3 per cent; 63 per cent of the New Hampshire Democrats were undecided. • Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, not yet formally committed to running for President next year, is pleading with his supporters to send him $1‐million for more pre‐primary expenses, including $260,000 for “filming of critical TV messages and preparation of radio spots.” The latest Wallace mailing encloses a “copy” of a memorandum to Mr. Wallace from his campaign manager, outlining budget needs and warning, “If we don't raise the entire $1,044,000 in the next few weeks your campaign will suffer a major setback.” Mr. Wallace's letter includes the offer of “an autographed color photo of me operating my boat on Lake Martin;” an appeal to old backers to find three new supporters; and color‐coded envelopes of the sort many churches use, in which individuals are asked to enclose contributions for October, November and December. “Please join me tonight,” the Wallace letter ends, “in praying that we will be able to raise all of the money by Sept. 30.” • Jesse Unruh, the former Speaker of the California Assembly, has been so restless as State Treasurer that he recently toyed with the thought of running for a vacant Assembly seat near Sacramento in hope of regaining the powerful Speakership next year. He has settled instead for running Senator Jackson's campaign in the California primary. Mr. Unruh Was President Kennedy's closest ally in the state in 1960 and managed Senator Robert F. Kennedy's California primary campaign in 1968. “He has never backed a loser in a Presidential primary,” Senator Jackson said hopefully. • Representative Morris K. Udall's Presidential campaign will pick up endorsements in New York tomorrow from Ramsey Clark, the former United States Attorney Gen eral and Senate candidate in 1974, and from three Democratic colleagues in the House: Representative Otis G. Pike of Suffolk County, Richard L. Ottinger of Westchester and Jonathan B. Bingham of the Bronx. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen's Presidential campaign continues to shrink, meanwhile. The Texan is closing his New York campaign office and telling associates that he will vote against organized labor's “situs picketing” bill—a priority item for the building trades that would let a single striking union picket and stop work on big projects where other unions had been working. • Sargent Shriver refined his position on abortion yester day at the Democratic conference in Springfield, Mass. A Roman Catholic who says he does not believe in abortion, Mr. Shriver was expected in some rival quarters to take a rigid “right‐to‐life” campaign position. His distinction turns out to be a subtle one. Like other Democrats in the Presidential race, he accepts the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion; unlike the others, he will not pledge to “work vigorously” to block a constitutional amendment against abortion. His emphasis, Mr. Shriver said yesterday, will be on “developing a national system of life‐support clusters where a person with an unwanted pregnancy could make a choice about having her baby.”"
Parent and Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/05/archives/parent-and-child-teenage-affairs.html,"By the time the mass media explode a new social truth, it's so old, spread so far, accepted so commonly as to be already on the wane or absorbed totally into the porous morality of most Americans. Betty Ford's casual acceptance of the idea of her teen‐aged daughter's prospective affair is a perfect example of how we divide what we know into what is true and what is permissible to say out loud. The shock waves she created were like courtesy nods in the direction of eras long past. But even though the President's wife was calm about it all, and even though most parents would prefer to have their 15‐year‐olds in bed with a friend rather than imbibing hard drugs, stealing cars or running away to distant cities, the subject of adolescent sexuality is still a tender, raw spot on the bruised and bent soul of the older parent. Freud told us infants have sexual desires and arrangements. Sex is natural in puberty, said the clouds of psychiatrists that have rained across this country since World War II. From Holden Caulfield to Portnoy, things have gotten wilder and wilder, funnier if not better. Masters and Johnson, the pill, legal abortion, breakdown of parental authority, the women's movement have reduced the ideal of virginity, male and female, to the size of an appendix, a little organ without much of a future in the evolution of human anatomy. But large social currents aside, it's still a difficult thing when the young daughter who leaves rings around the bathtub, her shoes under the couch, and soup on her algebra homework, turns out to be less of an innocent than you (hiding your copy of “Fear of Flying” under a stack of National Geographics) had thought. If a casual inspection of that creature's underwear drawer reveals a container of pills, it's still, in 1975, something of a shock. Any parent who too easily smiles it off is bluffing. (Not, of course, that we didn't do it, too—but we were older, wiser; it was more of a commitment. What does a child know about love and protecting herself, and besides, what's sauce for the mommy goose could easily choke a gosling.) It's always been all right, even desirable, for young males to begin their sexual life early. My brother had a friend whose father, a doctor, arranged for an initiation rite with his receptionist. Most boys found their way to local bad girls or older women. The double standard fostered the myth that boys needed sex for their health and well‐being while nice girls took up horseback riding. What has changed for boys is the easy access there is now to all kinds of girls. There is probably less talk these days of scoring now that scoring is like picking beach plums on a hot August day. And modern teen‐aged girls are talking about boys in terms of their value as sex objects. Sometimes I overhear female conversations that seem to be about prize cattle. Locker‐room talk has definitely moved into the ladies' lounge. Sacred and profane love have become indistinguishable and both look a little the„ worse for wear. Young people suffer through emotional relationships at a time when their bones and cartilage are still growing and are easily crushed. In some ways, it must have been easier for boys when they could sneak off to the wrong side of the tracks. For females, the changes are massive. Their sexuality need not be kept hidden, used as a lure to keep a gentleman caller calling. They are not afraid of consequences, ruined reputations, or unwanted babies. For girls, the changing morality is filled with promise but, for parents, it's still a very confusing problem, arousing conflicting emotions that few of us have dealt with honestly or well. I have respectable, intelligent friends who know that their daughters at college are living with young men off‐campus. They are pleased for their children, delighted they are loved and loving. But when the young couple come home to visit, they insist that they sleep in separate rooms. The sham is not for the grandparents who live cities away or for younger siblings who have already visited the happy couple in their apartment off‐campus. The pretense is for the parents themselves whose joy in the new world of sexual mores exists in the abstract but not the particular. Illogical as this seems, it's all very understandable. Our images of ourselves as parents are scrapbooks of moments of passage: first shoes, first words, first school report, first haircut. But all of these moments signaling growth require our presence, our control, our encouragement. The first intercourse, the first affair, the first pill, the first moment of real sexuality—these happen without us. In fact, they imply, even demand, our withdrawal. Biologically, we have served our function but, like certain prehistoric remnants (i.e., the armadillo and the alligator), we insist on hanging around even though our time is over. Facing the sexuality of our children brutally faces us with the process of time, of one generation pushing the next off the globe. It forces us to see that, biologically, we have succeeded in our mission and all the rest is small talk. It means we have lost the power we once had, the status we had, over our children, the secret we didn't share with them: We had sex at night while they listened for the sounds behind closed doors. Now we listen, amazed that the roles should have changed. No wonder my friends evade this transition, gloss over it with separate bedrooms when the children come to visit. A large part of what I've learned as a parent is that we tend feel opposing emotions at the same time. So, with the emerging sexuality of our children come some dread and some pleasure. After all, we are the generation that knows that one of the signs of good parenting is sexually unrepressed children. We toilet‐trained them casually so as to civilize them with a velvet glove, not a hammer. We told them the truth about the facts of life so they would be free of the inhibitions and distortions that we had discovered prevented sexual fulfillment. It's ironic but human that, when we get what we wanted, we're not so sure it's what we wanted. Now, with (my informants tell me) at least 50 per cent of any graduating high‐school class participating in sexual liaisons, we, as parents, are confronted with the reality of the biological process long before we can easily accept it. “No, no.” the unconscious wails, “not yet.” A director of a preparatory school in Maine closed his eyes tightly when I asked him about the sexual activity on his campus. “I am a Mr. Magoo on the subject,” he said. “I prefer to stumble about and bang my shins rather than see anything I don't know what to do about.” Like most of us who are 35 or older, he is caught between the generations. He might even be somewhat jealous of the freedom his students feel but, at the same time, the more repressive voices of his childhood clang in his head, saying, “It's not right, it's not right.” If he asks himself why it's not right, he may retreat in confusion. “I don't know,” he would say. “Do you?” And I don't know either. It really doesn't matter much what mommy and daddy think. There is the argument against teen‐age sexuality based on the immaturity of the adolescent in all emotional areas. One psychiatrist told me of a promiscuous 13‐year‐old patient who slept with fellows almost every night of the week. She liked the idea of holding them in the dark. She liked the body warmth and the sharing of the blanket. She was willing to put up with the rest in order to have a live teddy bear to cuddle under the covers. That is nobody's idea of sexuality and we don't know how many young people who are having sexual relations are being pushed into them for nonsexual reasons. But this is equally true of the adult population. There are many grownups who use each other no better than the 13‐year‐old used her teddy‐bear boyfriends. Her youth is shocking only if we expect all our children to mature into sexually well‐adapted people. Waiting a long time to begin sexual activity did not particularly help the previous generation, whose multitudes of sexual cripples speak for a variety of errors in child‐rearing and cultural habits. Virginity was a protection only against pregnancy and venereal disease; it was no safeguard against impotence, frigidity and the full range of perversions. Anyway, it really doesn't matter whether we, as parents, approve or disapprove—the chances are good that teen‐agers will have early sexual relationships, will have seen and done everything before they have turned sweet 16. The sweetness of 16 (which was always a con) is gone forever. Facing the sexuality of our children brutally faces us with the process of time, of one generation pushing the next off the globe.’ Sexuality among teen‐agers has created some surprising new problems. For one thing, there is the marked increase in venereal disease which, unattended, is far more serious than children care to know. For another, the new sexual rules place demands for performance on girls or boys who may he shy or slow, or maturing at a different rate from their peers. There may be no reason now to say “no” unless the reason is “I don't want to,” and just such a strong assertion is hard for many young people who may find themelves undressed and in bed with a stranger when they really wish they were home having milk and cookies in the kitchen with their brothers and sisters. Peer pressure and social image have always deviled teenagers but now the stakes seem higher than ever and “going all the way” is thought to be a sign of that much‐desired adulthood. Many children think they must act cool and easy about their bodies when the truth is they are still awkward, uncomfortable and anxious. Many others separate sexual feelings from emotional attachment or feelings of love and, consequently, have great trouble making any kind of real commitment when they are no longer driven by sexual need. The new mores do create new problems. But nostalgia for the old ways is no more than sentimentality— they weren't very good, either. Many of the sexual currents that are out in the open in American society are discreetly, and thankfully, not discussed within the family. Parents and children go to see films that are explicit and stimulating in their sexual images; they just go on different evenings, each with their own friends. The idea of watching Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider in “Last Tango in Paris” with my daughters sitting beside me gives me cold shivers. We maintain a certain decorum, as if I don't know that they know what I know they know —and they know I do. It's a very complicated maneuver. in which we respect each other's privacy. Sadly enough, inevitably enough, modern family life is built on a system of secrets, a scaffold of what is and is not said aloud. Any parent who has walked into a room where a teenaged child is talking with friends and felt the sudden stillness, the averted eyes. knows exactly what I mean. Sexual secrets seem less threatening to the children's well‐being than the dope secrets or the alcohol secrets that fill the written or unwritten diaries of young people. We are visitors on a temporary visa when an adolescent talks with us about his or her real life and the chances are we are getting only half the story, only what they want us to know. One can only hope that, as a blind person might accept the beauty of a Picasso, so a child will accept the love that comes from a parent and a parent the love that comes from a child. Sometimes it does work out that way, and sometimes it doesn't. Much of the mystery of sex may be gone. Its taboos have been broken and adolescents use street language the way the pediatricians of my childhood used violet‐gentian on anything at all. But sex is still a taboo subject between the generations and, while abstract information can be discussed frankly, or gynecologists' names dropped into conversations with 9‐year‐olds, when a child reaches 13, certain harriers are drawn. Mothers and daughters do not sit around and discuss what platicular sexual positions please them. They each pretend the other doesn't know anything about it. From the child's point of view, this privacy serves to help the striving for independence, to help in the work of growing away from the parents, Besides, the ancient conflicts of Oedipus hang between parent and child, making free talk difficult. From the parent's point of view, the advantages of noncommunication are numerous. Privacy maintains the status quo: parent as parent, child as child. If one of my daughters did tell me that she had begun an affair, I hope I'd be able to ask her it she really wanted to do this, was responding to clues from her own body, not to pressure from her fellow or her friends. I hope I'd be able to tell her the six ways to delay the arrival of my grandchild and I'd hope and expect that she already knew them. I think then I would tell her to count on the usual mixture of joy and pain that always comes with love. I hope she'd be brave enough, daring enough, to experience all the feelings of anxiety, mixed with pleasure, obsession and jealousy, tenderness and anger that must accompany any relationship of meaning. Everyone must spend some time being a slave of love. But, please, I would ask her, don‐t forget your work, your mind, your other activities. Don't drown in this relationship. I would hope that, for her, the end of the affair would not be too destructive or too filled with regret and hurt, and I'd want her to remember that forever is mostly for fairy tales. I would tell her that sexual excitements anti satisfaction grow with experience and that she should not he disappointed if the beginnings don't meet her expectations—that she should be patient with herself and her friend and her physical pleasures will increase. And then I think I might go into my own room, close my door, and weep for the child whose genitals I had once wiped and covered with powder. ‘Masters and Johnson, the pill, legal abortion have reduced the ideal of virginity to the size of an appendix, a little organ without much of a future.’ A mother I know once told me that she divided all the people she knew into two categories. First, there were those who believed that everything in the world would work out well, that problems could be worked through and that, if you behaved virtuously, good things would happen to you. Then, there were those who believed that tragedy was imminent that nothing turned out the way it was planned, and being good had nothing to do with what happened to you in life—disaster was random, reasonless, and likely. As she looked over her two lists, my friend discovered that all of the trusters, those with shining eyes and faith in the future, had young children, either just beginning school, or in diapers, or in the womb, while those in the second, grimmer category all had teenagers or older children. The sampling in this amateur study may not have been pure enough for a sociologist's stamp of approval, but the insight strikes me as horribly accurate. Sexuality, affairs among teen‐agers, become a minor matter (like how many cavities does a fifth‐grade?? have?) compared to the larger threats to our offspring. The fact is that the American adolescent is subject to a variety of social tornadoes and becomes automatically a member of a subsociety that prefers to stay out in the storm rather than take shelter with us. Drugs, alcohol or religious and political extremes can mushroom into nightmares that make sexual experimentation seem as harmless as stamp‐collecting or other hobbies of the tranquil past. The other day, one of my daughters pointed a broom at me, cocked her head in the attitude of Patty Hearst and said, “Die, capitalist pig!” Ha, I laughed, or meant to laugh. Who, after all, knows where this innocent with her belief in justice for everyone may end? How can I choose her friends, hope she isn't insane enough to turn to violence, hope that she is insane enough to be comfortable with some of the insanities of the adult world, hope that the extremes of political cruelty on the left and the right don't drive her to cruelties of her own? My mother might have feared diseases contracted from t diet seats; I am afraid tit the cultural air. I'm afraid of gurus and freaks of meditation, astrology and health foods. I can stay up all night with images of disasters that have already happened to the children of friends, neighbors to the left and neighbors to the right. I know, and have heard of, victims of alcoholism, drug addiction ?? ?? depression joblessness, directionlessness. I know outcasts from broken communes, failed political groups, lost causes. and smashed rmtrriages— the possibilities are endless. (Overheard on a Nantucket tennis court: older man just beaten by a younger man. “You play a good game but ?? because your chitciren haven't het rayed you yet”) ‘Parents and children go to see films that are explicit and stimulating in their sexual images; they just go on different evenings, each with their own friends.’ Few of us with grown children have been spared a reflection of our own ina&quacies—a sense of betrayal is as common as parental pride. Our children have a way of developing lust those failures that torment us the most, and we must learn to accept whatever has come. Daughters of feminists have eight Children and bake bread: sons of firemen find pyromania pleasant activity. A Si cialist‐atheist friend of mine, an early member of the Abraham Lincoin Brigade that fought against Franco in Spain in the nineteen‐thirties, sighed when his son became a Zen Buddhist but allowed him to pitch a tent on his back lawn even though he firmly believed his son was dying from an overdose of one of the people's favorite opiates. A willingness to be vulnerahle is a necessity if one is to he a parent at all. The investment of oneself in another, a highly irrational act, makes one's own defenses thinner. Just like the juggler and the clown, the parent is exposed (his ambition, his failure) to himself and others. Pitted by rotten apples, a lot of par,nts are chased right off the stage while others applaud themselves like trained seals. I remember sitting around in my hobby socks blowing smoke rings at the ceiling, whispering and laughing with my friends at parental whims and wiles, reporting everything from minor comedy to high tragedy. We were trying to puzzle it out: Why were they the way they were? Why were they being that way to us? Why was there such a battle between up? Now I sit with friends and the conversations come quickly to the children's exploits. Why? we ask ach other. What happened? Sometimes there is good news, a child happy, giving, growing creative, warm and pleased to be alive. There may well be nothing in the world as good as that good news. Many of our children do reward us with fulfillment of our exact expectations. A mother I know wept when her daughter was admitted to medical school. She told everyone she knew, including parents of a child hospitalized for drug addiction. Competitive child‐rearing (though as safe a sport as hang‐gliding) is as American as cheating on the income tax. The dream of the young parent is that good parenting will produce a strong, kind, moral, successful, nearly perfect child, better than others, smarter than others, sensitive but no pushover—the ideal of a child reflecting and carrying on the good in the mother and father. The older parent fondly remembers those dreams so many compromises ago and is willing to settle for almost anything human at all. This country, of course, has odd time dimensions: pockets of places and people where things may be easier and the cultural calendar reads 1925, and other places where time seems to tumble forward into chaos and the year is 1995 (i.e, L.A.). Most of us struggle along in the present. The dream of a perfect child may become a reality from time to time and I do not doubt any who tell me they've got it. I only doubt that everyone has it. The sexuality of adolescents is then a red‐herring issue in the important matters between parent and child. Fashions in these matters change from time to time (every thousand years or so). In Romeo's and Juliet's time, the young people's tragedy was not sexual intimacy but adultcaused tribal problems. I imagine that if today's young people become unglued, destructive, R will not be because of early sexual activity. It will be, as always, because of the social, political, economic, emotional failures of our generation, which we can change no more than we can change our children. ■"
Supreme Court Is Facing a Year of Uncertainty,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/05/archives/supreme-court-is-facing-a-year-of-uncertainty.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 4—At 10 A.M. Monday the Justices of the Supreme Court will enter their marble‐columned courtroom for the official start of the new Court year. It will be a year of uncertainty, largely because of the health of Justice William O. Douglas, who suffered a stroke last Dec. 31. It will also be a year of great potential impact upon the nation's political system, and on the working lives of minorities and women. The role of Justice Douglas raises several questions, starting with his ability to continue on the bench and extending to the effect of his health on such critical issues and possibly close votes coming up as the death penalty case and the ability of the Court to prevent any loss of public confidence as a result of his health. To lawyers and law professors who watch the so‐called “Burger court” at work, the 1975–1976 Court year also appears uncertain for other reasons. Voting Pattern Unclear For one, the Court's voting patterns or blocs are unpredictable—a situation that some court‐watchers attribute to a lack of intellectual leadership among the Justices. For another, the Court's philosophy is not clear. While it has a reputation of being nonactivist, it has handed out such activist opinions as the one striking down antiabortion laws, making one “wonder,” as Prof. Dock Howard of the University of Virginia Law School puts it, “whether they won't do it again” on some other major issue. And, some experts say, there has been a lack of consistency, of “doctrinal development,” in several areas — “waffling” or “seesawing” on questions of sex discrimination, for instance, and standing to sue, according to Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the Columbia Law School professor and authority on sex discrimination and constitutional law. “I think, particularly because or the Douglas problem and the lack of any clear consistent bloc of votes, there's not going to be any clear consistent development during the coming year,” Eugene Gressman, an expert on Supreme Court procedure, said. He added that that was “not necessarily a criticism—some people might view that as an opportunity.” The Court, headed by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, is obviously and decidedly different both in its rulings and the issues it is facing from the Court headed by the late Earl Warren, with its years of bold judicial lawmaking in civil rights and other areas. But while some of the early predictions about the impact of four appointees of President Nixon on the Court have come true, most noticeably in the retreat from early decisions in certain areas of rights of criminal defendants, other predictions have not. Wide Range of Questions So the questions at the start of the Court term cover several areas and perspectives, such as how the Court will handle its major cases, what will happen regarding Justice Douglas and show the Burger Court will function as a distinct entity. The major cases either already accepted for review or expected to be accepted raise issues including the constitutionally of the new campaign financing legislation, the death penalty, the exclusion of pregnancy‐related disabilities from company disability benefits programs, the related issues of “last hired‐first fired” employment practices and seniority status set retroactively to make up for past discrimination and the abilit of courts to fashion housing desegregation orders that cross city and suburban boundaries. There are also cases of substantial importance involving the Federal Government's ability to mandate pay scales for state government employes, raising serious questions about states' rights; and raising questions left unanswered by the Court's decision on abortion, prisoners' rights, school desegregation and church‐state relations. Other cases involve a ban on advertising the prices of prescription drugs; the extent of the Federal courts' power to establish a mechanism to review the behavior of a local police force (Philadelphia's is the case in question); mandatory retirement because of age; the constitutionality of nonlawyer judges; and the procedures through which employes of the Federal Government can challenge alleged discrimination, an area in which the NAACP Legal and Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., is waging a major legal attack. Campaign Finance Law Of these cases the challenge to the new campaign reform legislation is perhaps the most crucial in terms of immediacy and potential impact on national affairs. It is also one of the more difficult, in that it involves both the widesp??ead view in the wake of Watergate that new campaign practices are needed and also a substantial potential intrusion into the free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The new legislation sets limits on campaign contributions and spending, it poses certain disclosure requirements and it establishes a Federal Election Commission to implement the law. The challengers, including Senator James BuckIley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, democrat of Minnesota, and the New York Civil Liberties Union contend among other things that the provisions unconstitutionally limit speech. The United States Court of Appeals here upheld nearly all the provisions this summer. The challengers then requested the Supreme Court to review the case. The Court is expected to agree to review it and to expedite the hearing. A reversal of the appellate court could create havoc in the forthcoming elections. An at firmation would mean a massive restructuring of the campaign process. The difficulty of the case is indicated by the way in which the Justice Department plans to respond before the Supreme Court. It will file a brief on behalf of the new election commission and will defend the new law, with one exception—the portion that gives the commission enforcement powers, powers that the department thinks it should have. The department will also file a more neutral kind of brief pointing out the various issues at stake. Benefits for Pregnancy The case involving benefits for disabilities related to pregnancy has a potential impact almost as large in another area and similarly difficult legal problems. Essentially, it raises the question of whether company plans that exclude pregnancyrelated disabilities from coverage are illegal sex discrimination under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act. The lower court, in a ruling similar to rulings by other lower courts, found that it was. The Supreme Court previously ruled that exclusion of pregnancy from a disability plan is not unconstitutional. The Eoual Rights Amendment, if ratified, is likely to be interpreted much as Title 7's ban on sex discrimination; thus, if the Court does not agree that such programs are illegal under Title 7, they would probably not be considered illegal under the amendment. Beyond that, if the Court finds that such programs are legal, similar reasoning could conceivably be used to defeat challenges to other kinds of pregnancy‐related practices —such as dismissing someone because of pregnancy. The issue of “last hired, first fired”—a related issue in a pending case and the main issue in one or more cases that the Court is being asked to hear—is of importance to minorities and women hired as a result of antidiscrimination efforts. And, it is particularly important at a time of economic difficulty. On issues such as the death penalty, the health of Justice Douglas may be especially significant. In an earlier decision, the Court struck down capital punishment, 5‐to‐4, Mr. Douglas voting with the majority. A 4‐to‐4 vote leaves standing a lower court decision. The Court has held over for reargument this year a number of cases, such as the death penalty, in which a close vote migh be expected. None of the critical cases in this group was scheduled for argument in October, apparently because of Mr. Douglas's health. A number of observers, such as Prof. Yale Kamisar of the University of Michigan Law School, are predicting that the Court may “scrap” or at least limit the “exclusionary rule,” which forbids the use as evidence of material obtained through illegal means. Many observers say there seems to be a majority, including all the Nixon appointees, against the exclusionary rule. Some Divergence Seen On other issues, however, students of the court—and apparently some of the Justices themselves—view the unity of the four Nixon appointees as substantially less strong. Statistics from last year's rulings back this up. Court watchers have noted both Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Justice Harry A. Blackmun increasingly parting from Chief Justice Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist. Mr. Powell is “showing signs,” according to several law professors, of becoming more like the late Justice John Marshall Harlan, a scholarly, conservative‐minded but independent Justice who had great intellectual impact on the Court. Mr. Blackmun, gave an interview to the St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press this summer in which he said that if the Court were to be rated from “conservative” to “liberal.” Mr. Rehnquist would he most conservative, then Mr. Burger, Justice Byron R. White, Mr. Powell, and finally, at the center of the nine himself."
Jersey Consumer Notes,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/06/archives/jersey-consumer-notes-more-physicians-losing-their-licenses-in.html,"The State Board of Medical Examiners said that beginning last year there had been a sharp rise in the number of physicians whose medical licenses to practice in New Jersey had been permanently or temporarily taken away. A spokesman for the 15‐member board said that 17 doctors' licenses had been either revoked, suspended or voluntarily surrendered so far this year, and that last year the total had been 29. There are approximately 15,000 doctors licensed to practice medicine in the state. Before 1974, the spokesman said, there usually were only several such cases a year. In 1973, two licenses were revoked and two were suspended. In 1972, six were revoked and two were suspended. The violations that prompted the board's action ranged from nonpayment of state registration fees to criminal activity. In most cases, according to the spokesman, the doctors were involved in violations that the board considered “injurious to the health, safety and welfare of patients.” The spokesman added that in many cases in which doctors voluntarily surrendered their licenses they did so to save the trouble of defending themselves against enough evidence to cause their licenses to be revoked. The State Division of Consumer Affairs, the parent body of the medical examiners board, announced several New Jersey license revocations last week, including tnat of a New York doctor, Robert S. Stone, who pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, and a former assistant Camden County medical examiner, Louis C. Reigert, who acknowledged that he had failed to submit required reports on 31 autopsies, some of them involving homicide. In a third case, Sherwin H. Raymond, a physician who served two years in jail for performing illegal abortions, and who is serving a Federal prison sentence after attempting to sell submachine guns, lost his medical license for the second time. • As with the recent increase in malpractice suits, which have been driving up malpractice insurance rates, anthorities find it difficult to pin down just what has caused the jump in medical license revocations and suspensions. Speculation has attributed the rise in malpractice suits to, among other things, greater consumer awareness, more doctors performing, poorly, and a change of emphasis by lawyers from automobile liability to medical malpractice cases, as no‐fault insurance became effective in many places. A recent study sponsored by a group of 1,578 Michigan physicians asserted that in the Detroit area there was a clear relationship between the advent of no‐fault auto insurance there in 1973 and the abnormal rise in malpractice suits starting the following year. New Jersey's no‐fault insurance program also went into effect in 1973. The revocation or suspension of medical licenses in New Jersey was attributed by one board official to the board's more “active” inquity into the actions of errant doctors. “We're geared to more and more involvesment,” he said, noting that the board recently began to meet three times a month instead of once monthly. • The State Consumer Affairs Director, Virginia Long An nich, wants a prescription required to purchase hearing aids. She said that current legislation provided a “potential ripoff” because hearing aid retailers were also “the ones telling people whether they need one or not.” Mrs. Annich said that legislation would be sponsored next month by Assemblywoman Betty Wilson of Union County and that the measure would have the support of Attorney General William F. Hyland. “Many people told me they were sold hearing aids they later found they did not need,” Mrs. Wilson said “And many of the sales were at exorbitant prices.”"
Doctor Tests State Law by Arranging Adoption of Patients' Unwanted Babies,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/06/archives/doctor-tests-state-law-by-arranging-adoption-of-patients-unwanted.html,"HACKENSACK, Oct. 5—A prominent New Jersey physician who successfully challenged the state's antiabortion laws is now the target of a Bergen County grand jury investigation into charges that he is illegally arranging the adoption of unwanted babies that he delivers. Evidence against the pysician, Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood Cliffs, has been presented to the grand jury by the County Prosecutor's office. The jury is scheduled to convene here tomorrow to hear more testimony. Dr. Livingston, an obstetrician and gynecologist, expects to be indicted. He said in an interview that while he wished there were some other way to challenge New Jersey's adoption laws, he hoped his indictment would provide the courts with a test case. Jury Weighs Charges Specifically, the grand jury is weighing charges that Dr. Livingston violated a state law that prohibits anyone other than a relative or a state‐approved adoption agency from arranging an adoption. Defendants charged with unlawfully facilitating an adoption for a fee, such as crimes involving black‐market babies, can be indicted for a high misdemeanor, which is a serious felony in New Jersey and involves a long prison term upon conviction. However, Dr. Livingston is not accused of receiving any fee for arranging any adoptions, so any prospective indictment would most likely be a simple misdemeanor, which still carries a jail sentence. but which is regarded as a lesser crime. All told, Dr. Livingston has arranged 10 adoptions in the last eight years, all of them involving prospective mothers whom he talked out of having an abortion and adoptive parents who were being treated by him for infertility. His only fee is the normal delivery charge, which usually runs about $500 for the adoptive parents, depending upon their income. Joseph C. Woodcock Jr., the Bergen County Prosecutor, said that the evidence against Dr. Livingston would he given to the grand jury “fairly and squarely” and that it was “then up to its members to decide whether to hand up an indictment.” “No man can hold himself above the law,” Mr. Woodcock said in an interview. “So long as the state's adoption laws are valid, they must be upheld.” For Dr. Livingston, art acknowledged expert in the treatment of infertility and a leader of a medical drive in New Jersey to provide inexpensive abortions for women, the new criminal action against him represents the latest episode in a medical career that has been in part devoted to challenging laws that he contends conflict with the best interests of his patients. In 1971, he held a news conference in Newark to announce that he had just performed an illegal abortion on a 33‐year‐oid mother of 11 children and challenged state law enforcement authorities to do something about it. They did and the following year he was indicted by a Bergen County grand jury for violating the state's abortion statute. But the indictment was dismissed following the United States Supreme Court's ruling in January, 1973, that no state had the right to interfere in an abortion performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Dr. Livingston is now waiting for the police to arrest him again. As he absent‐mindedly gazed at antiabortionist “right to life” demonstrators who picket his clinic every Saturday, he recalled how he came to arrange adoptions and how he is now prepared to fight for what he insists is a physician's right to continue to arrange them. Dr. Livingston operates one of the country's argest outpatient clinics that specialize in abortions, sterilization, gynecology, obstetrics and the treatment of infertility. Young women come to him seeking to abort an unwanted pregnancy, while others seek to find out why they and their husbands cannot conceive and have the children they want. For Dr. Livingston, the conflicting interests were resolved by simply acting as a go‐between for prospective mothers who were too far into their pregnancies to be aborted (he will not perform an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy) and couples who wanted children but had failed to conceive. Many of Dr. Livingston's abortion patients strongly opposed giving birth and placing the child for adoption through an agency because they refused to submit to the extensive background investigations that adoption agency case workers make into the mother's and father's background and the circumstances of the birth. They feared the castigation of their parents and their peers, the abandonment of the baby to an unknown parent and the humiliation involved. According to Dr. Livingston, some of his abortion patientss would give birth and agree; to adoption if it could be done secretly and if it did not involve an adoption bureaucracy. As for couples who want to conceive. Dr. Livingston said many were told by agencies that there would he anywhere from a three‐to‐four‐year waiting period for a norma, white baby and that even then there would never be any assurances that one would be available. Officials in the adoption unit of the State Department of Institutions and Agencies confirmed this. They said that more than 2.000 couples had applied to adopt from a pool of fewer than 40 babies. Black‐Market Babies Some parents do not wait, and pay thousands of dollars for illegal black‐market babies. Couples fortunate enough to obtain a baby from an agency often have to pay 10 per cent of their annual income for it. Then, of course, abortion and birth control mean that there are fewer and fewer babies available every year, particularly white ones. One couple who adopted a child through Dr. Livingston were married in 1970, purchased a home in a Bergen County suburb, and prepared to raise a big family, just like the ne each of them came from. In an interview, the mother, a woman of about 30 who agreed to discuss her case provided that she was not identifed, said that she regarded Dr. Livingston as a saint. “I would trust my life with him,” she said. “I was born to be a mother,” she said as her adopted child entwined himself around her legs. “Dr. Livingston made it possible for me to be one.” The woman said that she and her husband could not conceive and that their prospects for having a chid were adjudged to be hopeless, despite repeated operations, therapy and attempts at artificial insemination. Illegal Channels They tried an adoption agency, but were told they had to be married three years before they could even apply for a baby. But she was nearing 30, she said, and wanted to be a young mother. “Then one day,” she said, “Dr. Livingston called me and asked me if I wanted a healthy white baby. Did I? I answered, ‘You bet I do’ “ “Two months later, we went to a parking lot near a hospital where Dr. Livingston had delivered this child four days earlier. The mother was there with the baby, and so was a lawyer. “She was so young, I said hello to her and she said: ‘Here, take him. The baby is yours now.’ And she handed him to me ever so gently. There were tears rolling down her cheeks. “I told her we would love him forever. It was the most beautiful moment in my life.” Later, the adoption was approved in court even though it had not been arranged by an agency. “The Prosecutor's investigators have told me they're not happy with what the doctor is doing,” she said. “And that it may go to a grand jury. But I don't think they want me as a witness.” Tragic Consequences While the woman's adoption has been adjudged a success by the courts, another arranged by Dr. Livingston has had tragic consequences and is the principal reason why he is in trouble with the law again. The case involves the child of a 15‐year‐old mother whom Dr. Livingston arranged to be adopted by a couple he had been treating for infertility. But attar five months, the girl wanted her child back and sought legal help to get it. The girl contended that she had been duped. In addition, since Dr. Livingston cannot provide the insulation between mother and adoptive parents that agencies insist upon, the girl succeeded in finding the parents. At one point, the parents reported that the girl attempted to break in and seize the child from their home. At a subsequent court hearing, the judge ruled that the adoption was legal and that the adoptive parents could keep the child, a decision which precipitated an emotional court outburst by the girl and her mother. That decision. however, prompted the girl to have a complaint filed with the Bergen County Prosecutor charging that Dr. Livingston had illegally taken her child away. While law enforcement officials in the Prosecutor's office can sympathize with Dr. Livingston's apparent altruism, they also contend that “no one can take the law into his own hands.” Moreover, they contend that their investigation threatens the girl, the adoptive parents and the child and only proves the validity of the law that would protect them. More importantly, they contend that while Dr. Livingston is compelled to accept the mother's version of the circumstances surrounding her conception, an adoption agency is not. Professional case workers determine the identity and background of both mother and father. The antiabortionist pickets outside Dr. Livingston's office are restricted by court order to demonstrating for a few hours on Saturdays. The court has prohibited the pickets from shouting such things as “murderer” and “butcher” at young women patients, as Dr. Livingston said they used to do. Now, they just carry placards that say such things as “Adoption not Abortion.” “That's what I say too,” Dr. Livingston said yesterday as he silently observed a handful of demonstrators file back and forth across the street. “But do you think you could ever get them to agree with me now?”"

Summary of Various Actions Taken by the U.S. Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/07/archives/summary-of-various-actions-taken-by-the-us-supreme-court.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6—The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION It consolidated and agreed to hear two cases based on the new Missouri abortion law, involving issues left undecided by the Court's 1973 abortion decisions. In Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, No. 74‐1151, the lower court upheld a variety of sections including requirements for consent by parent or spouse. In Danforth v. Planned Parenthood, No. 74‐1419, the lower court struck down certain provisions posing new standards of care and potential criminal liability for doctors. News Article, Page 1 CRIMINAL LAW The Court vacated the stay that Justice Douglas previously granted pending appeal of an order that would turn over to a state prosecutor records of a Federal grand July involving C. Arnholt Smith, the financier and associate of former President Richard M. Nixon (C. Arnholt Smith et al. v. U. S. and County of San Diego, No. A‐230). The Court accepted for review two petitions by defendants for the limited purpose of considering whether an accused who, following his Arrest, asserts his right to silence and to counsel may subsequently be questioned in court about, among other things, why he did not protest his innocence at some point prior to trial; and, Whether a witness for the defense who was arrested along with the defendant then on trial may be asked the same thing. (Doyle v. Ohio, 75‐5014, Wood v. Ohio, 75‐5015.)

COURT TO REVIEW VOTING FUND LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/07/archives/court-to-review-voting-fund-law-justices-accept-challenges-to.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6—The Supreme Court, on the opening day of its new Court year, agreed today to a full review of the new campaign financing legislation that restructures the way the nation's political campaigns are waged. The Court accepted the case just two and a half weeks after the challengers filed their appeal from a lower court decision that upheld most parts on this new legislation. Apparently the quick acceptance of the case will make possible a final decision in time for at least the major portion of the 1976 election campaign. The Court, which met today with all nine Justices present—including William O. Douglas, whose frail health has cast an aura of uncertainty about the Court's proceedings—also set the stage for a review of the legislative aftermath of its landmark 1973 decisions striking down anti‐abortion laws as unconstitutional. It agreed to hear appeals in two cases based on the 1974 Missouri abortion law—a law that sets certain requirements of consent by parent or spouse, prohibits one commonly used abortion technique and prescribes strict standards for doctors and penalties for violating the standards. Pro‐abortion activists had sought review of the law, both because it raises issues not decided by the 1973 rulings and because other states have adopted new abortion laws with some similarly restrictive provisions. The Court also agreed to consider more than two dozen other cases, involving matters ranging from environmental to criminal law. One involved a matter that is considered crucial to effective antipollution efforts: Whether air pollution standards formulated by the states in accordance with the Clean Air Act must take into account the technological or economic feasibility of the standards. The court declined to review three libel cases involving claims against newspaper publishers, for instance. The lower court decisions in those cases were generally attacked by the newspapers as intrusions on the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. So, while the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the cases simply leaves the lower court rulings in effect and sets no national precedent, the refusal was viewed by some First Amendment advocates as a disappointment. The new campaign financing legislation involved in the case accepted today—one of the most significant issue that the Court is likely to decide this year—limits both expenditures and contributions during campaigns and requires disclosure of some data. It also creates a Federal Election Commission, which is already functioning. Twelve challengers, including Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, and former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, Democrat of Minnesota, are contending that the new laws violate several provisions of the Constitution, particularly the First Amendment. The Court allotted four hours for argument “to be evenly divided between the appellants and the appellees.” It denied requests by Senators Hugh Scott, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, for oral argument in their own behalf as intervenors; however, it said they could seek part of the two hours allotted the appellees. Argument is expected to take place in mid‐November. Abortion Law Cases The two abortion cases involve different aspects of the same law. In one case, with Judith Mears of the American Civil Liberties Union and Frank Susman representing the challengers, a three‐judge Federal court upheld a variety of the statute's provisions, including the consent requirements, a provision that terminates the parent's rights in the fetus if it lives and the prohibition of abortion by “saline amniocentesis” after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The challengers' written arguments to the Supreme Court contend: “To argue, as appellees have here below, that this legislation does not prohibit abortion is specious.” They also argue that review of the Missouri law is important because of the passage of other laws as well, saying that review is “necessary so that state and local legislative bodies will not continue cavalierly to pass legislation which violates the spirit, intent and meaning” of the Court's earlier rulings and of the Constitution. The second case is one in which the three‐judge court struck down as unconstitutional the parts of the law that require doctors to take the same care of the fetus that is aborted as of a fetus intended to be born alive and subjecting doctors to manslaughter charge and damages if they do not.

National Study Finds Many Unable to Get Abortion in '74 Despite Supreme Court's Easing of Curbs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/07/archives/national-study-finds-many-unable-to-get-abortion-in-74-despite.html,"Despite an increase in the number of legal abortions performed following the Supreme Court decision of January 1973, that overturned restrictive abortion laws, last year between 30 and 50 per cent of women believed to need an abortion were unable to get one, according to the findings of a nationwide study released yesterday. In 1972, before the Court's ruling, between 50 and 70 per cent of the estimated need for abortions was unmet by legitimate health services, the study showed. As with other health services, the greatest inequity between need for abortion services and ability to obtain them was found among poor and rural women. The study, sponsored by The Alan Guttmacher Institute of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, revealed that only 15 per cent of public hospitals, which traditionally serve the poor, had performed any abortions by the first quarter of 1974, a year after the court ruled that laws that barred women from obtaining abortions during the first two–thirds of pregnancy were unconstitutional. In fact, the survey showed, United States hospitals in genral reported performing slight ly fewer abortions in each succeeding quarter of 1973. In stead, more than half the approximately 892,000 legal abortions performed last year were done in nonhospital abortion clinics, most of which demand payment in advance. A further problem with abortion clinics, according to Dr. Christopher Tietze, principal investigator for the study, is that they are concentrated in large metropolitan areas, forcing many women to travel far from home to obtain their services. Cases Are Concentrated In 1973, New York and California provided half of all the reported abortions, the survey showed, while five states—Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Utah and West Virginia — and 103 metropolitan areas performed few or no abortions. Dr. Tietze said that subsequent information had indicated that abortion services had since opened in some of these areas, but that most were still unable to meet a significant proportion of the local need for abortions. The estimate of need used in the report was derived from the number of abortions performed among New York City residents in 1971 (used as the high estimate) and among California residents in 1973 (used as the low estimate). Following the change in New York's abortion law in inid1970, abortion services for poor and paying patients were widely established and publicized in the city. In 1971, about 40 city women out of every 1,000 aged 15 through 44, obtained abortions. In California, where abortion laws were more narrowly applied, 27 abortions were performed per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The authors of the study believe that these estimates of abortion need are low, since in both areas there were undoubtedly some women who, for reasons of ignorance, misinformation, financial difficulties or hospital restrictions, were unable to obtain the abortions they wanted. Nonetheless, based on the New York and California rates, the author estimated that, nationally, between 1.3 and 1.8 million women were believed to have needed abortions last year. Services Lacking This would mean that between 400,000 and 900,000 women who needed abortions last year were unable to obtain them. Poor women were estimated to make up one–third of the total abortion need but nearly half of the unmet need. At a news conference yesterday, Dr. Frederick S. Jaffe, president of the Guttmacher Institute, who was a co‐author of the study, said that while the nation's health care system generally discriminated against the poor, “abortion is one service that enjoys constitutional protection.” “The American health system should be called into account on this,” Dr. Jaffe remarked. “It can't treat abortion as just another measure of the inequities in health care.” Dr. Tietze estimated on the basis of other studies that relatively little of the unmet need for abortions had been satisfied through illegal (nonmedical) procedures. Rather, he said, “most of the unmet need ends up in the cradle.” Dr. Tietze said that a major reason for the continuing disparity between abortion supply land need was that “a lot of public officials who think abortion is morally wrong have translated their beliefs into public policy” and that others have been “intimidated” by the activities of antiabortion groups."
"As Rich, Divorced Mayor of Italian Town, She's an Exception",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/10/archives/as-rich-divorced-mayor-of-italian-town-shes-an-exception.html,"PORTO SANTO STEFANO, Italy—If there is one thing that makes an Italian voter a little suspicious, its a rich politician. If the politician is rich and a divorced woman, then the chances of success might well be regarded as dim. But there are even exceptions in political life in Italy, where one party has dominated things for 30 years. And the most famous exception around these days is the Mayor of this area, Susanna Agnelli, a 53‐year‐old mother of six, the granddaughter of the man who founded the giant automobile company Fiat and the sister of the man who runs it now. She came to this coastal area northwest of Rome about 12 years ago, realized that the local politicians were sitting on their hands, started to grumble and then decided to get into politics herself. She was elected to the City Council as an independent in 1970, became Mayor last year and won re‐election in August. “There are obviously some pluses and minuses when you are both the Mayor and an Agnelli,” she said as she lifted her bare feet onto a canvas cot on her terrace overlooking the Tireno Sea. “On the plus side, people think I am in a position where I might be able to get more things done. On the minus side, they look at you as a privileged person who is not going to understand their problems. “Now, after 15 months as Mayor, I think I have given the people here the sensation that somebody honest can look after their interests. That's the most important thing. The rich don't like me very much because I have stopped their illegal building. And I think the poor realize I do care.” Her manner was relaxed and her dress casual—faded blue jeans, an open‐neck shirt and a red, short‐sleeved pullover. Her phone only occasionally stopped ringing. The issue of the day was buses. She had just returned to her ranch‐style villa from a meeting on the question of how some of the children would go from Porto Santo Stefano to a neighboring town for classes. Some local lights thought the train would be cheaper. The parents insisted on buses. By the end of the day, after one crucial telephone call, the Mayor had solved the problem and persuaded businessmen in the area to donate two buses to the community. Defer to the Mayor “I don't have much time for social life,” she said. “And I don't get the chance to spend as much time in New York City as I would like. This is a full‐time job but I do have guests here at times—Queen Juliana of the Netherlands has a house here and comes over in the summer and others drop by.” Porto Santo Stefano is that kind of place. Many wealthy people have built homes in the area, often on land that raised questions of legality. But after the summer, they leave the day‐to‐day problems of sewage, schools, hospitals and pollution fall to the locals and, of course, the Mayor. So they come to the Town Hall, in the picturesque harbor, to the office of the Mayor, known to her friends as “Suni.” There is open house for two hours every day, an innovation for these parts and a technique that helps keep her in touch with the voters. “They complain about water shortages,” she said. “They feel they are being badly treated because they want to build a house where it is not really allowed and I have to say no. “They often do not understand because they see all the homes of the rich that went up some time ago. It's difficult to tell them that the law has been changed and they can't do it anymore. “Sometimes they want me to look into their pensions. Or they may want me to find a way to get their brother who works for, say, the Finance Ministry, sent from the north to the south. Or they have a child who is sick or they complain about a local teacher.” She has had her successes —like the buses, the new library and the recent decision to build a new swimming pool because of polluted seas—and she has also made an impact on Italian politics. She is a well‐known figure and several politicians agree that her well‐publicized mayoral career may well inspire women in Italy to take a more active role in political life. There are now about 200 women among the 8,500 mayors throughout the country, hardly a representative share. But that is a large increase over recent years and, as Mayor Agnelli put it, “People in Italy sort of think that I am going to be the real thing that is going to make women try harder to go into politics.” All this is not to suggest that Miss Agnelli—she was divorced from Count Urbano Rattazzi about four years ago and uses her maiden name—is a raving feminist. In fact, she has little sympathy with the movement because she feels that much of what the feminists are up to in Italy is “nonsense.” “The Italian feminists are pretty bad here,” she said. “And they are pretty silly. I am not a feminist myself at all. I think all those feminists are all so boring. “Here the feminists had a great thing about abortion. Their arguments became codfused—they did not want anything to do with men but they wanted abortions. I said that if you don't want males, why worry about abortions? Just forget both. They are always so aggressive. Sees Some Changes “There has not been much progress on jobs for women,” Miss Agnelli continued. “In many cases, husbands just insist that their wives not work in Italy. “Still, there are many more women who think they should take an interest in public life. It is changing. It is difficult for many women—most women are shy. I am myself, too.” Miss Agnelli looks on New York City as a fascinating place to be and has, in fact, spent many months there in the past. She will go back to New York next Wednesday for five days to help publicize her book, “We Always Wore Sailor Suits,” published by Viking. The book, widely read in Italy, is a memoir of her youth up to her marriage and of her life under Mussolini's dictatorship. The title reflects her experience as a privileged child, when she and her brothers and sisters were dressed in sailor suits, blue in winter and white in summer. Miss Agnelli, who said she did not plan to write a sequel, has been a freelance writer; often writing profiles for Italian magazines and newspapers. She also caused a stir in 1969, when she went to Vietnam for the International Red Cross and then wrote an article saying the United States would lose the war. She did not write it out of any antagonism for America—she is a great fan of the States. Her children, now ranging in age from 19 to 26, were educated there because of the failings of the university system in Italy. Right now, the failings in this part of Italy are upper most on her mind. She may turn to national politics in time and perhaps run for the Italian Parliament in the next voting in 1977. “I really haven't made up my mind,” she said over a glass of the local white wine. “I'll just wait and see. There is, still a lot to do here. But at least we've solved the problem of the buses.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/11/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Newspaper photos have revealed an unlikely link between three Americans: an assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald; an abortionist, Dr. Kenneth Edelin, and an urban terrorist, Patricia Hearst. Each has been photographed with the raised‐fist salute. What is the meaning of the fist? Does it reveal some deep bond between these three people who have never spoken to one another? What does it mean for our society? The raised fist, that distortion of the human hand and spirit, symbolizes the most serious threat to human society and its progress that has ever gained sway over men's minds. It is the concept of violence as a legitimate human resource. We see this infection everywhere in the world today and the lesson is clear to anyone who raises his head above the deafening propaganda. Violence begets violence. Violence defends violence and those who use it for personal or ideologic goals are co‐opted into its inevitable spiral. It is the master adhesive that holds together those states that first raised assassination, terror and abortion to the level of civic virtue. These states have not escaped its inevitable totalitarian consequences, nor can we unless we face the problem squarely. The infection cannot be controlled unless we reject it completely. Totalitarian control over any individuals will eventually lead to slavery for all, and the Supreme Court's decision to classify all unborn children as slaves subject to violent destruction by the medical profession represents a giant step toward a totalitarian state. The Court cannot raise the fist in one area without accepting it in others. If we are to insist on social prowess, political change and national security measures free of violence, we cannot have millions degraded by a more sinister violence under the guise of personal privilege. The human hand was designed to create, to care, to caress and to heal. Its power is crippled by the fist and individual creativity is trapped by its narrow uses; just as the real power in any society is stunted and corrupted by violence. America has a mission in our time, a clear imperative to reverse the retrogressive trend in human affairs signified by the fist. It is our mission to show the world how to create, to heal, to caress and to care. First, let us restore the Constitution with a human‐life amendment, demonstrating our sensitivity for the defenseless and our absolute respect for individual human rights. Then our individual acts and national policy should be guided by the principle that every human life should achieve its greatest potential. This goal is the burden of all free men. BART T. HEFFERNAN, M.D. Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sept. 25, 1975 The Right to Bail To the Editor: According to your Sept. 22 news article on Patricia Hearst, the Federal Bail Reform Act provides that the defendant in a noncapital case must be released pending trial unless it is unlikely that he or she will return to face the charges. The description of the statutory provision is, literally accurate but misleading. The act requires that some “condition of release” must be allowed even when there is a possibility of flight. In such cases the condition of release usually imposed is a bail bond in a high amount so that the defendant will find it difficult or impossible to obtain a bondsman even if he has the means to pay the premium. But the defendant may not be jailed without any chance of release unless he has been convicted after trial or plea of guilty, and then only if there is a risk of flight or danger if he were allowed to remain free pending sentencing or appeal. The purpose of the Bail Reform Act of 1966 was to encourage the use of methods less onerous than bail bonds to insure the accused's appearance for trial. The act specifically provides for release on personal recognizance or to the custody of responsible members of the community and several other alter natives to the imposition of a money bond. However, the availability to the accused of bail in a reasonable amount, if some other “condition of release” will not assure his presence at the trial, is a basic right in Federal noncapital cases. As the Supreme Court wrote in Stack v. Boyle, “Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the presumption of innocence, secured only after centuries of struggle, would lose its meaning.” FRANKLIN S. BONEM New York, Sept. 24, 1975 On Punishing a City To the Editor: Vincent K. Hubbard [letter Oct. 1] has made the monstrous suggestion that New York be allowed “to sink” in the interests of gaining humility. It seems that Mr. Hubbard, a transplanted Tennessean, has taken umbrage at “the more vocal” New Yorkers who, he claims, have a snobbish attitude toward others living west of the Hudson and have even sought to tell them how to conduct their local affairs. To slap the wrists of these voluble villains, he proposes that the city be allowed to go broke. If Mr. Hubbard knew more about New Yorkers, he'd know that almost everyone here is vocal: children, schoolteachers, policemen, ministers, taxi drivers, old people, shopkeepers, city bond holders (large and small), and all the other assorted denizens of this great melting pot which has opened its arms in welcome to allcomers, including Tennesseans. Articulation isn't a crime in this country; neither is having nasty thoughts about other parts of the country. Nevertheless, Mr. Hubbard advocates a punishment for those infractions. In his orchestration, all New Yorkers, the humble as well as the proud, should suffer because some have seen fit to tell others how to handle their business. A city can't be punished—only the people living in it, as their schools cease functioning, their stores close, their jobs end, their savings vanish—and they begin to starve. I wonder how many of these people who are to take the brunt of this disaster, if it occurs, have been guilty of giving advice to other communities. I don't happen to know any Tennesseans, but judging from the evidence at hand, and borrowing for a moment Mr. Hubbard's logic mechanisms, it's obvious that all Tennesseans have enlarged spleens and therefore the entire state should be carted off to the hospital for corrective surgery —at the individual's expense. DAVID D. MICHAELS New York, Oct. 1, 1975 To Sentence a Criminal To the Editor: State Senator Ralph Marino's suggestion that New York City judges are soft on crime, citing the disparities between sentences imposed by upstate and downstate judges, presents a false picture of the criminal‐justice system. New York City judges are virtually forced to promise lower sentences to criminals to stave off the collapse of the criminal courts, and they accomplish this by widespread plea bargaining arrangements. Upstate courts are not so crowded and can more often proceed to a speedy trial of major felony cases than can the judges in big cities. Senator Marino's simplistic proposal to equalize sentences around the state by depriving judges of discretion in sentencing will destroy our civilized concept that the punishment should fit the crime and the criminal. The 2 to 3 per cent disparity in sentences between upstate and downstate courts does not justify comparing apples and oranges, as the Senator has done, and saying that they are both “fruit.” A little more light and less heat is what we need to solve our crime problems. THOMAS RUSSELL JONES Justice, N.Y. State Supreme Court Brooklyn, Oct. 6, 1975 • Citizens' Examples To the Editor: The Federal deficit is the highest in our history; many states and cities are nearly broke, while New York City is actually bankrupt and totters on default. My question: By what logic is the individual citizen expected to be solvent? ALFRED GESCHEIDT Chappaqua, N. Y., Sept. 30, 1975 To Teach the Children To the Editor: Ronald Kerwin's Sept. 30 letter on teachers, jobs and teacher education takes a very shortsighted view of a complex problem. In no other profession has there been, such sharp, immediate and drastic reaction as there has been to teacher supply and demand. In 1966, when New York City had a teacher shortfall of over 2,000, I was associate director of an Intensive Teacher Training Program (I.T.T.P.), whi.ch attempted to “train” college graduates for teaching positions. Now that there is a surplus of teachers in some but by no means in all areas, Mr. Kerwin proposes in effect the dismantling of teacher education programs altogether and a moratorium on the preparation of new teachers. The hysteria of one decade presses colleges to prepare teachers for certificates and licenses much more rapidly than is prudent. The hysteria of the next proposes to eliminate teacher education programs entirely. Neither approach is sound. Colleges should have the opportunity to develop sustained standards of excellence to assure effective teachin urban schools. The various schools and departments of education of the City University have undertaken a partnership arrangement with many of the public high schools in a program of mutual help which offers good potential for establishing new patterns of collegeschool‐community cooperation. Furthermore, new functions should be undertaken to include the in‐service training of teachers, as Mr. Kerwin suggests, as well as to develop programs for the education of parents in child rearing, the preparation of professionals for day‐care centers, the retraining of the unemployed for new positions and the aged for self‐enrichment in a systematic approach to What has been called lifelong learning. The National Center for Educational Statistics anticipates that 1.8 million new teachers or “returnees to the profession” will be needed between now and 1981. Under the circumstances care must be exercised that colleges retain the capacity to prepare teachers and school administrators at a level of proficiency and commitment worthy of the children of this city. GERALD LEINWAND Dean, School of Education Baruch College New York, Oct. 3, 1975 The Proper Challenge To the Editor: When United States Ambassador to the U.N. Patrick Moynihan called Idi Amin of Uganda a “racist murderer,” he was speaking accurately. Amin has murdered thousands of black Ugandan tribesmen, executed the Chief Justice of Uganda, murdered, beaten and tortured many of his political opponents, and expelled some 60,000 Asians by cruel racist decrees. These facts have been documented by organizations affiliated with the U.N. such as the International League for the Rights of Man; the International Commission of Jurists, and Amnesty. Ambassador Moynihan properly challenged Amin's racist speech before the, U.N., which called for the extinction of a member state, Israel, and made insulting, lying statements vilifying the United States, Great Britain, and France. Third‐world leaders do their own cause a disservice by attacking Mr. Moynihan for telling the truth. The aspirations and goals of the African states to overcome the effects of decades of colonialism deserve full support from everyone. Bat that cause does not need an Idi Amin, a man who flaunts his admiration for Hitler, suppresses liberties in his own country, murders political opponents and incites racism and violence. JEROME J. SHESTACK Chairman, International League for the Rights of Man New York, Oct. 9, 1975 • Support for a Strike To the Editor: On Oct. 3, James Reston misstated the facts when he wrote that the Newspaper Guild refused to endorse the pressmen's strike against The Washington Post. The fact is that not only has the executive committee of the Washington‐Baltimore Newspaper Guild—the local to which those Washington Post employes belong—endorsed the strike, but so has the entire labor movement in metropolitan Washington. The fact that members of the unit declined to concur in this decision does not alter the Guild's position, which remains in support. It is unfortunate that these members could not see that their short‐run gain (by working during this period) could become their long‐term loss. I will not debate the event leading up to that morning when fire suddenly flared in The Post's press room, but I do question Mr. Reton's statement that “this was no collective‐bargaining power play, but a simple, vicious and planned act of sabotage.” Middle‐aged men with mortgages, children in school and a history of working long hours at their jobs do not resat to such actions unless pushed to the wall by a management which has proved that it is far from the liberal institution Mr. Reston describes. They do not destroy those jobs at which they have labored for—in most cases—many, many years. And the Newspaper Guild will never support the kinds of actions that The Post has built into a pattern of unionbusting while pushing one of its unions to the situation that now exists. WARREN E. HOWARD President, Washington‐Baltimore Newspaper Guild Washington, Oct. 6, 1975"
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/11/archives/notes-on-people-hirohito-tours-san-francisco.html,"With a police helicopter overhead and police sharpshooters patrolling rooftops, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako took a fast tour of rain‐drenched San Francisco yesterday — just like any tourists with an 18car motorcade. JapaneseAmerican speakers recalled that the first 12 Japanese immigrants to this country arrived there in 1867, and one stop for the visitors was the city's new Nihon‐Machi, or Japan Center, a high‐rise housing and commercial complex with a peace pagoda. The royal couple were welcomed by hundreds of Japanese‐Americans at a betweenshowers reception in the arboretum of Golden Gate Park. Earlier, Hirohito met at his hotel with A. Myra Keen, a professor emeritus at Stanford University and a leading figure in the Emperor's special field of interest, marine biology. The visitors will be in Hawaii today for the final stop on an American tour that began Sept. 30. • On a half‐hour informal call at the Oval Office, King Olav V of Norway gave President Ford a medal commemorating the first Norwegian immigrants 150 years ago. After a reception at the Norwegian Embassy, the King was host at a Blair House dinner for 40 guests, including Vice President Rockefeller and Secretary of State Kissinger. The King will go to Minneapolis this afternoon. • Presenting J. W. Fulbright with the insignia of honorary Knight Commander of the British Empire yesterday, Sir Peter Ramsbotham, the British Ambassador, called the former Senator from Arkansas “one of the great postwar internationalists.” Those who drank champagne at the embassy in honor of the long‐time Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also originated the international Fulbright scholarships, included Secretary of State Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, and 75‐year‐old Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the World War II Allied commander in Southeast Asia and the last Viceroy of India. Rudy Vallee, who made himself and the Maine Stein Song famous by singing it through a megaphone, will lead spectators in singing the song today at the University of Maine's home game at Orono with the University of New Hampshire. The 74‐yearold entertainer attended the school in 1921 and 1922 before transferring to Yale—partly, he said yesterday, because a co‐ed named Avory Munro “jilted me for a baseball player—he had a racoon coat and an automobile, and I had neither.” Mr. Vallee is being honored at the 100thanniversary celebration of the alummi association. • W. Averell Harriman, the former New York Governor, whose 84th birthday will be Nov. 15, is in George Washington University Hospital in Washington as the result of a fall Monday at his Georgetown home. Mr. Harriman suffered two broken pelvic bones and a chip‐fracture of the right elbow when he tripped on a brass door‐strip and plunged down a short flight of stairs. • After the first airplane flight he has ventured to make in some 15 years, Salvador Dali was back in New York yesterday, eager to tell his version of French press and broadcast reports that the Spanish artist had made pro‐Franco statements approving the Sept. 27 execution of five political terrorists. Affirming his pro‐monarchist position, Mr. Dali said he was nevertheless “against all kinds of politics” and “absolutely against the death penalty for the same reasons I am against abortion.” The French reports, he said, were the “invention” of a man “with journalistic connections” who had phoned him on the Costa Brava from Toulouse and later called to apologize, promising to do so publicly in the French press. • Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose late father clashed frequently with Gov. George C. Wallace over school desegregation, met with the “Alabama Governor this week. He said Mr. Wallace “spoke highly” of his father, the former Attorney General. The Harvard senior and his former roommate there. Peter Kaplan of South Orange, N. J., have rented a house in Montgomery to research their theses on politics in the South, where Mr. Kennedy said, the trends are “indictive of those elsewhere “but here they are a lot more obvious.” • John Henry Faulk, the former CBS radio personality whose blacklisting during the nineteen‐fifties was the subject of the network's recent “Fear On Trial” special, has been signed as a result of the program to make continuing appearances on “Hee Haw,” the syndicated television series. The 62‐year‐old Mr. Faulk would be making his commercial television debut. He has also been offered a job as a weekly commentator for WBBM, the CBS‐owned radio station in Chicago. • In an action that has become almost routine since Adm. Hyman G. Rickover reached normal retirement age, the oldest United States military officer has been reappointed to two more years of active duty. Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger and Navy Secretary J. Wil liam Middendorf 2d, announced that the 75‐year‐old admiral would continue as head of the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. • An immediate crackdown on his community's No. 1 crime problem, juvenile delinquency, has been ordered by Donald Brock, chief of police in Bunnell, Fla. The chief, who heads a six‐member force in the East Coast town of 1,500, is 19 years old."
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/12/archives/the-nation-in-summary.html,"The chairman of the Senate committee investigating the Central Intelligence Agency has disclosed that the agency not only plotted to kill Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba but actually made attempts on his life during the Administrations of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. The disclosure gives added importance to the question of whether Presidents have personally condoned the assassination of leaders of other countries as an instrument of foreign policy. That question is unlikely to be answered definitively by the committee. Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, the chairman, has conceded that the legislators have no hard evidence that any President ordered or even knew of the agency's assassination schemes.. But he said he finds it difficult to believe that Presidents were not informed of what was happening. That assessment was evidently supported by testimony before the committee indicating that the agency had a formal “executive action group” responsible for preparing proposals assassinate foreign leaders. . Agency officials have also testified that they were authorized by a “higher level” to plan assassinations, but their accounts apparently conflict at some crucial points. The testimony is expected to be published In a committee report in a few weeks. If Presidents were unaware that the intelligence agency was engaged in assassination plots and attempts, it would mean that the agency was, in effect, making important policy decisions without Presidential authorization. The committee has already obtained some evidence that the agency was not totally responsive to Presidential orders to destroy a chemical weapon. The attempts to kill Mr. Castro were apparently motivated by a belief that a less pro‐Soviet Cuban might take his place. The agency is also known to have plotted to poison Patrice Lumumba, the Congolese leader, who was later killed in a coup. The agency, moreover, gave “initial” support to a plot that resulted in the death of Rafael. Trujillo, the Dominican Republic dictator. Congress Wants To Keep Its Slush Funds The debate was long and the vote was close‐48 to 47—but the Senate has nevertheless disapproved a proposal by the Federal Election Commission that would have held all members of Congress politically accountable for money they spent from private “office accounts” in seeking re‐election. The vote means they can still spend the money as they wish, accepting unlimited contributions and using them for purely political purposes. Some members maintain such accounts for numerous office activities not covered by their expense allowances, such as transportation, newsletters, Christmas cards and flowers for constituents. Under the proposed regulation, any spending from office accounts, sometimes called “slush funds,” would have been considered funds for, political purposes, subject to campaign spending ceilings, during the last two years of a Senator's term or the last year of a Representative's. Some opponents of the regulation, the first by the commission to reach the floor of either house, contended that it contained too many loopholes and ambiguities to warrant their support. They charged that a Senator's financing of legitimate office activity would be classified as political under the proposed regulation, that Senators and Representatives were dealt with differently, that incumbents would be subject to a limitation not imposed their challengers. Under the 1974 campaign election law, any commission regulation rejected by one house is dead, but in view of the closeness of the vote, despite all the objections, Thomas B. Curtis, chairman of the commission, said his legal staff would prepare a redraft that might be ready by the end of the week. Conviction in Grain Scandals The Bunge Corporation, one of the nation's leading grain companies, has been found guilty of conspiring to short‐weight grain ships and to conceal the stolen grain by falsifying records. The conviction is the most significant result so far of a Federal investigation of corruption in the grain export trade. The Government had already secured the conviction of a number of low‐level grain inspectors in connection with short weighting and misgrading in Texas and Louisiana grain ports, but the outcome of the Bunge case evidently confirms that the improprieties reached to a higher, corporate level. At least three other grain companies are known to be under investigation. The penalty imposed upon the Bunge Corporation, in addition to the maximum $20,000 fine, was also significant. The company was allowed to plead no contest, avoiding an embarrassing trial, in return for a pledge to undertake a self‐policing program that is expected to cost the company more than $2‐million. The company will be required to employ internal auditors and to pay for additional Federal inspections of grain shipments. If other companies are indicted, the prosecutors are expected to seek a similar pledge as part of the plea bargaining. Supreme Court Will Review Abortion Law The United States Supreme Court has agreed to review the constitutionality of a Missouri law requiring, among other things, that a woman obtain the consent of her parents, if she is under 18, or of her husband, to get an abortion. At issue is the extent to which a state may restrict a woman's freedom to have an abortion. If the Court voids the Missouri provisions, similar legislation in 10 other states could be invalidated. If the provisions are upheld, more states would be free to adopt them. The Court ruled in 1973 that states could not prohibit abortions during the first six months of pregnancy. After the end of the first three months, the Court held, states could regulate the practice of abortion in “ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.” Since that decision, legal abortions have become more readily available, but some women have been prevented from obtaining them because of state restrictions. Despite the 1973 decision, between 400,000 and 900,000 women—half of them poor—were unable to have an abortion performed in 1974, according to a study published by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The study found that many hospitals either did not provide abortion services at all or restricted them. Another Touch Of Deregulation President Ford has taken another step in the direction of Federal deregulation by proposing a reduction in controls over domestic airlines. He said the aim was to promote competition among airlines that would result in more and different kinds of service at lower prices. His objective in general, as he said in a recent speech to manufacturers, was to get the Government “out of your hair” as much as possible. Mr. Ford's latest deregulatory action followed a similar legislative proposal regarding the railroads and one is expected soon on the trucking industry. Reaction of the Air Transport Association was swift and critical. The group warned that service would be impaired and the “financial integrity” of the nation's airport system would be endangered. There was also some question that safety standards might be hurt if the power of the Civil Aeronautics.Board was cut. The proposed legislation also faced possibly stiff opposition in Congress because of the airline industry's contention that services to small towns would be jeopardized. In Favor Of Lunches The Democrats in Congress have again managed, and again on a politically popular issue, to override a Presidential veto. Last week, with help from Republicans, they overrode President Ford's veto of the 82.7‐billion bill extending and broadening Federal school lunch and child nutrition programs. The votes were 397 to 18 in the House and 79 to 13 in the Senate. Congress had similarly enacted, though by smaller margins, measures involving health and education funds. It has failed to override five vetoes this year and 32 of 39 during Mr. Ford's 14 months in office. The effect of the latest action on the 1976 elections was plainly on everyone's mind. The President charged Congress (the Democrats) with “fiscal irresponsibility” for its action; the Democrats accused him of a lack of concern for the needy."
Students Learning How Law Works,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/12/archives/new-jersey-pages-students-learning-how-law-works.html,"EAST MEADOW — Amid the tension and excitement of a courtroom drama, 30 high school students here witnessed a jury trial of a student who threw an orange and hit an assistant principal. But the trial was not in any court; it was in the classroom. The mock trial—complete with attorneys, witnesses, a balliff and a judge—is part of Hofstra Law School's Community Legal Education program. Second‐and thirdyear law students visit high schools in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens and provide a first‐hand look at how the legal system operates. The high school students learn by acting out actual roles of courtroom cases that have been decided. “It's an opportunity to participate in a real trial without having to actually go through the trauma of a real trial,” said Andrew Eibel, a thirdyear law student who is one of the program's five directors. “Often these kids seem to make contact with the law in abrasive ways,” he said. “What we try to do with the program is to assign various courtroom roles to students, and concentrate on issues that affect them.” Before the “trial,” the students read over the facts of the issues, which include cases involving school suspension, freedom of speech, locker searches and confidentiality of school records. Some students are attorneys, some are witnesses, some compose the jury and “a female is always, chosen as the baliff, since to my knowledge there are none in real life,” Mr. Eibel said. Student's Given Outlines The students are given the outline of the testimony, and are admonished not to communicate any information to their courtroom adversaries. But what they actually say in “court” is left to their imagination and resourcefulness. “High school students always see things their way,” said Shirley Gaynor, who teaches a course in law and society at East Meadow High School. “But, in the mock trial situation, they are forced to see things objectively because they play roles. They are forced to see both sides of the story, that everything is not black and white.” Miss Gaynor's class simulated the trial of a 17‐yearold high school senior who, while having a catch with an orange in the school cafeteria, hit the assistant principal on the head. The student was suspended, and went to court to reverse the suspension. The “jury” listened intently as the attorneys examined and cross‐examined the witnesses to establish their cases. After the presentation of the facts, Mr. Eibel, who played the part of the judge, instructed the jury as to what they must do in making their decision. As opposed to a real trial, the deliberations of the mock jury were open. “It was revealing to see how a jury decides the issue,” said Mr. Eibel. “We saw what their attitudes were to the testimony and to even such things as the dress of the witnesses.” Students Like Idea “The trial was very interesting. It gave us some insight into, what goes on in a real courtroom,” said Lori Finkelman, a 16‐year‐old senior who played the part of the mother of the fictitious student. “I only knew from TV what went on in a courtroom.” Now beginning its third year, the program involves more than 35 volunteer law students and has reached more than 25 high schools. The program benefits not only the high school students, Mr. Eibel said, but the law students, who “get an opportunity to see characters on paper come alive and clash in a way which can't be visualized by reading a case.” “I'm most impressed about the innovation, creativity and enthusiasm that the high school kids bring to the subject,” he said. “They get the sense that a lawyer running a trial has to be more than Perry Mason.” The response to the program has increased over the last year, and Mr. Eibel expects that more than 40 high schools will participate in the program this year. In addition to the mock trials, the directors of the program want to extend their offerings to include programs on mock legislatures and Supreme Court trials, “where the class can argue burning issues such as abortion, capital punishment and busing,” Mr. Eibel said."
RATE OF MARRIAGE DECLINES IN CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/12/archives/rate-of-marriage-declines-in-city-89-for-1000-in-1973-was-lowest.html,"The marriage rate in New York City has declined to the lowest rate in six years, standing at 8.9 marriages for each 1,000 people in 1973. This is nearly a fourth below the high level of the years just after World War II Birth rates in the city also are at the lowest point since the consolidation of Greater New York in 1898, except for the 1936‐40 depression years. Changing life‐styles in the city can be discerned from A new 12‐page pamphlet of vital statistics, which provides data through 1973. The pamphlet was just published by the Health Department under Commissioner Lowell E. Bellin. Mott Haven Deaths Low Mott Haven in the Bronx, an area with a youthful Hispanic population, has been showing the city's lowest death rate. Central harlem, the home of impoverished blacks, has the highest death rate. Bay Ridge in Brooklyn has the highest death rate from heart diseases; Maspeth‐Forest Hills in Queens the highest from cancer. As for the marriage rate, the 1973 figure of 8.9 marriages for each 1,000 in population represents a decline from 9.3 in 1971 and 1972, 9.4 in 1970 and a recent high of 9.5 in 1969. The marriage rate was as high as 11.6 in 1946‐50 after servicemen returned from World, War II The city pamphlet makes no attempt at interpretation. The city had 14.0 live births for each 1,000 in population in 1973, far below the estimated, high of 35.4 at the start of Greater New York in 1898‐1900. The only lower birth rate was 13.9, reported for 1936‐40. In recta years, the highs have been 21.6 in 1961, and 21.5 in 1963. Since then there has been a decline interrupted only in 1969 and 1970. Presumably, the decline refleets the impact of the liberalized abortion law that went into effect July 1, 1970, as well as expanding knowledge about. family planning and contraception. The records report fetal death, rates of 123 to 141 for each 1,000 in population in the nineteen‐sixties, reaching a high of 159.6 in 1970, but dropping to 124.7 in 1971, to 51.2 in 1972 and to 35.4 in 1973. The figures now exclude “induced abortions? Health Advances Indicated Hidden in the figures is evidence of dramatic health advances over the years. At the start of Greater New York, deaths of babies under a year of age averaged 136.7 for each 1,000 live births in 1898‐1900. That rate has declined almost without interruption to 19.9 in 1973, second to the record low of 19.8 the year before. There has been what the department calls “the conquest of pestilence,” including such moves as chlorination of water in 1910, milk stations for babies in 1911 and pasteurization of milk in 1912. Over‐all death rates have fallen to just about half of what they were at the city's start‐10.4 for each 1,000 in population in 1973, against 20.1 in 1898‐1900. There have been years with lower rates, including the record of 10.0 set in 1951. Among 11 reportable diseases for which yearly data has been published since 1940, there have been decreases in all but one‐gonorrhea. There were ??8,055 cases of gonorrhea in 1973, more than quadruple the low point of 10,482 in 1956. Another venereal disease, syphilis, ??ell to 7,334 cases in 1973, compared with 30,718 in 1940. Poliomyelitis has been down to zero since 1965, except for single cases in 1967, 1968 and 1972. Meningococcus meningitis Veas down to 37 cases in 1973, compared with 1,406 in 1943. Whooping cough fell to 77 cases, compared with 9,240 in 1942. Heart disease is the city's chief cause of death, with 39 per cent of the deaths in 1973. Cancer was second, with 20 per cent of the deaths. Ethnic Differences Noted At birth, life expectancy for New York City white males was 67.1 years and for nonwhites 61.5 years as of 1970. For white females, the life expectancy was 74.8 years and for nonwhites females 71.2 years. There were also ethnic differences on infant mortality with 23.9 deaths for each 1,000 live, births among nonwhite New Yorkers in 1973, compared with 19.5 deaths for Puerto Rican residents and 17.7 for others. Among the 30 health districts, Mott Haven had only 5.8 deaths. from all causes for each 1,000 in population in 1973. Central Harlem had 14.3 deaths for each 1,000 of population. Bay Ridge had a rate of 490.8 deaths for each 100,000 in population from ischemic and other heart diseases. Maspeth‐Forest Hills led in malignant neoplasms, cancer deaths, with a rate of 257.3 for each 1,000 in population. Central Harlem's rates were highest for cerebrovascular disease, deaths from stroke, at 106.0 for each 1,000 in population, and for deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, 103:3 The Lower West Side had the highest death rate from pneumonia and influenza, 47.8. for each 1,000 in population."
Ousted Jesuit Floats In an Earthly Limbo,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/14/archives/ousted-jesuit-floats-in-an-earthly-limbo.html,"Since he was expelled by the Jesuits more than a year ago, the Rev. Joseph P. O'Rourke has lingered in ecclesiastical limbo. On Sept. 6, 1974, the order officially dismissed him for having baptized an infant whose mother favored allowing women free choice in obtaining abortions. The Rev. Eamon Taylor, the priest's New York provincial superior charged at the time that Father O'Rourke had been expressly forbidden to perform the baptism and had been disobedient. The accusation was disputed by Father O'Rourke as the controversy raged inside and outside the order. Among other things, the debate raised questions about whether Father O'Rourke had been granted due process, the fitness of the punishment and the right to baptize children whose parents may hold views that disagree with official church teaching. Speculation Aroused Much of the tension developed out of the new mood in the church. Vatican II placed heavy stress n consultative processes between superiors and subordinates, and many of Father O'Rourke's supporters, though opposed to his action felt this sipirt had been violated. The case also aroused speculation, denied by superiors of the order, that a crackdown on activists was under way. Last fall the Pope issued a strong appeal for loyalty to church authority at the opening session of the Jesuit sacred congregation in Rome, a move widely understood as a call for discipline. While these issues are debated, Father O'Rouke has seen his hopes for reinstatement steadily dim. Though stripped of his “S.J.” (Society of Jesus) title, he remains a valid priest in the eyes of the church. But like a man without a country, he floats without an assignment, under the authority of no Bishop or superior. In the sports world, he would be a “free agent,” at liberty to make an arrangement with a prelate who would give him work and visible means of support. Priest Bewildered But for the moment, Father O'Rouke hovers at the fringes of Jesuit society, still somewhat bewildered, living in the West Side Jesuit complex on West 98th Street, taking meals with members of the order, anguishing over the past and the future. “I still don't really know what happened,” he says of the incident. “I have no regrets because I did my duty.” Admitting that he may have, acted against the wishes of his superiors, he thinks a less severe sanction, such as a month‐long retreat or a new assignment, would have served the purpose. A long trail of discontent, often testing the authority of the church, led up to the cause celebre. Under a church rubric, a priest can refrain from baptizing a child if he questions the ability of the parents to provide a truly Catholic upbringing. On that basis, priests at the Immaculate Heart of Mary parish in Marlborough, Mass., refused to baptize Nathaniel Ryan Morreale, whose mother, Carhl Morreale, favored opening an abortion clinic in the community. Father O'Rourke was advised that he could counsel the couple but should avoid performing the sacrament. Dismissed by Superior His decision to proceed on Aug. 20, on the steps of the hurch, apparently angered his provincial superior, who summoned him within days for a formal dismissal. Father O'Rourke contends the process was a formality that denied him a chance to discuss the matter with Father Taylor. But “due process” within Jesuit law is a somewhat ambiguous term. One noted Conservative canon lawyer, the Rev. John Reed, former president of Woodstock College and a vice provincial in New York, says that the concept is “a relative term.” “There is no such thing as absolute due process followed everywhere,” he contends. James Crowley, another canon‐law expert and a member of a Wall Street law firm, says that “many superiors feel it is within their discretion not to have a hearing,” though most do in the new climate of increased dialogue in the church. Of Father O'Rourke's case, he says: “The changing consciousness is more in his favor than strict legal claims.” Under normal church procedure, matters such as dismissals are treated confidentially. Though the O'Rourke case attracted notoriety in some respects, details about the deliberations remain secret. Father Taylor was not available for comment, but Father O'RO'Rourke's immediate provincial superior, the Rev. John Talbot, declined to comment on the due‐process issue. Optimism for reopening the case would appear to he unfounded. After the initial verdict, Father O'Rourke filed a 30‐page brief to the Vatican. He was turned down. Then, in one last effort, he appealed directly to Pope Paul VI. It ended with a message in May from the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Archbishop Jean Jardot, saying that the appeal papers had been received by the Pontiff. In July, on a visit to Archbishop Jadot, Father O'Rourke was told that the message meant the case was closed. “I guess that means it's bad news when the Pope gets mail delivered,” Father O'Rourke says with a characteristically puckish grin. He adds ruefully: “I still feel like a Jesuit. They can take me out of the Jesuits, but they can't take the Jesuit out of me.” At 37, ‘ he has spent nearly half his life acquiring a Jesuit identity. Expulsion left him dazed. He has spent long stretches of time alone and drifting. Mixed Feelings Noted “Some days now are fine,” he says, “but others I feel desperate. I lost my sense of purpose. It's such that sometimes I have to wake up in the morning and start from scratch. “Some of my friends say I should shuck the whole church. Others, some of them old timers, tell me to hang in there. I want to stay. The reason I stay a priest is that I am one. It's almost not a matter of choice. I've honed my own identity as a priest, and I'm good at it.” With sparkling brown eyes, a ruddy complexion and a shock of jet black hair, he is the picture of the jaunty, zestful Irish priest, complete with self‐deprecating wit. He was a bright, popular student in his hometown of Hudson, N.Y., earning good grades, serving as class president from the fifth to the 12th grade. His father died two days before he was born, and he lived with his mother, whom he decribes as a devout Catholic who put no pressure on him to enter the priesthood. After high school he left for Holy Cross College to begin his studies for the priesthood. He says his desire to be congenial has made his social activism “a painful experience.” But he has fought for a number of volatile causes from civil rights to antiwar efforts. Record as an Activist In 1969, he participated In a break‐in at the Dow Chemical offices in Washington. Copies of war contracts were destroyed. He also was a member of the Camden 28, the Harrisburg Defense fund, and groups that included the Berrigan brothers. His Peck's Bad Boy role contrasts with his image as a well‐scrubbed product of parochial schools. During the Dow break‐in, he says, he balked at smashing a pane of glass “because breaking windows was a sin when I was a kid.” Increasingly, his “parish” has embraced those outside the church who share his social values, if not his spiritual convictions. Sometimes loyalties to church and to the activist community have produced conflict and strained relations with the church. During his ordination service in St. Patrick's in 1971, for example, conflict between the church and antiwar sentiments took the form of a momentary refusal to greet Cardinal Cooke in the “Kiss of Peace.” It was intended as a protest against the Catholic Church's stand on Vietnam and the Cardinal's role as military vicar. When he did step forward to carry out the greeting, Cardinal Cooke reportedly aid, “Peace to you, especially, my friend.” At the time of his dismissal, he was authorized by the Jesuits to work for the Religious Center for Corporate Responsibility, an interfaith project that links social action with investment strategies of churches. Since then, he has gained some income from lecturing. He also serves as a part‐time priest in an upstate parish. But that is not enough, he says, and he feels pressure to find a diocesan Bishop who will accept him with his controversial past and restless nature. Staying a priest, he says, will entail continued resistancaee to celibacy (""I don't think you can really be a priest and celibate"") andthe rule against women priests, among other things. Though some canon lawyers suggest that he might win reinstatement if he persists, Father O'Rourke is not hopeful. “There is only one authority above the Pope,” he says with a smile, ‘ and I guess He's not available.”"
"Computer Finds the ‘Average Person, But Madame France Isn't Impressed",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/15/archives/computer-finds-the-average-person-but-madame-france-isnt-impressed.html,"PARIS, Oct. 14—Once upon a time a young girl named Jeanette lived in a small town in northern France. She grew up in an unspectacular way, went to mass every Sunday and was graduated from high school. She accepted the invitation of the first man who asked her to dance and soon married him, pregnant. She had two children, took a job in a milk plant office and became, according to the French Institute of Public Opinion, Madame France, the average French person. The selection last week of 28‐year‐old Jeanette Avelange as Madame France reflected the increasing French propensity for self‐identification by computer rather than through the thoughts of Descartes, Camus or Sartre. In a sense, “I think therefore I am” has been replaced by “The computer indicates that I am … ” And while computer surveys are not new in France (political polls abound), the printout that discovered Madame France is the most detailed statistical profile of the French ever produced. Mrs. Avelange has light brown hair and bears a slight facial resemblance to the women of the English royal family. In an interview the other day, she was nonchalant about the burst of publicity she has received since her normality was discovered in the survey, made for the weekly news magazine Le Point. The opinions she expressed seemed average enough in the nation of 52.5 million people, who generally consider themselves individualists. With her husband, Jean‐Claude, a truck driver, standing by quietly, Mrs. Avelange said. She considers herself a Catholic but does not go to church. She takes contraceptive pills but is strongly opposed to abortion, which she calls murder. She voted for President Valery Giscard d'Estaing last year and still likes him, but would vote for his opponent, Francois Mitterand, if an election were held now. She thinks crime is a growing problem in France, but she opposes the death penalty. Mrs. Avelange considers international politics “a great game.” If she could have one wish fulfilled, she said, would be that “everbody is happy, no poor, no rich.” Unmoved by Women's Lib. “But of course I don't have a magic wand,” she added. She frowned at the mention of the French women's liberation movement, and said, “I don't feel chained up. Liberation? Liberation from what?”. She said that she had no hopes of making the Madame France role a career, and that she was returning immediately to Amiens to resume her job as a statistician at the milk plant. Her husband, wearing a blue velvet suit, said, “I am proud of my wife.” Most of Mrs. Avelange's personal statistics and opinions coincide closely with the institute's national profile, which was based on interviews with 2,000 French men and women. The average height of men are 5‐feet6‐inches and 154 pounds, and of women, who comprise 51 per cent of the population, 5‐feet‐2‐inches and 130 pounds. Fifty‐five per cent of the poulation have dark eyes; blonds and redheads are disappearing. Slightly less than half of French men and women are virgins when they marry. Chefs, Oui; Cooks, Non. The average family has two children, lives in a detached house in an urban area other than Paris, which has 17 per cent of the population. French men do not generally help prepare meals, and while 41 per cent of them watch sports on television, less than a third of them actively participate in any sport. While 84 per cent of the French consider themselves Catholics, slightly more than half do not go to mass and do not confess their sins to priests, who ought to have the right to marry, according to 70 per cent of the 2,000 persons interviewed in the survey. As to state of mind, 71 per cent consider themselves “rather happy” today. But nearly half those interviewed said they felt people would be less happy in the year 2,000. And 84, per cent of the French are reported to tell their children that there is a Santa Claus."
Productivity Pressed To Cut Welfare Costs,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/17/archives/productivity-pressed-to-cut-welfare-costs.html,"Nearly one of every 12 employes of the Human Resources Administration‐2,031 out of 25,000—has been subjected to disciplinary penalties this year to step up productivity in an often‐criticized agency that administers the city's billion‐dollar welfare and Medicaid programs. Mainly aimed against widespread idling, the undisclosed This is the fifth in a series on new proposals being discussed or implemented to help the city save money and improve or tighten services as a result of the fiscal crisis. disciplinary actions, according to Administrator James R. Dumpson, comply with Mayor Beame's directive “that every city employe give a full day's work.” The drive is one of many management reforms and productivity campaigns now being pressed or proposed in the absence of Federalization of welfare to lessen the overwhelming welfare burden of New York. For years, city officials and welfare experts have stressed that the fundamental reform would be a Federal takeover of full financing of welfare and Medicaid costs on the ground that poverty is neither locally induced nor locally controllable. This proposal has gained even more local support during the city's fiscal crisis because a Federal takeover would almost by itself solve the city's fiscal troubles. The city tax share of the two programs is estimated by the Municipal Assistance Corporation to require $877‐million in the year started last July 1, excluding administrative costs. Confrented by such figures, the rescue panel drawn heavily from the business community joined the appeal for a takeover last August. But realistic prospects for takeover are dim, given the failure of President Nixon's 1969 proposal for a uniform Federal income support for welfare family cases and President Ford's current demand for a $28 ‐ billion cut in Federal spending in the next fiscal year. So in the absence of total Federalization, a variety of other proposals are now being offered to gain some Federal help while local efforts are launched to get interim nelp through management reforms. These include: ¶A plan for “welfare cost stabilization” is being advanced‐by the Community Service Society and some key national welfare experts. Under this plan, the Federal Government would absorb costs attributable both to caseload growth and cost of‐living increases since January, 1974. The Community Service Society calculates its so‐called “hold harmless” plan, which would insulate the city against the strain of recession‐swollen rolls and inflation, could be achieved at a Federal cost this year of $644‐million nationally, easing the city's burden by $60‐million. ¶Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, has mustered 44 co‐sponsors for a bill to provide at least a uniform 75 per cent Federal reimbursement for Aid to Dependent Children and Medicaid cases. This would correct the alleged unfairness in which the Federal Government now shares only 50 per cent of the costs in New York and 11 other states while it reimburses Mississippi 78 per cent. Under existing formulas the city and state each pay 25 per cent. ¶A 75 per cent Federal reimbursement for welfare and Medicaid in states experiencing at least 7 per cent unemployment, such as New York, also is being sought by Stephen Berger, the state Commissioner of Social Services. ¶Commissioner Berger additionally seeks to ease the burden of home‐relief, now paid half by the state and half by the city, by having increased Federal help for the underemployed. He proposes that the Federally supported Aid to Dependent Children‐Unemployed Parent category which covers a two‐parent family in which a father may be temporarily jobless or working part‐time, he expanded from a present ceiling of 100 hours’ work a month to 135. ¶While urging Federal assumption of the entire welfare burden, Administrator Dumpson and other welfare specialists call for at least an interim state takeover of the statemandated home‐relief portion of welfare. This would mean a savings to the city of at icast $80‐million a year under current levels. put Commissioner Berger says the state has its own deficit of $600‐million or more, and can't pick up new burdens. He does promise to “help local districts to try to maximize getting those who don't betong on the rolls off the rolls.” Proponents of takeover argue that Federal policies helped cause much of the city's welfare problem, in the first place. When Federal farm subsidies made it economic for Southern farms to become larger and mechanized, black laborers moved off the: land and many came here hoping for jobs. From Puerto Rico, other newcomers migrated to the mainland‐783,358 as of the 1970 census‐in the same hope of better opportunity instead of chronic grinding unemployment. With freedom of movement upheld as a constitutional right, the city has found itself having In shoulder burdens of United States citizens whose lack of skills and education was not always the city's fault. The influx of poor—to whom the city has always been a magnet of hope for generationshas been paralleled by an exodus of middle‐income residents to the suburbs. Now the problem has been cempounded by a national depression‐which the city must lobk to national policies to cure. But meantime, one of every eight New Yorkers is on welfare—more than 85 per cent of them black or Hispanic—and the city is paying 30 per cent of the welfare bill. Welfare continues as the major rising cost in the city's operating budget. But at the bottom it still leaves the city's poor trying to survive on an average of $3.46 a day‐a sum that has to cover their food, clothing and rent. Last month, a three‐hour television documentary on welfare clients and workers by film‐maker Frederick Wiseman was distributed nationally by the Public Broadcasting Service. Administrator Dumpson said the city not only permitted the filming, but wanted it done. The city welfare chief says the result exposed “a neverending human sea of illness and desperation, frustration and fear . . . the tedium and paperhandling that are pervading, debilitating themes at all welfare centers.” “Welfare,” Mr. Dumpson says in a review for the Community Council of Greater New York, “is a societal and syslemic failure‐the organic malfunctioning of an outmoded system that leaves both desperate client and frustrated workers suffering the callous disregard of a national government that cares more for guns than human dignity.” Mr. Dumpson now sees the city's massive welfare caseload leveling off at its current total of just about 1 ‐million New Yorkers with but a slight increase likely. This is a considerable reduction from the original budget forecast by the Department of Social Services last winter that predicted an average rise of 12.000 persons a month for the year started last July 1. But the current prediction, Mr Dumpson concedes is ‘based “on the slimmest kind of data.” He says it considers “the national administration's repeated statement that the recession has bottomed out” and it takes into account the anticipated success of management reforms under way or in process. The new forecast, he says, does allow for some 70,000 new cases coming on during the year after family breadwinners exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits. Threeliundred‐thousand persons statewide are estimated likely to run out of such benefits, including 210,000 in the city. Is the newly toughened policy tarring the truly needy from help? Indicators differ. Over the last year, rejection rates on new applicants have actually fluctuated downward. City records indicate 41.8 per cent of home‐relief applicants were turned down in the first five months last year, but only 34.9 per cent this year. Last year, 32.2 per cent of applicants for Aid to Dependent Children were rejected, this year 25.8. So this would suggest things might even be easier for wouldbe new clients. But another indicator of official attitudes is the rate at which persons believing themselves unfairly treated — either by rejection, termination or grant reduction: —are submitting appeals to the state. The state's so‐called fair hearings averaged 2,671 judgments a month in the first eight months this year. This is far above the average of 2,091 month for all of last year. Decisions by the state Department of Social Services have been increasingly against the city. The state reversed 50 per cent of the city's actions from April through August, compared to 36 per cent reversed in a sampling of 2,000 cases for last year. And that reversal rate was even after the city itself withdrew initial actions against clients in 30 per cent of cases decided this year—about the same as last year's 31 per cent withdrawals. The over‐all cost of the Department of Social Services, including city, state and Federal sharing, is $2.8‐billion in the current city budget, or 22.8 per cent. The Citizens Budget Commission reports this is up from $2.4‐billion last year. $1.7billion five years ago and only $494‐million a decade ago. Thus, in 10 years, the welfare cost has nearly quintupled while the entire city budget has only tripled. The current budget was developed on the Budget Bureau's forecast of 6.000 more recipients each month, or half of the department's prediction. But despite the levelling off in numbers of clients now envisaged, welfare experts now expect little savings in the costs, which include $1.2‐billion in actual grants to welfare recipients. This is, in part, because the average grant to welfare recipients has been increasing —$333.48 for an Aid to Dependent Children family case in May, compared to $325.14 in January. As rents have gone up and as the working poor have lost jobs in the city's troubled economy, their earlier welfare supplements have had to be increased. One factor in the leveling off is a new state law that limited home‐relief clients in a Work Relief Employment Project, who had been earning wages in city agencies, to 18 months’ work, sending them to collect unemployment insurance thereafter. The number ho received project checks fell from 6,713 in June to 2,947 in September. Eighty‐five per cent of the city's welfare recipients are in the other main category, Aid to Dependent Children, usually a mother and children with no father present. These family cases now average 3.4 persons, down from 3.7 in 1971; elective abortion programs have brought down the number of babies born on welfare. When Vice President Rockefeller was Governor, he pressed for requiring one year's residency in the state before anyone could be eligible for New York welfare aid. But residency requirements were held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. To those who would renew a bid for a similar residency requirement, Mr. Dumpson says recipients who have lived here less than a year only make up 3 per cent of New York's staggering caseload. Rather than any realistic hope of Federal — or even state takeover of the welfare burden, New York City is actually being threatened with increased costs. The threat is a nationwide Federal order to get the percentage of ineligible people receiving welfare everywhere down to 3 per cent of the Aid to Debendent children caseload as of next Dec. 31 or lose Federal reimbursement for any excess. The latest but still unreleased stale quality‐control audit puts the proportion of ineligible people receiving welfare here at 11.3 per cent for the first half of this year. This is up from a preliminary interim report of 9 per cent for the first four months that had been disclosed by State Controller Arthur Levitt last June But it is down from 18.3 per cent a year ago and 14.5 per cent for the last half of 1974—when ineligibility and overpayment errors combined were estimated to involve $212million in grants here. j Mr. Dumpson says that “50 per cent of ineligibility is worker error” rather than client misinformation or fraud. A Sept. 10 staff memorandum by his acting deputy for income maintenance, Herbert Rosenzweig, indicated some explanation and pointed up some of the problems of the welfare system: “All of our procedures are dictated by state regulations which are extremely complex and ever‐changing. Thus far in 1975. I have issued over 100 changes In procedure—all mandated by changes in state regulations.... “It is virtually impossible to keep an up‐to‐date manual of all procedures under which staff must operate. Our current manuals are well over several feet thick. “In short, the public assistance system itself is a nightmarish jungle of red tape and paperwork which stands as an Immense obstacle to efficiency.” Examples of low productivity by city welfare employes were documented by State Controller Levitt after his auditors went into 11 centers starting in April, 1971. In April, 1972, he informed city officials that employes assigned to check eligibility were wasting “about twothirds” of their time, some leaving early and many idling in the office. That November, a detailed report by Controller Levitt described time misused in welfare centers for naps, exercise, chess, cards and fixing other workers’ hair. Jule M. Sugarman, then Human Resources Administrator, said he had also found excessive lateness and absenteeism, beginning a crackdown May 1. 1972, that in seven months caused dismissals resignations. The latest disciplinary drive by Administrator Dumpson requires every deputy in the agency to make an unannounced visit to some area in his jurisdiction at least once a month to check on his staff. It also indicates that the problem remains a severe one. In the first six months this year, the productivity campaign led to 1,476 employes suspended and fined in work days, 504 reprimanded, 29 dismissed, 10 resigned under fire, 10 fined and two demoted—with monetary savings estimated at $500,695. Mr. Dumpson cites these additional management reforms despite the loss of 2.500 staff members this year (1.700 laid off and the others departing without replacement): ¶Face‐to‐face recert ifications required semi‐annually, is being stepped up. Controller Levitt last June estimated delays in closing cases were causing unnecessary spending of $1!million a year. He charged that staff productivity, as of last fall, was below an unofficial standard of 10 verifications daily (reaching this level only 65 per cent of the time). The Community Service Society says there are only three recertification centers for the five boroughs, and harassed clients can face case‐closings by one center simply because of a failure to resubmit documents already presented or even left on file in another welfare center. ¶Photo identification cards have been improved to prevent fraud. ¶The use of computers to match city and state payrolls with welfare rolls. Controller Levitt reported this practice turned up 2,300 cases by last spring, showing more than $2million in overpayments for such employes who are also on welfare, many times legitimately. ¶Field investigations to locate absent parents recommended 1.800 cases for closing and nearly 600 for revision of grants out of 20,000 investigated between last November and May. ¶A project to verify whether welfare family recipients actually have children by checking to see if such children are enrolled in school has resulted in 3,200 case‐closings or grant reductions out of the first 20,000 reviewed. Ineligibility has also been monitored by the state Welfare Inspector General's office, which was independent until a new state law transferred it July 1 to Controller Levitt's office. In its first three years through last December, the Inspector General's office estimated it had brought about $9.1‐million welfare savings statewide Deputy Inspector General Ralph A. Cipriani says the office is now down to about SO staff members and a budget limit of $1.3‐million, compared with 124 employes last year and a peak budget of $1.S‐million. Some experts believe the city drive against welfare fraud was handicapped by city layoffs of 150 case aides and 25 investigators last June. Stuart Leibowitz, vice president for research for Social Service Employes Union Local 371, asserts the laid‐off employes “generated much more money for the city than their salaries cost.” Internal memoranda in the Department of Social Services indicated the investigators were bringing about case‐closings for fraud averaging 30 a year for an annual saving of $102,000 each, compared with their salaries generally of $10,800. Despite budgetary handicaps, Mr. Dumpson contends diat service to clients has improved. He says waiting time for an applicant to get an appointment for an interview has been reduced to five days or less in all but one of 38 family centers, compared to only 21 complying with the five‐day state standard six months ago. Moreover, a system by which a client can get an appointment scheduled by telephone is in effect in 20 centers, he adds. But the Social Service Employes Union, contends that people still began lining up at midnight this summer at the employment eligibility center at 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn, where home‐relief applicants‐must report to have their employability determined. The union says most applicants had to get appointments to return, involving waiting periods up to 27 days, with a month more after that for decisions on acceptance or rejection. Beyond the program of welfare grants, the related Federal‐state‐local Medicaid program pays medical bills for welfare recipients and other sick poor. State records indicate current Medicaid costs are running $1.75 for every dollar spent on welfare grants here. Such a nearly 2 to 1 relationship seems “excessive” and far away from the experience of ordinary families, according to Dean Mitchell I. Ginsberg of the Columbia School of Social Work, and Bernard M. Shiffman, executive vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York. Dean Ginsberg says “the Medicaid program is turning into a lot of money for providers.” Mr. Shiffman adds that “better supervision of Medicaid and Medicare treatment would cost more money, but it would end some of the rip‐offs and ultimately produce a net savings.” Re says the city is “underutilizing public hospitals,” while voluntary hospital costs can run up to $60 for an outpatient visit, reimbursable under Medicaid. The Community Council leader contends that short sighted cuts in counseling, day care, protective services to children and similar programs Can reduce welfare costs, hut would, serve to create greater costs in coping with ‘'future social problems caused by the reduction of such services. State Commissioner Berger aims to review the system that separates welfare grant payments and social services. This has been in effect nationwide under a Federal regulation since Oct. 1, 1972. “The result has been that we have lots of specialists.” Mr. Berger says. “But we may have lost the capacity to control the caseload. “I'm not sure that going back is the right answer.” Mr. Berger says. “I think that what is necessary is a casemanagement system, in which people are treated as individuals parts of families. “Where Medicaid, public assistance and services are fragmented, the recipient gets a little of a lot of other’ people's time. But he goes nutty going from place to place.” One new city pilot plan ing at eventual savings of “several million dollars” year in administrative costs and fraud losses is to be started by Mr. Dumpson before the end of the year for 10,000 welfare clients in a Bronx center still to be chosen. The plan would have clients get their checks through banks, check cashers or credit unions instead of by mail. Such a “direct payment” plan is being introduced for Social Security recipients, and has been in effect for welfare cases in Nassau County. A study by a Human Resources Administration office estimates that 20 per cent of client visits to welfare centers are made simply to pick up checks. The new plan is expected to produce savings for clients who have had to run gamuts of muggers at their mailboxes and whO have had to patronize check cashers or highpriced local stores to cash checks. Only 25 per cent of welfare checks have been cashed at banks. Tomorrow: The city's public schools"
New Labels Drafted To Tell of Hazards In Birth Curb Pills,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/17/archives/new-labels-drafted-to-tell-of-hazards-in-birth-curb-pills.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (AP) —The Food and Drug Administration said today that it had drafted new professional labeling on birth control pills to bring doctors up to date on possible hazards to women and unborn infants. At the same time, the F.D.A. said that it remained convinced that oral contraceptives were safe and effective for the great majority of the 10 million or so American women taking them and that serious adverse effects were relatively uncommon. The draft, which has not yet been released publicly, will be circulated among consumer, industry and medical groups for guidance before it is Officially proposed for public comment. The draft makes three points: Women over the age of 40 should be urged to use some method of contraception other than the pill because of the risk of heart attacks. Women who have been taking the pill and wish to become pregnant should consider waiting three months after they stop taking it before they conceive because of a possibility of spontaneous abortion in post‐pill pregnancy. Pregnancy tests that involve administering sex hormones to patients should be discontinued because of the risk of exposing the fetus to the drug. Nonmalignant tumors of the liver have been reported in extremely rare instances among women taking the pill. These tumors can be fatal if they cause internal bleeding. A woman who has not taken the pill as directed should be checked for pregnancy If she. misses one period to avoid exposing a developing fetus to the hormone drug if the womart has conceived. Some extremely rare birth defects have been reported more frequently in children whose mothers took female sex hormones in early pregnancy."

But at the bqttom it still leaves the city's poor trying to survive on an average of $3.46 a day‐a sum that has to cover their food, clothing and rent. Last month, a three‐hour television documentary on welfare clients and workers by film‐maker Frederick Wiseman was distributed nationally by the Public Broadcasting Service. Administrator Dumpson said the city not only permitted the filming, but wanted it done. The city welfare chief says the result exposed “a neverending human sea of illness and desperation, frustration and fear . . . the tedium and paperhandling that are pervading, debilitating themes at all welfare centers.” “Welfare,” Mr. Dumpson says in a review for the Community Council of Greater New York, “is a societal and syslemic failure‐the organic malfunctioning of an outmoded system that leaves both desperate client and frustrated workers suffering the callous disregard of a national government that cares more for guns than human dignity.” Mr. Dumpson now sees the city's massive welfare caseload leveling off at its current total of just about 1 ‐million New Yorkers with but a slight incense likely. This is a considerable reduction from the original budget forecast by the Department of Social Services last winter that predicted an average rise of 12.000 persons a month for the year started last July 1. But the current prediction, Mr. Dumpson concedes is based “on the slimmest kind of data.” He says it considers “the national administration's repeated statement that the recession has bottomed out” and it takes into account the anticipated success of management reforms under way or in process. The new forecast, he says, does allow for some 70,000 new cases coming on during the year after family breadwinners exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits. Threeliundred‐thousand persons statevide are estimated likely to run out of such benefits, including 210,000 in the city. Is the newly toughened policy tarring the truly needy from help? Indicators differ. Over the last year, rejection rates on new applicants have actually fluctuated downward. City records indicate 41.8 per cent of home‐relief applicants were turned down in the first five months last year, but only 34.9 per cent this year. Last year, 32.2 per cent of applicants for Aid to Dependent Children were rejected, this year 25.8. So this would suggest things might even be easier for wouldbe new clients. But another indicator of official attitudes is the rate at which persons believing themselves unfairly treated — either by rejection, termination or grant reduction: —are submitting appeals to the state. The state's so‐called fair hearings averaged 2,671 judgments a month in the first eight months this year. This is far above the average of 2,091 a month for all of last year. Decisions Against City Decisions by the state Department of Social Services have been increasingly against the city. The state reversed 50 per cent of the city's actions from April through August, compared to 36 per cent reversed in a sampling of 2,000 cases for last year. And that reversal rate was even after the city itself withdrew initial actions against clients in 30 per cent of cases decided this year—about the same as last year's 31 per cent withdrawals. The over‐all cost of the Department of Social Services, including city, state and Federal sharing, is $2.8‐billion in the current city budget, or 22.8 per cent. The Citizens Budget Commission reports this is up from $2.4‐billion last year. $1.7billion five years ago and only $494‐million a decade ago. Thus, in 10 years, the welfare cost has nearly quintupled while the entire city budget has only tripled. The current budget was developed on the Budget Bureau's forecast of 6.000 more recipients each month, or half of the department's prediction. But despite the levelling off in numbers of clients now envisaged, welfare experts now expect little savings in the costs, which include $1.2‐billion in actual grants to welfare recipients. This is, in part, because the average grant to welfare recipients has been increasing —$333.48 for an Aid to Dependent Children family case in May, compared to $325.14 in January. As rents have gone up and as the working poor have lost jobs in the city's troubled economy, their earlier welfare supplements have had to be increased. One factor in the leveling off is a new state law that limited home‐relief clients in a Work Relief Employment Project, who had been earning wages in city agencies, to 18 months’ work, sending them to collect unemployment insurance thereafter. The number ho received project checks fell from 6,713 in June to 2,947 in September. Eighty‐five per cent of the city's welfare recipients are in the other main category, Aid to Dependent Children, usually a mother and children with no father present. These family cases now average 3.4 persons, down from 3.7 in 1971; elective abortion programs have brought down the number of babies born on welfare. When Vice President Rockefeller was Governor, he pressed for requiring one year's residency in the state before anyone could be eligible for New York welfare aid. But residency requirements were held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. To those who would renew a bid for a similar residency requirement, Mr. Dumpson says recipients who have lived here less than a year only make up 3 per cent of New York's staggering caseload. Rather than any realistic hope of Federal — or even state takeover of the welfare burden, New York City is actually being threatened with increased ,costs. The threat is a nationwide Federal order to get the percentage of ineligible people receiving welfare everywhere down to 3 per cent of the Aid to Dependent children caseload as of next Dec. 31 or lose Federal reimbursement for any excess. The latest but still unreleased stale quality‐control audit puts the proportion of ineligible people receiving welfare here at. 11.3 per cent for the first half of this year. This is up from a preliminary interim report of 9 per cent for the first four months that had been disclosed by State Controller Arthur Levitt last June. But it is down from 18.3 per cent a year ago and 14.5 per cent for the last half of 1974—when ineligibility and overpayment errors combined were estimated to involve $212million in grants here. Mr. Dumpson says that “50 per cent of ineligibility is worker error” rather than client misinformation or fraud. A Sept. 10 staff memorandum by his acting deputy for income maintenance, Herbert Rosenzweig, indicated some explanation and pointed up some of the problems of the welfare system: “All of our procedures are dictated by state regulations which are extremely complex and ever‐changing. Thus far in 1975. I have issued over 100 changes In procedure—all mandated by changes in state regulations.... “It is virtually impossible to keep an up‐to‐date manual of all procedures under which staff must operate. Our current manuals are well over several feet thick. “In short, the public assistance system itself is a nightmarish jungle of red tape and paperwork which stands as an Immense obstacle to efficiency.” Examples of low productivity by city welfare employes were documented by State Controller Levitt after his auditors went into 11 centers starting in April, 1971. In April, 1972, he informed city officials that employes assigned to check eligibility were wasting “about twothirds” of their time, some leaving early and many idling in the office. That November, a detailed report by Controller Levitt described time misused in welfare centers for naps, exercise, chess, cards and fixing other workers’ hair. Jule M. Sugarman, then Human Resources Administrator, said he had also found excessive lateness and absenteeism, beginning a crackdown May 1. 1972, that in seven months caused resignations. The latest disciplinary drive by Administrator Dumpson requires every deputy in the agency to make an unannounced visit to some area in his jurisdiction at least once a month to check on his staff. It also indicates that the problem remains a severe one. In the first six months this year, the productivity campaign led to 1,476 employes suspended and fined in work days, 504 reprimanded, 29 dismissed, 10 resigned under fire, 10 fined and two demoted—with monetary savings estimated at $500,695. Mr. Dumpson cites these additional management reforms despite the loss of 2.500 staff members this year (1.700 laid off and the others departing without replacement): 4E:Face‐to‐face recert ifications required semi‐annually, is being stepped up. Controller Levitt last June estimated delays in closing cases were causing unnecessary spending of $1!million a year. He charged that staff productivity, as of last fall, was below an unofficial standard of 10 verifications daily (reaching this level only 65 per cent of the time). The Community Service Society says there are only three recertification centers for the five boroughs, and harassed clients can face case‐closings by one center simply because of a failure to resubmit documents already presented or even left on file in another welfare center. (113hoto identification cards have been improved to prevent fraud. The use of computers to match city and state payrolls with welfare rolls. Controller Levitt reported this practice turned up 2,300 cases by last spring, showing more than $2million in overpayments for such employes who are also on welfare, many times legitimately. ¶Field investigations to locate absent parents recommended 1.800 cases for closing and nearly 600 for revision of grants out of 20,000 investigated between last November and May. ¶A project to verify whether welfare family recipients actually have children by checking to see if such children are enrolled in school has resulted in 3,200 case‐closings or grant reductions out of the first 20,000 reviewed. Monitors Are Reduced Ineligibility has also been monitored by the state Welfare Inspector General's office, which was independent until a new state law transferred it July 1 to Controller Levitt's office. In its first three years through last December, the Inspector General's office estimated it had brought about $9.1‐million welfare savings statewide. Deputy Inspector General Ralph A. Cipriani says the office is now down to about 80 staff members and a budget limit of $1.3‐million, compared with 124 employes last year and a peak budget of $1.S‐million. Some experts believe the city drive against welfare fraud was handicapped by city layoffs of 150 case aides and 25 investigators last June. Stuart Leibowitz, vice president for research for Social Service Employes Union Local 371, asserts the laid‐off empioyes “generated much more money for the city than their salaries cost.” Internal memoranda in the Department of Social Services indicated the investigators were bringing about case‐closings for fraud averaging 30 a year for an annual saving of $102,000 each, compared with their salaries generally of $10,800. Despite budgetary handicaps, Mr. Dumpson contends diat service to clients has improved. He says waiting time for an applicant to get an appointment for an interview has been reduced to five days or less in all but one of 38 family centers, compared to only 21 complying with the five‐day state standard six months ago. Moreover, a system by which a client can get an appointment scheduled by telephone is in effect in 20 centers, he adds. But the Social Service Employes Union, contends that people still began lining up at midnight this summer at the employment eligibility center at 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn, where home‐relief applicants‐must report to have their employability determined. The union says most applicants had to get appointments to return, involving waiting periods up to 27 days, with a month more after that for decisions on acceptance or rejection. Beyond the program of welfare grants, the related Federal‐state‐local Medicaid program pays medical bills for welfare recipients and other sick poor. State records indicate current Medicaid costs are running $1.75 for every dollar spent on welfare grants here. Such a nearly 2 to 1 relationship seems “excessive” and far away from the experience of ordinary families, according to Dean Mitchell I. Ginsberg of the Columbia School of Social Work, and Bernard M. Shiffman, executive vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York. Dean Ginsberg says “the Medicaid program is turning into a lot of money for providers.” Mr. Shiffman adds that “better supervision of Medicaid and Medicare treatment would cost more money, but it would end some of the rip‐offs and ultimately produce a net savings.” Re says the city is “underutilizing public hospitals,” while voluntary hospital costs can irun up to $60 for an outpatient visit, reimbursable under Medicaid. The Community Council leader contends that short sighted cuts in counseling, day care, protective services to children and similar programs Can reduce welfare costs, hut would, serve to create greater costs in coping with ‘'future social problems caused by the reduction of such services. State Commissioner Berger aims to review the system that separates welfare grant payments and social services. This has been in effect nationwide under a Federal regulation since Oct. 1, 1972. “The result has been that we have lots of specialists.” Mr. Berger says. “But we may have lost the capacity to control the caseload. “I'm not !sure that going back is the right answer.” Mr. Berger says. “I think that what is necessary is a casemanagement system, in which people are treated as individuals parts of families. “Where Medicaid, public assistance and services are fragmented, the recipient gets a little of a lot of other people's time. But he goes nutty going from place to place.” One new city pilot plan aiming at eventual savings of “several million dollars” a year in administrative costs and fraud losses is to be started by Mr. Dumpson before the end of the year for 10,000 welfare clients in a Bronx center still to be chosen. The plan would have clients get their checks through banks, check cashers or credit unions instead of by mail. Such a ‐direct payment” plan is being introduced for Social Security recipients, and has been in effect for welfare cases in Nassau County. A study by a Human Resources Administration office estimates that 20 per cent of client visits to welfare centers are made simply to pick up checks. The new plan is expected to produce savings for clients who have had to run gamuts of muggers at their mailboxes and whO have had to patronize check cashers or highpriced local stores to cash checks. Only 25 per cent ot welfare checks have been cashed at banks. Tomorrow: The city's public schools."
Brigham Young U. to Challenge Federal Rules to Curb Sex Bias,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/18/archives/brigham-young-u-to-challenge-federal-rules-to-curb-sex-bias.html,"Brigham Young University, one of the nation's largest private schools, intends to challenge new Federal regulations dealing with sex discrimination and run the risk of losing its Federal aid The Provo, Utah, school will announce in newspaper advertisements today that it disputes the legality and constitutionality of parts of the Health, Education and Welfare Department's Title IX rules dealing with sex discrimination. Compliance notices from colleges and universities are due tomorrow. Dr. Dallin H. Oaks, president of the Mormon‐run school, said the new rules “infringe on religious freedom.” “University policies are already consistent with the regulation in most respects and we fully support the goal of equal opportunity for men and women in education and employment,” Mr. Oaks said in a telephone interview. “We expect to do all in our power to support and implement this goal.” However, he continued: “Where we believe the regulations are unconstitutional or illegal and where they prohibit or interfere with the teaching or practice of high moral principles, we will not follow them.” H.E.W.'s jurisdiction over Federal money flowing to the campuses includes aid to students. Any institution that does not comply with the Title IX regulations places those funds in jeopardy, under to the law. Mr. Oaks said that payments to veterans and Federal‐backed loans to students could be affected. Brigham Young enrolls 25,000 students and several thousand get some form of Federal aid. If Federal aid is cut, Mr. Oaks said, he probably would take the challenge to the courts. “We just think some of these regulations are very illegal,” he said. One regulation says that a donor of scholarships cannot desigrrate that the funds go to only men or only women. “This is a violation of due process,” Mr. Oaks said. “We look on this as depriving of property without due process.” Mr. Oaks said that Brigham Young would not follow regulations prohibiting inquiries into or actions based upon marital or parental status and pregnancy or termination of pregnancy of present or prospective students or employes. The school, sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints, teaches arrd enforces strict adherence to the highest Christian standards of morality and condemns abortion and out‐of‐wedlock births."
The fetus as guinea pig; Is such experimentation an insult to our humanity? Or is it a step toward life‐saving knowledge?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/19/archives/the-fetus-as-guinea-pig-is-such-experimentation-an-insult-to-our.html,"“I can remember a situation in which a woman entered the hospital with a miscarriage. It was a case of spontaneous abortion, and she came in because she'd been told it was about to happen. The baby, however, was born alive. It weighed less than 500 grams, or just under a pound—which was below the legal definition of a live birth (this was in Baltimore). No birth certificate was made out, therefore, and it wasn't legally born. Since it was alive, however, it was taken over to the premature unit where it survived for two days. Eventually, being at that very borderline weight, it did die. As it happened, the woman had given birth on Dec. 31; and so the two days of infant care had been during the first two days of the New Year. The parents, when they received the hospital bill. were unable to claim any tax deduction. The father was incensed and he took the position that since there never had been any legally born ‘person'—no birth certificate and no death certificate—they couldn't hold him responsible for the costs of treatment. Why should he be made to pay for the care of a child who had never even existed? The hospital, on its own part, was put in the odd position of having spent 48 hours treating an individual who wasn't even, technically speaking, born. They finally did cancel the charges, I believe, and they agreed to forget the whole thing. DR. RICHARD E. BEHRMAN, Medical Director, Babies Hospital, in an interview.  When does a fetus become “a person”? At what point in the slow continuum of fetal growth—from fertilization, to implantation in the uterine wall, to the time of the first heartbeat, to “quickening” (when the mother first perceives movement within her womb), to “viability” (the stage of fetal maturation at which the organism becomes capable of surviving outside the mother”s support system, outside the uterus), to birth itself—does it become possible to say that, yes, from here onward, the fetus is Maggie Scarf is author of “Body, Mind. Behavior,” to he published next spring, and is a Nieman Fellow at Harvard for the year 1975‐76. to be regarded as a fully human individual, endowed with status as a person and a set of protectable human rights? Legally, the position of the fetus was stated clearly in Roe v. Wade, one of the Supreme Court decisions on the abortion issue, which was handed down in 1973. The Court said that the fetus is not to be regarded as a “person in the whole sense” prior to the age of viability. Viability, as defined in the Roe‐Wade decision, is the point in fetal development at which the growing organism is “potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid'; the Court placed the stage of fetal viability at “seven months (28 weeks),” but noted that it could occur earlier, as early as 24 weeks. The Court took the view, in short, that a fetus that is born alive is not to be construed as a “person”; the fetus that can maintain a biologically independent existence—that can live, grow and develop outside the womb—is to be As one may readily see, the RoeWade decision has a curious impact upon our perception of the fetus prior to the age of viability. It places that fetus not only in an odd legal limbo, but in a metaphysical and moral one as well. For, by defining the fetus in the first two trimesters of pregnancy as “not a person in the whole sense,” the Court leaves open the entire question of what it actually is—and, more important, what may be done with it. Since the time of the Supreme Court abortion decisions, live and dead fetuses, fetal tissues, fetal organs and similar materials have become widely available for use in a dizzying array of scientific investigations. At the same time, antiabortion forces, who believe that fetal work “legitimizes” abortion practices, as well as people who are simply opposed to this experimentation on moral and ethical grounds, have been pressing for legislation that will impede or halt fetal research entirely. Opponents of this work have decried it as a form of “mad science” and an assault on human values and human dignity. Scientists, for their part, have been protesting what they view as persecutory tactics, spearheaded by “anti In 1974, in response to a surge of public concern over fetal and other kinds of research that utilized “human subjects,” Congress enacted legislation to establish a (Continued on Page 89) The human embryo at 30 days, 31 days, 34 days. 40 days. 44 days. 56 days. In this time, it grows in length from about a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half. The fetus at 12 weeks: “Not a person in the whole sense.” according to Supreme Court but to others a “human subject” that deserves protection. The fetus National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission. whose members were selected by the Secretary of Health. Education and Welfare, was entrusted with the task of studying the various types of human research and suggesting possible regulations for experimentation that might go on in the future. Whiie the National Commission was to have no legal power to enforce its decisions. the Congressional legislation did require the Secretary of H.E.W. to respond to whatever report it made (either negatively or positively) when he drew up his guidelines for the ptotection of human subjects. The same act of Congress that established the National Commission also provided for a ban on all experimentation involving live, whole fetuses, before or after an induced abortion—and it instructed the commission to investigate fetal research in advance of all other kinds of human research, as its very first order of business. As if these moves were not sobering enough for scientists working in this area, the Department of Health. Education and Welfare then suggested that a voluntary “moratorium” on any even mildly questionable fetal studies be entered into by investigators whose research thety were supporting supporting. It was thus in an atmosphere of some apprehension and a good deal of bitter misunderstanding that the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects was appointed; it consisted of three lawyers, three physician‐investigators, two medical ethicists, two psychologists and one “public representative.” Perhaps the thorniest issue they had to consider was that of the fetus's humanity—does fetal work involve research on “human beings,” or are fetuses, prior to viability, “nonpeople,” and therefore perfectly legitimate subjects for use in potentially scientific studies? The question of what the fetus is, as one philosopher working as a consultant to the National Commission remarked to me, is not so much a moral and ethical as it is a pre‐ethical issue. “You have to define what it is you're talking about,” he explained. “before you can define whatever you're doing as right or wrong.” The word “person” is variously defined, but generally signifies a being characterized by the ability to experience consciousness of self, to communicate, to experience sensations of pain and pleasure, to reason, to behave autonomously both in the moral and physical sense, and so forth. If the fetus cannot do that, then to what else may it best be equated? Is the fetus, for instance, more nearly similar to an animal than it is to a fully human “person”? The ancient philosophers, in point of fact, did so characterize it—they took the view that the developing organism moved from the merely vegetative stage to the animal and finally to the rational level. If it is true, as recent researchers at Albert Einstein Medical School have suggested that “brain life“—the capacity for human intelligence, including consciousness, selfawareness and other generally recognized cerebral functions —does not come into being until after the 28th week of fetal life, then can experimentation on the fetus up until the end of the seventh month of pregnancy be seen as nothing too different from experimentation on a monkey or a rabbit? We, as a society, certainly do permit and find morally justifiable a wide range of biomedical investigations that make use of living animal subjects. And such experimentation has yielded impressive medical and scientific benefits—the human community has clearly profited from them. perhaps the fetus might, in the early months of pregnancy, more profitably be viewed as something that is simply a part of the mother's body—something similar to her gall bladder or her appendix. If she should choose, due to some pressing set of reasons, to have her gall bladder, appendix or her fetus removed, then she might give consent to have the excised part of her body studied. Isn't her permission—since the fetus was once a part of her—all the moral justification the investigator needs in order to proceed with an experiment? Many scientists think so. But in a paper on fetal experimentation prepared for the National Commission, Dr. Leon Kass of the Kennedy Institute of Bioethics at Georgetown University said flatly: “The assertion that the fetus is a part of the mother is simply false. The fetus, in its varying stages, is a self‐developing, self‐changing whole, which assimilates and transforms food supplied by the mother, and grows and differentiates itself according to the plan encoded in its own DNA.” Other experts consulting with the commission have attacked the validity of maternal consent on different grounds. If the mother has determined to abort her fetus, they argue, isn't the meaning of her consent highly equivocal? Generally speaking, in cases involving experimentation on a living, human child, the parent's proxy consent is required—i.e., the parent of a 4‐year‐old child suffering from leukemia would have to give consent if the physican wished to treat the child with a new and unproven drug. The parent is assumed, in such an instance, to “speak for the child,” to be the one who has the child's best interests at heart. In a situation in which the mother has already decided upon abortion, however, her own interests (wanting to terminate her pregnancy) would appear to be in some conflict with the interests of the fetus. Is she, then, the person who may most properly “speak on behalf of the fetus,” the person who can be assumed to hold the best interests of that fetus closest to heart? Paul Ramsey, the Princeton theologian and ethical philosopher, has suggested that a good deal of biomedical research involving the human fetus can be seen as similar to experimentation upon unconscious or dying patients. For the fetus, like the unconscious or dying person, is a nonconsenting, vulnerable and helpless human subject. In his recent book “The Ethics of Fetal Research” (Yale University Press, 1975), he carried this analogy further: “In cases of induced abortion,” he wrote, “the fetal human being resembles not only the dying; it also closely resembles the condemned (even if necessarily and justly, but tragically, still the condemned).” Dr. Ramsey, 63, has been serving as one of the battery of consultants to the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects over the course of the past year. “One might argue,” he pointed out, during the course of a talk we had in his Princeton office, “that capital punishment presented us with a similar ‘golden opportunity’ to do highrisk medical experimentation. After all, the condemned prisoner, like the living previable fetus, was going to die anyhow. So why is it that we didn't research someone in that position to death? Such experimentation could, you know, have been seen as ‘ennobling’ the death of the human subject by using him to make great contributions to mankind”  Ramsey smiled briefly: “I think we all know that would be a morally degrading use of the condemned for us, as a society, to make.” I suggested to Ramsey that the classes of persons to whom he was comparing the fetus—that is, the unconscious, the dying, the condemned —were all among the more “helpless” kinds of human beings. This seemed to beg the whole question of the “personhood” of the fetus; and hence its eligibility for the customary human rights and protections. “I myself,” he responded at once, “am of the opinion that the unborn fetus is a protectable human being.” Professor Ramsey leaned forward: “What we're really discussing here is not an object called the live but nonviable fetus. We're really discussing a tragical case of a dying baby—and the concern I am expressing is about the dying; that is, about imposing research upon this dying creature, who cannot consent. I mean, all of a sudden here are these ‘things’ that can be used for scientific experimentation—and the human fetus could easily become the most unprotected primate in medical research.” Fetal research is not something new under the sun—embryonic human tissues taken from live but nonviable, spontaneously expelled fetuses were, for example, vitally necessary for culturing the viruses that led to the creation of polio vaccine back in the nineteen‐forties. What is new is the extraordinary growth and vitality of this area of study: Fetal experimentation is a “hot” field in medicine, not only because of some striking recent advances, but because the ready availability of fetuses and fetal organs—as a result of the 1973 abortion decisions— has itself stimulated a good deal of work. Some medical ethicists have, as a matter of fact, contended that if we as a society do condone abortion, then there can be no earthly reason for our refusal to condone experimentation on the fetus. If, as in the Roe‐Wade decision, we are making the claim that a mother has the right to abort her previable fetus because the fetus is not yet a “person in the whole sense,” with its own set of rights and protections, then why defend and protect the fetus from experimental procedures? Drs. Willard Gaylin and Marc Lapp& of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, have asserted that such a positioni.e., permitting abortion but drawing the line at much or all fetal experimentation—has “an element of the irrational about it.” Writing in the Atlantic Monthly in May of 1975, the two authors observed that the fact that some people do hold these mutually contradictory positions “ perplex [es] many of us. Such absolute and complete defense of the dignity and autonomous rights of the fetus seems bizarre, when in abortion, we condone procedures which subject the fetus to dismemberment, salt‐induced osmotic shock, or surgical extirpation. No experimentation so far imagined would do the same. If society can condone abortion procedures which subject the live fetus to these unimaginable acts of violence, how can it balk at giving a mother an aspirin prior to those procedures in order to determine if the drug crosses the placenta—with the hope that the knowledge thereby gained will prevent damage to future wanted babies?” Why not indeed? Critics of the Gaylin‐Lappe position have pointed out that their moral justification for experimentation on the live fetus seems to be predicated on the fact that we're going to be committing “unimaginable acts of violence” upon it anyhow. In other words, because the worst will be visited upon the fetus ultimately, lesser acts along the way ought (rationally speaking) to be tolerated. This a worrisome kind of argument to use in defense of any type of research. If it is furthermore, that experimentation can sometimes involve a good deal more than simply having mothers swallow aspirins just prior to abortion procedures. In that instance, the moral costs of the research would appear—in my own view—to be low, and the possible benefits to be high; there are, however, other instances in which the weighing‐up of costs and benefits might tilt the argument strongly in the other direction. An experiment called “An Artificial Placenta,” for example, involved an attempt to simulate the role of the placenta in supplying oxygen to the immature fetus. For that experiment, eight fetuses were obtained by hysterotomy—an abortion procedure often used after the fifth month of pregnancy— which is much like a Caesarian operation. The living fetuses, ranging in weight from 300 to 980 grams were then placed in tanks filled with warmed, saline solution (to mimic amniotic fluid). Small cannulas, or tubes, were inserted in the umbilical arteries and veins—for pumping in and removing oxygenated blood. The researchers had constructed an elaborate circulation system, which, they hoped, would prove able to play the mother's role in supplying oxygen to the fetus. In the case of the wanted fetus, this could be the means of assisting the prema ture infant to survive until its lungs had matured enough to allow for breathing: the experiment described here was simply intended to test out the oxygenation circuitry. The following is taken from the investigators’ report, and details the death of the largest (980 grams) fetus used in the study: “For the whole 5 hours of life, the fetus did not respire. Irregular gasping movements, twice a minute, occurred in the middle of the experiment but there was no proper respiration. Once the perfusion [i.e., the pumping‐in of oxygenated blood] was stopped, however, the gasping respiratory efforts increased to 8 to 10 per minute. After stopping the circuit, the heart slowed, became irregular and eventually stopped. The fetus was quiet, making occasional stretching limb movements very like the ones reported in other human work. The fetus died 21 minutes after leaving the circuit” “An Artificial Placenta” is a study that has provoked a storm of ethical criticism: Not only does it smack uncomfortably of research on the dying, but it brings to mind old tales of mad science, the “living beings preserve din tanks.” This makes it all the more interesting to note that, shortly after this research was completed, it won the Foundation Prize Award from the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A more recent fetal investigation, which has not yet attracted much attention and criticism—but which undoubtedly will—was reported upon in a 1975 paper innocuously entitled: “Oxidation of Glucose and D‐B‐OH Butyrate by the Early Human Fetal Brain.” This research was directed toward ascertaining whether or not the fetal brain is capable of utilizing the breakdown products of fat bodies when the usual source of “brain energy” (which is glucose, a sugar) happens to be in short supply. It was already known that when an adult was starving. D‐B‐OH butyrate, a breakdown product of fat stored in the liver, could be taken up and used by the cerebral tissues; thus, when the adult brain was not being nourished by its usual energy source, glucose, it could survive on derivatives of the body's stored fats. But, given a state of fetal emergency—say, if a diabetic mother were failing to provide adequate glucose to the growing organism—was it possible for the fetus's brain to function in the same way? In order to answer this question, 12 human fetuses between 12 and 21 weeks of gestation were studied. The fetuses were, at these ages, nonviable; all died soon after delivery. Once the fetal heartbeat had ceased, a catheter was inserted into the major artery leading to the brain (the carotid). The head of the fetus was then, as the investigators phrased it “isolated surgically from the other organs“; in other words, the fetuses’ heads were cut off. The fetal brains were then perfused, first with the glucose, and then with D‐pOH butyrate, and the rate at which the cerebral tissues took up each of these substances was carefully measured. In this way, it was possible to demonstrate that the fetal brain can support metabolism of D‐B‐OH butyrate as an alternative “brain fuel” in the event that normal glucose supplies are unavailable. (It should be explained that while the fetuses were officially dead at the outset of this experiment — heartbeat having ceased—their brain tissues were living, for death at the cellular level had not yet occoured.) Shades of “Donovan's At Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. Thomas Kerenyi performs amniocentesis‐drawing fluid from the pregnant woman's womb to check on the health of her fetus. The procedure is considered an important part of developing fetal research. Brain!” It is undeniably somewhat strange to read, in the researchers’ account of this experimentation, that the fetal heads were placed in something they referred to as an “organ chamber.” And one cannot help but wonder if, on balance, it is worth doing this kind of experiment in order to obtain this bit of knowledge of fetal physiology. Some types of scientific research, particularly those that may serve to harden or brutalize the investigator (and the society he or she serves as well) may simply not be worth the moral price they exact. But this is my own opinion: others would view this work as totally unobjectionable biomedical research. As the author and bioethicist Dr. Joseph Fletcher complained (in “The Ethics of Genetic Control,” Anchor Press, 1974): “Many people's belief propositions are entirely visceral, not rational—witness, for example, the repugnance some people feel at perfusion of a separated fetus head while feeling none at the perfusion of its kidney. Where we start from is essentially important in understanding our own moral judgments and others. ” In Fletcher's opinion, as stated repeatedly both in his book and in a paper prepared for the National Commission the great advances in health and welfare that may accrue to the human race as a direct result of this experimentation are justification enough for such research on the human fetus. According to Dr. Maurice J. Mahoney, Associate Professor of Human Genetics and Pediatrics at Yale University, experimentation involving the use of the whole, living fetus after an abortion—or, as may also occur, during the abortion procedure itself—represents well under 1 per cent of published fetal research. Dr. Mahoney, another of the consultants working with the National Commission, has compiled an overview of all fetal work carried out between the years 1969 and 1975. “Most fetal research has actually addressed itself to diagnosing the fetus that is sick inside the uterus,” he told me, “and to finding ways to help and treat that fetus.” He himself, Dr. Mahoney said, takes a negative view of the small amount of fetal experimentation that falls into the “artificial placenta” and “severed heads” category. “I think there's something about invading the human body in these ways that makes most of us feel uncomfortable.” Nevertheless, he noted, even such morally dubious studies as these have been motivated by sincere attempts to solve real and urgent medical problems. ☐ Is it possible that the living fetus suffers during experimental procedures? Could the eight fetal subjects used in the “artificial placenta” research, for example, have been experiencing pain during their hours in the fluid‐filled tank? It seems to be impossible to answer this question with total certainty. However, in the opinion of every medical expert that I spoke to, it seems extraordinarily improbable that the fetus—at least before the age of 28 weeks—could have the capacity to suffer. The central nervous system is apparently still too underdeveloped. The nerve endings in the skin have not yet extended outward with any of the degree of the affluence to be seen later on: the surface of the brain is relatively smooth, showing little in the way of the convolutions seen in the mature human brain cortex. The nerve endings have not yet developed their fatty myelin sheaths—and without these sheaths, which play some crucial role in the transmission of nervous “messages” from one nerve cell to the next, it is hard to imagine sensations of pain “getting through.” The fetus's “incapacity for experiencing pain” is one of the four major reasons set forth by Sissela Bok in support of continuing—though carefully regulated—research involving living fetal subjects. Dr. Bok, who is a lecturer on Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School, is another of the consultants working with The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects. In a position paper prepared for the commission last March, she cited four major reasons for not permitting experimentation on nonconsenting human subjects. These were: (1) because we would not want to cause harm or suffering to the victim, (2) because we would not want to cause grief to those who were bound to the victim by ties of affection, love or economic dependence, (3) because we would not want to permit brutalization or criminalization of the researcher and (4) because we would not want to permit the brutalization of society—since we all have a stake in the protection of human life. In the case of the nonviable fetus, Bok pointed out, the organism is not capable of experiencing pain, and is dying as well—the researcher can, therefore, do it no serious harm. If consent for experimentation is given by the mother or both parents, no suffering will be caused on the part of those who might otherwise experience sadness, loss and anguish. The researcher will not be brutalized by the work he is doing, because he is experimenting on a “not‐yet‐viable” subject —an organism related to the human community in potential, but not yet in fact. Lastly, the society that permits such research will not be brutalized—as we would be, were we to permit experimentation on other kinds of vulnerable, nonconsenting subjects, such as the unconscious or dying person, the infant, the condemned prisoner—because we will not have violated our own strong sense of the worth, protectability and value of the individual human life. In a conversation with Dr. Bok at her home in Cambridge, I asked when, in her estimation, the developing fetus becomes “a person.” Bok, who has the wide blue eyes and blond haircut of a Dutch schoolgirl—so that the force and determination of her personality take one slightly by surprise — shook her head quickly. “I think that's a wrong question to ask,” she said. “People have become simply mesmerized by that question, and it's really a question that has no answer. Because we are, after all, talking about something that is biologically ‘human’ not only after fertilization, but before —the ovum cell and the sperm cells are certainly both living and human even before they meet. “But if we are talking about ‘personhood,’ then I believe it's impossible to speak of the fertilized egg, early in gestation, as ‘a man,'” she continued, “although I realize that some theologians and others do.... It's as if one were to have to contemplate having funerals for two or three‐month fetuses that had miscarried or investigations for murder each time a fetus died in utero for reasons that weren't completely clear.” What it is essential to do, suggested Dr. Bok, is to draw a line—“an artificial line, admittedly, because as I said, nature hasn't provided us with a biological one“—at some point early in pregnancy, and to say that beyond that stage of development no experimentation will be allowable. The line must, she stated be drawn at a time in pregnancy when there can be no question whatsoever about the possible viability of the fetus to be used as a subject in biomedical research. “I think,” she added, “that we'll always have to be very careful anyhow, and that it will be essential for us to continue having experimentation committees that can oversee and regulate all proposals for this kind of research.” ☐ Last May, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects, headed by Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, submitted a full report on their deliberations and conclusions concerning research on the fetus to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (and most of their recommendations were subsequently adopted and incorporated into new guidelines set by the Secretary in August). They suggested that the total ban on experimentation involving the living human fetus be lifted; they also called for the end of the moratorium on H.E.W. supported fetal research. At the same time, they set the “age of viability” at 20 weeks (four and a half months) and 500 grams; this was much more conservative than the Supreme Court's definition had been. What this means, in essence, is that any fetus above the age of 20 weeks is “possibly viable,” and therefore not a candidate for use in biomedical studies. The commission also proposed a set of guidelines that would serve to restrict and carefully regulate (in some instances, prohibit outright) certain types of fetal experimentation. One kind of research procedure, for example, involves injecting the pregnant mother—who has already decided upon abortion—with drugs whose effects upon the fetus are not fully known. Then, following upon abortion procedures and the fetus's death, an autopsy is performed in order to ascertain the extent to which the drug was able (if it was able) to cross the placental membrane and affect the fetus. This kind of information is often invaluable to the physician treating the pregnant woman who plans to bring her baby to term. In research such as this, the commission has now ruled against the “testing out” of potentially harmful drugs on fetuses whose mothers have decided upon abortion. The fetus whose mother plans to abort it, the commission has asserted, is no different in itself and in its own essence from a fetus whose mother plans to bring it to term; the only distinction between them is our knowledge of the impending abortion. This ought not, in the commission's opinion, serve to render the fetus‐to‐be‐aborted into a testing animal. Mothers do sometimes change their minds about going ahead with a planned abortion—and for this reason, the commission has proscribed all experimentation involving the fetus in utero that entails anything more than “minimal risk.” It is interesting to note at this point that fetal work carried out by the defendants in the “Boston Grave‐Robbing Case” would be permissible under the commission's new ruling, even though it is now about to be prosecuted by law. The case involved an attempt to find out what kinds of antibiotics might best be prescribed for pregnant women who had syphilis and who were allergic to penicillin. The syphilis, left alone, would invade the fetus and cause congenital defects; the penicillin, while capable of treating the fetus in utero, could not be tolerated by the pregnant mother. The question was what other antibiotic might most effectively be used in its place. In order to find out, researchers performed routine experimentation with 14 pregnant women, all planning abortions, who agreed to accept injections of two different antibiotics while their fetuses were still in utero. Later on, after the nonviable fetuses were aborted and had died, the investigators did autopsies to find out which of the two substitute antibiotics had penetrated the placental barrier most effectively. The doctors who performed this research apparently neglected to get the mothers’ signed permission to do the autopsies, which left them vulnerable to prosecution under grave‐robbing statutes. Three of the doctors were indicted more than a year and a half ago, but their trial date has not yet set. One of the most sensitive issues to be discussed by the National Commission was the whole problem of research involving the intact, living fetus —in practical terms, an aborted fetus that is alive after delivery, but not viable and predictably going to die. Such a fetus must, the report of the commissioners stated, bc viewed as a “dying subject.” Stating that “issues of violation of integrity are central,” the commission recommended that“out of consideration for the dying subject,” no experimental procedures be permitted that would alter the duration of the fetus's existence, either shortening its life by methods that might literally research it to death, or prolonging its life. (Enforcement of this regulation would, obviously, serve to prohibit research of the type reported upon in “An Artificial Placenta.”) In a section of their report entitled “Deliberations and Conclusions,” the commissioners reviewed some of the complex problems that were debated during their effort to set some reasonable medicalsocial policy in this truly formidable area. But it is fascinating to note that nowhere in their summing‐up document does the commission try to define the nature of the fetus (nonhuman? prehuman? animallike? “somewhat‐human'? “person”?); aside from the fact that the fetus is discussed under the rubric of “human subject,” they remain silent on this question. But consultant Paul Ramsey, his sharp blue eyes glittering humorously, observed: “the fact that the National Commission has drawn up any protective legislation concerning the human fetus has demonstrated that they do consider it to be a vulnerable, nonconsenting subject of research which is entitled to rights and protections of some kinds. It seems to me,” he added, with a sly pursing of his lips, “that once you've conceded that much‐I mean that you are talking about something which is, in some sense ‘human’ and protectable‐why you've obviously conceded quite a lot.” ☐ Why do fetal exinrimentation at all? Why not, given that this research has ruffled so many moral feathers and aroused such antipathy among certain portions of the population, simply drop the enterprise altogether? The issue need not be linked to the question of abortion‐we could, for example, think of continuing to permit abortions to women who want them during the early weeks of pregnancy, but prohibit the use of the abortuses (or the products of spontaneous mis carriages) as material for study in biomedical experimentation. Is there, in fact, some technologoical imperative urging us implacably onward? Is this research really necessary? The fact is that fetal experimentation has become important In medicine because it seems to be exploding in number cf difterent directions. and many real advances have alreday been made. One of the most important among these, according to Professor Richard E. Behrman, M.D., Chairman of the Pediatrics Department at Columbia and Director of its Babies Hospital, has been the development of amniocentesis. The word means, literally, “piercing of the amnion,” the sac enclosing the fetus; and the procedure involves sending a fine needle through the mother's belly and into her womb. By withdrawing a sample of the amniotic fluid and subjecting it to careful analysis, physicians are able to diagnose the presence of any of several dozen known genetic (and other) fetal diseases. For instance, Down's syndrome— If we can condone abortion, some ask, then how can we possibly object to fetal research? called mongolism—one of the common causes of mental retardation, can readily be detected in utero by this means and the prospective parents can then be forewarned of the danger and make their own choice about whether or not to terminate that pregnancy. “Now the whole development in this area did involve fetal research,” observed Dr. Behrman. “I mean, someone did have to take the risk of putting that needle into the mother's uterus. And it had to be done not only in instances where the fetus was thought to be suffering from a disease, but in cases where it was known to be perfectly healthy—so that we could make the necessary comparisons between the ‘sick’ and the ‘normal’ fetal cell.” The development of amniocentesis, Behrman continued, was crucial to the discovery of effective treatments for Rhdiseased fetuses and infants. Rh‐disease, known also as Rhincompatibility, used to result in the births of scores of severely damaged — retarded and deaf—children, and in the delivery of many dead Infants as well. The problem arises when a mother and her fetus are of differing blood‐types and cells in the mother's blood have become sensitized to the red‐blood cells of her developing offspring. What occurs is essentially an immune reaction on the mother's part. She forms antibodies that literally attack and destroy the red blood cells of the fetus much as they would attack and annihilate an invading virus. By means of amniocentesis doctors are now, however, able to detect the distressed fetus before too much harm has taken place and take steps to treat it while it remains lodged in the womb. Fetal research whose effects will be felt in the future is directed mainly toward precise measurement of several dimensions of behavior in utero: For instance, the fetus's ability to perceive sound (and the subsequent effects upon heart‐rate and brain activity), its swallowing and breathing and gasping patterns, its pattern of urination and its periods of apparent sleep are all currently under study. More exact knowledge of these fetal functions can make a life‐and‐death difference in circumstances where an early delivery may be indicated and the doctor is uncertain about the maturity of the fetus and therefore its capacity to survive outside the womb. Such information may also be vital to the earlier detection of fetuses that haveb ecome ill inside the uterus. A number of fetal scientists, sensitive to recent criticisms, assert that a failure to pursue such research at this point would be an abandonment of the fetal patient; they add, too, that there has been far too little public awareness of the real gains that have been made in fetal medicine. For instance, researchers have learned to peer directly into the womb and identify structural defects in the developing fetus (such as hydrocephalus, or “water on the brain,” and anencephaly, the failure of the brain to develop). These increasingly sophisticated diagnostic techniques do suggest that more sophisticated methods of treatment will be in the offing. And many questions about fetal life and development, some of them of a pressing nature, remain unanswered. In numerous instances, for example, it is not known how the drugs a pregnant woman is taking are going to affect her fetus. If the mother is taking antidepres‐‐sants (which cause changes in her mood by effecting alterations in her brain chemistry), are those drugs entering the brain of the growing fetus as well? And if so, do they affect brain development and funcioning—and in what ways? Much more needs to be learned about the effects of maternal psychotropic drugtaking, maternal smoking and environmental pollutants that the mother may be ingesting a recent study has, for instance, linked the taking of common aspirin with the incidence of stillbirths. Thus far, it appears to me, the real advances in fetal knowledge have not come from the more brutal, invasive “cutting and chopping” experimentation, or research protocols that call for maintaining live fetuses in amnionlike brine, but rather from the standard kinds of medical research that are more or less directed towards caring for and helping the particular fetuses involved. The major gains (thus far) have really been in areas in which the fetus was the “subject to he treated,” not the “object to be studied.” Undoubtedly, however, we are now moving into a time in which critical choices are going to have to be faced and made. We do, on the one hand, share a strong presumption that experimentation on dying people is wrong, and that human life is not to be treated casually. On the other hand, many of us also do have doubts regarding the “personhood” of the fetus and realize that we may be balancing its welfare against that of untold numbers of babies who will live to enter the human community, and can be benefited vastly from this research. On the one side are our concerns anout permitting medical researchers to make use of something human; on the other, the promise of great scientific good to he obtained. There is an element of ultimate conflict in this whole peculiar situation."
Flick Fads Pack Paper,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/19/archives/flick-fads-pack-paper.html,"Not content with merely viewing old films on TV, in movie houses and at American film festivals, the devotees of pre‐1950 flicks have been searching for and gathering up tons of onesheets, lobby cards, original programs and other assorted memorabilia, as well as devouring the plethora of books about film currently available, particularly in paperback. Star‐biographies lead the pack. Pyramid Books has released a dandy line of oversized, slick, photo‐packed items grandiloquently called the Pyramid Illustrated History of the Movies. The series provides thumbnail descriptions of the stars’ work, with generous ladlings of reviews and interviews from contemporary periodicals and newspapers, carefully (and wisely) skirting the scandal and gossip. To be sure, each book traces personal and professional history, but Jerry Vermilye's “Barbara Stanwyck” ($1.75) concentrates mainly on that lady's prime virtue: she was the cornpleat pro; everyone from the grips and gaffers to her co‐stars and directors loved her, she was well known for giving a helping hand when she could (for instance, her intercession with Harry Cohn on behalf of William Holden for the title role in “Golden Boy”). “Edward G. Robinson” ($1.75) by Foster Hirsch is somewhat ambiguous since the author maintains that Robinson never shook the yoke of typecasting once he had created Rico in “Little Caesar” and that his credibility as an actor in other than gangster roles was ever afterward strained. Hirsch then goes on to praise Robinson for his characterizations of Dr. Erlich, the insurance investigator in “Double Indemnity,” Gino Monetti in “House of Strangers” and for several other roles outside the tough‐guy genre. It's almost as though Mr. Hirsch, in writing the book, began to savor the memory of the little giant, once he recalled the other films. Jeanine Basinger, on the other hand, knows exactly what she is doing in “Shirley Temple” ($1.75). She has had the insight and the courage to evaluate Miss Temple's appeal during the mid and late thirties in a way that no one (ro my knowledge) has touched upon in print. “What,” asks Designer, “brought so many people into the theaters?” It was that Shirley was “so sexy as a small child. Beneath the surface of her screen image lurked hidden, disturbing messages. She was an outand‐out baby scxpot her constantly Mel Torme is a singer, song writer and the author of “The Other Side of the Rainbow,” about Judy Garland kissing little mouth unquestionably held an adult's promise.” “Jack Nicholson: Face to Face,” by David D. Crane and Christopher Fryer (M. Evans. Cloth, $9.95. Paper, $5.95) would seem, at first glance, to be somewhat premature, since Nicholson's emergence as a star is quite recent. What Crane and Fryer have done is to put together a series of interviews with people who have worked with Nicholson (Karen Black, Bruce Dern, Ann‐Margret, Dennis Hopper). There is a final commentary by the authors, curiously maw) a mano, wherein they interview each other about Nicholson. Like I said, curious. There seems, also, to be a batch of standard‐size paperbacks of the purely biographical variety, among which “The James Dean Story,” by Ronald Martinetti (Pinnacle, $1.50), and “The Marx Bros.,” by Allan Eyles (Warner, $1.50) are most interesting. I was just beginning to know Dean, (he was passionate about learning to play bongo drums, and I am a sometime drummer) when he died, leaving the huge question: would he have developed into really great actor, or was he merely a cult hero in life, made even more sacred in death? I think he had the makings. Martinetti seems to share that opinion. Now don't laugh, but in 1942‐43 worked as singer, arranger and occasional drummer for Chico Marx in a truly swinging big band put together for him by the late Ben Pollack. During the tenure of my employment, had the opportunity to observe Chico's various peccadillos. He was an obsessive gambler, especially on the horses; he had an eye for girls, and mean girls, not women. I remember Harpo's gentle charm and wit (he took over the leadership of the band for full month when Chico fell ill) and Groucho's absentmindedness (I met the Mustachioed One when I joined the band at 16, have since spent many evenings in his company, and must always be reintroduced, as must so many others). I was always impressed, though, with the fact that the three more prominent brothers (I never met Zeppo or Gummo) were bonafide zanies who carried their nutsiness beyond the cameras, each in his own inimitable way. Allan Eyles's book fun. Yet another category of cinema books might come under the broad title “The Films of ” In this vein, “The Abbott and Costello Book” by Jim Mullholland (Popular, $3.95) offers a small biographical section plus beaucoup stills. It is, I think, a book for A‐and‐C cultists only. There are more of these special Items than one would imagine. “The Films of W. C. Fields” by Donald Deschner (Citadel, Cloth $12. Paper, $4.95) serves this purpose. Many stills, a short piece by Fields himself titled “Anything for a Laugh,” and a chronological listing of the bulbous‐nosed comedian's celluloid output through the years. As an added fillip, there is a final article by Heywood Broun, “W. C. Fields and the Cosmos,” which claims Fields was a better actor than Walter Hampden. Hmmm! For a truly incisive look at Fields I would recommend William K. Everson's fine “The Art of W. C. Fields,” a far more informative book that is unfortunately out of print. “The Busby Berkeley Book” by Tony Thomas and Jim Terry with Busby Berkeley (A. and W. Visual Library, $6.95) has a loving foreword by Ruby Keeler and the kind of well‐doctimented, expertly researched text one has come to expect from Tony Thomas, who along with two other outstanding film historians, Clifford McCarty and Rudy Behlmer, turned OM the excellent “Films of Errol Flynn” few years back. (Citadel. Cloth, $12. Paper, $5.95.) Berkeley's own reminiscences make this book particularly interesting. Example: During the Broadway opening night of the Rogers and Hart musical “Present Arms,” Berkeley writes, “I launched into my first song, ‘You Took Advantage of Me,’ and after the first chorus, my mind went blank. couldn't remember a line but had to keep singing. I concocted some lines like: When I was walking down the street I saw a little bird who called tweet tweet I shook my head And said, instead Cause took advantage of me. “It was awful but I got through it. I can still see poor Larry Hart running up and down in the wings almost apoplectic. But I drew a lot of laughs from the audience that night and he (Hart) later forgave me.” Berkeley went over to MGM from Warner Brothers in 1939 to direct “Babes in Arms,” with Rooney and Garland, and stayed to create memorable sequences, subsequently, with the same young team. “Strike Up the Band” boasts the famous “Conga” number hi the high school gym, in which a very long truck‐crane shot remains, today, one of the most discussed pieces of film ever to grace musical. Berkeley had many imitators, but he remains today one of a kind. Thomas and Terry leave no doubt about that fact of life. “The Films of Carole Lombard,” by Frederick W. Ott (Citadel, $4.95) does not, correctly I think, dwell upon Miss Lombard's famous, choice four‐letterword vocabulary, nor does it go into her wonderfully outrageous behavior. It is principally a filmography and succeeds admirably. The plane crash in which she died, and Its aftermath, are Above I mentioned William K. Everson. I should do more now than merely mention him. He represents, to me and thousands like me, the ultimate in film scholarship and insight. Nnw I can happily report the paperback publication of his superb work, “A Pictorial History of the Western Film” (Citadel, $4.95). It is certainly the definitive tome on sagebrush sagas, covering, as it does, over 66 years of Westerns from “The Great Train Robbery” (1903) to “True Grit” (1969). Along the way we learn about the “B” Westerns of Sunset Carson, Charles Starrett, Wild Bill Elliott, the comedy Westerns (Abbott and Costello in “Ride ‘em Cowboy”), the sleepers (“Pursued” with Mitchum, “Wagonmaster” with Ward Bond) and the “biggies” (“Red River,” “Stagecoach,” “The Big Country,” “Duel in the Sun”). The beauty of all of Everson's books is that, while most similar works rely on pictorial and graphic art to sustain interest, Everson reverses the process, dazzling the reader with all sorts of little‐known facts. There are, to be sure, where it's at in the Everson books. This one is a must. For an interesting and perhaps shocking look at how the times, they have a‐changed, one needs only to turn the first few pages of “The Talkies: Articles and Illustrations From a Great Fan Magazine,” edited by Richard Griffith (Dover, $5.95). The “great fan magazine” is Photoplay, and the articles range from 1928 to 1940. There are one‐sheet reproductions, tips on aids and lovely full‐color covers of Jean Harlow and Clara Bow. The feature articles, however, are something of a revelation. In these days of scandal‐mongering ‐fan‐inag dreck concentrating on who is doing what to whom, with misleading headlines, stories which declare that this virile‐looking movie star is gay, or that famous young actress has just had her third abortion, or this actor has moved out of his house, leaving his wife and kidlets to shack up with a well‐known female rock singer‐pothead one reads rather wistfully in “The Talkies” about how “It's Lonely Being a Child Prodigy” (by Deanna Durbin), “The Greatest Actress in Hollywood Is Zasu Pitts” (by Erich Von Stroheim) and “Don't Go Platinum Yet, Read Before You Dye” (by Jean Harlow). With all the Merest in old movies, a slew of movie quiz books is only natural. Stanley Appelbaum has put together “The Silent Movies Picture Quiz Book,” “The Hollywood Musical Picture Quiz Book” and “The Movies: A Picture Quiz Book” (Dover, $2.50 each). Every question in these books is accompanied by a corresponding still, and if one has evert a‐ rudimentary acquaintance with films, the answers should instantly come to mind. “The Movie Buff's Book” edited by Ted Sennett (Pyramid, $3.95) is just that, a book for buffs. In the area of “remakes,” do you know the titles of the two that Fox did of “Folies Bergore”? Well, believe it or not, I have asked many film fanatics this question through the years, and on several occasions it has separated the dedicated from the only interested. (In case you care, the “remakes” were “That Night in Rio,” and “On the Riviera.” There! Now you'll sleep better.) There is a chapter called “They Had Character,” in which your memory is tested ort roles played by supporting players whose names are more familiar than their faces. The real toughie seemed to me to be “Screen Test: A Quiz Book About the Movies” (Penguin, $2.50), by Peter Bowen, Martin Hayden and Frank Riess, published in En'gland, where they take their movie expertise seriously; it contains some of the trickiest most obscure tions imaginable. In a category all it's own is a fine volume called “King of the B's” edited by Tod McCarthy and Charles Flynn (Dutton. Cloth, $12. Paper, $6.95). At long last, the sadly neglected “B” picture is given loving coverage by a variety of writers who do not seek to denigrate the actors, producers, directors and studios involved in what was once the meat‐and‐potatoes element of the industry. An article by Flynn, “The Schlock/Kitsch/Hack Movies,” deals with the sort of B's produced solely in the interest of buckchasing. “The Economic Imperative: Why Was the B Movie Necessary?” by the authors, examines the financial reasons for producing B's. Manny Far. bet's “Blame the Audience” studies the decline of the B's. Best of all is Andrew Sarris's “Beatitudes of the B Pictures.” A few final remarks. Rudy Behlmer and Tony Thomas have just finished a new, immensely interesting bookcalled “Hollywood's Hollywood,” the first attempt ever to review and evaluate every film ever made about the making of movies. It will be published in hardcover by Citadel in November, and if you're even remotely interested in cinema, you'll want it."
TV VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/19/archives/tv-view-a-mindless-exploitation-of-patty-hearst.html,"Anyone surveying the wreckage, the numbing mediocrity, of this year's new TV series may have suspected that the networks were on a selfdestruct binge, but thp presentation of a madefor‐TV movie entitled “Katherine” on ABC two Sundays ago came close to Providing concrete evidence. Katherine Alman (Sissy Spacelc), the publicity releases noted, was a young heiress who rejected her parents and pampered lite to join a group of terrorists'''. ABC stressed that Katherine Alman was in no way modeled after Patty Hearst and, indeed, the fictional character was more a composite of assorted women catapulted to national prominence through their association with terrorist groups. But to believe that the headlines about Patty Hearst had no bearing on the presentation of “Katherine” would be to ‘believe that network programers are not opportunistic, which would be akin to denying the existence of Cher's navel. The story of “Kalherine” lbegan in San Francisco September 22, 1972. The heroin i was seen donning a “disguise” and leaving her communal home with a bomb set to explode at 9 o'clock that morning. As a camera, and a government agent, followed her through the streets of San Francisco, Katherine's life was recounted through several devices: flashbacks, interviews with her family and friends, and direct comments from Katherine herself, sitting on a Stool against a bare and white background in some “limbo” room. Directly addressing the viewer at home, she explained: “I love this country. I've had the best it can offer and I've seen the worst it can be. I'm committed to making America a better place, no matter what the cost.” The biography then shifted to 1964 to find Katherine in, college and already “different” from her friends. Margot (Julie Kavner) is interested in snaring an overachieving husband and social status. Katherine is spending her Saturdays teaching disadvantaged children to read. The rest of the drama traced the making of “an American terrorist,” which once had been the program's subtitle. Katherine to her parents, after finishing college: “I want to help people.” To a rebel group while doing Peace Corps‐type service in South America: “I'll hive nothing to do with bloodshed.'’ To black‐power advocates while working for civil rights in the American South: “My white skin has given me lot of privileges in this society.” To her parents, circa 1967: “Mother! What's a normal life? Pretending nothing's wrong?” To the viewer, after Chicago 1968 “That convention was a turning point for all of us.” To her activist boyfriend: “I've decided I'm going all the way. I'm going to have an abortion. It's going to get tougher and bloodier. It's selfish to have baby now.” Most of the major bases wore carefully touched, however superficially. And in the end, in the solid American tradition for dealing with transgressors, Katherine was severely punished. Her bomb did go off, in the process blowing up Katherine so that positive identification is finally made through a tooth filling. But still, within the confines of her short span in television land, the evolution of wealthy Katherine into a lean and hungry terrorist was depicted with a remarkable sympathy that occasionally bordered on outright admiration. Consider the offered alternatives, most notably Katherine's parents. Dad (Art Carney) disapproved of Katherine's ways but couldn't resist facile rationalizations: “Well, she just wasn't one to give in. But that's the kind of American stock she comes from—the kind that does what they believe in.” Mother (Jane Wyatt, in another of her delicious sweet/ vicious interpretations) is committed to idiotic social graces and appearances. “If you keep up like this, you'll lose everything,” she warns Katherine, after Katherine has just calmly explained to her family that “you can't be nice to people you have to overthrow.” While morn and dad seemed to spend much of their time arranging real estate deals ('besides it's good rental property') and incredibly dull parties, Katherine was busy grappling sincerely with the “real” world, a world in which violence “against the pig state and its corrupted institutions” became inevitable, a world that decided the “good people were probably more responsible” for the world's evils. The details and structure of “Katherine” were ingenious and the quality of the production was far above the average encountered in a made‐for‐TV movie. But the notion of presenting a sympathetic portrait of a terrorist committed to the overthrow of most American institutions, presumably including commercial television itself, is ludicrous. As producer, Gerald I. Isenberg deftly brought all the basic ingredients together. Jeremy Paul Kagan's script and direction were, with considerable help from Frank Stanley's photography, unusually effective and absorbing. And most of the performances were startlingly good. Miss Spacek's Katherine was thoroughly convincing, from chic college girl revolutionary in jeans and granny glasses. Reality, in the form of brief film/photograph collages (overlaid with voices of Presidents Johnson and Nixon) to define passing years, was imaginatively intertwined with the fictional portrait. But, finally, the portrait was too easy, too soft, fatally blurred less by radical chic than standard middleclass guilt and sentimentality. The care taken with this production is of a sort desperately needed on commercial television. The content of “Katherine,” however, remains.. well, what can one say? Selfdestructive? The fact is that the complusion of Katherine and her nonfiction counterparts to save America “no matter what the cost” is usually rooted in childish arrogance, an exhibitionist performance of “look, ma, I'm blowing up an institution.” The entire subject demands exploration on television, but not in the fashionable mystique proffered by ABC and “Katherine.” • • • Note: While it is true that the three networks rejected the first proposal to broadcast “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman” as I wrote several Sundays ago, CBS in New York had not seen the project until after CBS in Hollywood turned it down. CBS in New York then decided to go ahead with the project and, after viewing 15 minutes of rough footage, the Xerox Corporation signed up as sole sponsor. I am delighted to correct the record."

Test For Discovering Defects in Fetus Called Safe,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/21/archives/test-for-discovering-defects-in-fetus-called-safe.html,"WASHINGTON. Oct. 20—The procedure called amniocentesis for discovering defects in babies developing in the womb is both safe and accurate, according to scientists who took part in a major Governmentsponsored study. The study involved 1,040 women who had amniocentesis performed and 992 pregnant women who did not. The key issue in the four‐year study was whether or not the procedure adversely affected the outcome of the pregnancy. The data released today indicated the procedure involves extremely small risk. In amniocentesis a small amount of the fluid surrounding the fetus is removed after the mother's abdomen has been pierced by a hollow needle. It has been a subject of some controversy as it has come into relatively common use in recent years without definitive studies of its safety for fetus and mother. The study described today was designed to fill that lack. The study compared the outcome of pregnancy for the 1,040 women who had amniocentesis and for those who did not. According to a, summary of the data, which were compiled by nine major medical institutions, the study “showed no significant adverse effects on the women undergoing amniocentesis; and no significant differences in rate of fetal loss, prematurity, newborn status, birth defects of developmental status at one year of age.” The brief summary was made public today by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, sponsors of the study. The results were described by about a dozen speakers in a symposium at the 44th annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics. In amniocentesis, the fetal ?? removed from the mother are grown in laboratory flasks where they are studied for abnormalities of the obromesomes and for other defects that could have serious ill effects on the baby. The technique has been known for many years, but it was first used in 1968 to detect the abnormality of chromosomes that foreshadow Down's syndrome, also known as Mongoloid idiocy, in the unborn child. At present it can be used to detect a wide variety of chromosomal abnormalities as well as about 60 biochemical disorders including the fatal hereditary disease called TaySachs disease. Today about 25 of these 60 disorders have been detected by amniocentesis, acccrding to Dr. Duane Alexander, one of the two project officers of the study. The other officer is Dr. Charles U. Lowe. Since 1968, use of amniocentesis has greatly increased—to about 3,000 procedures a year. About 52 institutions in the United States are believed to be using the procedure, mainly for women who have reason to suspect their unborn babies carry some serious defect. At present the main recourse available to parents who discover serious fetal defects through amniocentesis is therapeutic abortion. Fears Were Groundless Some of the speakers today said amniocentesis has apparently prevented some abortions by showing prospective parents that their fears concerning their unborn babies were groundless. They said the procedure, customarily done durinc the second three‐month period of a pregnancy, had also—through abortion—prevented the birth of babies who would have been fatally compromised by genetic defects. Of the 1,040 mothers who had amniocentesis, 34 were found to have fetuses with an abnormality. In addition, 11 were found to have male fetuses each having a 50 per cent risk of a disorder such as hemophilia or muscular dystrophy. Thirty‐five of these women elected to have Abortions including eight whoce fetuses were identified as having the chromosomal abnormality that goes with Down's syndome, often a cause of severe mental retardation. Seven of the 992 women who did not have amniocentesis had babies afflicted with Down's syndrome. On the safety question, the data from the study showed a rate of fetal loss—spontaneous abortion, and still birth—of 3.5 per cent for the women who had amniocentesis and 3.2 per cent for the other group. The difference was described as not statistically significant. Tho cooperating institutes in the study were Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center, Boston: Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine: Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Also, University of California at Los Angeles (Harbor General Hospital); University o. California School of Medicine, San Diego: University of Michigan School of Medicine: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and Yale University School of Medicine."
2 Doctors Accused Of Violating Laws Covering Adoptions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/21/archives/2-doctors-accused-of-violating-laws-covering-adoptions.html,"HACKENSACK, N.J. Oct. 20 (UPI)—Two New Jersey gynecologists were indicted today for violating state adoption laws by serving as go‐betweens in the adoption of an unnamed child. The defendants, Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood ‘Cliffs and Dr. Stephen H. Jaffee of Englewood, who share an obstetrical gynocological practice in Englewood Cliffs, were charged with one jcount of violating state adoption laws. Dr. Livingston, who was indicted in 1970 for violating the state's antiabortion law, said he wanted to be indicted by the grand jury to challenge the law that permits only state‐licensed lagencies from arranging adoptions. As a physican performing abortions and treating women who are seeking to become ‘pregnant, Dr. Livingston said, he often has the opportunity to arrange adoptions between women who do not want childen and childless couples. The physicians were charged with arranging the adoption of a single unnamed child between February, 1974, and May, 1974. If convicted of the misdemeanor charge, they face prison terms of three years and fines of $1,000 each. Dr. Livingston was never tried on the counts charging him with performing illegal abortions because the United States Supreme Court ruled in the interim that abortions could legally be performed during the first six months of pregnancy. ‘Test Case’ Sought Dr. Livingston said in a recent interview that while he wished there were some other way to challenge New Jersey's adoption laws, he hoped his indictment would provide the courts with a test case. He is an acknowledged expert in the treatment of infertility and a leader of a medical drive in New Jersey to provide inexpensive abortions for women."
$1.5‐Million Is Paid to Settle Contraceptive Device Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/21/archives/15million-is-paid-to-settle-contraceptive-device-cases.html,"RICHMOND, Oct. 20 (UPI)—The A. H. Robins Company said today that it had paid $1,548,000 for the settlement of litigation, legal fees and other expenses stemming from its Dalkon shield intrauterine contraceptive device. The device was voluntarily removed from the market in June, 1974. The Food and Drug Administration, which has linked the device to the death of 14 women, has cited several cases where women who were using the shield became pregnant and suffered spontaneous septic abortions that, in some cases, led to fatal blood poisoning. The company said that earnings for the first nirte months of 1975 did not include the charges after taxes for the settlement of litigation, legal fees and other expenses involving the Dalkon shield. The charges will be handled as a prior period adjustment to the fourth quarter of 1974."

In five of those elections, he had to run in a partly new district. The district, eurrently the 17th, alv.‐ay.; has included Staten Island. which is JohA Murphy's political base. But Staten Island is not populous enough (310,000) to comprise a Congressibnal district. So. over the years, the State Legislature, which handles such thing, has linked it with other parts of the city. At the moment, Representative Murphy's district is made up of Staten Island (Richmond County) and that portion of Manhattan that includes Chinatown. Little Italy, the Jewish and Puerto Rican enclaves of the Lower East Side, Chelsea, and bits and pieces of Greenwich Village. Conservative but mostly Democratic Staten Island has always made up twothirds of the district.. Accordingly, Mr. Murphy is very much the middle‐of‐the• road Democrat. To some of his Greenwich Village voters, he is an arch‐conservative. In some ways, John Murphy is happier with his liberal Manhattanites than they are with him. He knows they will • vote Democratic. He cannot be so sure about his Staten Islanders. In 1972. when 62 per cent of the Manhattan side of the district backed George McGovern for President, 74 per cent of the Staten Island side went for Richard M. Nixon. In the nineteen forties, the district was the 11 th, and included Staten Island and much the same parts of Manhattan that ithas now. In 1950, the number was changed to the 16th, but the boundaries remained the same. From 1952 until 1962, it was the 15iii district and, along with Staten Island, in cluded most of Bay Ridge. In ‘1962, the Legislature dropped Bay Ridge and tacked on Flatbush, Flatlands and Gerritson Beach, and changed the district number back to 16. In 1968, the 1962 lines were erased. Coney Island, Brighton Beach and parts of Bensonhurst were added to Staten Island Finally, in 1972, the Legislature carved up Bella Abzug's 19th District and joined the southern‐most portion of it to Mr. Murphy's Staten Island.

The Orthodox Jews simply cannot eat the food provided in the regular lunch ppngrams—even the usual kosher meals.” “I'm sure I represent th most polyglot Congressional district in the United States.” Mr. ,IVIurphy likes to emphasize the work he does for his relatively new Manhattan constituents, but almost in spite of himself he makes it clear that his heart is across the waters in Staten Island. A West Pointer A native of Staten Island, John Murphy began his political career in the island's regular Democratic organization after serving in World War II, graduating from the United States Military Academy with honors, and then serving in the Korean %var. He was defeated in his first try for Congress in 1960,, and he was defeated in 1961 when he ran for Richmond Borough President. After 14 years, Representative Murphy still runs hard—and constantly, since, time and again, election returns have shown him that his Staten Island constituents vote for him and not the Democratic party. “It's tough, tough politics all the time,” he said. Part of tinning all the time is keeping in touch. Jack Murphy does that by holding court most Saturdays from 9:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. in his office in the Post Office Building in the West Brighton Section of Staten Island. “I do 40 to 50 people each week.” he said proudly. He admitted, a trifle apologetically, that he did not get to see Manhattan voters as often. “I try to get there on Murphy's 17th District Two‐Thirds Democrat According to recent figures, the 17th Congressional District has a population of 475,000. There are 200.000 registered voters, of whom about 64 per cent are Democrats. 23 per cent Republicans, per cent Liberals and 3 per cent Conservatives. One worker in three in the district is in a blue‐collar or service job. By Representative John M.

In 1972 “I talked to one of the clubs in Greenwich Village,” he recalled, chuckling. “The first three questions were about the war. gay rights and abortion. We were ISO degrees apart on each of them. I told them I didn't expect to get their votes in the primary but they would have to go for me in the general election. They started screaming. I said to them: Wait ‘till you see what you get from the Republicans.'’ An Unknown Loses Mr. Murphy, unopposed in the 1972 primary, went on to defeat a political unknown, Mario D. Belardino in the general election. Mr. Belardino, who once was described by an aide as “the Italian Jack Kennedy.” used a great deal of his family's money to saturate Staten Island with campaign literature and advertising while ignorint the Manhattan part of the district. Mr. Belardino lost heavily. Mr. Murphy feels he is fairly well known in most of the Manhattan portion of his district, but he acknowledges that he is sometimes referred to anonymously as simply “that guy from Staten Island.” John LoCicero, Greenwich Village Democratic leader agreed, saying. “People in the Village tend to assume that Bella Abzug or Ed Koch is their representative, even though they live in Murphy's district.” Mrs. Abzug represents the 20th District and Mr. Koch represents the 19th, both of which adjoin the 17th. Mr. Murphy knows, though, that even the most highly visible Manhattan politicians think twice about taking him on. He defeated Jerome Kretchmer last year and. when Mrs. Abzug's district was legislated out of existence in 1972, he chose to challenge another liberal. the late William Fitts Ryan, rather than try to oust Mr. Murphy.

Issues in Quinlan Case Divide Clerics in Rome,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/25/archives/issues-in-quinlan-case-divide-clerics-in-rome-rome-clerics-differ.html,"ROME, Oct. 24 — Roman Catholic theologians here have begun to debate publicly the moral issues surrounding the case of Karen Anne Quinlan, the 21‐year‐old coma victim in New Jersey whose parents have asked the court for permission to turn off the mechanical equipment keeping her alive. Articles this week by twol church scholars on moral theology indicate that the main: issue in the debate is the question: How far is one obliged to go to keep a person technically! alive? The Rev. Gino Concetti, in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, maintained that the intrinsic right to life of any human being must be guarded by others to the “maximum possibility.“ But the Rev. Domenico Gras so, a Jesuit professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University here, argued in an interview in the Turin daily La Stampa that no one had the moral responsibility to prolong the life of a person for whom there was no hope of recovery, and that in such cases nature should be allowed to “take its course.” Miss Quinlan has been in a coma for six months. In a 1,000‐word article in yesterday's L'Osservatore Romano, which generally reflects the views of the church hierarchy, though it is not an official Vatican organ, Father Concetti wrote: “The case of Karen Anne Quinlan is certainly heartrending. But with all the comprehension that we may have for the parents—traumatized and languished by the situation—we do not feel that we can accept their thesis. “Every human being, in whatever state he or she may he as a result of a disease, is still endowed with dignity and rights. In these intrinsic, inviolable and inalienable tights, the human being must be respected to the final limit of life. This duty is that much greater when the life is thereatened or endangered.” Father Concetti said that such a duty “cannot be lacking even in the case of a human being who has an incurable illness, who has been reduced to a state of apparent nonlife—who is, in short, in the condition of the girl from Morristown. “Human life is a gift of God; only God is master of life. Men is only a wise administravie of it. Consequently, no one he an arbiter over his own life or that of others. Men have the responsibility to pro tact life according to their maximum possibility, both individually and as a society.” Father Concetti, a Franciscan, is considered by the Vatican newspaper to be an expert on questions of moral theology. His articles, which frequently deal with sensitive moral issues such as abortion, tend to reflect a conservative view. Father Concetti rejected the contention of Miss Quinlan's parents that their daughter should be allowed a “dignified death.” Calling such a contention “untenable,” he wrote: “There is no right to death; on the contrary, there is right to life.” He suggested that medical research might even be improved by the challenge of case such as Miss Quinlan's. “Paradoxically, medical science is timulatecl to refine and enrich itself by the appearance of new forms of diseases,” he wrote. His thesis was implicitly contested yesterday by Father Grasso, who teaches pastoral theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University here. He frequently writes on moral questions in the authoritative Jesuit magazine Civilta Cattolica. In an interview in La Stampa, Father Grasso asserted that “man always has the right to life, and in no case, not even in the limits of the extreme, can man do anything to take away this right.” He condemned euthanasia, or so‐called mercy killing, saying “no one can kill a man who is about to die, and so cause the definitive end.” But when he was asked what were the responsibilities of the family of an ill person, Father Grasso said that it was their duly to do what they can, but not, however, at All costs, such as by taking measures that may conserve life if they have as a result only the prolonging of a vegetative state.”; “Persons who, in order to prolong the life of a dear one,; render themselves penniless,’ may be admired but they are not necessarily to be imitated,”!

He said that the views of Father Grasso, who is consid‐j ered a middle‐of‐the road; theologian, were simply up‐; holding a traditional Catholic viewpoint. In his interview, Father Gras so indicated that doctors were not morally obliged to keep Miss Quinlan alive if there was no hope of keeping her from deteth or bringing her to a state of reason. “It's not a question of killing her, but of lettin nature take its course.” he said. Asked about the justification of keeping such a patient alive on the grounds that a miracle might occur, Father Grasso said: “God is free to work miracles if and when He wants. Man, however, cannot insist on it, nor make his own deci‐, sions based on such a possibility. God has made laws of nature that man must follow.” The late Pius XII, who was Pope from 1939 to 1958 and was known as a firm traditionalist, also took the view that extraordinary measures to keep a patient alive were not necessarily required."

3 HOSPITALS REJECT ABORTION DIRECTIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/3-hospitals-reject-abortion-directive.html,"SCRANTON, Pa., Oct. 25—Sparked by a rebellion by the board of directors of Scranton State General Hospital, three state‐owned hospitals in this area have defied a state directive to permit abortions and sterilizations at those institutions. The hospital board here dicided to defy the directive Oct. 1. The board of the State General Hospital at nearby Nanticoke voted last Monday to defy the directive. The rebellion caused the State Attorney General, Robert P. Kane, to rule on Thursday that the hospitals “must reverse” their policies. Hours after this ruling, the board of the State General Hospital at Hazelton, near WilkesBarre, reversed its former decision to comply and decided to oppose the state order. The state operates nine general hospitals formerly associated with the coal industry. They are, operated as general hospitals on a deficit basis. The state originally ruled that as public hospitals, they had to provide sterilization and abortion facilities to the public. The hoard of the Scranton institution asserted that since the hospital dropped its obstetrical services in 1972, it would discriminate against women who wanted to have babies if it provided services for women who wanted abortions. No private hospitals in the areas served by the three hospitals now permit abortions."
TAX PLANS RAISE STORM IN FRANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/tax-plans-raise-storm-in-france-giscard-collides-with-ideas-on.html,"PARIS, Oct. 25 — President Valéry Giscayd d'Estaing's efforts to modernize and liberalize French society are colliding with deeply entrenched notions of the sanctity of land and priority of capital in a storm over tax changes. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing promised during his election campaign a year and a half ago that he would strengthen France's tax laws to promote social justice and lay the foundations for a more egalitarian society. He has now moved in the tax field, as he did earlier in areas of moral reform when he got changes in laws covering divorce, contraception and abortion. In the big economic debate, his Socialist and Communist opponents and even some of his reformist allies are saying his proposals are too timid. On the right he is attacked for going too far. Bill on Real Estate A Government bill has been introduced in the National Assembly to control real‐estate speculation. In effect, speculators would have to share some of their profits with local authorities, who would also get first right to buy any land up for sale at market prices. It reinforces the power of local authorities to get the type of urbanization they deem necessary, instead of having development complexes thrust upon them by the market. The bill is being guided through the National Assembly by the Minister of Building, Robert Galley, and because of the large Government majority, a coalition of Gaullists and independent Republicans, it is virtually assured passage. Yet some in the majority coalition, such as André Fanton, a Paris lawyer and Gaullist Deputy, and Eugène Claudius Petit, a former Minister of Construction, wanted the Government to go much further by decreeing an annual land tax. Outcry on Tax Mere ownership of land—and there are 17 million French men and women with big or little plots—would have brought the tax collector into the act. It was an effort to tax capital, cried the opponents who saw it as an infringement of the right to accumulate land. The Assembly last week firmly turned down an amendment to the Government bill by Mr. Fanton, demonstrating that new capital levies are hardly popular in a country where tax evasion is a science, if not an art. The Government bill fixes a density ratio in Paris and the provinces beyond which new construction cannot go without forcing payment of a tax. It is estimated that the tax will bring in $500‐million to $600‐million a year to local authorities. The Fanton amendment was only one of a number of ideas to tax capital and capital gains. Unlike the United States, and most countries of northern Europe, France has no capital gains tax at all. So geared is the tax system here to the preservation of wealth that dividends are treated not as something to he taxed, as in most other countries, but as a credit to reduce taxes. Because any changes in the tax structure, especially regarding capital, are so sensitive and political, President Giscard d'Estaing some months agn gave the whole subject to a committee, mostly distinguished civil servants, to examine and report on at their leisure. Report Just Issued Their report, a document of more than 200 pages, which has just been handed to the Government, has already stirred up a hornets' nest because of its recommendation that individuals declare the sale of assets and pay a capital gains tax. In France, where anonymity in financial transactions is especially valued, all transactions would have to be declared to the tax authorities—sales of real estate, stocks and bonds art beyond a value of $2,000 and even gold. Most specialists believe, however, that it will he some years before any parts of the report are incorporated in legislation."
Will a Vote for the E.R.A. Be a Vote for a New Era?,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/will-a-vote-for-the-era-be-a-vote-for-a-new-era-will-era-mean-a-new.html,"TRENTON—From T‐shirts to bumper stickers, the campaign to add an equalrights amendment to the State Constitution is in full swing, and early indications are that the public will approve the measure at the polls next week. In the heat of the campaign, claims and counterclaims concerning women's rights in the areas of child support, divorce, alimony, credit, military service, abortion and the right not to work have created a rift among women themselves. A statewide survey to he released this week by Market Research Systems, an independent polling organization, indicates that most voters who understand the amendment will support it. However, the survey also found that 50 per cent of those questioned were uninformed about the purpose of the measure, which, according to Kitty M. O'Neil, is designed to “extend legal rights under state laws equally to men and women.” Mrs. O'Neil is acting director of the state's Division on Women. The proposed amendment, which states that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex,” seeks to assure equal rights in New Jersey in the absence of a United States Constitution guarantee. The latter may not become effective for six years, if at all. Ratification by the necessary 38 states has been stalled, although 34 states, including New Jersey, already have approved the proposal. Fifteen states also have equal‐rights provisions in their stale constitutions. As to the effect the amendment would have on women and their life‐style, there is little or no agreement. The Alliance to Stop E.R.A., a women's group seeking to block the measure, contends that women will lose rights they now have. The group paints an alarming picture of women losing financial support from their husbands, losing the custody of children in divorce cases and forfeiting their right to alimony, if not being required to pay alimony themselves. “Women don't realize how much they will be hurt by this amendment,” said Mrs. Inez Franko, chairman of the alliance and a Plainfield housewife and music teacher. In addition, opponents of the amendment have been reciting a litany of potential hazards threatening married and family life, including a unisex society and widespread homosexuality. In rebuttal, Mrs. O'Neil denies that the measure will destroy family life as it now exists. “The amendment affects government action only,” she said. “It will not force women to work outside their homes, and will not change a woman's relationship with her husband or her family.” Although Mrs. O'Neil is clearly a forceful exponent of women's rights and the constitutional proposal, she is under orders from William F. Hyland, the State Attorney General, not to use the resources of the Division on Women to campaign for passage of the amendment. In September, Mr. Hyland ruled that the division could not provide facilities for proponents of the measure. Legal experts consulted about the proposal agree that a constitutional amendment is, in fact, a shortcut around the legislative process. “Full citizenship for women should be affirmed constitutionally,” said Ethel Bent Walsh, vice chairman of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Washington. “There are thousands of laws across the country that discriminate against women. They would all have to be repeated or changed if the amendment becomes effective.” In New Jersey, it is estimated that, if the proposal is approved, some 800 laws would have to be reviewed. For each one, a decision would have to he made whether coverage should be extended equally to both sexes, whether the law should be repealed or, as a third possibility, whether the law should remain unchanged, and then only if a compelling reason could be cited why men and women should be treated differently. By all accounts, New Jersey has strong antidiscrimination laws in employment, and the problem there has been that the state's civilrights authorities have an enormous backlog of complaints they cannot handle expeditiously. Mrs. O'Neil said that one of the most significant changes under the amendment would he that the burden of proof would fall on the state, rather than on the aggrieved individual, to demonstrate that maintaining the law was reasonable and free of discrimination."
Learning the Ways of America,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/learning-the-ways-of-america.html,"FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa.—Vietnamese refugees, used to the traditional role of women as wives, mothers and nurturers, trickled into a decrepit military barracks here the other night for their weekly dose of feminism, American style. The topic was “The American Family,” and it was one of a series of lectures in a course designed for women refugees, sponsored by the Pennsylvania Commission on Women. The commission is a feminist‐oriented group attached to the Governor's office. “We're not here to make American women out of you,” said Judy P. Hansen, a commission staff member, whose remarks were translated by an Englishspeaking Vietnamese woman. “We just want to tell you what American women are like because you'll be dealing with them once you leave here. And one of the big differences in our two societies is that women play an important role in American society.” The 70 refugees (50 women and 20 men) who had jammed into the small, pea‐green barracks smiled slightly as Mrs. Hansen spoke, some out of amusement, some out of politeness, some out of disbelief. (Most of the men were present as part of an English class they are taking here.) “In American culture,” she went on “some women choose to stay home with their children and not work, just as most women do in Vietnam. But in America, 60 per cent of American women are in the work force some time in their lives. Many choose to combine family interests with a career and a job, while others choose to have jobs and not marry.” Describes Own Life She added that she was married and had one child that her husband took care of two days a week. “He also helps with the household work,” she said. “This is fairly common in America.” Several Vietnamese men looked at one another and snickered. One shook his head in disbelief. Tran‐Quang Vinh, a 4I‐year‐old accountant who fled Vietnam in a fishing boat with his wife, five children and one daughter‐in‐law, raised his hand. “In Vietnam, many capable women are doctors and lawyers,” he said, “but they abandon their careers to stay home and raise their children. What's wrong with that?” Mrs. Hansen replied, “More and more women are choosing to combine career and home, since more and more American husbands are willing to help with the housework.” Mr. Vinh shook his head slowly and smiled. “If women do all that,” he said, “they will wind up working a lot harder than the men do.” The course for refugees, called “Women in America: Their Roles and Rights,” was begun last month because. according to Marie R. Keeney, the commission's director, nothing was being done especially for women at the military base. More than 4,000 refugees are still at the base, she said, awaiting sponsors and relocation to American communities. “There is a program called Transition America, sponsored by the State Department, but it's for the heads of household —meaning the men,” she said. “The only thing it had relating to women was a discussion on what an American supermarket looks like.” Other Areas Covered Sixty to 125 refugees have attended the sessions, which in the past, she said, have included lectures on child care, how to find a job, how to he interviewed for a job, and how to dress and prepare for winter. Roz Powell, a volunteer from the Unitarian Church, told the refugees that American wives were equal partners in a marriage, and were not to be beaten and abused. “My husband does not heat rne,” she said, “and I do not beat my husband.” (According to some people at the base, wife‐beating is quite common among the Vietnamese refugees, a hol?? over from a practice in their homeland. Alan Carter, the senior civilian coordinator here, said there have been only four reported cases of wife‐beating. “but then most people here are on exemplary behavior and probably don't report every case.”) Mrs. Hansen told the refugees that there were two kinds of jobs for women in America — traditional “women's jobs,” such as being a nurse or a teacher, and nontraditional jobs, such as being a house painter, truck driver or police officer. “More and more women are choosing these nontraditional jobs because they pay more, and often have more status in society,” she said. Question From a Woman A hand shot up from the audience. “You Americans have statistics for everything,” a male refugee said. “Tell me, what percentage of American women stay faithful to their husbands?” There are no statistics,” Mrs. Hansen replied, looking somewhat embarrassed. “You have to ask each person individually.” A Vietnamese woman raised her hand shyly and asked whether a wife or husband could divorce a partner without the consent of the partner. (According to Mr. Carter many refugees who left spouses behind in Vietnam have fallen in love with fellow refugees, and want to get married.) “That all depends on what state you're living in,” Mrs. Keeney replied. “There are a hodgepodge of laws on the subject.” The discussion turned to the family. “Perhaps the biggest difference,” Mrs. Hansen said, “is that in America there is no real extended family system such as you have in Vietnam. Families often live far apart from each other, and aunts and uncles don't all live nearby, and my baby has seen his grandparents only once.” The audience groaned. “In Vietnam,” Mrs. Hansen went on, “age and old people are respected: in America, that's not true. We tend to worship youth and put much value on being young.” More groans. The session ended with a slide presentation showing rooms from “typical American homes” and scenes from “typical American families,” including photograph of children in Halloween costumes. There was also a 15‐minute film called “The American Family.” Afterwards, six women and one man —Mr. Vinh, the accountant—lingered in the barracks to discuss American feminism and how they hoped their family life would he in their new country. “I'm not worried about feminism,” said Cong Huyen Ton Nu To Nga, who is here with her husband, who ran a photography shop in Saigon, and their six children. “What worries me is whether, with two of us working, we can support six children in this country.” Won't Let Wife Work Mr. Vinh vowed that he would work overtime if he had to prevent his wife from having to go to work. “I've never done any housework before,” he said, “and my wife has never had to work to support the family. I earned all the living.” When asked what the words “women's liberation movement” meant to them, one of the women said, “It means equal rights for women.” Is that a good thing? All but one woman nodded. “I think it's good,” said the lone dissenter, “but I don't believe in the freedom to have an abortion.” When asked whether they wanted to work or stay home with their children, five of the six women said they wanted to work. “I'd like to stay home with my family,” said Dao Thi Gam, 44, who is married to a pharmacist and has two children. Then she added with a smile. “But if it were possible to have a business at home, I'd like that, too.”"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/the-region-in-summary-carey-takes-the-lottery-off-the-board-money.html,"As with most other things in New York State these days, the state lottery has been suffering from falling revenue and rising criticism, particularly over its failure to award certain prizes. Last week, the lottery was suspended by Governor Carey when printing errors were found on some ticket numbers. A computer programming mistake for a special $250,000 drawing resulted in the printing of hundreds of duplicate tickets. An investigation has been started to determine whether the mistake was caused by design, perhaps by disgruntled employes, or was simple error. The lottery director, Jerry Bruno, has tightened administration of the agency and changed some of the games. Criticism of the program had focused on the fact that in some weeks the $250,000 Super Colossus had no winners. Lottery officials had argued, however, that the criticism was “oversimplified.” “The public was not led to believe that there would be a big winner every time,” said a lottery official. “They were led to believe, correctly, that there could be a big winner. On the weeks when there wasn't, the prize money went into jackpot drawings for succeeding weeks.” Nonetheless, the Super Colossus has been dropped in favor of a new game with weekly payoffs. The lottery has also run into criticism because its total sales have declined in the last year from $113.5‐million to $91.7‐million. The allocation of the revenues also has been criticized. Originally, the money was to be used for educational purposes, but it now goes into the state's general fund. State Controller Arthur Levitt and others have urged that the money be used only for education. Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut last week called for review of the allocation. It was not known how long the suspension of the lottery would last. The Governor's office said that those holding tickets for the canceled drawings “will be protected.” Apparently, money will be refunded or new tickets issued when the suspension is lifted. Money Short, State University Stops Building The State University of New York, which has been expanding rapidly during the last decade, is stopping all new construction because financing has suddenly become too expensive, and because of the prospect of declining enrollments in the mid‐1980's. The university also will limit admissions to 20 of its campuses. Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer said the actions were designed to do the following: • Maintain the quality of the system during a period of fiscal constraint; • Alleviate student shortages at some of the state's private colleges (mainly because of soaring tuitions) by reducing the state's competition with them; • Avoid the possibility of an overbuilt state system by the middle of the next decade when the number of applicants is expected to start going down as the effects of a declining birth rate are felt. Dr. Boyer said the construction moratorium would affect 104 already‐approved projects worth $156‐million throughout the 72‐unit system. The biggest projects involved are on campuses at Old Westbury and Stony Brook, L.I., Purchase and Buffalo. Enrollments have been rising steadily, and are expected to continue doing so until about 1985. This year there were 85,000 applicants but only 35,000 were accepted because of space limitations. The new admissions policy is intended to avert further crowding. A major factor in the university's decisions, Dr. Boyer said, was the rise in interest rates on public borrowing for construction. He said the suddenness of the decisions, made by the university's board of trustees, reflected the rapid change in the state's financial posture in recent months. Town Changes Its Mind on Porn Zoning A plan to create an “adult entertainment” district in Islip, L.I., was no sooner said than done in. A week after Peter Cohalan, the Republican Town Supervisor, announced the idea, he scrapped because of “adverse publicity” and attacks by Democrats that he said “completely distorted” his intent. The plan's purpose was to stop the proliferation of bars with nude dancers, porno movie houses and other X‐rated enterprises in the community by containing them in a specially zoned area, away from homes, schools and churches. Government officials and the police on Long Island and elsewhere in the region have periodically tried to ban such businesses, but United States Supreme Court rulings have held some of these efforts unconstitutional. Mr. Cohalan's Democratic opponents pounced on the idea. One said it would lead to “pockets of perversion.” Another asked rhetorically if the districts would be called “Cohalan's erogenous zones.” Out of the legally and historically unrealizable hope of eliminating the places altogether has evolved the concept of trying to limit their spread through zoning. The idea is being tried in Boston, with mixed success. The legality of using zoning to fight pornography has not been tested in court yet. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the question of what a city can do to prevent dense pockets of “adult‐entertainment” enterprises from developing. The case it will review has to do with zoning regulations in Detroit. In New York City, officials are considering once more what to do about Times Square, where there has long been a large concentration of such businesses. Zoning changes have been proposed that would restrict the establishment of “massage parlors” in the area, and in the rest of the city, and ban new ones altogether for one year. Conservatives Reject Ford In Public New York State's Republican and Conservative parties have seemed to be moving closer since the Conservatives' bete noir, Nelson Rockefeller, resigned as Governor to become Vice President. But the improving relationship has come under new strain for some of the same old reasons: Mr. Rockefeller, and what the Conservatives perceive as the liberalism of President Ford. The leaders of the Conservative party have publicly declared their support for Ronald Reagan over Mr. Ford for the Republican nomination for President next year. Moreover, they said, they would not back Mr. Ford, should he be the nominee, if his running mate was Mr. Rockefeller. The open opposition emerged at the annual state dinner of the Conservative party last Monday night where Mr. Reagan, the former Governor of California, was introduced as “the next President of the United States.” Mr. Reagan, who on Wednesday drew a large crowd at a Republican dinner in heavily Republican Suffolk County, is expected to announce his candidacy next month. Since the Republican party in the state is supporting a Ford‐Rockefeller ticket the position of the Conservatives es could result in the denial of the Republican nomination to Senator James L. Buckley, and affect other potential alliances in the state. Mr. Buckley was elected as a Conservative six years ago with 35 per cent of the vote in a three‐man race and has been seeking both the Conservative and Republican nominations this year. Talk Is Dearer On N.Y. Phones The New York Telephone Company has been given permission to raise its rates again. This time, businesses and government agencies, which cost the company most to service, will bear more of the increase than residential customers. The new rates, according to the state Public Service Commission, will add 34 cents to the basic monthly charge for residential customers who have one telephone. In New York City, that rate is now $7, without taxes, for 50 message units. The basic rate for a business customer with one phone, which in the city is $11.25 before taxes, will go up $1.04. The commission rejected a controversial proposal by the company to place time charges on presently untimed local calls, because it said the plan gave customers no choice between timed and untimed service to suit their calling habits. Phone service rates throughout the region vary considerably. New Jersey residential customers in Newark. Jersey City and Union City who have one phone pay a basic monthly rate of $6.25, excluding taxes, for 75 message units. All other New Jersey home customers pay a flat monthly rate of $6.20 to $7.65, without taxes. The state's business customers with one phone pay a basic rate of $11.40, without taxes, for 75 message units. In Connecticut, the comparable rate for residential customers (excluding those in Greenwich, who are served by the New York company) is $5.15 to $7.85, excluding taxes, for unlimited nontoll calls. The range for business customers is $10.15 to $20.80. A Challenge to Adoption Law Two New Jersey gynecologists have been indicted for acting as go‐betweens in the adoption of a child. The case could become a test of the state's adoption law, which prohibits anyone other than a relative or a state‐approved adoption agency from arranging an adoption. One defendant, Dr. Robert Livingston, said he is often able to put childless couples in contact with mothers who do not want their babies, and he wants to challenge the state law that makes private referrals illegal. This is not the first time Dr. Livingston has deliberately challenged New Jersey law. In 1971, he announced he had performed a then‐illegal abortion in order to test the constitutionality of the state abortion statute and in 1972 was indicted. The charges were dismissed in 1973 after the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion for up to the first six months of pregnancy. Dr. Livingston and his partner. Dr. Stephen Jaffee, are charged with a simple misdemeanor, as they are not accused of taking a fee for the referral. The law provides a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $1,000 fine. Defendants charged with illegally arranging an adoption for a fee, such as those involved with black‐market babies, can be indicted for a felony that carries a longer prison sentence. In New York and Connecticut, facilitating an adoption as the two physicians are accused of doing is not a crime, as long as no fee is involved. Doctors Told To Be Grateful In an action designed to improve medical services for the poor in New York City, the State Board of Regents has ordered that doctors graduating from a special, partially free, training program must serve in doctor‐short areas for two years. Depressed sections have difficulty attracting physicians. The Regents' requirement affects those in a program designed to graduate doctors in six years instead of the usual eight. After four years of undergraduate work at City College, the students go on to one of seven participating medical schools as third‐year students for the last two years of their training. Doctors who fail to meet the “service commitment” will have to reimburse the city and state up to $25,000 for the free four‐year undergraduate part of the program. The requirement for mandatory service in a doctor‐short area is believed to be the first such action in the United States, though the idea has been under study for several years, according to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare."
Quinlan Family Gets Advice and Sympathy in Mail,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/quinlan-family-gets-advice-and-sympathy-in-mail.html,"LANDING, N. J., Oct. 25—“We, too, had a daughter also named Karen who was 16 when she died from brain damage caused by a mystery illness,” wrote an English couple to the parents of Karen Anne Quinlan, the 21‐ year‐old girl who lies unconscious in a New Jersey hospital while a court debates her fate. “Our Karen was in hospital for seven weeks. We were told that tshe could not live for more than minutes without the breathing machine she was on, and had she lived, your dilemma would have also been ours,” they wrote just two weeks after their daughter died. Since the Quinlans began their fight to turn off the machine keeping their daughter alive, more than 1,000 cards and letters have been received by the family, the hospital and even the lawyers and judge. Religious Articles Offered The family has also been swamped with books—including 15 copies of Kathryn Kuhlman's “I Believe in Miracles”—and with dozens of religious articles, such as holy water from Lourdes, rosaries, and Mother Seton commemoratives. There have also been about 10 small donations and flowers — some from a Karen A. Quinlan in upstate New York. According to the family, since the trial began a week ago, its mail, which had been about evenly divided, is now running two‐to‐one in its favor. St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, however, says that almost all of its 200 letters oppose turning off the machine. Both family and hospital say that the religious articles are being used in prayer. “Karen has a bottle of holy water above her bed and a green scapular around her neck,” Julia Ann Quinlan, her mother said. The letters range from just a sentence on a scrap of paper—“Please bless Karen Anne for me,” wrote one—to three‐ or four‐nape closely typed instructions of such things as “a few important steps,” generally involving bizarre treatments that might save the girl. None of the principals say they have been bothered by cranks, although the family has switched to an unlisted telephone number. Mail From All Parts The notes come from as far as the Philippines, with England being the major foreign source. Some correpondents have correct addresses down to the zip code, other letters are misdirected to the Morristown Hospital and even the local water company. And though a few write only “Karen Quinlan, New Jersey,” they all end up in the large plastic bags in the family's living room here. Today the family sat around the dining room table, piled high with letters for a visitor to read. Though the weeks of waiting and legal turmoil have visibly worn the family, the plainly furnished house in this small lakefront community was tidy. After six months, the family has adjusted somewhat to the hospital vigil; the major concern in the household on this rainy Saturday afternoon was the condition of the dog who had just come back from the veterinarian. In one concession to the strained atmosphere, the letters still arriving at the rate of 30 a day, are all unanswered; many as yet unopened. But the mail has been a great comfort, the parents agree. They insisted that particularly moving letters be read by the visitor. “Isn't it wonderful how many people know Karen by just her first name?” the father. Joseph T. Quinlan, softly asked his wife. She nodded silently. When Mr. Quinlan returned from his daily visit to the hospital, he told his wife that Karen looked happy today. She had just been washed and seemed to he resting comfortably, he said, obviously pleased. The largest number of writers, many of whom appear to be Roman Catholic, concentrate on faith, healing, and theology. Most of these writers — who often draw small crosses at the top of each page—dwell on miracles, recounting their own experence or sending an article. “I felt a great need to share with you my faith that with God nothing is impossible,” began a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, woman. “God has given me faith to believe that your daughter Karen can be healed in spite of what the doctors say.” Others felt that removing the machine could he a further movement towards euthenasia, begun, they feel, by legalized abortions. “God's innocent children [are] being aborted without a chance of life.” wrote a Newark police officer “did not Our Lord say ‘what two people have joined together let no man put asunder?’” Another frequent category of letters are those offering medical advice. A Henrietta, N. Y., woman proposed turning to reflexology, which suggests that the “reflex to the pituitary gland” is in the big toe. And a number of wouldbe healers have even come to the hospital, saying that they could cure Karen if only allowed to touch her. Mr. Quinlan believes that the change in public opinion was attributabie to the graphic descriptions at the trial of Karen's deteriorated condition. “After hearing Mr. Quinlan's articulate testimony, I was so moved by his sincerity in ‘turning our Karen's life to the loving Lord,’ I don't see how anyone can deny you this favor,” wrote “a mother, a Catholic.” Mrs. Quinlan said that there are also a number of letters from doctors who offered sympathy, help and stories of similar problems. “I write now to let you know I feel for you and with you,” wrote a Yale University medical professor who said he had “had to endure some abuse from my colleagues” for his support. Favorable letters have also been received from chaplains and others who face the same dilemma. The Quinlans feel that their supporters often have suffered similarly and can understand the emotions. “My heart is full and I wanted to write to you,” a Memphis, Tenn., woman wrote. “Your faith and courage is inspiration to me as a Catholic‐Christian and a mother.” “I have had brain surgery, my medical prognosis is one more year to live.” confided a Marietta, Ohio, lawyer, “I have informed my neurosurgeon, my family physicians, friends, family, priest and a Protestant minister that I do not wish to be kept ‘alive’ under the same cirumstances”"
Israeli Widow Deals With Own and Others’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/27/archives/israeli-widow-deals-with-oven-and-others-grief-questions-answered.html,"KFAR HABBAD, Israel—A young war widow was resentful when Schifrah Golombowitz, a stranger, tried to comfort her in her bereavement. “It's easy for you to talk.” the young woman shouted to Mrs. Golombowitz. “You'll go home and tell your hugband all about it.” Mrs. Golombowitz answered softly, “I'm not going home to my husband.” and the young woman fled from the room. “Five minutes later she returned,” Mrs. Golombowitz recalled. “Her eyes were swollen. Now we are good friends.” Since her husband, David, was killed in battle on the Egyptian front in 1967, Mrs. Golombowitz has dedicated herself to comforting other widows of men slain in battle or in terrorist attacks. She is an adherent of the Luhavitcher Hasidic movement and draws her strength from that sect's credo that it is a privilege for one to die defending Israel. She said that when she first appeared at the home of a bereaved, she did not let on she was herself a war widow. “At first the women were reserved,” she said. “They thought I was doing research or something. But during our talk it would come out and they'd exclaim, ‘You're a widow too!’ Then they opened up and we had heart‐to‐heart talks for hours.” In their talks, widows consulted Mrs. Golombowitz on such questions as whether to take a small child to his father's grave and whether to send children to boarding schools or keep them home. She coaxed widows to come to her village and observe Jewish holidays with her, thus indirectly causing them to visit beauty parlors again or to buy new dresses. She talked pregnant widows out of abortions. Mrs. Golombowitz's mission evolved by ohance. The motive of her first visit to another war widow had not. been to console but curiosity. She had had a compulsion to meet the wife of her husband's best friend who was killed by the same Egyptian shell near the Suez Canal. The other casualty, Lieut. Uri ‘Weisel, was of the new type of Jew from a collective settlement and Cpl. David Golombowitz was an OW World‐oriented person. Their close friendship had been curious. Schifrah wanted to know A few days after the week of deep mourning prescribed by religious law, Mrs. Golombowitz drove to Givat Brenner, the lieutenant's communal settlement. She found his widow, Zehava, in the sixth month of her first pregnancy in a darkened room she had not left since she had heard of her husband's death. “Zehava was surprised wasn't wearing black,” Mrs. Golombowitz recalled. “Hasidic mourners don't wear black. It also embarrassed her that I who was nursing a seven — week — old baby should have gone to her instead of her coming to me. “We had a long and frank talk. I didn't preaCh religion, but I explained that, dying in the defense of Israel was not like being killed in a road accident or drowning. I also convinced her she was fortunate to he carrying the child of the man she loved.” Questions Answered That evening, Mrs. Weisel went to the communal dining room for supper for the first time since her husband's death. “I realized our talk helped her,” Mrs. Golombowitz said. “It also helped me. So obtained the addresses of other widows in the unit and visited them, too.” She went to the Defense Ministry and sifted the files for the addresses of widows who were mothers or expectant. Then she began the rounds. And the Lubavitcher Youth Organization planned a series of functions. Mrs. Golombowitz invited the widows in a circular written in a breezy style that might have been considered offensive from someone else. “Park the kids with grandma or a trustworthy neighbor and come,” she wrote. About 100 widows responded. “There were university graduates and unlettered women.” Mrs. Golombowitz remembered. “Many of them were pregnant. All wore black. For some it was the first time since their bereavement they left home.” On the Feast. of Hanukkah, the Hasidim arranged a celebration with gifts for the children. “Getting the children together was important,” Schifrah explained. “Each orphan had thougni. he was exceptional. If he felt like playing soccer or an accordion, he thought he shouldn't. He believed he must be sad like mother. When the kids got together and discovered other orphans also wanted to play, it made things easier.” Mrs. Golombowitz's dedication has not waned over the years. She says she is the way she is because of her mother, who died in the Bergen‐Belsen concentration camp. Earlier during World War II. the family had been deported from their home in the Netherlands to the Westerhork camp. Her mother hare a son who died in the camp a month later. “Instead of mourning and weeping,” Mrs. Golombowitz said, “she took another baby, nursed it and kept it alive. I always felt I must emulate her courage."
Carter Appears to Hold a Solid Lead in Iowa as the Campaign's First Test Approaches,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/27/archives/carter-appears-to-hold-a-solid-lead-in-iowa-as-the-campaigns-first.html,"AMES. Iowa, Oct. 26—Former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia appears to have taken a surprising hut solid lead in the contest for Iowa's 47 delegates to the Democratic. National Convention next year. The caucuses that begin the process of select'ng, those delegates will be held on Jan. 19, and will provia the first test of strength among Presidential aspirants. They will affect not. only the voters in early primary elections but also uncommitted contributors, organizers and party leaders. Because of Iowa's strategic position in the long nominating; process, seven of he nine announced Presidential candidates —all but Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and Gov Milton J. Shapp of Pennsylvania —spoke to the 4,000 people at a Jefferson‐Jackson dinner in Ames last night. Interviews with political leaders in all parts of the state over the last few days bore out the findings of a straw vote taken. at preliminary caucuses late this summer, which showed Mr. Carter in the lead. But few local politicians were prepared for the results of a poll of those at the dinner in Hilton Coliseum of Iowa State University. In the poll, which was conducted by The Des Moines Register, 1,094 of those attending the dinner, repreenting cross section of party activists from all parts of the stated marked ballots for Presidential candidates or checked a box marked “uncommitted.” Mr. Carter, whose Presidential aspirations have been considered laughable by many Washington experts, won 23 per cent of the total. His nearest rival was a write‐in candidate, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, with 12 per cent. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, who announced only last week, was third with 10 per cent, with the rest of the vote widely scattered. During the last year, Mr. Carter has worked hard to build an organization in Iowa, so he did not burst into sudden prominence completely unheralded. But Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona and former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma have also invested a good deal of time here, and they finished fifth and sixth respectively, behind Sargent Shriver. The former Georgia Governor, a slight, soft‐spoken man who has been a naval officer, a businessman and a peanut farmer, is also reported to have put in place the foundations of strong organizations in New Hampshire and Florida, two of the important states with early Presidential primaries. Whether he can maintain his early lead here when the contest switches from opinion leaders to rank‐and‐file voters is unclear. Whether a victory here would translate into momentum in other states is a question that will have to wait. What is evident is that Mr. Carter, working from Atlanta rather than Washington, has made dramatic progress while attention was focused on the scramble for liberal primacy among Mr. Udall, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Harris and Mr. Shriver. Ask in Iowa why Mr. Carter has done so well here and one will get a bewildering variety of answers. “They relate to him because he's a farmer,” said one legislator. “He's not from Washington,” said another. “He doesn't yell at them. and he answers questions,” said a county chairman. Whatever else may be working for him, Mr. Carter's personal charm and the skill of his campaign director here have obviously counted heavily. Iowans like courtesy and the personal touch, and the visitor hears countless tales about the Georgian's understanding of that fact. For example, Fred McLain, a farmer who lives near here, returned home one day to find that Mr. Carter, driving past on his way to Marshalltown, had left a handwritten note of greeting pinned to the McLain door. The two men had met only once before. Mr. Carter's 34‐year‐old coordinator, Tim Kraft, is being described as the Gene Pokorny of 1976, a reference to the or ganizer of Senator George McGovern's 1972 Wisconsin triumph. He has assembled steering committee so diverse in its ideology that one Iowan says it never meets “because they'd all shout at each other.'’ Among the members are Charles Hammer, a physicist who was one of the pioneer antiwar organizers here; Edris [Soapy] Owens, the retired Iowa chief of the United Automobile Workers; James Maloney, the auditor of Polk County, which includes Des Moines, and member of the old‐line court house crowd, and Jim Schaben, the conservative 1974 Democratic nominee for Governor. Mr. Carter's speech last night was typical of his style. It was in no way a political speech; it had no applause lines, little detail on issues, no rhetorical flourishes. Instead, it consisted of a description of the candidate by himself, delivered in a low‐pitched voice. Perhaps the most popular line was: “Of all the speakers here tonight, I am the only one who is not a lawyer.” Of the other hopefuls who trooped to the podium, none excited the crowd to any real, intensity. The members of the audience seemed to be watching and listening, much like a panel of judges trying to evaluate an oratorical contest. Mr. Udall, who delivered the most polished speech, appears to be in some trouble in Iowa As the inheritor of much of the 1972 McGovern backing, he had been the early favorite and had hoped to establish his primacy among liberals here At a meeting in Washington about 10 days ego, Norma Matthews, the Udall manager in Iowa, successfully pleaded for more campaign appearances by the candidate and for organizing help. The Udall forc's may also be in a position to do the best job of precinct organizing—a major factor in this stale, where only 30,000 or 40,000 persons are likely to participate in the caucuses. Mr. Shriver; campaign. which is far less advanced, ra apparently to he tied to the fact that about a third of the Caucus participants will be Roman Catholics, many ct them active in the right to life movement. Mr. Shriver is the only Cathoric in the race, and his wife, Eunice, has been an antiabortion leader. Mr. Harris has pledges of support from about 1.500 persons, plus the hacking of Don Rowen, a key leader of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. But his own operatives admit that no real effort has begun to lie together an organization. Mr. Bayh has been collecting important commitments since his announcement Tuesday and Ann Lewis, his deputy national campaign manager, is working toward the appointment of a manager sometime this week. Many lowans consider Mr. Bayh to be Mr. Udall's and Mr. Carter's strongest rival, but his refusal to oppose abortion a Senate Judiciary Committe. member may hurt him. Here as elsewhere, the campaign of Senator Henry M. Jackson has little visibility. But he has the backing of the trade unions and some rural elements in the party, and some Iowa observers expect him to win few delegates, which are allocated prnporlionaih"
LIBERALS FACING ASSEMBLY LOSSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/27/archives/new-jersey-pages-liberals-facing-assembly-losses-conservative.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 26—A number of liberal Democratic Assemblymen who were swept into office with Governor Byrne in 1973 face the possibility of being swept out again in traditionally Republican New Jersey's election Nov. 4. On several key issues, the legislators have consistently taken liberal stances, which is unexpected from a legislator in a conservative district. For instance, all of the liberal Assemblymen have been strong supporters of Governor Byrne's income tax proposals and have stanchly supported his efforts at tax reform throughout their two‐year terms. Some Democratic liberals are given varying chances of heating the odds and maintaining their seats. Among those likaly to win re‐election are Betty Wilson in the 22d District, Gordon A. Maclnnes in the 23d, Harold Martin in the 39th, Martin A. Herman in the Third, Gertrude A. Berman in the 10th and Joseph L. Garrubbo in the 20th. All the districts are traditionally Republican. Like their liberal colleagues, the Democrats rated a chance to win have supported abortion laws, the expansion of social services, the Equal Rights Amendment and the bill to provide a “thorough and efficient” education in all school districts regardless of wealth. Despite the risks of not being re‐elected, the legislators apparently have voted on the issues because they believed. they were right. And yet their action raises serious questions about what constitutes “good representation.” On one hand, a legislator is accountable to his constituents to represent their viewpoint in making the laws. But a legislator is expected to exercise his good judgment, using the facts available to him, to vote for what he believes is best — in effect, to “vote his conscience.” The conflict has given the legislators some problems in their political campaigns. “I always bring the income tax up first thing,” said Mrs. Wilson, who has run an exhausting campaign in her Union County district. “I might as well, because someone else will bring it up if I don't. I take a hard, frontal aggressive attack on the tax issue and I think it works. People know that high property taxes are. no answer.” Mrs. Wilson sponsored the bill creating a new State Division on Women, and had a perfect voting record for the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. until the vote to extend the transportation bond issue by $40‐million was brought up. She opposed it and it cost her the union endorsement, the only legislator with such a voting record not to be endorsed. “I think I can get elected without it,” she said. And her optimism is shared by many political observers. Despite her liberal voting record, she is perceived by many conservatives in her district as an able legislator who spends weekends and nights tending to constituent complaints. On the other hand, Mr. MacInnes, a Morris County Democrat, objects to being viewed as a liberal in a conservative district. “I think I'm a good, representative of my district,” he said. “The problem in my district is high property taxes and the income tax would give relief in many communities. Themain think is to be straightforward about what you believe. The major reason people don't vote for certain candidates is that they have a distrust of them. I'm absolutely open about my income tax stance.” He and Mrs. Wilson are both known for their outspokeness and their self‐assurance whether they are disagreeing with the Governor or talking to voters. Nevertheless, Mr. Maclnnes's vote for the unearned income tax that levies a state tax or capital gains, interest, and dividends will cost him votes among his more affluent constituents. Part of his district includes New Vernon, Mend. ham and Mountain Lakes, which are among the most affluent conservative areas in the state. “When people ask me why I voted for the unearned income tax, I tell them ‘to keep the Erie‐Lackawanna Railroad running,’ “ Mr. Maclnnes said. Governor Byrne had threatened to cut back the railroad's subsidy by $36‐million unless the Legislature voted in a series of so‐called nuisance taxes to restore state budget cuts. Mr. Martin in Bergen County's conservative 38th District assumes a campaign role that is low‐key. “I don't usually bring up the income tax, but if asked, I tell them I was a co‐sponsor of the bill because I believe in tax reform,” he said. “When I have the opportunity to explain the reasons, I can usually convert people who didn't understand. A few are just anti any kind re tax and I can't do anything with them.” ‘ Initiative Is Taken Vote on Tax Cited"
Lawyer Re‐elected President of NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/27/archives/lawyer-reelected-president-of-now-political-endorsements-vowed.html,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 26 —Karen DeCrow, a lawyer from Syracuse, was re‐elected today as president of the National Organization for Women, running on the slogan, out or tne mainstream, into the revolution.” Miss DeCrow carried into office with her, as head of the nation's largest feminist organization, most of a slate of‐ backers pledged to use any “principled means of change, from lobbying to civil disobedience” to advance the cause of women. NOW claims a membership of 55,000 in all 50 states. Nearly 3,000 women and a few dozen men are attending its eighth national conference here, which began Thursday night. Miss DeCrow, 37 years old, won her new one‐year term as president by a margin of only 98 votes out of a total of 2,116 cast, defeating six other candidates, including Mary Lynn Myers, director of Human Rights for the state of South Dakota and Mary Jean CollinsRobson, of Chicago, who has headed NOW's 18‐month‐old campaign against alleged discriminatory employment practices by the nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Company. Despite her advocacy of what she calls evolutionary change, one of the principal new areas into which Miss DeCrow pledged to move NOW was the endorsement of political candidates. Those who opposed her felt that there were other feminist organizations, such as the National Women's Political Caucus, that made endorsements, and that getting involved in party politics would divert time and attention from other issues. So far, NOW has endorsed only one potential candidate, Representative Bella S. Abzug, Political Endorsements Vowed Democrat of Manhattan, who is considering running for the Senate next year. Many of the participants in the convention said that they were uncertain whether any real policy differences, as opposed to mere differences in style and rhetoric, underlay the bitterly contested election. Miss DeCrow and her backers talked, however, of NOW's becoming “once again, the cutting edge of the feminist movement—the intellectual innovators, the innovators in process and the innovators in action.” Most of the members agree that their organization was once the cutting edge of the women's movement — for example when it endorsed abortion as a woman's right in 1967 long before this became a widely acceptable position in the country at large. The dispute has not been only over whether the organization is still at the cutting edge of the women's movement but whether it ought to be. Those who think it should not attempt to be say that it cannot become an organization that will attract a mass membership of working women and housewives if its policies are too radical. In her campaign for re‐election, Miss DeCrow said that a timid faction on NOW's board this year hampered her attempts, as president, to move NOW to more innovative positions. She said that this was why she and her supporters had entered a full slate of candidates this year in an attempt to win complete control of the board. Incomplete returns for the eight officers other than president showed that five had been won by her supporters, one by an opponent. A runoff will be required for the other two officers. Both of Miss DeCrow's chief opponents pledged themselves to remain in the organization and work. Others who were elected to office, with a number of races still open, included the following:W chairman of the board, Eleanor Smeal of Pittsburgh; vice president for legislation, Elaine Latourell, of Seattle; vice president for legal affairs. Geri Kenyon, of Houghton, Mich.; chairman of the advisory committee, Toni Carabiilo, of Los Angeles; secretary, Jean Conger, of Wilmington, Dei., and treasurer, Nada Chandler, of Philadelphia.

Paradox in Women's Movement: Feminists Who Are Mormons,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/28/archives/paradox-in-womens-movement-feminists-who-are-mormons.html,"SALT LAKE CITY—Mormon feminists are stepping out of the closet, and for many the trek is symbolically as hard as the cross‐country journey their persecuted ancestors took more than a century ago to reach the Utah desert. On first glance, “Mormon feminists” might almost seem a contradiction. The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints denies women entry into the priesthood and opposes the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion and birth control, while promoting marriage and motherhood as a woman's most divine roles. The Mormons’ current president, Spencer W. Kimball, whose word is said to come straight from God, recently declared, “The role of woman was fixed when she was created” and pronounced members of the feminist movement “Pied Pipers of sin.” Nevertheless, the third annual “Women Unlimited” conference presented here last week made it clear that Mormon women increasingly are standing up for their rights, striving for careers outside the home and questioning longheld religious beliefs. “The ehurch can't tell anyone what to do,” Linda Taylor, a young teacher, told the audience at one session “If it comes to a choice, I'll take the E.R.A.” Polygamy Practiced To non‐Mormons, such a statement might seem melodramatic. But within Utah, where Mormons make up 60 per cent of the population and where polygamy is still practiced illegally by some, women who espouse feminism risk personal attack as well as emotional anguish. Indeed, several women interviewed asked that their names not be used because they feared reprisals or ostracism. “I am very suspect.” began one woman who wore an Equal Rights pin but considered herself deeply religious. She and several friends had formed an “underground” consciousness‐raising group that they half‐jokingly called their “cell,” since traditionalists might brand them Communists. “I've had Mormon men ask me right out if I'm a lesbian because I'm not married,” the 33‐year‐old woman explained, adding that she and other unmarried friends have chosen to remain celibate rather than break the Mormon sex‐before‐marriage creed. Was there no middle ground? she was asked. “There may be but I don't know what it is,” she replied. An older woman confided that after her daughter had given a high‐school commencement address supporting expanded career opportunities for girls, the local church bishop sent a teacher to her home to admonish her parents. A few have simply broken with the church. One, Eleascholar scornfulty. “Now they aren't needed in the professions, so they're told to stay home and make babies. Until they challenge the male priesthood, they're not going to make much headway.” The conrerence, sponsored by the University of Utah Women's Resource Center, reflected stunning modernday paradoxes within Mormonism. One small meeting room featured two right‐tolife displays, one abortion information table, a poster advertising Salt Lake City's homosexual bars and a Relief Society booth. Two graduate students from Brigham Young University, both wearing “garments” (a one‐piece culotteslip worn all the time by Another professional woman put the case differently. “The Mormon work ethic has created very strong women with nowhere to go,” she said. “They believe their eternal salvation is dependent upon following the Mormon doctrine, so to speak out against the church takes lot of courage. This is not a Sunday religion; it's way of life.” Standing Ovation The conference's keynote speaker, Gloria Steinem, got a standing ovation from a packed auditorium following a speech in which she denounced all religions as “patriarchies” that “enshrine sexism and racism.” With evident glee, she told the crowd, “Whoever said the feminist revolution isn't happening in Utah is wrong.” One by‐product of the revolution has been a growing mistrust by the fledgling feminists of their male co‐religionists. “I don't know that the Mormon church breeds the kind of men women like me are looking for,” said one unmarried teacher. Another stated, “the problem with Mormon men is they've been raised as American men.” Perhaps more typical of the modern Utah woman was Carol Lynn Pearson a young poet who came to the conference each day with her children and husband. Introducing her talk on important pioneer women, she recited a poem entitled “On Nest Building” that lyrically epitomized the dualities her Mormon sisters are trying to resolve: Mud is not bad for nest building Mud and sticks And a fallen feather or two will do And require no reaching. I could test there, with my tiny ones, Sound for the season, asleep. But— If I may fly awhile— If I may cut through a sunset going out And a rainbow coming back. Color upon color sealed in my eyes— If I may have the unboundaried skies For my study. Clouds, cities, rivers for my roofs— If I may search the centuries For melody and meaning— If I may try for the sun— I shall come hack Bearing such beauties Gleaned from God's and man's very hest. I shall Come filled. And then— Oh, the nest that I can build! nor Olsen, a lobbyist for the League of Women Voters, pointed out that semi‐official church pressure helped defeat the E.R.A. in the state legislature. “Mormon women are discouraged from individuality by the church,” she asserted. According to Moana Bennett, a church spokesman, the church believes man to be the “provider,” woman the “nurturer.” Thus, the president of the largest women”s church auxiliary, Barbara B. Smith of the Relief Society, spoke out not long ago against the E.R.A. on the grounds that it could be “harmful to the solidarity of the family and the optimum protection of children.” In the early days under Brigham Young, the Utah Territory”s elite class practiced plural marriages yet encouraged women to go to college and enter such professions as medicine. In 1870, the territory became one of the first to give women the vote. However, then as now, the power of the church resided totally in men”s hands because only those in the priesthood could hold the highest positions. “Women were directed into professions to help develop the ‘kingdam,”” said one faithful men and women to signify their belief in the principles of the church gospel) under their long dresses, declared their opposition to abortion in one breath and their interest in the “assertiveness training” seminar in the next. Jan Tyler, a B.Y.U. administrator, told of setting up the school's first women's studies course, then discovered the next day that the church‐run institution had announced it would fight Title IX of the Federal Education Act's amendment, which forbids sex discrimination in school programs. Shauna Adix, director of the resource center, acknowledged the paradoxes when she remarked, “I can be a Mormon and still be a feminist, but by some people's standards I'm not a good Mormon.” The problem, she said, was that many women had been conditioned to view feminism in strictly negative terms. “We don't have many radicalized women,” she continued. “But I think there are a lot of very aware women here.” She said that younger students frequently ask counselors at the center questions like, “Can I use my education and still be married? Is it possible? Is it wise?” “The Mormon work ethic,” said one woman, “has created very strong women with nowhere to go.”"
"Priest, Hailedat 90, Recalls A Long Ecumenical Career",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/29/archives/priest-hailedat-90-recalls-a-long-ecumenical-career.html,"In 1918, as a young Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. George B. Ford became an Army chaplain. “I wasn't the rough‐andready type.” he recalled, “and I ‘didn't know quite what would happen.” But he said he “got on wonderfully well” and attributed this to an early lesson. “In the Army,” said Father Ford, who turned 90 yesterday,” you were taken for what you were worth. You couldn't depend on a collar to get you by.” With a penchant for making his own way, Father Ford remained in the military for five years, becoming the first executive officer of the first peacetime training school of the Chaplain Corps. Later, he left his mark in New York as a Columbia University chaplain, church pastor, ecumenical groundbreaker, civil libertarian and friend to many of the city's best‐known citizens. Retired since 1958, Father Ford spoke recently about his 44 years as an active priest in his single room at the Mary Manning Walsh residence at 71st Street and York Avenue between a round of birthday parties. Separate gatherings honored Father Ford yesterday. A small afternoon reception was co‐hosted by Mrs. Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Mrs. Roger Guggenheim Straus. Later that evening a larger celebration took place at the 21 Club. “I've known him since the days at Columbia when he represented the Catholics,” Mrs. Sulzberger said. “He always had an extraordinarily liberal, intelligent approach. He was way ahead of his time.” “I really don't think about it,” Father Ford said of becoming a nonagenarian. Though spare and somewhat unsteady with age, he speaks with the timbre and cadence of a born storyteller. Dressed dapperly in a three‐piece pinstripe suite, his thin layer of white hair neatly combed, he spoke of his auspicious arrival at Columbia in 1929 as the college's first Catholic adviser. He was given an office, outside of which hung the glowering portrait Of Martin Luther. “Martin scowled,” he said, “and I scowled back.” He added, “Some day, I think he'll be canonized.” In an era of icy relations among the major faiths, Father Ford became a colleague and friend of Protestants and Jews, particularly those at Columbia and Union Theological Seminary. “In all those years,” he said, “I don't recall the slightest serious difference among us.” However, he smiled, on remembering that on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Riverside Church he was reprimanded by Archdiocesan authorities for sending the church a basket of flowers. Such actions, and his unabashed liberalism, often strained relations between Father Ford and the hierarchy. “I fought the chancery all the time,” he said. After one such incident, Cardinal Spellman officially silenced him for a time. In his book, “A Degree of Difference,” published in 1969 by Farrar Straus & Giroux, Father Ford summarized many of his outspoken criticisms of the church. Among other things, he lamented what he saw as extreme conservative among bishops and the Italian dominance of the College of Cardinals. “Vatican II opened the windows of the church and a cyclone blew in,” he said of the church's evolving overhaul, “But many changes are still needed.” He said that he was “very strongly in favor” of wome'n being ordained priests and that “equal rights for women will be attained in the church.” Another priority, he said, is a more democratic means of electing Popes. “Every segment of the church should be represented.” he said emphatically. The same taste for egalitarianism led him to manycauses for human rights. Along with his close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt, and others, he was a founder. In 1941 of Freedom House, whose purpose was to further democratic principles. Among the Freedom House statements that bore Father Ford's name was condemnation of the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy as a “demagogue.” A crosscountry tip in 1944 aroused his interest in rights for blacks. He also championed the rights of labor, the poor and Soviet Jews in the late nineteen forties. He served on the Church Peace Union and was a leader in the Committee for Harlem, which attempted to improve slum conditions, and the City Committee for Children. His involvement with the children's committee drew chancery ire, he said: “They ordered me to withdraw because there were ‘pinkos’ on it. The only ones who were pink were blazing with enthusiasm for helping the poor kids.” ‘The Little Man In Mind’ Father Ford's position, at Columbia, his participation in causes, and his role as astor of Corpus Christi church at 529 West 121 Street put him in touch with a wide spectrum of society, from the powerful to the enniless. He became a favorite in high social and political circles, but, he said, “I think I always had the little man in mind.” He was known as a gentleman with droll wit and uncommon intelligence. From the hurried schedule of earlier decades, his pace has tapered down to a limited routine. Rising at 6 A.M., he joins other residents for breakfast at 7:30, and fills the day long walks, visits with old friends and reading (without glasses), mostly books on international affairs and religion. He displays the feistiness that marked his priesthood. Referring to the church's teachings on birth control, divorce and abortion, he savs, “It's hard for me to believe they are infallibly true.” But he continues, “there's no use starting a scrap at my age.” He says he would gladly choose the priesthood again as a life's work. “It is a more open church, with much more freedom,” he notes approvingly. “I've never regretted my choice.” Born in 1885, Father Ford was the son of a native of London who was, like his American‐born mother, of Irish descent. He was graduated from Niagara University in 1908, St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, and ordained in 1914."

Among other things, he lamented what he saw as extreme conservative among bishops and the Italian dominance of the College of Cardinals. “Vatican II opened the windows of the church and a cyclone blew in,” he said of the church's evolving overhaul, “But many changes are still needed.” He said that he was “very strongly in favor” of women being ordained priests and that “equal rights for women will be attained in the church.” Another priority, he said, is a more democratic means of electing Popes. ‘'Every segment of the church should be represented,” he said emphatically. The same taste for egalitarianisth led him to rimy causes for human rights. Along with his close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt, and others, he was a founder in 1941 of Freedom House, whose purpose was to further democratic principles. Among the Freedom House statements that bore Father Ford's name was condemnation of the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy as a “demagogue.” A cross‐country trip in 1944 aroused his interest in rights for blacks. He also championed the. rights of labor, the poor and Soviet Jews in the late nineteen forties. He served on the Church Peace Union and was a leader in the Committee for Harlem, which attempted to improve slum conditions, and the City Committee for Children. His involvement with the children's committee drew chancery ire, he said: “They ordered me to withdraw because there were ‘pinkos’ on it. The only ones who were pink were blazing with enthusiasm for helping the poor kids.” ‘The Little Man in Mind’ Father Ford's position at Columbia, his participation in causes, and his role as pastor of Corpus Christi church at 529 West 121 Street put him in touch with a wide spectrum of society, from the powerful to the penniless. He became a favorite in high social and political circles, but, he said, “I think I always had the little man in mind.” He was known as a gentleman with droll wit and uncommon intelligence. From the hurried schedule of earlier decades, his pace has tapered down to a limited routine. Rising at 6 A.M., he joins other residents for breakfast at 7:30, and fills the day long walks, visits with old friends and reading (without glasses), mostly hooks on international affairs and religion. He displays the feistiness that marked his priesthood. Referring to the church's teachings on birth control, divorce and abortion, he says, “It's hard for me to believe they are infallibly true.” But, he continues, “there's no use starting a scrap at my age.” He says he would gladly choose the priesthood again as a life's work. “It is a more open church, with much more freedom,” he notes approvingly. “I've never regretted ray choice.” Born in 1885, Father Ford was the son of a native of London who was, like his American‐horn mother, of Irish descent. He was graduated from Niagara University in 1908, St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, and ordained in 1914. The New York Times/Chester Higgins Jr. The Rev. George B.

Most of the Nation's Alices’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/30/archives/most-of-the-nations-alices-stay-on-job-ignoring-nows-call-for.html,"“Alice Doesn't.” a nationwide strike called by the National Organization for Women, fizzled in much of the country yesterday because most Alices did. They did what NOW had urged them not to do: They went to work, they did housework, they shopped, they cooked, and they cared fer their children. “Alice did — because she had to,” said an Pd itor for a Chicago publishing h:)use who worked yesterday. “It shows how out of touch with the world the NOW people are to call something like a str:1.e. It's ridiculous. Most women are in positions where if they don't go to work, they'd he fired.” The editor refused t0 allow her name to be used, saying that she would be dismissed for saying anything about the strike. ‘Resounding Success’ Despite the spotty nationwide response to the strike, Dee Rutledge of NOW's national strike coordinating center in San Jose. Calif., called the day a “resounding success.” “What we were trying to do was raise the consciousness of women,” she said. “and we did that through the various rallies and demonstrations across the country. We feel we have succeeded in doing that even if no one went on strike.” In some parts of the country, members of antifeminist groups, including one known as the Eagle Forum, wore pink dresses to “support womanhood” and demanded that striking women be dismissed from their jobs. Many of these protests were organized by Phyllis Schafly and other women opposed to the Federal Equal Rights Amendment. There was little action in support of the strike in New York and New Jersey, where local NOW officers had decided to concentrate their efforts, instead, on generating support for their states’ Equal Rights Amendments in the general election next Tuesday. Carole De Saram, president of the New York City chapter of NOW, whose 1,500 members make it the largest in the country, said: “We need the state E.R.A., and we thought that any adverse publicity from this strike would hurt at the Elsewhere across the country, there were scattered marches, rallies and demonstrations in support of the strike, which had originated with California NOW members “to show the nation how much it needs and depends on women.” They dubbed “Alice Doesn't,” after the recent movie “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,” which deals loosely with feminism. “This is a California type idea, and I hope they have lot of fun with it,” Betty Friedan, mother of the modern women's movement, said somewhat disdainfully. “We have more serious things here in New York, like the E.R.A.” Miss Friedan spoke at rally in support of the E.R.A. last night in the law school auditorium at New York University. Rally and Workshop One of the largest “Alice Doesn't” demonstrations was held in Los Angeles, where 1,000 women turned out for a rally at the Federal Building. Afterward they marched to the University of California at Los Angeles campus, where they attended 27 workshops on such subjects as consciousness‐raising, rape, abortion, credit problems of women and black feminism. Tom Hayden, the husband of the actress Jane Fonda and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in California, supported the strike by running a day‐care center in San Diego. In Washington 800 demonstrators marched in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House. in a rally called “Shoulder‐toShoulder.” Later an assertiveness training session was held for women marchers. About 200 demonstrators turned out for a burning of “symbols of women's exploitation” in a charcoal grill on a sidewalk in downtown Detroit. The items included a pair of women's white gloves, pages from a Sears catalogue and Good Housekeeping magazine, and some play The fire was ordered extinguished by Ronald Shosh of the Wayne County Air Pollution Control, who said he had received a complaint “from a woman.” One of the demonstrators was Barbara Tessitore of West Bloomfield Hills, Mich., whose 2‐year‐old daughter, Lauren, wore an “Alice Doesn't” sign ‘z around her neck. “Hopefully, she won't have to picket in 20 years,” her mother said. President Ford's wife, Betty, did not participate in the strike, saying she had other commitments. Neither did Gov. Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut who draw feminist ire when she said she thought the strike would “set the women's liberation movement back 20 years.” Also on the job was Lieut. Gov. Mary Anne 1Crupsak New York State, who said she thought the strike was “probably good for women outside the system,” but counterproductive for women like herself who had been accepted into the system. Among feminist leaders, Representative Bella Abzug was reported to be in mourning for her mother, Esther Savitzky, who died on Monday, and Gloria Steinem was said to be on vacation. Demonstrations Held Other “Alice Doesn't” demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Iowa City, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Carbondale, Ill. And in several other cities, including Boston and Oklahoma City, feminists wore armbands in support of the strike. Among the 150 persons who rallied in Indianapolis was Gary Granneman, 31, who has announced plans for a male counterstrike Nov. 21 entitled “Ted Doesn't Either,” a play on the 1969 movie, “Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice.” A spot‐check of such private employers as New York Telephone, American Airlines and Sears, Roebuck and Company, and government agencies throughout the country showed no unusual absenteeism among women. Margie Robinson of the Cincinnati NOW group said one reason for this was that many women were afraid of losing their jobs. “We got 64 calls from women who wanted to go out on strike,” she said, “but 43 had been threatened with the loss of their jobs.” In Lincoln, Neb., Ann Perkinton, a disk jockey, was dismissed Monday after supporting the strike on the air, The Associated Press reported. She said she was dismissed because she supported the strike. The station, KMFQ, denied the assertion. Counter protests were held in several cities, including Phoenix, San Francisco, Columbus and Newport, R. I. In Newport, a group of women proclaimed Wednesday as “Male Appreciation Day” as a counteraction to the strike. Among the beneficiaries was Mayor Humphrey J. Donnelly 3, whose wife got up at 5 A.M. to cook him breakfast. “She usually doesn't get up so early,” he said. In columbus, members of the new, 20,000‐member antifeminist group called Eagle Forum (after a passage in the ‘Bible where God told men and women to go and spread the gospel like eagles) wore pink dresses to observe a day they called “America Does.” “We frankly feel we'are on a pedestal,” said Ann Kitzmiller, the group's director for Ohio. “Why should we want equality when we can have superiority?” In New York City, most of the dozen women who were interviewed about the strike yesterday said they were aware that it was taking place, but did not support it. “I'm a nurse, and “ somebody's got to take care of those sick people, right?” said Claudia Mondesire, 25, a nurse at Elmhurst City, Hospital in Queens, who was on her way to work. Debbe Muratori, a 22‐yearold receptionist from the Bronx, said she didn't support the strike “because I'm really not in favor of women's lib.” “I want to be treated like a woman,” she said. “t want to do women's things, not men's things.” Sandy Finkenberg, a 32year‐old artist, spread out her water colors of animals on a corner of Avenue of the Americas and 53d Street and was open for business as usual. . “I'm self‐employed and supporting six kids,” she said, “and I think the strike is kind of a silly idea. I'd feel like kind of an idiot if I was on strike.” The only woman interviewed who supported the strike was Janet Wikler, 29‐year‐old promotion manager at College Entrance Examination Board, who was wearing a “Support tin ERA.” button. “I went to work today because I'm in a management position, and my career is important to me,” she said. “But I'm not doing any shopping —and no housework..

Last‐Minute Rhetoric Is Confusing Many on Equal Rights Amendment,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/01/archives/lastminute-rhetoric-is-confusing-many-on-equal-rights-amendment.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 31—In the final hours of the election drive to add an equal rights amendment to the New Jersey Constitution, campaign rhetoric has created a deep division among women and widespread confusion among voters over the effect the amendment will have on men, women and family life. However, two independent polling organizations say that a majority of those who plan to vote on the amendment. question would approve it. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure equal rights in New Jersey in the absence of a United States constitutional guarantee. Only 34 of the required states have ratified the Federal amendment creating doubt as dorsements. Initially, proponents of the amendment were alarmed that the proposal, which will be the second proposition on the ballot, will be put to voters in the middle of four bond proposals totaling $922‐million. The bond issues were viewed as particularly unappealing to voters and given little chance of passage. This led to fears that the bonds would have a disastrous effect on the equal rights amendment. Now, however, there are increasing indications that the bond proposals for transportation, water resources state in stitations, and housing have chance of receiving voter approval. By all accounts, the worst result of the proposal's defeat would not he the defeat itself. According to a number of civil amendment has given opponents a chance to cite radical changes that they contend would result if women's rights were constitutionally guaranteed. The Opposing View A women's group calling itself the Citizens Alliance to Stop E.R.A. has charged that the amendment would cause women to lose the financial support of their husbands, thus forcing them to go to work, and that women would forfeit alimony and custody of children in divorce cases. In addition, the stop‐E.R.A. women. who have been engaged in very active speaking campaign around the state, have contended that homosexuality and abortions would he widespread, and that the result would he a unisex society complete with to whether the guarantee will become efective in the next six years, if at all. New Jersey was one of the first states to approve the amendment an action taken by the Legislature and not requiring public approval. Fifteen states have already added equal‐rights guarantees to their constitutions. From the outset, the campaigning has generated considerable controversy among women while men's organizations in New Jersey have remained largely silent some prominent men it the state have publicly indorsed the proposal, including Governor Byrne. Today, Mayor Paul T. Jordan Jersey City and Bill Bradley of the New York Knicks has??ball them ended their en rights lawyers. New Jersey has strong antidiscrimination laws in the area of employment and if the amendment were defeated laws that now are discriminatory would have to be repealed or amended by the much more cumbersome, but equally effective, legislative process.

Stage: 2 Soviet Plays,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/01/archives/stage-2-soviet-plays-nina-voronels-dramas-at-interart-theater.html,"We know so little about the Soviet Union. We imagine a great deal, we sense the idea of a certain society, but our actual knowledge is shockingly limited. And one of the main sources of that limitation is the Soviet Union itself. It frankly does not want us to know. It does not even want its own people to know about the very fabric of its society. At the Interart Theater of the Women's Interart Center, 549 West 52d Street, a double bill of plays by Nina Voronel is being presented. Mrs. Voronel is the wife of the famous Soviet physicist Aleksandr Voronel, and both of them were permitted to immigrate to Israel this year. Mrs. Voronel is also a scientist by profession, but for some years she has devoted her life to playwriting. These two plays were written in the Soviet Union—they have now been translated—but, of course, never produced. Why, • They are political plays. Well, not really, but they do have a sense of political reality, and they are comments on Soviet society. The first playlet, “The First of April” is concerned with an old people's home for writers, while the second, “MatushkaBarynya” is about an abortion clinic in Moscow. They are not all that abrasive, yet one can see how they could be embarrassing to a totalitarian state. Both plays are busy with atmosphere rather than action. They are vignettes, pure but sweetly simple. The picture of the old people's home for distressed, decaying and jaded artists is drawn with some skill, and the abortion clinic is even more vividly depicted. It seems that birthcontrol methods, which are apparently even now less than adequate in the Soviet Union, were once actually illegal. So the commonplace of the abortion clinic has, this play asserts, become a familiar factor in the life of Soviet There is perhaps—so it seems to a man—nothing more degrading to a woman The Cast THE FIRST OF APRIL, transWed by Philippe Lewis, and MATOSHICABARYNYA, translated by Martin Hon Wit:, one‐act plays by Nina Voronel.

Yet childbirth is a right that must have the possibility of refusal to it. If Mrs. Voronel's play is historically accurate, it is clear that the Soviet Union, while deploring birth control, offers abortion without compunction or compassion. • Dramatically both of these playlets require work; they need sharper focus. They are illuminated, and illuminating, texts, poised like daggers against the Soviet system. They speak out boldly for humanity and justice. but the writing is not arresting, and the subject matter is permitted to fade into a simple statement rather than being used as an interpretation. Margot Lewitin has directed both plays with a loving expertise. They both have an indefinable, carbolic air of the Soviet Union about them, and the acting, whether approaching death as an artist, or abortion as a woman, was controlled and rewarding. Nina Voronel is offering us an unusual insight into the way Russia works for people. The plays themselves have faults of structure and determination. Yet they depict Russia; old people meandering over their artistic deaths, and women talking randily about birth and transfiguration, all have their moments of truth. These playlets really do say something about Russia and the cold detachment of its management. They also, particularly the second, say some"
Corsets were gone forever,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/corsets-were-gone-forever-chanel.html,"Fashion is more often a word of odium now than of praise—‘high fashion,” that is, not the fashion for denims or curly hair or make‐up for gentlemen. Fashion suggests an expensive ideal for mindless bores. That is one way of putting it. The other way is that without Coco Chanel we would never have been released into denims at all. Gabrielle Chanel was born in 1883, a bastard, delivered in an outer office of a charity hospital. She never married, had no children, was extremely Rachel Billington's latest novel, “A Painted Devil.” will be published this winter. successful and lived till she was 88. Family, friends, fellow workers, employees and servants were all abandoned as her need for them ended. Perhaps, even though it appears to be based on a totally ruthless egoism, one should sympathize with her approach to life. In 1903, the small garrison town of Moulins was dominated by the presence of the fashionable 10th Light Horse Regiment. Chanel became its toast. She even tried a touch of singing and dancing, which increased her popularity but left her with nothing but her nickname, Coco. It figured in both her top hits. “Coco! Coco!” shouted the soldiers. Etienne Balsan was a soldier who put horses above women but eventually allowed his mistress to set up a millinery business in his Paris flat. All of turf society —minus the wives—paraded in and out. Chanel was on her Soon Balsan's place was taken by a more interesting catch, Arthur Capel, a displaced Englishman, clever businessman and dedicated philanderer. Ca‐ Her Life.

Knopf. 315. pel, Edmunde Charles‐Roux insists, without much evidence, was Chanel's great love. At least he took her out of the narrow circle of the demimondaines. In 1913, he bought her a smart boutique in Deauville where the fashionable admired her berets and opennecked shirts and tried not to notice signs of approaching war. But it was World War that really boosted Chanel. Workers’ uniforms perfectly accorded with her own principles of ease and comfort. Corsets were gone forever. Soon her famous knitwear was launched, made out of machine knit, which was originally created for men's underwear and rejected as too horrid even for that. In Chanel's hands, the poor fabric became fashion for the rich. First link with denims? Victory came and Capel went —married into the Scottish aristocracy. Despite “a broken heart,” Chanel prospered, and she discovered her one and only confidante, Misia — “a cruel young Pole,” admired by Verlaine. Renoir, Diaghilev, Mal!arm& to name but a few. . . . Another new world was opened for Chanel. When Capel was killed in a car crash, she decorated her bedroom in black, but after one night changed it to pink. Besides, she was becoming involved with a poet, Paul Reverdy, the most unlikely and interesting of her loves, who eventually left her for God. Meanwhile she worked on Cocteau's theater productions, later saying “I very soon had enough of his classical salad.” By 1925 it was time for another lover. Churchill wrote in memory of the 2nd Duke of Westminster, “He was deeply versed in all forms of animal sport and saw into the heart of them.” For five years, Chanel and her duke pranced about the international social scene. She was introduced to England's upper crust. Her designs became resolutely masculine; English tailoring showed. Until the duke married the Honorable Loelia Mary Ponsoby. By now Chanel's fame had spread to America — Samuel Goldwyn offered her one million dollars for a twice yearly visit. She accepted, but after one film of her colorless understated designs, the stars rebelled and refused to wear The next lover, Iribe, a satirical cartoonist, introduced her to French literary life. But not for very long; he died suddenly on the tennis court. Given her lovers—one gone, one married. two dead and one gone to God—perhaps it was no surprise that Chanel put her own interests first. Her workers felt differently. In strike‐bound Paris of 1936 she was locked out of her own workshop. Earlier when ap‐ proached about their demands she had replied, “Oh, stop bothering me with your nonsense.” Now she was defeated—temporarily. Three years later, as World War II began, she laid off her entire staff without warning. This war provided her with a new style lover—Hans Gunther Von D., a spy in occupied Paris, employed by Dr. Goebbels. Chanel decided the only possibility of peace lay in her hands. She would bring Churchill, whom she knew slightly from ducal days, and Hitler together for a meeting of international reconciliation. Unbelievably, the Germans took her seriously Operation Modulhut, which was a farce from start to finish, ended in Madrid (Chanel's planned meeting place) with the news that Churchill, still all unaware, had fallen sick and gone to recuperate in Marrakesh. For the rest of Chanel's life she was terrified by the possibility of this dangerous abortion being discovered. After the war she was arrested, although only for a few mysterious hours. Nevertheless it was not till 1954 when she was 71 that she re‐entered the fashion business. “I care more about the city street than the drawing room,” she said and forthwith sold her still classic clothes around the world. New success kept her going till she was 88. Then, lying straight and neat in bed, she gave in. “So that's how you die,” she said. It is, of course, an amazing life story. Sadly, Mlle. CharlesRoux. former editor of French Vogue, is an amazingly irritating writer. Perhaps it's the translation. A certain sort of high‐flown French does not come out well in English. The verbosity and an awful tone of self ‐ congratulation often blurs any real sense of what was going on. This would, no doubt, have pleased Chanel, who apparently took endless pains, including straightforward lying, to hide her background and real self. Apparently, too, she never wrote a word about herself, because there are no written quotes and only the occasional spoken word. Nor, it seems, could Mlle. Charles‐Roux dig up any interesting material from her friends or business associates. All is circumlocution, padding, 19thcentury pomposity.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/letters-letters-letters-letters.html,"Enraged teen‐ager I have read a great many things that have disturbed and irritated me but I have never been enraged to the point of tears over any piece of writing until I read “Teenage affairs” (Oct. 5). Anne Roiphe may possibly have portrayed a parent's reaction to a teen‐age affair very accurately, I wouldn't know, I'm not a parent. But she did portray teen‐age girls very inaccurately, and I do know that because I am one. She depicted today's girls as a large, lost, irresponsible group of sleazies. “There is probably less talk these days of scoring now that scoring is like picking beach plums,” she says. All wrong, lady, all wrong. Guys discuss scoring more than they do football and to their great disappointment most girls are pretty hard plums to pick. Mrs. Roiphe also states that “modern teen‐aged girls arc talking about boys in terms of their value as sex objects” and girls “are not afraid of consequences, ruined reputations or unwanted babies.Who has she been talking to? Of course girls talk about the attractiveness of a boy, sexually and otherwise, but we don't rank them excellentto‐poor according to how well Parents alert: We are not heartless. We care very much about unwanted babies. We are petrified of the consequences of an affair and no body wants to ruin a reputation. But fist and foremost, it matters a hell of a lot what mommy and daddy think. MEGAN M. HIGGINS Katonah, N.Y. Open and closed doors I can't help but compare Anne Roiphe's article on childrearing to that dreadful dish of literary Pablum called “Tay have a baby?” which you published earlier this year. Even to those of us with small children (at least a decade away from puberty), Mrs. Roiphe's article addresses itself far more to the central joys and agonies of parenthood than that young couple's celebratory ode to their toddler. But one gnawing and poignant observation struck me. For those of us not fortunate enough to have attended White House press conference or had an article published in the Sunday Times, how are we ever going to communicate [with] our adolescents? Mrs. Roiphe obviously knew (and hoped) her daughters would read about her perceptions of them through this article. (Were all other doors closed to her?) What channels will be open to the rest of us if even so vital and understanding a woman as Mrs. Roiphe has to talk to her daughters through the megaphone of the press? BARBARA H. PIERCE. Assistant to the Dean of Studies, Vassar College Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Anne Roiphe replies: Naturally our children know our opinions and feelings on important and trivial matters. Those old enough to be concerned have always read, prior to publication, whatever material I happen to be working on. Sometimes they contribute changes or additions. I use my life experience in my work as does most everyone, whatever their work might be. The experiences gained being a parent, a mate, a woman, etc are all the raw materials of my craft. Surely Barbara Pierce does not think it would he better to write about bull tights or baseball games. Women, particularly, need to share honestly their important troubling concerns and accept them as worthy of public discussion and professional Parental snooping? What was the parent of a I5‐year‐old doing on a “casual inspection of that creature's underwear drawer” anyway? It is interesting that the same Magazine section contained an article on how police have become increasingly careful to advise suspects of their rights and to collect prosecutorial information in a legal manner which will withstand the close scru tiny of the fairness doctrine. A parent snooping like this is substituting second‐hand information for first ‐ hand communication. Parents who snoop deserve what they get. Would the snooping parent have felt any better if the 15‐year‐old had asked for permission or help in obtaining birth‐control pills? A parent whose fears keep sexuality out of the living room should not go looking for it in underdrawers. Aside from Mrs. Roiphe's casual acceptance of the cas‐ Letters ual inspection mentioned. there are some errors and sloppy reporting that I do not expect to see in The Times. Specifically, “they [female teenagers] are not afraid of . . . unwanted babies.” Where does Mrs. Roiphe get this information? In Schofield's 1965 study, 51 per cent of the males and 70 per cent of the females with sexual experience feared the possibility of the female becoming pregnant. This fear doesn't stop people from having intercourse without contraception and perhaps that is what Mrs. Roiphe is getting at, but the statement as it stands is misleading. A second problem sentence says, “(My informant tell me) at least 50 per cent of any graduating high‐school class I isl participating in sex• ual liaisons.” My informants tell me? This is really shoddy reporting, less for the percentage than for the vagueness of the source of the percentage, all the less acceptable because we have numerous recent studies from which such percentages can be estimated for males and females. Readers deserve to know the sources of a report‐ My final point is more personally biased. Mrs Roiphe says that cuddling is “nobody's idea of sexuality.” Who rays? What gives Mrs. Roiphe the right to decide what is and is not sexual? I have often slept with a friend, not necessarily because I wanted to make love passionately bit'. because the sensuality of warmth between two people lying close to each other is an experience I value in its own right. Mrs. Roiphe's mistake here seems to be equating sexuality with intercourse, foreplay (an awful word), etc. After all, sometimes tak ing a shower (even alone) is a very sexual experience. Masters and Johnson's work has clearly shown that the narrowing of sexual focus, the setting of objectives in lovemaking, is the single most effective process for killing sexual joy rind warmth. PETER SCALES Research Coordinator. The Institute for Family Research and Education Syracuse Anne Roiphe replies: (1) Putting away the laun dry is not the first step toward a police state. (2) Statistics and surveys are the greatest con game of all time. Mine are as erroneous as yours. We can play with them like Silly Putty and make them say anything we want. (3) Cuddling is a part, but not all, of human sexuality. Adult love carries with it a variety of childhood satisfactions but it goes on to include other sensations. In the best of all possible worlds, the full range of satisfactions would he available to each of us Anyone who stops at cuddling or showering alone is missing something, and that's a pity. No more necking? The picture of a couple kissing in Central Park which illustrated Anne Roiphe's article is misleading and I suspect deliberately posed. When my husband and were courting there some 15 years ago we were members of an army of couples lounging around on the ground. necking, enjoying limited sexual pleasure. However, today I rarely see a couple necking in the park. They come to enjoy nature, having already had it all in bed. MAGGIE KATSANOS New York City Shared sufferings Anne Roiphe gives a sensible and touching account of the traumas and sorrows of parenthood. Adolescence is, of course, a wrenching experience for parents and children. We begin to experience separation as teen‐agers a feelintt for which we spend the rest of our lives trying to compensate. For years, I've heard my mother and her friends discussing their children, not just out of pride and satisfaction Letters but, more often, to share their sufferings. I've heard my grandmother, at age 85, still berating her middle ‐ aged children for not quite fulfilling her needs and their own filial obligations, as if motherhood were a sort of penance (she bore her children like a cross). And for years now, my friends and I have been discussing our parents: at first, as teen‐agers, with resentment and self‐centered rage; now, in our 20's, with compassion and a sense of guilt and, sometimes, humor. We have all seen smashedup lives, and as children we wonder how our parents will survive us. Sometimes our own pain is doubled because we see it inflicted upon them. We are not oblivious to our parents’ suffering, though we must sometimes act in spite of it. And their pain is something we will always carry within us, along with our own. WENDY KAMINER Brookline, Mass. Some rules are good Anne Roiphe's [opening paragraph] is a wise, poignant and honest riposte to the media's brutal decontextualization of Betty Ford's remarks. However, the general tone of her article is typical of the passive, manipulative liberalism that drives many of today's young people into the arms of Rev. Moon or the S.L.A. In her last paragraph she states, “if today's young people become unglued, destructive, it will not be because of early sexual activity . . . [but] because of the social, political, economic, emotional failures of our generation. . . .” I find this statement to be patronizing and infuriating. I am 30 years old and have been making my own moral mistakes for almost 20 years. I also have been making my own wise judgments for almost 20 Any morality which by definition obviates teenagers’ abilities to make sexual mistakes also obviates their abilities to make wise judgments. When I was around 21, my mother made clear to me that she did not approve of fornication under her roof. This rule helped me to move away from home. Far from being the sham that Mrs. Roiphe thinks, a rule like this can be a tender gift of love which helps the child to grow into his or her own maturity. In my mother's case it was also a difficult act of love, for she was a 61‐year‐old widow with other children. JOHN STOUT New York City Immaculate brides? I am surprised that you have seen fit to publish Anne Roiphe's article and I cannot find an expression strong enough to censure this outrage against‐morals and dignitY‐ Your magazine is read not only by mature adults but by teen‐agers, and they cannot help interpreting this treatise on premarital sex as a confirmation of their immature opinion that it is a sign of our time and an expression of women's lib to have intercourse before they are married. Every religion praises chastity as one of the great virtues, and nature itself has provided a protective shield for the girl which only her wedded husband may perforate. In this day and age there is not much that a bride can offer her husband, but an immaculate body is one of the most beautiful wedding presents. The difference between humans and animals [is] that the latter copulate when the female is in heat whereas woman gives herself to the man whom she loves and who loves her enough to make her his wife. Nowhere in Anne Roiphe's Letters article is it stated that sex, important as it may be, is only one of the many parts which constitute love and that intercourse without true and complete love must lead to disappointment. It is most important in the education of girls that the mother teaches her daughter to remain popular without going to bed with Tom, Dick and Harry and that it is no disgrace to say “no” until she finds the man who says “I do.” DR. CHARLES R. A. Hartig New York City Anne Roiphe replies: An immaculate body (only on the part of the bride) combined with the phrase some irate readers have used—“a sense of one's worth”‐‐makes me realize how much we as women are ‘till defined by primitive standards. Wouldn't it be better for Dr. Hartig's bride to offer a loving soul rather than an untouched body? Isn't her worth in her mind and her spirit, and not in the condition of her hymen? I find this view highly immoral, which only shows the wide differences between us these sensitive topics. Virginity and virtue Major parts of Anne Roiphe's article upset us very much. For instance: “Masters and Johnson, the pill, legal abortion, breakdown of parental authority, the women's movement have reduced the ideal of virginity, male and female, to the size of an appendix, a little organ without much of a future in the evolution of human anatomy.” The majority of the teens we know are still virgins. They still feel as if virginity is a virtue. These people feel that if they explore all aspects of life too early they will have nothing to look forward to. They like to save sex until they are positive that they have found the one man/ woman they love. In this way sex has a certain beauty about it. Yet those who are not virgins do not feel ashamed of what they have done, for they found the one person whom they thought was the right person for them. Abortion is still considered a hush‐hush subject, as it was in Roiphe's day. MICHELLE LEWIS, Roam HALL, JULIE YACH, ALISON MULLADY LOUISE LAVALLA, SUE SHANNON (All sweet 16) Fairfield, Conn. Imparting values When I came to Anne Roiphe's flat statement that as parents “we must learn to accept whatever has come,” I found myself saying “No! No! No!” That is why many parents have lost. They didn't lead. The parent Anne Roiphe mentioned, who sighed when his son became a Zen Buddhist but allowed him to pitch a tent on his back lawn, was being led. Leadership by the parent was needed, not acceptance. I remember a pediatrician who told me many years ago that children fight against their parents to strengthen themselves for survival in the world. “As hard as they struggle against you, that hard they will struggle against the world,” he said. We have lost so many children to their peers and their influences because we have failed to be as strong in imparting our values and ideals as we would have been in projecting strength through a physical Many young people are finding the need for commitment. Farther down that road of commitment is the public one of marriage. When they get there, let's not have them find that we have followed them and that they are once again alone. MAXINE L. KAYE Hillsdale, N. J. Anne Roiphe replies: I'm reminded of the constant Presidential announcements on the imminent victory in Vietnam and the cheery statements on the upturn of the economy. Adolescents are definitely not a bunch of cub scouts making teepee fires in the woods, and the reality of the day‐to‐day tangles cannot be simplified by inspirational exhortations. The fact is, it's hard to lead when we're all together in swamps of uncertainty and change. No more excuses For all of the parents of today's children/adolescents, et al. I should like to say thanks very much. In one relatively brief article, it has been told like it is. There is certainly no longer any excuse for today's parents to say, “I really didn't know, can't (won't) believe it.” BARBARA K. RINGLER Teaneck, N. J. ■"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/the-region-politics-must-take-account-of-catholicism.html,"The Connecticut Legislature at its last session enacted a bill permitting meditation in public schools to ducumvent the United States Supreme Court ban on prayer in schools. Connecticut and New Jersey have prohibited the use Medicaid funds for most abortions even though the Court has ruled that most antiabortion legislation is unconstitutional. The actions in both states, many politicians believe, point to the strong influence of Catholic voters in the two states, which along with New York are among the most Catholic states in the union. Continued All three states now have Catholic governors: That three Catholics, governors Brendan Byrne of New Jersey, Hugh L. Carey of New York and Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut, hold the tristate governorships simultaneously is partly an accident of history. It is also a natural development of the demographic and political forces at work in the region. All three states have large Catholic constituencies. All three states demonstrate, at least in their gubernatorial elections, the coming together of the New Deal alliance labor and liberals with Catholics, who are re‐establishing their historic ties with the Democratic party, which has shifted rightward under the pressure of governmental budget crises and an upswing in crime. The three Democratic governors replaced Republican administrations by running middle‐of‐the‐road campaigns which attracted Catholic voters, a major swing vote the three states. The Catholic shift was particularly evident in New York, where Mr. Carey ended 16 years of Republican rule last November. Before his election, Democrats had held the New York State House for only four of the previous 32 years, largely because of the defection of Catholics from the Democratic line starting with Franklin Roosevelt's third‐term bid in 1940. The numbers tell part of the story of Catholic influence in the three states. Catholics comprise 44 per cent of the population in Connecticut, 41 per cent in New Jersey and 35 per cent in New York. Only Rhode Island, with 63 per cent of its population Catholic, and Massachusetts, 51 per cent, have larger Catholic populations, according to the Census and Catholic Almanac statistics. The Catholic share of the voting population, however, is even larger, according to politakers who project Catholic voters as 53 per cent of the electorate in Connecticut, 48 per cent in New Jersey and 40 per cent in New York. These numbers help explain why the last three governors of both Connecticut and New Jersey were Catholics. Somewhat surprisingly though, New Jersey did not elect its first Catholic Governor until 1962, and Connecticut until 1941. In New York, Mr. Carey was the first elected Catholic Governor since Alfred E. Smith, in the 1920's. (Mr. Smith was New York's first elected Catholic Governor.) There is no comparable pattern in the United States Senate seats in the three states. Of the six senators, only one, James L. Buckley of New York, is Catholic. Senator Buckley owes his election, with less than a majority of the vote in a three‐way race in 1970, to Catholic voters and he will again need their support to be re‐elected next year. New York Democratic leaders, recognizing that Catholics are now the swing vote in the state, hope nominate an opponent of Mr. Buckley's who will draw away some of his Catholic support while retaining traditionally Democratic, Jewish voters. The House of Representatives delegations in the three states provide a mixed picture of Catholic influence. Four of the six Connecticut members of Congress and eight the 15 New Jersey House members are Catholic, but only 12 of 39 New York representatives are Catholic. The Influence on Legislation The large Catholic populations in the three states have varying impact not only on election returns but on state legislation as well. There is general agreement that a decade or two ago, the late Cardinal Spellman had considerable influence state and even national affairs, largely because politicians perceived him as an undisputed leader of a monolithic church. Today, however, the authority of the church is no longer unquestioned, so the Catholic hierarchy has lost some of its influence in government and politics. Cardinal Cooke, the successor to Cardinal Spellman and the highest ranking prelate of the church in the three states, avoids public involvement in politics and government. Similarly, the new Archbishop of Hartford, John Whealon, is considerably less visible in political and governmental affairs than was his predecessor. Through its own lobbying efforts and the stance of Catholic legislators, the church has been most influential publically in the two, often bitterly fought‐over issues abortion and state aid to parochial and private schools. Here too the record is mixed. The Catholic position on parochial aid prevailed in all three states until the courts stepped in and declared most of such aid unconstitutional. But there was also considerable pressure for such aid from other religions, Secretary of State Gloria Schaffer of Connecticut noted. Mrs. Schaffer, who is Jewish and was legislator and chairman of an education committee in the Connecticut legislature, strongly supported such aid. Unlike parochial aid, the abortion issue was a clear defeat for the church in New York even before the Supreme Court ruled in favor of virtually unrestricted abortions. In New York, abortion was legalized with few restrictions even before the Court acted and despite the strong opposition of the church and Catholic legislators. In New Jersey and Connecticut, the recent legislative and administrative rulings barring the use of Medicaid funds for abortions are viewed by politicians in both states as rearguard actions that are unlikely to withstand court challenges. The church's defeat on this volatile issue demonstrated to many politicians that clergymen, Catholic or otherwise, have lost most of the legislative influence they once had. Assembly Minority Leader. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, a Protestant, echoed other regional politicians when he said he did not think that “the church, more than any other group, can control a big bloc of votes either at the polls or in the legislature.” Frank Lynn writes about political, affairs for The New York Times."
Poll Shows Voters In Doubt on E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/poll-shows-voters-in-doubt-on-era.html,"TRENTON — Despite vigorous campaigns both for and against the proposal to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the State Constitution, there is still widespread confusion in the minds of voters as to what effect the amendment would have on the rights of both men and women. The results of a poll by an independent research organization—they were released last week—indicated that only 30 per cent of those interviewed had heard of the amendment or had any idea of what it would mean. The question will be listed on Tuesday's ballot. Last week, as women's groups blanketed the state with campaign materials and speakers, emotions were running high. Supporters of the proposal charged that opponents were making “irresponsible claims” in an effort to confuse voters concerning the effect the amendment would have on women and their family life. ‘Scare Tactics’ Alleged “The public should not let themselves be intimidated by the scare tactics and misrepresentations of the antiE.R.A. forces,” said Eileen P. Thornton, president of the Women's Equity Action League, a professional women's group. “They have been creating controversial issues to distract the voters from the real issues of practical and legal protection under the law. Anyone making public statements on the subject has an obligation to examine legal records to check the facts.” In rebuttal, Inez Franko, chairman of the Coalition to Stop E.R.A., said she thought the pro‐amendment forces had been “honestly duped” and that “our facts bother them.” The proposal is designed to provide a constitutional guarantee against discrimination because of sex. It reads, “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex,” and it is similar to an amendment to the United States Constitution that has been approved by Congress and must be ratified by four more states before it becomes effective. Although 34 states already have approved the amendment, the ratification effort has been: stalled and could take six years to become effective, if it is passed at all. New Jersey gave its approval in 1972. Specifically, the pro‐equal rights groups object to statements by opponents charging that the amendment would liberalize abortions, force women to forfeit their rights to child custody and alimony and compel housewives to go to work to support their families. “There is no legal basis for any of these claims,” said Madora Doherty, a Toms River lawyer specializing in domestic relations. The amendment would not affect the right to abortion, she asserted, because such right already has been established by the United States Supreme Court. As for the claim that some women will be forfeiting their rights in child custody cases and to alimony, Mrs. Doherty said that the courts already had begun to award custody on the basis of what parent would best raise the child. Either spouse can now be required to pay alimony, depending on the ability to pay, but in many divorce cases, she observed, alimony is no longer awarded. Most important, Mrs. Doherty asserted, “the E.R.A. would not require women to go to work and would not require husbands and wives to contribute the same amount of money to a marriage, as the opponents contend it would. Who works in the home and who works outside the home will be decided by the individuals involved, not the state E.R.A.” Mum is Word For Men Mrs. Franko contends, however, that “under certain conditions, women will be forced to leave home to work. A lazy husband could force his wife to work.” Moreover, Mrs. Franko believes that the amendment will sanction homosexual marriages, a charge that Mrs. Doherty said had been disproved by a recent case before the Washington State Supreme Court. Throughout the campaign, men have been unusually silent. In New York State, where the amendment also is on the ballot, veterans’ groups and some other men's organizations have publicly asked for its defeat. However, no broad statewide opposition or support has been voiced by New Jersey men's groups, according to leaders of the two opposing factions. The New YYork Times Eileen P. Thornton"
Follow‐Up on The News,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/followup-on-the-news-the-bricklin-dream-convicted-doctor-safety-on.html,"In June, 1974, when he introduced his sports car, the Bricklin SVI, Malcolm Bricklin said confidently that he would be building 1.000 cars a month at a profit before the year was out. Last September, when work on the car was halted in New Brunswick, Canada, only about 420 cars a month were being manufactured, and Mr. Bricklin's General Vehicle, Inc., of Scottsdale, Ariz., was near financial collapse. The company is attempting to reorganize today under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Mr. Bricklin, who says indications are that he will declare himself personally bankrupt shortly at a loss “in excess of $5‐million,” has not abandoned his dream. He is attempting to line up backers to build a new sports car in the United States and says that four locations have been offered to him. “We're going to take all the mistakes we made on the SVI and revamp it,” he said, “so that the car that comes out will have the same pizazz but it will end up being a much more publicly responsive car.” Of impending bankruptcy, he says: “The probability is I will lose everything. The knowledge and experience gained, they don't take away.” Convicted Doctor Fount; guilty last February of killing a 6‐month‐old maie fetus during a legal abortion, Dr. Kenneth S. Edelin called his trial a “witchhunt.” The 36‐year‐old obstetrician‐gynecologist, who was placed on probation by the court in Boston, has not altered that view. His appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts will be heard the week of Dec. I. The trial and publicity have not affected his relations with patients, he reports. He continues to practice and teach at the Boston City Hospital, and at his parttime private practice in Boston's South End, “there's a long waiting list to get in to see me.” But plans he had could be affected, he fears. “I'm a convicted felon, unfortunately,” Dr. Edelin says grimly. “I had hopes of pursning a career in academic medicine — being affiliated with a medical school, teaching obstetrics and gynecology —and I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to pursue that.” Safety on the Pike Heavy fog rolling off the Meadowlands swathed a northern stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike during the night and early morning of Oct. 24‐25, 1973. By the time ‘t'had lifted, nine persons had been killed and 40 injured in a series of flaming chain collisions involving 65 vehicle:. The Turnpike Authority promised two months later to install electronic sensors along the highway's northern end to alert motorists immediately to accidents ahead. “The system has been completely installed and is being debugged by the Sperry Rand Corporation, which designed it,” reports William J. Flanagan, executive director of the authority. Nearly 800 sensors, spaced a half mile apart, have been embedded in the pavement. Any interruption to the normal flow of traffic is signaled via computer to a control room in East Brunswick, and warning signs are activated automatically on the pike. The $5‐million system should go into operation by January, according to Mr. Flanagan. Halloween Murder A year ago this week, Ronald Clark O'Bryan of Pasadena, Tex. was accused of murdering his 8‐year‐old son, Timothy, on Halloween by giving him a candy straw filled with cyanide. The 30‐year‐old tether, who was said to have been motivated by a desire to collect $30,000 in insurance, was convicted. Last June he was sentenced to death in the electric chair. He continues to maintain his innocence, according to the Rev. Jimmy E. Jones of the Second Baptist Church in Pasadena, which Mr. O'Bryan attended regularly with nis wife, son and daughter before the hay's death. “I really don't know,” the minisier adds. “He talks convincingly.” At the Texas Department of Correction death house outside Huntsville, Warden Robert Cousins reports that Mr. O'Bryan “reads his Bible a lot.” His conviction is being appealed. ‘“He's done quite a bit of trying,” says the Rev. Jones, who has visited him a few times. At the trial. Mrs. O'Bryan testified that immediately after their son's death, Mr. O'Bryan had “beat the wall and asked questions out loud on why an 8‐year‐old boy had to die: I did not see any tears.” RICHARD HAITCH"
Ideas &,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/02/archives/ideas-trends-other-karen-quinlan-cases-have-never-reached-court.html,"A significant aspect of the Karen Quinlan case is the fact that it is in court at all. Each day hundreds, perhaps thousands, of similar dilemmas present themselves to relatives and physicians involved in the care of vegetative or terminal patients with no reasonable chance for recovery. The decisions—to pro‐ Continued long or not to prolong life—are difficult, often agonizing, but they ara reached in hospital corridors and in waiting rooms, not courts. Indeed, the rarity of courtroom battles is what has helped focus national attention on the Quinlan case. For physicians, the fact that the case went into the public process for resolution represents a failure of the usual—often unspoken, deliberately ambiguous—steps in caring for such a patient. What happens to the thousands of other patients like Karen Quinlan, a coma victim whose breathing has been sustained by a respirator, is that a consensus is reached between the nearest‐of‐kin and the attending physicians. Physicians are obligated to fight to preserve life, and this they do, but they are neither sadists nor automatons. At a certain point heroic measures to preserve life become obscene, and they are (quietly) discontinued. The physician is not treating the family—the patient is his only legitimate concern—and yet he (or she) cannot ignore the family. When the patient is vegetative or in terminal agony, the family provides the clues: “He always said he would kill himself if he was becoming senile…” “She's in such pain and the medicine doesn't help….” “We've always been against prolonging dying.” Sometimes the perceptions of the family and the physician do not jibe. Some comatose patients, particularly those hurt in accidents, may recover full function after weeks of stupor. Cancer, even cancer that has spread, may respond dramati‐ cally to chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Little children with leukemia are tormented by infections, bleeding, pain, intravenous needles, drug‐induced hair loss, nausea, fear and isolation. Yet, each year more and more live five years after the onset of the disease, some have lived 10; and always there is the hope of a new drug that will cure. Sometimes the physician may know the situation is hopeless, but confronts a family that refuses to accept the prognosis. There is no moral problem here. The physician tries as hard as possible, and eventually the disease itself or superimposed infection takes its toll. If the patient settles into a vegetative limbo, physicians and nurses may work conscientiously to preserve whatever life there is. Sometimes this is expensive, but the financial cost to the family or the state is not an allowable factor in any ethical or religious decision about prolonging life. When a person gets hurt in an auto accident, he doesn't want any cost‐accountants pointing out that 100,000 children could be immunized for the same money it takes to support one comatose adult until recovery. Technological advances in lifesupport equipment have intensified the problem, which has been present to some extent since intravenous fluid supplements became readily available 50 years ago. For Karen Quinlan there will be no miracle drug. There is no prospect for recovery. Yet, she is not dead, according to society's criteria for determining death. Death may supervene as the case moves through the legal process, including expected appeals. If a decision is reached, It is not likely to satisfy anyone. All this in a case which never would have gone to court were it not for phantom fears and medical paranoia. Malpractice, real or imagined, helped drag the Quinlan case front a subtle transaction between physicians and family into trial. Although given explicit written permission by the patient's father to turn off the respirator, the attending physicians, Dr. Arshad Javed and Dr. Robert Morse, refused. One major reason for their refusal was fear of a retaliatory malpractice suit. They also contended there was no medical precedent and that they felt they must adhere to “medical tradition.” Stalemated, the next‐of‐kin turned to the court. It is unclear whose idea the written permission was; but, like many important things in this world, it was clearly best left unwritten. The doctors were probably correct in assuming that such a declaration would have little value in protecting them if they ever were sued for negligence or murder. Strong Evidence Indeed, some lawyers feel that the permission document might have been the strongest evidence against Drs. Javed and Morse. Once the permission to end life became explicit, the doctors were fair game for any crusading prosecutor who might hear of the case and decide to make a test case—and possibly a reputation—out of Karen Quinlan. Had the doctors quietly acceded to the family's wishes, medical reality would have taken over. It is rare for a vegetative patient to be kept indefinitely on a respirator. A slightly prolonged attempt to “wean” Miss Quinlan from the respirator would hae ended with a natural death and no law suit. There is no precedent for a physician's being held guilty for malpractice or manslaughter in failing to provide extraordinary care for terminal patient. Only two cases have gone to trial of physicians who actively hastened death through injections (instead of merely withholding or delaying extraordinary treatment). Both had deliberately documented what they had done, so the question of intent was clear. Nonetheless, both were acquitted. The case of Dr. Kenneth Edelin, convicted of manslaughter for not attempting to revive a late‐pregnancy abortion, is said to have frightened physicians into persisting in unusual efforts to maintain life. Although Drs. Javed and Morse may have been sensitized by that case, there is little evidence that doctors in general have changed their pattern of tacit cooperation with reality and the reasonable wishes of next of kin. If they had, there would be a hundred Quinlan cases daily. Dr. Michael Halberstarn writes and practices medicine in Washington, D. C."
Defeat of Equal Rights Bills Traced to Women's Votes,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/06/archives/defeat-of-equal-rights-bills-traced-to-womens-votes-rights-bill.html,"It was women, not men, whose negative votes brought about the stunning defeat of state equal‐rights amendments in New York and New Jersey, both supporters and opponents of the amendments agreed yesterday on the basis of their contacts with thousands of women in the final days of the campaign. That defeat, both sides further agreed, has in turn dealt both a psychological blow to the women's movement and political blow to public figures identified with the movement. Some friends of Representative Bella S. Abzug expressed concern that the defeat of the amendment by more than 400,000 votes in New York State could damage the Manhattan Democrat's imminent campaign for the United States Senate nomination next year. Almost immediately, opponents in both states announced drives to repeal ratification of the Federal equal‐rights amend. ment. The New York and New Jersey State Legislatures were among the earliest to ratify the Federal amendment in 1972. And with the national drive stalled at four states short of the required 38, Tuesday's vote, with a 60,000 margin in New Jersey, will be read as a signal that the amendment's old friends have turned against it.. As for the passage of six of the 10 proposed amendments to the New York City Charter, politicians read that as indicating disenchantment with incumbent officials in general —and with the Beanie administration in particular. [Page 32.] “E.R.A. has been repudiated lby the electorate, so we will undoubtedly work to rescind,” Serphin R. Maltese, executive director of the state Conservative Party, said yesterday. The Conservatives had made defeat of the state of our major issues this year,” Mr. Maltese said, adding: “We're entitled to claim some credit for Tuesday night.” Most of the credit, or blame, apparently goes to women themselves, and to their perceptions of what the amendment I would actually have meant in ‘their lives. “There's no way to measure it, of course, but I suspect was us who voted against it,” said Ross Graham, executive assistant to State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein and the former head of the State Women's Political Caucus. “WoI men were afraid. They know what they have now, so why take a chance on something new?” The language of the amendment seemed simple enough—“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex'—but its very simplicity meant that it did not precisely spell out how it might affect the innumerable situations in which women come into contact with government or the law. The Unisex Toilets “It came down to a question of credibility,” said State Senator Karen S. Burstein, a Nassau County Democrat who took part in many public debates on the side of the E.R.A. “They'd say E.R.A. would mean unisex toilets. We'd say there was no way E.R.A. would mean unisex toilets. Well, if someone came away believing there was even a 1‐in‐100 chance of unisex toilets, then she'd vote against E.R.A.” Through the long months of often‐confusing debate, the amendment came to symbolize the entire array of changes in the law, and society as whole, that have been sought or achieved by different elements of the women's movement in recent years. In turn, the response to those changes dictated response to the proposed amendment. “People were fed up by all that radical nonsense and concerned about what has been happening to the family,” Annette Stern, president of Operation Wake‐up, the principal opposition to the amendment here, said yesterday. “The women's movement has been heard far out of all proportion to its real numbers,” Mrs. Stern continued. “Our campaign was the first time that the average women of this state could get organized.” Vote Against Family’ As the scope of the defeat became apparent Tuesday night, supporters of the amendment charged that the opponents had intentionally distorted aspects of the amendment. Opposition literature, for example, claimed that “a vote for E.R.A. is a vote against the family” or “a vote for homosexual marriage.” Some of the literature, for example, said it would force wives to contribute 50 per cent of the family's financial support, or would deny women the right to alimony. “There was such anxiety,” said State Senator Carol Bellamy, a Brooklyn Democrat who campaigned for the amendment. “So many women talked to had a sense that we wanted to take something away from them, some privilege or benefit that in most cases they don't really have.” The amendment's supporters denied most of the opponents’ allegations, but conceded that on the alimony question, an equal rights amendment would have insured that husbands could qualify for alimony if individual circumstances warranted it. The proposal carried New York City by 59 percent, but it was soundly defeated in such major upstate urban centers as Erie County (Buffalo), Monroe County (Rochester) and Onondaga County (Syracuse), where local and county races produced a much higher voter turnout than in New York City. Many of these same upstate areas elected women candidates to local and county offices in record numbers—three county, legislators in Monroe, two in Erie, two in Albany County. In all, more than 40 women were elected to local offices in the state, in addition to the women who were elected Lieutenant Governors of Mississippi and Kentucky and another woman, Margaret Hance, who won 55 percent of the vote in an eight‐way race for Mayor of Phoenix, Ariz. Representative Abzug cited these results yesterday to Dhow that the E.R.A. defeats had not signalled the political death of the women's movement in the state and to counter speculation that she, in particular, would be hurt by Tuesday's results. Nevertheless, some politically active women saw the EqualRights‐Amendment defeats as the end of the crest of political victories that included the election last year of Lieut. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak here and Gov. Ella T. Grasso in Connecticut. “Maybe lieutenant governor is becoming what secretary of state has been in a lot of states—the token woman's job,” one woman commented yesterday. Complacency Noted Mrs. Stern of Operation Wake‐up said yesterday that since the amendment's supporters “talk only to themselves,” they were unable to recognize grass‐roots disaffection with the women's movement or to organize to combat it. Some supporters, too, conceded that had been complacent. The New York Coalition for Equal Rights, the principal group supporting the amendment here, raised only $75,000 of an original $250,000 goal. “Where were the women?” asked Mark Gasarch, who served as the coalition's Election Day coordinator. A year ago, he said, 300 women volunteers had shown up on election day to help Miss Krupsak, whose election by that time was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion. On Tuesday, only 30 volunteers came to the coalition's midtown headquarters. Supporters of the amendment in New York said yesterday there would be little point in trying to push the amendment through the Legislature next session. Rather, they predicted, all their energy is needed to fight the threatened rescinding of the 1972 ratification and to prevent anti‐abortion groups and others who might be encouraged by the amendment's defeat to renew dormant legislative efforts. Senator Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton and the Senator majority leader, has been a strong supporter of the Federal amendment. Asked yesterday what position he might take on the effort to rescind, a spokesman for Senator Anderson replied: “He wouldn't be for it himself, but if the Republican conference felt strongly about it, he might have to go along.”"

The Conservatives had made defeat of the state amendment “one of our major issues this year,” Mr. Maltese said, adding: ‘We're entitled to claim some “We're entitled to claim some credit for Tuesday night.” Most of the credit, or blame, apparently goes to women themselves, and to their perceptions of what the amendment would actually have meant in their lives. “There's no way to measure it, of course, but I suspect was us who voted against it,” said Ross Graham, executive assistant to State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein and the former head of the State Women's Political Caucus. “Women were afraid. They know what they have now, so why take a chance on something new?” The language of the amendment seemed simple enough—“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex”—but its very simplicity meant that it did not precisely spell out how it might affect the innumerable situations in which women come into contact with government or the law. The Unisex Toilets “It came down to a question of credibility,” said State Senator Karen S. Burstein, a Nassau County Democrat who took part in many public debates on the side of the E.R.A. “They'd say E.R.A. would mean unisex toilets. We'd say there was no way E.R.A. would mean unisex toilets. Well, if someone came away believing there was even a 1‐in‐100 chance of unisex toilets, then she'd vote against E.R.A.” Through the long months of often‐confusing debate, the amendment came to symbolize the entire array of changes in the law, and society as whole, that have been sought or achieved by different elements of the women's movement in recent years. In turn, the response to those changes dictated response to the proposed amendment. “People were fed up by all that radical nonsense and concerned about what has been happening to the family,” Annette Stern, president of Operation Wake‐up, the principal opposition to the amendment here, said yesterday. “The women's movement has been heard far out of all proportion to its real numbers,” Mrs. Stern continued. “Our campaign was the first time that the average women of this state could get organized.” Vote Against Family As the scope of the defeat became apparent Tuesday night, supporters of the amendment charged that the opponents had intentionally distorted aspects of the amendment. Opposition literature, for example, claimed that “a vote for E.R.A. is a vote against the family” or “a vote for homosexual marriage.” Some of the literature, for example, said it would force wives to contribute 50 per cent of the family's financial support, or would deny women the right to alimony. “There was such anxiety,” said State Senator Carol Bellamy, a Brooklyn Democrat who campaigned for the amendment. “So many women talked to had a sense that we wanted to take something away from them, some privilege or benefit that in most cases they don't really have.” The amendment's supporters denied most of the opponents’ allegations, but conceded that on the alimony question, an equal rights amendment would have insured that husbands could qualify for alimony if individual circumstances warranted it. The proposal carried New York City by 59 percent, but it was soundly defeated in such major upstate urban centers as Erie County (Buffalo), Monroe County (Rochester) and Onondaga County (Syracuse), where local and county races produced a much higher voter turnout than in New York City. Many of these same upstate areas elected women candidates to local and county offices in record numbers—three county legislators in Monroe, two in Erie, two in Albany County. In all, more than 40 women were elected to local offices in the state, in addition to the women who were elected Lieutenant Governors of Mississippi and Kentucky and another woman, Margaret Hance, who won 55 percent of the vote in an eight‐way race for Mayor of Phoenix, Ariz. Representative Abzug cited these results yesterday to Dhow that the E.R.A. defeats had not signalled the political death of the women's movement in the state and to counter speculation that she, in particular, would be hurt by Tuesday's results. Nevertheless, some politically active women saw the EqualRights‐Amendment defeats as the end of the crest of political victories that included the election last year of Lieut. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak here and Gov. Ella T. Grasso in Connecticut. “Maybe lieutenant governor is becoming what secretary of state has been in a lot of states—the token woman's job,” one woman commented yesterday. Complacency Noted Mrs. Stern of Operation Wake‐up said yesterday that since the amendment's supporters “talk only to themselves,” they were unable to recognize grass‐roots disaffection with the women's movement or to organize to combat it. Some supporters, too, conceded that had been complacent. The New York Coalition for Equal Rights, the principal group supporting the amendment here, raised only $75,000 of an original $250,000 goal. “Where were the women?” asked Mark Gasarch, who served as the coalition's Election Day coordinator. A year ago, he said, 300 women volunteers had shown up on election day to help Miss Krupsak, whose election by that time was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion. On Tuesday, only 30 volunteers came to the coalition's midtown headquarters. Supporters of the amendment in New York said yesterday there would be little point in trying to push the amendment through the Legislature next session. Rather, they predicted, all their energy is needed to fight the threatened rescinding of the 1972 ratification and to prevent anti‐abortion groups and others who might be encouraged by the amendment's defeat to renew dormant legislative efforts. Senator Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton and the Senator majority leader, has been a strong supporter of the Federal amendment. Asked yesterday what position he might take on the effort to rescind, a spokesman for Senator Anderson replied: “He wouldn't be for it himself, but if the Republican conference felt strongly about it, he might have to go along.”"
Nina Voronel Talks of Plays and Dissent in Soviet,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/07/archives/nina-voronel-talks-of-plays-and-dissent-in-soviet-reenact-old.html,"As an underground playwright in the Soviet Union before she immigrated to Israel last December, Nina Voronel set out to write realistic plays. “But,” she said here this week, “Soviet life is .so absurd that when write realistically, it becomes the theater of the absurd.” Unlike leading exponents of the real theater of the absurd in the West, such as Eugene Ionesco and Slawomir Mrozek, Mrs. Voronel begins at the other end of the tunnel. “When I read Mrozek and Ionesco, I see they invent situations and make them witty. I do the opposite. I try to write in a way that people really speak and describe a situation. And then I find it is absurd.” Two of Mrs. Voronel's plays, originally written in Moscow last year with no hope of being produced there, are currently receiving their American premiere at the Interart Theater, 549 West 52d Street, through Nov. 16 (Thursday through Sundays). Re‐enact Old Traumas Selected and directed by Margot Lewitin, the two oneacters, “The First of April” and “Matushka ‐ Barynya” demonstrate Mrs. Voronel's view that characters reveal themselves best at a moment of crisis. But while “Matushka ‐ Barynya,” set in an abortion clinic, attempts to deal with general problems of life and death, “The First of April” is specifically drawn from Soviet experience. In this play, a group of former writers in an oldage home re‐enact the traumas of their past when confronted with the idea that there is an informer in their midst. “Americans do not know what it is to live in a society where everybody suspects everybody,” Mrs. Voronel said during a visit before returning to Israel to rejoin her family. “It is a society that is sick.” In Moscow, Mrs. Voronel arrd her husband, Aleksandr Voronel, a physicist of in‐ ternational repute, sometimes communicated with each other by writing on an erasable slate. “It's called a Russian ‐ Russian grammar,” she said. As a prominent dissident, Professor Voronel had been jailed several times and had organized scientific seminars for Jewish scientists like himself, who had lost their jobs after applying to emigrate to Israel. He Testifies at Trial A translator of books in English and Persian, Mrs. Voronel began writing plays in 1965, she said. “The first two were for children with normal Soviet ideas. Good versus evil and gond triumphs,” she added. When the Ministry of Culture shut down her fifth play (inspired by A. A. Milne) at the preview stage, the prohibition coincided with a turning point in the Voronels's own attitude toward Soviet society. A few years earlier, Professor Voronel had testified on behalf of the writers Andrei Sinyaysky and Yuli Daniel, whose trial attracted international attention. The 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia “freed me of all illusions,” she explained “The six‐day war in 1967 made me aware of my Jewishness. Then, my husband decided he could no longer live in that society.” In 1969, after the prohibition of her play (“Eight Eights Are Sixty‐Four,” which she hopes to see staged in the West), Mrs. Voronel turned from what she called a surrealistic and “fantastic” vein to “my new kind of plays.” “When they prohibited this play,” she said, “I was completely free. I was no longer dependent on the Ministry of Culture. I suddenly discovered my desire to describe life's noises—to ‘tape’ the life around me.” “In these plays, I was concerned about the creative person and the crowd,” she said. It is in exploring the creative artists's relationship to Soviet society, that Mrs. Voronel arrived at a view that is bound to shock liberals, both in and outside Russia. In essence, this view states, that “each people has the government it deserves” and that the Soviet regime remains in power because it enjoys tacit support form a population that makes compromise a way of life. “I don't want to blame only the government,” she said. “If tomorrow, they vote to kill a creative person, the crowd will say, ‘Kill him.’ “You have to make your choices. Every time you support what goes on you compromise. This is the strongest point of the society. It is destructive to pretend all your life. A lot of Russian intellectuals will feel offended by what I say. I have a very cruel point of view. I see things as they are—I am talking about people who think one way and do things another way. “There were many reasons why I did not want to leave Russia, but my cruel views were unacceptable there.”"
"Britain's Cardinal Heenan, 70, Westminster Archbishop, Dead",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/08/archives/britains-cardinal-heenan-70-westminster-archbishop-dead-ecumenical.html,"LONDON, Nov. 7 (AP) John Cardinal Heenan, Archbishop of Westminster and the leading Roman Catholic prelate in. England, Scotland and Wales, died here today. He was 70 years old and had been in failing health since early 1974. Cardinal Heenan, leader of the 4 million Roman Catholics in Britain, was appointed Archbishop of Westminster in 1963, and was created cardinal two years later. The Archbishop was a firm believer in the ecumenical movement, and worked closely with Dr. Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, principal seat of the Anglican church. In 1968, he became the first cardinal to preach in Westminster Abbey since the Reformation of the 16th century. The Cardinal was uncompromising on the teachings of Roman. Catholicism and strongly against Communism. He also strongly condemned birth control by artificial means and abortion—two issues on which the majority of Britons disagreed with him. He took a keen interest in politics. During the 1974 British miners’ strike, he wrote to Edward Heath, then Prime Minister, with suggestions on industrial relations. He spoke out aganst the Irish Republican Army's terrorist campaign in Britain and Northern Ireland, stressing that the Roman Catholic church “in no way supports the I.R.A.” Conservative in Tone Dr. John Carmel Heenan, as a member of the hierarchy of bishops during the Vatican Councils that began under Pope John XXIII, was active both in the work of “aggiornamento” or updating of the Roman Catholic church and of cautioning those who pressed too far beyond the Pope's leadership. This conservative approach reflected much of his work and thoughts. He set the tone of his leadership in his sermon following his enthronement as Cardinal: He said that he proposed to follow the leadership of the late Pope John. “A Bishop is a pontifex—a builder of bridges,” he observed, adding that he proposed to build bridges that “will be spiritual bridges, but not the less durable on that account.” He also remarked that in some ways moral standards in Britain had improved: “There is a keener sense of social justice, the sick and the needy are not ignored.” The Cardinal was born Jan. 26, 1905, a son of James Carmel Heenan and the former Anne Pilkington, in Ilford,oni the eastern edge of London:( Educated for the priesthood‐at St. Cuthbert's College near Durham, he went on to the Englis; College in Rome. Following ordination in 1930, he was assigned in 1931 as a parish priest in the East End of London, where he remained throughout the bombings of World War II. From 1947 to 1951, he was superior of .the Catholic Missionary Society. These experiences; and others earned him the reputation for always leaning to ward the poor. He was made Bishop of Leeds in 1951 and Archbishop of Liverpool in 1957. In 1960, he commissioned the cathedral for Liv, erpool's 500,000 Catholics, accepting a modern design, on a less costly scale than earlier ‘Gothic aspirations, partly because of the contrasting poverty of the neighborhood. In a London sermon in 1965, he appealed for racial tolerance in Britain. “If today we hound the Negro or the Indian from his home,” he said, “tomorrow we shall, burn the Jewish synagogue. Then we shall rapidly return to political and religious intoler‐. ance of all kinds.” He told the Vatican Council in September 1965 that it would be “false to deny the wellknown facts that in certain places Protestants have suffered persecution at the hands of Catholics.” He urged a clear statement that all men are freeto follow their conscience in religion. Early in 1967, he spoke to a Jewish congregation in Manchester, England, and said that the Vatican Council's document absolving Jews of responsibility for the Crucifixion was “not perfect from your point of view, but waht a great difference from Christian documents of the past with references to the Jews.”"
Italian High Court Approves A Referendum on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/08/archives/italian-high-court-approves-a-referendum-on-abortion.html,"ROME, Nov. 7 (AP)—The Supreme Court of Italy today declared valid a petition for a referendum on whether to legalize abortion. The court said that 557,677 valid signatures called for such a plebiscite. Feminists contend that more than one million illegal abortion operations are performed in Italy every year. Sponsors of the referendum seek a law to permit abortions when two doctors agree that the physical or mental health of a woman is endangered by pregnancy. The vote would be held sometime next spring, barring a national political crisis."
"JERSEY Ell. LOSS LAID TO 4 COUNTIES,",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/09/archives/jersey-era-loss-laid-to-4-counties-upsets-in-the-north-stunned.html,"TRENTON, NOV. 7— Leaders of the campaign to add an equal‐rights amendment to the New Jersey Constitution, still stunned over Tuesday's defeat, conceded today that the amendment drive had faltered badly In four key northern counties, accounting in large part for the defeat. The suburban counties of Union, Passaic Essex and Morris provided opponents of the amendment with a plurality of 66,000 that could not be erased in other areas. Although the amendme‐nt proposal was soundly defeated statewide by 59;145 votes, its failure could‐not be attributed to the more rural southern counties, as had been expected, but rather to the heavily populated northern counties, which have always been regarded as the progressive areas of the state. For instance, ‘Camden County approved the amendment by the widest‐ margin, 14,956‐votes, an unekpected.rvictpry.,An aide to Assemblywomah'Mary'Keating Croce, a Camden County Democrat reelected on Tuesday, said women's groups in the county were angered over what they regarded as a discriminv tory attitude toward Mrs: Croce by the editors of The Camden Courier Post. As a result, the women picketed the offices of the newspaper and worked hard to achieve passage of the amendment. Other Counties Approved Other counties approving the measure were Atlantic, Burlington, Gloucester and Mercer, all in South Jersey. Hudson County was the only northern county providing a “yes” majority. There, voters followed the Democratic Party line, approving the proposal by nearly 5,000 votes. In the rural counties of Cape ‘ May, Cumberland and Hunterdon, the amendment lost by slight margins, causing one proamendment leader to question whether raising the issues in the campaign had been good political strategy at all. Today, proponents of the amendment were reluctant to analyze the remains of the battle. “I bate to even think about it, but I'll guess we'll have to determine where we went wrong,” said Judith Knee, a coordinator of the campaign. Over‐all, she said, the proamendment forces had underestimated the impact on voters of arguments concerning family life, alimony, support, and child custody, and had prematurely discounted what they called the opposition's “irresponsible claims” concerning homosemiality and common toilets Different Difficulties As for the large defeats in the four key counties, she said, no one reason could be cited, but that each had its own sets of difficulties. For instance, in Union County, where the “no” vote exceeded the: “yes” tally by 20,752 votes, State Senator Thomas G. Dunn, who is also the Mayor of Elizabeth; had • stumped relentlessly for defeat of the amendment In addition, in the closing week of the campaign, a ‘strong Right to Life movement came out with a heated attack on the:amendment's effect, on liberalizing abortions, a charge vehemently denied by proponents: In Passaic County,.. the proponents had Virtually‐nO campaign organization, Mrs. Knee said. The county rejected the amendment by 20,917 votes. It is a predominantly, blue‐collar area and the center of wellorganized conservative opposition to taxes in the state: Irregularities Charged The magnitude of the loss in Essex County was particularly bitter for supporters of the amendment. “We believe there were election irregularities in Essex County,” Mrs. Knee said, “and I don't understand why it should have encountered so much trouble there.” The proposal lost by 13;421 votes. Morris County,which defeated the amendment by 12,181 votes, was the center of strong opposition organized by the League of Housewives. Other counties contributing sizable majorities to the antiamendment forces were Monmouth, Ocean and Middlesex Counties, in central Jersey. Bergen County, where the amendment had been expected to pass by a healthy majority, defeated the proposal by 470 votes, All told, the anti‐amendment forces were as bewildered by the victory as their counterparts. “I don't know what made our campaign catch on in the big counties,” said Mrs. Inez Franko, chairman of the Citizens’ Alliance to Stop E.R.A. “It just seemed that women got fired up in some areas and got to work.”"
Foes Aim at Defeat Of Federal E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/09/archives/foes-aim-at-defeat-of-federal-era.html,"TRENTON—Elated by victory at the polls last week, leaders of the campaign that helped to defeat the state's Equal Rights Amendment have begun a drive to repeal New Jersey's endorsement of the Federal Equal Rights wide spectrum of proposed Amendment and to attack a political legislation they regard as liberal. ‐ State Senator Thomas G. Dunn, Democrat of Union County and a leader in the anti‐E.R.A. movement, already has ordered the drafting of legislation designed to rescind New Jersey's approval of the Federal measure. He is expected to push hard for its passage'duffng the forthcoming session of the Legislature. “The Equal Rights Amendment was only the beginning,” said Inez Franko, chairman of the Citizens’ Alliance to. Stop E.R.A. “We have a big job ahead of us and a mandate from the electorate to carry it out.” Mrs. Franka said that the alliance, which consists primarily of “housewives who have been thrust into the public eye,” would meet soon to outline strategy. High on the list of priorities is a litany of issues that political conservatives have traditionally espoused, but with limited success. These include opposition to subsidized day‐care centers, proabortion legislation, penal reform and all tax measures. What They Will Oppose Specifically, Mrs. Franko said that her group would oppose Governor Byrne's proposed penal code, which revises many criminal statutes, any income‐tax proposal and the implementation of the “thorough and efficient” education law that is designed to equalize spending in the state's 607 school districts. Defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment in New Jersey by some 60,000 votes stunned the state's pro‐women activists. “There's no question that the election was a major setback for the women's movement in the state,” said Eileen Thornton, president of the Women's Equity Action League. “Our job now is to exand and strengthen the women's movement.” In addition to defeat of the amendment, the number of women in the Assembly was reduced from six to five. Amon.=t’ those going down to defeat were Betty Wilson, Democrat of Union County, and Gertrude Berman, Democrat of Monmouth County: both are leading proponents of women's rights. Election observers view the referendum result as resounding repudiation of the radical feminist movement and an equally strong mandate against change. From the outset, pro‐E.R.A. leaders had privately expressed fear that the amendment would be defeated. Moreover, State House observers regard the amendment's del‐eat in two liberal states—New York and New Jersey—as a possible death knell for ratification of the Federal amendment. Only 34 of the necessary 38 states have ratified the proposal. Death Knell Sounded? Essentially, the stop‐E.R.A. campaign succeeded in convincing women that the proposal would threaten family life as it now exists, and that they would in fact, lose rights in divorce cases through alimony, child custody and support. A major debate in the campaign centered on the right of women not to work, with opponents charging that women would be forced to go to work because their husbands would not have to support them. In addition, claims that the proposal would lead to a unisex society, widespread homosexuality and abortion on demand alarmed voters enough to cast doubt on a “yes” vote. “If in doubt, vote no,” said one antiamendment flyer. Despite the strong counterclaims by amendment proponents and denials by lawyers that the proposal would threaten family life, the prbE.R.A. forces were never able to convince voters of the amendment's alleged benefits. The State Constitution prohibits bringing the proposal to a vote for another three years."
Judge Rules Out Removal Of the Quinlan Respirator,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/judge-rules-out-removal-of-the-quinlan-respirator-court-rules-out.html,"MORRISTOWN, N.J., Nov. 10 —Judge Robert Muir Jr. today refused to authorize the removal of the respirator sustaining the life of Karen Anne Quinlan, saying the decision was a medical one and noting that the woman's attending physicians were opposed to disconnecting the machine. “The judicial conscience and morality involved in consider Excerpts in Quinlan decision appear on Page 62. ing whether the Court should authorize Karen Quinlan's removal from the respirator are inextricably involved with the nature of medical science and the role of the physician in our society and his duty to his patient,” the Superior Court judge said. “There is a duty to continue the life‐assisting apparatus if, within the treating physician's’ opinion, it should be done,” he added. Miss Quinlan, who is 21 years old, has been in a coma for nearly seven months. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph T. Quinlan, filed an unusual guardianship petition in Judge Muir's court in September, asking that Mr. Quinlan be appointed her guardian for the express purpose of authorizing the withdrawing of “all extraordinary means of sustaining the vital processes of his daughter.” Miss Quinlan is legally and medically alive, according to the Court, but has lost all ability to function on a sapient, human level. Because there is no reasonable hope for her recovery, her parents, after months of prayer and bedside vigil at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, asked the attending physicians to remove the respirator, and then went to court when they turned down. The Quinlans said this evening that they did not regret having gone through the ordeal of the court trial, which stirred debate around the world, “because we did everything we could for Karen, medically and spiritually,’ and we came to court as a last resort.” The parents refused to comment directly on the decision and said they had not yet made up their minds whether they would appeal. Judge Muir handed down his decision “with prejudice,” which means that the Quinlans cannot replead the case in State. Superior Court on different grounds. They may, however, appeal the decision to a higher state court. “I think the judge showed a certain amount of courage,” Mr. Quinlan said during a brief, news conference held in a hearing room of the County Board of Taxation across the street from the courthouse. “But he didn't go all the way and so I'm disappointed.” Mother ‘Just Prayed’ Julia Ann Quinlan, speaking in the calm, even voice that she has used throughout the weeks of the case, said, “I just prayed that I would be able to accept whatever the court decision would be.” The 44‐page decision was given to lawyers for the family, the hospital, the attending physicians, the Morris County Prosecutor, the State Attorney General and the guardian for Miss Quinlan, during a closed‐door court session that began at 1:15 P.M. Coburn's Statements Recalled Paul W. Armstrong, who acted as counsel for the parents without charge, then met privately with the Quinlans. He explained] the judge's decision and the court order based on it. The order authorized Daniel R. Coburn, a Morristown lawyer who acted as Miss Quinlan's guardian for the recent court hearing, to continue as the guardian of “her person,” while Mr. Quinlan was named guardian of her property. The parents objected through Mr. Armstrong, according to some of those at the closeddoor session, because they remembered Mr. Coburn's statements during the court hearing that it would be better if their daughter “went out fighting” on an operating table rather than die through removal of the respirator. The parents indicated they were afraid their daughter would be used for medical experimentation, until Judge Muir assured them that Mr. Coburn would not be authorized to initiate any medical procedures for their daughter but would be available for consultation with the attending physicians. Judge Muir described Mr. Quinlan as a “very sincere, moral, ethical and religious person,” in explaining why he did not name him guardian for his daughter's person. “He [Mr. Quinlan] obviously anguished over his decision to terminate what he considers the extraordinary care of his daughter. That anguish would be continued and magnified by the inner conflicts he would have if he were required to concur in the day‐by‐day decisions on the future care of his daughter. These conflicts would have to offset his decision‐making processes,” the Court said. Constitutional Right Cited In pressing the Quinlans’ request in court, Mr. Armstrong argued for the existence of a constitutional right to die, based on recognized rights of freedom, of religion, privacy and self‐determination. In advancing the religious arguments, Mr. Armstrong said that the Quinlans were Roman Catholics who believed in life after death and that they simply wanted their daughter to return to her “natural state” by removing her from the respirator, so that she might pass on to the next “more perfect” phase of her life. Judge Muir said he was bound to Iimit his considerations to a person's temporal—not spiritual—needs. He said that turning off the respirator “is not something in her best interest, in a temporal sense, and it is in a temporal sense, that I must operate, whether I believe in life after death or not.” “The single most important, temporal quality Karen Anne Quinlan has is Iife,” he said.] “This Court will not authorize that life to be taken away from her.” Judge Muir also said “there is no constitutional right to die that can be asserted by a parent for his incompetent adult child.” Hyland's Arguments Cited And, although he recognized the primacy of the physicians’ judgment in making decisions, such as those affecting Miss Quinlan's life, Judge Muir indicated that removal or the respirator might have violated state homicide statutes, as was argued by William F. Hyland, the State Attorney General, and Donald G. Collester Jr., the Morris County Prosecutor. Although he dealt at greater length with the constitutional issues raised in the civil suit, Judge Muir noted that, under New Jersey law, “the intentional taking of another's life, regardless of motive, is sufficient grounds for conviction... It is a reasonable construction that the law of this state would preclude the removal of Karen Quinlan from the respirator.” Father Thomas Trapasso, the pastor of Our Lady of the Lake Church in Mount Arlington and the family's spiritual adviser, accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Quinlan as he did on each of the five days of the court hearing. Father Trapasso, who first advised the parents that removal of “extraordinary” medical care from a patient who has no hope of recovery is not morally objectionable, said today's decision, which spoke of society's interest in preserving life, shows that the time has come “for a national re‐evaluation of the value of human ilife.” “Last year 892,000 lives were swept out by abortion and no one seems to care,” he said. “We must reassess our attitude toward life across the board,’ for the born as well as the unborn.” ‘No One Enjoyed Case’ Mr. Hyland said the medical profession should be “considerably reassured” by Judge Muir's ruling that the decision in the case was properly won for the physicians. “That's where it belongs for the time being,” the Attorney General said. But he added that the government must now come to grips with the complex moral and legal problems posed by rapid advances in medical technology. Mr. Collester said that none of the defense lawyers in the case had experienced any “sense of satisfaction” because of their compassion for the Quinlan family. “No one enjoyed the case,” he said, “but it has opened a dialogue that hopefully will lead to some answers.” Ralph Porzio, the lawyer for Drs. Robert Morse and Arshad Javed, who attend Miss QuinIlan, called for an international conference “of the best medical and legal minds available” to draw up guidelines for deciding the problem raised by the Quinlan case."

Judge Muir described Mr. Quinlan as a “very sincere, moral, ethical and religious person,” in explaining why he did not name him guardian for his daughter's person. “He [Mr. Quinlan] obviously anguished over his decision to terminate what he considers the extraordinary care of his daughter. That anguish would be continued and magnified by the inner conflicts he would have if he were required to concur in the day‐by‐day decisions on the future care of his daughter. These conflicts would have to offset his decision‐making processes,” the Court said. Constitutional Right Cited In pressing the Quinlans’ request in court, Mr. Armstrong argued for the existence of a constitutional right to die, based’ on recognized rights of freedom, of religion, privacy and self‐determination. In advancing the religious arguments, Mr. Armstrong said that the Quinlans were Roman Catholics who believed in life after death and that they simply wanted their daughter to return to her “natural state” by removing her from the respirator, so that she might pass on to the next “more perfect” phase of her life. Judge Muir said he was bound to Iimit his considerations to a person's temporal—not spiritual—needs. He said that turning off the respirator “is not something in her best interest, in a temporal sense,’ and it is in a temporal sense, that I must operate, whether I believe in life after death or not.” “The single most important, temporal quality Karen Anne Quinlan has is Iife,” he said.] “This Court will not authorize that life to be taken away from her.” Judge Muir also said “there is no constitutional right to die that can be asserted by a parent for his incompetent adult child.” Hyland's Arguments Cited And, although he recognized the primacy of the physicians’ judgment in making decisions, such as those affecting Miss Quinlan's life, Judge Muir indicated that removal or the respirator might have violated state homicide statutes, as was argued by William F. Hyland, the State Attorney General, and Donald G. Collester Jr., the Morris County Prosecutor. Although he dealt at greater length with the constitutional issues raised in the civil suit, Judge Muir noted that, under New Jersey law, “the intentional taking of another's life, regardless of motive, is sufficient grounds for conviction... It is a reasonable construction that the law of this state would preclude the removal of Karen Quinlan from the respirator.” Father Thomas Trapasso, the pastor of Our Lady of the Lake Church in Mount Arlington and the family's spiritual adviser, accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Quinlan as he did on each of the five days of the court hearing. Father Trapasso, who first advised the parents that removal of “extraordinary” medical care from a patient who has no hope of recovery is not morally objectionable, said today's decision, which spoke of society's interest in preserving life, shows that the time has come “for a national re‐evaluation of the value of human ilife.” “Last year 892,000 lives were swept out by abortion and no one seems to care,” he said. “We must reassess our attitude toward life across the board,’ for the born as well as the unborn.” ‘No One Enjoyed Case’ Mr. Hyland said the medical profession should be “considerably reassured” by Judge Muir's ruling that the decision in the case was properly won for the physicians. “That's where it belongs for the time being,” the Attorney General said. But he added that the government must now come to grips with the complex moral and legal problems posed by rapid advances in medical technology. Mr. Collester said that none of the defense lawyers in the case had experienced any “sense of satisfaction” because of their compassion for the Quinlan family. “No one enjoyed the case,” he said, “but it has opened a dialogue that hopefully will lead to some answers.” Ralph Porzio, the lawyer for Drs. Robert Morse and Arshad 1Javed, who attend Miss QuinIlan, called for an international conference “of the best medical and legal minds available” to draw up guidelines for deciding the problem raised by the Quinlan case."
Summary of Actions by Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/12/archives/summary-of-actions-by-supreme-court.html,"WASHINGTON. Nov. 11—The Supreme Court, with ailing Justice William O. Douglas participating in some cases but not in others took the following actions today: ABORTION It made clear that it did not intend its landmark proabortion rulings of 1973 to prevent prosecutions of nonphysicians under antiabortion laws. In a three‐page unsigned opinion in Connecticut v. Menillo, No. 74‐1569, the Court vacated a ruling by the Connecticut Supreme Court that had set aside the conviction of a Hartford man for performing an abortion. The Connecticut court had said that the Supreme Court's 1973 rulings invalidated the state's antiabortion law as a whole, and that nondoctors such as Patrick Menillo, who performed the abortion for $400 in a motel room, could thus not be The Supreme Court said today, however, that the rationale of its 1973 ruling, forbidding states to restrict a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in the first trimester, was “predicated upon the first trimester abortion being as safe for the mother as normal childbirth at term.” This predicate, the Court said, “holds true only if the abortion is performed by medically competent personnel under conditions insuring maximum safety for the woman.” Justice Byron R. White noted he concurred only in the result of the case, sending it back to the Connecticut court for a determination AIRLINES In a case involving Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, the Court agreed to consider whether a would‐be airline passenger may recover monetary damages from an airline for being bumped from a flight on which the passenger had confirmed reservations. “Dumping” results from airlines’ overbooking flights to lessen the number of empty seats at take‐off caused by no‐shows. Legally the question is whether the Federal Aviation Act preserves or limits Common law tort claims for such practi‐ Mr. Nader sued after being humped from tin Allegheny flight from Washington to Hartford in 1972. He recovered $10 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages in the District Court, but the appellate court reversed and sent the case back for a determination by the Civil Aeronautics Board on whether bumping was an unfair practice (Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., No.75455). ATOMIC ENERGY In an unsigned per curiam opinion, with a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas the Court reversed a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit regarding the location of a commercial nuclear powered electric generating plant proposed for the south shore of Lake Michigan in Indiana. The appeals court had set aside approval for the plant on the ground that the Atomic Energy Commission had not followed its own regulations governing distance of plants from population cen‐ The Supreme Court, however, said that the appellate court “erred in rejecting the agency's interpretation of its own regulations.” It sent the case hack for consideration of other issues not decided by the appellate court (Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League of America, no. 75‐4). CRIMINAL The Court agreed to consider the constitutionality of the so‐called “two‐bier” system in which defendants accused of certain offenses are tried first by a judge without a jury and then, if convicted and if the defendant wishes, given a new trial with a jury. In the case that the Court accepted Ludwig v. Massachusetts, No. 75‐377, Massachusetts's highest court rejected a defendant's challenge to the state's twotier system. Over an angry dissent written by Justice William J. Brennan and joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Douglas, the Court declined to consider two wiretapping cases involving the question of the extent to which law enforcement must “minimize” the interception of communications (Bynum v. United States, No. 74‐1445; Birnbaum v. United States, No. 74‐6411.). News articel, Page 24 PUBLIC UTILITIES The Court agreed to review a case involving the extent of the Federal Power Commission's power to remedy anticompetitive practices by companiesi it regulates. The issue in the case, Federal Power Commission v. Conway Corporation No. 75‐342, is whether the F.P.C., in regulating wholesale rates, may seek to remedy anticompetitive practices involving retail rates. Conway, a wholesale customer of a power and light company, sought to have the F.P.C. reject a wholesale rate increase by the company on the ground that the new rate would squeeze Conway out of retail competition. The F.P.C. contended that it had no such power, but a lower Federal court disagreed. News article, Page 68 SCHOOLS The Court agreed to consider whether private schools may discriminate on the basis of race — specifically, whether 42 U.S.C. 1981, the re‐enactment of the Reconstruction Era civil rights law, prohibits racial discrimination by private schools (Run‐ yon v. McCrary No. 75‐62; Fairfax‐Brewster School, Inc v. Gonzales, No. 75‐66; Southern Independent School Association v. McCrary, No. 75‐278; McCrary v. Runyon, No. 75‐306). News article, Pane It also agreed to review a Federal appeals court decision refusing to release school authorities in Pasadena, Calif., from a 1970 school desegregation order (Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, No. 75‐164). The Court declined, however to review several other desegregation cases: School District of Omaha v. United States, No. 75‐270; Ferguson Reorganized School Destrict R‐2 v. United States, No. 75‐202; Berkely School District, v. United States, No. 75‐214; Kinloch School District v. United States. No. 75‐215. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. would have reviewed one issue in No. 75‐214 involving a court's power to fix tax rate. VOTING RIGHTS The Court agreed to consider whether the tightly knit community of Hasidic Jews in the Williamsburgh section of Brooklyn should be allowed to be a single election district (United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, No. 75104)."
Douglas Quits Supreme Court; Ford Hails 36½‐Year Service,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/13/archives/douglas-quits-supreme-court-ford-hails-3612year-service.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov.12—William O. Douglas retired from the Supreme Court today because of his failing health, ending a record 36½ term on the Court as one of the nation's most adamant—and controversial—defenders of the liberal view of the Constitution. His retirement was announced at 5 P.M., several Douglas and Ford letters, Burger statement, Page 60. hours after he had sat in the Court's marble‐columned courtroom listening to part of the day's oral arguments. Statements of praise came immediately from President Ford, Justices of the Court and others. The retirement produced immediate speculation on whom Mr. Ford would appoint as successor—and on the impact of the retirement on the decisions of the Court. The President was reported by high Administration sources tonight to be actively considering the appointment of woman, the first woman Justice in the Court's history. It was widely expected as well that he would select someone of a far more conservative philosophy than Justice Douglas. [Page 60.] The 77‐year‐old Justice notified President Ford of his retirement in a letter, saying: “It was my hope, when I returned to Washington in Sep‐ tember, that I would be able to continue to participate in the work of the Supreme Court. “l have learned, however, after these last two months, that it would be inadvisable for me to attempt to carry on the duties required of a member of I the Court. I have been bothered with incessant and demanding pain which depletes my energy to the extent that have been unable to shoulder my full share of the burden.” President Ford, who in 1970 as a Representative led the last of three abortive efforts to impeach Justice Douglas replied by letter: “Your distinguished years of service are unequaled in all the history of the Court.” The President said that he had read the Justice's letter with “profound personal sympathy,” and expressed “on behalf of all our countrymen this nation's great gratitude for your more than 36 years as a member of the Supreme Court.” Justice Douglas was consistently on the so‐called “liberal end” throughout his long years on the Court. If President Ford picks a more conservative Justice, as expected, the Court's philosophical make‐up will thus obviously change. But Justice Douglas was also, through those years the great dissenter—indeed, he was re‐ vered by a generation of law students for those dissents. The dissents were sometimes adopted by the Court in iater opinions and thus had great impact; at the same time, however, he was not considered a leader for the other Justices. Also the Court has already undergone a shift, with the liberal majority often observed in the Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren giving way to more mixed picture. It is often now described as conservative and nonactivist. That description is rejected by many analysts because the Court, under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, has issued sonic exceptional activist opinions such as the one on abortion, and its voting blocs are not as solid as had been predicted, except in certain areas of criminal law. At the same time, however, the Court has a decidedly different tone—while it has not retreated from the hold decisions of the Warren Court years, neither has it expanded. on them very much, if it all. And the views of Justice Douglas have for some time been minority ones. His retirement is thus not likely to lead to any dramatic shift in the Court's direction on various legal issues. The impact, instead, is likely to be seen in other ways. In very close cases his absence may cause a different decision. On the death penalty, for instance, the Court's last ruling was 5 to 4, with Justice Douglas in the majority, outlawing capital punishment as then practiced in America. Also, in First Amendment cases, his distinct philosophy will no longer he expressed. On the subject of obscenity, for instance, he had a standard oneparagraph dissenting opinion, in which he invariably noted that ill line with his definition of the First Amendment's free Speech rights, he would summarily reverse obscenity convictions. His absence will also probably have an effect in a far more subtle way, less easy to discern. For more than any other Justice, he had become something of a familiar institution, both to the other Justices and to lawyers and law students across the country, known to all, among other things, for his absolute‐support of and belief in his interpretation of the Constitution and especially of the Bill of Rights. Chief Justice Burger, often at odds ideologically with Justice Douglas, issued a statement that the Justice's long service on the Court ‘sets a record that may never be equaled.” The retirement, he said, brings to dos a career unique in the annals of the Court.” Associate Justice Potter Stewart said: “William O. Douglas stands uniquely alone in the history of our Court and our wintry. As one of his junior colleagues, I have long ad. mired his intellect, his independence, his energy and his clsion. I salute him now as ran of extraordinary courage.” [In a brief telephone interview, Justice Douglas's wife, Cathleen, was quoted by United Press International as saying, “I am sad that he's retired in the sense that feel that his contribution to the Court is a very necessary one, but on the personal level I'm very happy because think this will give him the freedom and leisure to recuperate.”] Justice Douglas has been in ?? health since he suffered troke last New Year's Eve, tie missed several months of ast year's Court term as a re. ailt.

The other Justices were known to have decided that there was little they could do but wait to see what developed.

Nutrition's Role in Learning,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/16/archives/nutritions-role-in-learning.html,"The highest priority in American education today should be the establishment of a national program of nutrition and early childhood education. Point of View It may seem strange for a university president to make this assertion. While I do not underestimate the complexity and danger of the problems that threaten higher education, to make their solution our highest priority would be to confuse the importance of cure with the importance of prevention. One of the most substantial problems facing higher education is the drive to convert colleges and universities into remedial institutions. This is a perversion of the purposes of higher education, and one that may eventually prove fatal to it. But it is the inevitable consequence of our having ignored basic educational priorities. We must reassess these priorities so as to prevent the occurrence of gratuitous retardation that is, of retardation that results, not from genetic malformation or other unavoidable causes, but rather from social neglect. In order to do this, we must understand the importance of nutrition, especially the nutrition of the fetus. It may he that a society that has opted for abortion on demand may have already foreclosed the question of prenatal nutrition. For if theiv is no restraint upon the freedom intentionally to destroy a fetus then perhaps there is not even an obligation on anyone to avoid destroying or merely damaging it through inadvertence. The latter view would seem to follow from the former. But while many of us have become used to the idea of destroying the fetus, few of us—and here the instincts triumph—can accept the idea of damaging, torturing or abusing one. Most of us would hold that the decision not to have an abortion carries with it the responsibility of the mother for the other life within her body. Thalidomide deformed hundreds of infants: Mothers addicted to heroin give birth to heroin addicts, and evidence accumulates of the serious damage inflicted on the fetus by alcoholic mothers. Malnutrition, involving the presence of harmful drugs, is seriously damaging and frequently destructive of the developing child. Undernutrition — the absence of essential elements—can be just as harmful. There has long been persuasive evidence of this, and the recent release of an extensive study by Prof. Robert B. Livingston and his associates at the University of California ‘must remove any ‘lingering doubts. They concluded that as many as one million mothers in the United States suffer from malnutrition serious enough to endanger their babies. But it is not prenatal undernutrition alone that can cause such damage. The University of California study also estimates that 1.1 million infants and children in the country are suffering from undernourishment severe enough to hamper their brain development. Because the majority of individuals handicapped by malnutrition may still fall within “normal bounds,” it may be questioned whether any loss has been suffered. If one focuses on the individual, only the most severe instances of retardation may be provable. But one enlarges the scope of investigation to compare the children of alcoholic mothers or undernourished mothers with the children of those who have been soundly nourished, the loss becomes obvious. It is a gratuitous retardation, imposed on those children whose prenatal and early nutrition has been defective. Only a society that has lost its respect for human life and its concern for the fulfillment of each individual can be indifferent to this retardation. If we are to avoid such retardation, we must insure that no mother: either through poverty or through ignorance, mal‘nourishes her children in utero. We can do this by establishing a comprehensive national program of nutritional support and education. It will not help if mothers can afford to nourish themselves and children unics they know how to do so. In our society the food industry seems deliberately bent as a matter of perverse economic principle on making all‐grain breakfasts such as oatmeal or whole wheat gruel a memory and replacing them with trashy concoctions variously confected from sugar and fraudulent “natural” ingredients. It is the obligation of educators at all levels—in schools, colleges, institu tions, social agencies and medical in stitutions—to provide this education. It is the obligation of society to see that no carrying mother or young child is undernourished because of financial need. The cost of such a program would be high, clearly in the billions of dollars, but we should compare this to the immense cost we now pay, spiritual no less than fiscal, for gratuitous retardation. For a citizen suffering from retarda tion imposes immense costs upon So ciety. If he is educable, he will be more expensive and difficult to educate than if he were sot retarded. If his retardation is sufficiently obvious to be recognized, he will require special education. If it is not, he will proceed through conventional schools posing an insoluble problem, possibly all the way to college. .Even if educated, he is unlikely to make any substantial contribution to the advancement of society. He will be doing very well to support himself, and if he cannot, he is likely to impose heavy custodial costs on the society. At best he will be a welfare client all his life. If his retardation is mild enough not to be diagnosed, he will go through life failing at the simplest tasks at best marginally employable, and perhaps If his retardation is gratuitous, all these costs—including the loss of human potential—are avoidable. If educators reawaken and reinforce our instinctive sense of the preciousness of human life, our society will not willingly allow any of its members to be retarded.

CONTRACEPTION USE IS UNCHANGED HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/16/archives/contraception-use-is-unchanged-here.html,"The legalization or abortion in the state has not been accompanied by a decline in the use of contraception—at least not in New York City, according to the findings of a new study. The study indicated that the 14 percent increase in legal abortions performed in New York City between 1971 and 1973 was accompanied by 7.5 percent decrease in the pregnancy rate among New York women. According to the author of the study, Dr. Christopher Tietze, senior consultant for the Population Council, these statistics suggest “more general and/or more effective” practive of contraception. His findings are described in the current issue of Family Perspectives, published by Planned Parenthood ‐ World Population. Dr. Tietze pointed out that pregnancy rates in the city dropped from 138.8 per 1,000 women of reproductive age in 1971 to 128.4 per 1,000 in 1973. ‘Pregnancy rates derived by adding together the numbers of ‘live births, miscarriages and legal abortions, declined substantially in all age groups except among teen‐agers, according to Dr. Tietze's analysis. However, the data do indicate that teen‐agers remain lax about contraceptive use either because they do not have ready access to an effective method or because they fail to take advantage of such methods. Planned Parenthood clinics and family planning clinics in many ‘hospitals provide contraceptives to all who ask for them, regardess of age or ability to obtain parental consent."
A Summary of Actions Taken by the United States Supreme Court on a Variety of Matters,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/18/archives/a-summary-of-actions-taken-by-the-united-states-supreme-court-on-a.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 17—The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION It agreed to decide whether states may forbid single women under the age of 18 to get abortions without the consent of both parents or, if one parent refuses consent, without getting a court order permitting the abortion. In the cases the Court agreed to review, Belloti v. Baird, No. 75‐73, and Hunerwadel v. Baird, No. 75‐109, a threeJudge Federal court ruled 2 to 1 that the Massachusetts abortion law requiring such consent was unconstitutional. The cases arose when young woman, given the name “Mary Moe” for the litigation, asked the court to allow her to have an abortion without the required consent. The two‐judge majority noted, “Her father had told her, in connection with the pregnancy of a contemporary friend, that if that happened to her he would evict her and kill her boy friend.” The state is appealing the court's decision in favor of the girl, arguing that the law accommodates both the rights of young women and the rights of parents. ARMED FORCES Following the suggestion of Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, the Court declined to review a ruling by the Court of Claims dismissing a suit seeking damages for the death of a 17‐year‐old serviceman in iVetnam. The youth's parents had brought the case, arguing that the reason they consented to their son's elistment — consent that was required because of his age — was that they believed he was protected by a Defense Department minimum‐age limit on the assignment of a soldier to combat The Court of Claims said that the suit raised a tort claim rather than a contract claim, and that it had no jurisdiction over such torts. Mr. Bork argued: “The regulation involved here merely provides that individuals who have not attained their 18th birthday are not eligible for assignment to a hostile fire zone. It in no way gives an individual under 18 who is sent to a combat zone in violation of the regulation a right to compensation for the Army's failure to follow the regulation.” (Bibbs v. United States, No. 75‐274.) CRIMINAL Over the angry dissent of Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, and a separate dissent by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court reversed a lower Federal court ruling on the question of the test of unconstitutional vagueness. The lower court had found that Tennessee's “crimes against nature” statute did not give adequate notice that it applied to the act of cunnilingus and had thus reversed a conviction based on that act (Rose v. Locke, No. 741451). News Article Page 20 The Court also reversed a holding by the New York Court of Appeals that a defendant waives his double jeopardy claim, of being prosecuted twice for the same offense, when he pleads guilty to the charges in the second prosecution (Vienna v. New York, No. 75‐5401). The Court sent the case back to the New York court for a determination of the double jeopardy claim on the merits. Justice Brennan stated that he would have reversed the conviction “outright,” without remand. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist would have heard argument on the case. At the urging of the Solicitor General, the Court agreed to consider a question involving a prosecutor's duty to provide the defense with exculpatory material: Whether the defendant is deprived of due process when the prosecutor fails to hand over possible exculpatory evidence when he believes it immaterial and where fhe defense, while aware of th possibility that such evidence exists, has not requested it (United States v. Agur, No. 75‐491). DOCTORS The court affirmed without comment a lower Federal court ruling that upheld as constitutional the system of a nationwide “medical utilization review” created to monitor doctors’ and hospitals’ treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients (Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Mathews, No. 75‐361). News Article Pam ELECTIONS The Court affirmed without comment two lower Federal court rulings each by a three‐judge court, regarding requirements for candidates. In one the lower court upheld the Arkansas requirement that candidates for city director, in cities that have a city ‐ manager form of government, be at least 30 years old. The state has no such requirement for candidates for city councilmen, in cities that have a mayorcouncil form of government. Two youthful would‐be candidates challenged the age requirement as a denial of equal protection of the laws (Whitehead v. Westbrook, No. 75‐168.) In Bush v. Sebesta, No. 75‐497, the lower court had sustained certain Florida provisions regarding getting place on the ballot. These were a single 21‐day period in which to gather nominating petitions; a requirement that the candidate get signatures equal to 5 percent of the registered voters of his or her party in the district, whether it is a single member district or a multimember district; and a filing feel equal to 5 percent of the salary of the office sought, most of it to he given to the party. The court declined to review a case in which a Federal court had struck down the Illinois requirement that to get on the ballot a “new party”—one that got less than 5 percent of the vote in the preceding election—must get 25,000 signatures, a total that may not include more than 13,000 per county (State Board of Elections of Illinois v. Communist Party of Illinois,‐ No 75:474). OBSCENITY Over the dissents of Justices Brennan,, Stewart and Marshall, the Court vacated a lower Federal court ruling that had struck down as unconstitutional a new Indiana obscenity law. The Court remanded the case for “further consideration” by the Federal court of an earlier Supreme Court ruling that limited the power of the Federal courts to interfere with state proceedings (Sendak v. Nihiser, No. 74‐1165). SCHOOL DESEGREGATION Over the dissents of Justice Rehnquist, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., the Court affirmed without comment a lower Federal court ruling that could ultimately lead to busing children between the City of Wilmington Del., and its suburbs. (Buchanan v. Evans, No. 74‐1418). News Article Page 17 The Court declined to review a Federal appeals court ruling that required the development of a more extensive desegregation plan for the schools of Montgomery, Ala., than a Federal district court had agreed to (Carr v. Montgomery County board of Education, No. 75‐476). SEX DISCRIMINATION The Court ruled that states may not refuse to provide unemployment compensation to all women in the third trimester of pregnancy, and the first six weeks after birth, on the presumption that all such women are unable to work (Turner v Dept. of Employment Security, NO. 74‐312). Justice Rehnquist dissented; Chief Justice Burger and Justi Blackmun would have heard oral arguments on the case. News Article Page 1"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/18/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Your editorial of Oct. 18 on the Ford Administration's plan to pull the U.S. out of the International Labor Organi zation and I.L.O. Director General Blanchard's succinct rejoinder of Nov. 4 bespeak well the folly of our labor and foreign affairs leaders’ scheme. For the U.S. to resign from the I.L.O. because the A.F.L.‐C.I0. reportedly objects to the I.L.O. acceptance of an observer last June from the Palestinian Liberation Organization is both, hypocritical and shortsighted. It is the act of throwing the baby out with the bath water. In transmitting to Congress the annual President's report on participation in the U.N., Ford recently said the U.S.. remained firm in support of Charter principles (news story Nov. 4). Running home with the marbles after losing a round of play is hardly a stand of firm support. Israel, after all, is staying in the I.L.O. In 1965, at the White House Conference on International Cooperation, George Meany, George Harrison, Walter Reuther and Joseph Beime all recommended “that the U.S. Government take steps to support and maintain the tripartite character of the International Labor Organization and to strengthen U.S. participation.” Of Presidents and Teams To the Editor:. In a recent interview, President Ford was reported as stating, “For me to do the job as well as I possibly can, need a feeling of comfort within an organization—no tension, complete cohesion.” One would have imagined that after Watergate. Mr. Ford and the country would have learned the terrible lesson of being surrounded, with associates who are selected for their teamwork and unwillingness to argue forcibly views contrary to those of President Ford. Moreover, I submit that the essence of democracy is not being on one's knees and supinely agreeing with the President • of the United States, the presidents of any and all our business firms, unions, universities, religious organizations, scientific foundations, art schools, etc., etc.—all just because you are a member of the “bosses’ team.” Those who have decided, and they are apparently a multitude, that team cohesion is the trick about American Labor's commitment as stated just a decade ago must be shallow indeed. In that decade, the U.S. adopted the Occupational Safety and Health Act—the most far‐reaching provisions for worker environmental protection known. Will the A.F.1...‐C.r.0. press like reforms in other nations through the I.L.O.? Withdrawal from this unique U.N. specialized agency must be viewed as labor's renunciation of its international brotherhood of workers and of the legacy of Samuel Gompers, who conceived and helped, realize the creation of the I.L.O. Since the days of the League of Nations, as Gompers hoped, the I.L.O. has raised a common global standard for worker, employer and government. Its constitution states that world peace depends on international social and economic justice: If interdependence is readily acknowledged today, why play fast and loose with a well‐established avenue for stabilizing that interdependence? We renounce both a global marketplace of ideas and a proven path for international cooperation if we quit the I.L.O. The greatest tragedy in such a course may be the economic, political and moral hurt we inflict upon ourselves. NICHOLAS A. ROBINSON New York, Nov. 4, 1975 society ought to take a week off and give themselves a brush‐up course on American history. They ought to include a side trip to Plato's “Republic” and that wonderful Socrates, a nearperfect nonteam player. Mr. Ford may not know it, but we have not as yet in this country become one great big happy football team. GEORGE F. ACKERNIAN Emerson, N. J., Nov. 10, 1975 The E.R.A.'s Weaknesses To the Editor: I would like to call attention to factor in the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment which I believe has not been fully appreciated. The amendment did not go far enough. Its terms were too platitudinous to win widespread support and too vague to put to rest reasonable fears. The amendment was drafted years ago when the law relating to civil rights had not developed to its present dimension. Its language was defective in two respects. First, it‐applies only to discrimination by public bodies. Recently legislatures and courts have extended some civil rights protection to discrimination ‐by private persons and organizations. In fact, Section 11 of Article of the State Constitution prohibits private persons and organizations from discriminating because of race, religion and national origin. It would mak& more sense to amend that section of the constitution by adding “sex.” The second problem with the. E.R.A. was that it only applied to existing civil rights. Many practices that keep women in their secondary status are not likely to be outlawed‐ as a denial of rights for men; specifically, those relating to pregnancy and child caii. Furthermore, there are areas whke men need additional protection, e.g. freedom of a father from mandatory overtime. It would be more construe.tive to outlaw practices where sex or parenthood puts anyone at a disadvantage. For instance, we need the right to substitute equivalent education and experience in licensing and certification requirements, the right to nonsex‐stereotyped employment, the right non‐sexist textbooks and guidance. The weaknesses of the amendment remind me of the problem the women's movement had in eliminating oppressive abortion laws. When the change was presented as a reform bill which left decision‐making to male doctors, judges and hospital committees, it failed to generate widespread support among women. On the other hand, more extreme bill repealing the old laws was able to garner sufficient political support to succeed because it offered a real solution to a pressing problem. The people in this state are perspicacious. If they are going to go out on a limb for change, they want to be sure that a significant improvement results. The advocates of E.R.A. should put their energies behind more effective legislation and constitutional amendments. CONSTANCE E. Coon Ithaca, N. Y., Nov. 6, 1975 The writer is a former Republican assemblywoman. • A Woman's Worth To the Editor: The feminists’ decision to reassess their image (new story Nov. 8) is most necessary if that large body of women known as homemakers is to feel valued part of any “women's movement.” How far the feminists are from such a reassessment is made distinctly clear by Letty Cottin Pogrebin's assertion that she would “love to see a homemaker branch of feminism” with spokeswomen who would “understand the issues and goals and be able to articulate them, but don't necessarily want to advance themselves.” Obviously, Ms. Pogrebin and her counterparts do not understand that many women, who are able, choose not to enter the marketplace, seeing the working world as not necessarily an advancement over another kind of life or that one's worth or contribution to society is measured in terms of weekly salary. MARY Lou WINNICK Woodbridge, Conn., Nov. 10, 1975 • Of Trials and Sanity To the Editor: If Mr. Meisel's suggestions [letter Oct. 29] were adopted, many a person accused of a serious crime would be tempted to avoid responsibility by stating: “I know nothing. I don't know who I am, or who my parents were. Sky is red, milk black, Charlie McCarthy is the President, and to getto San Francisco from New York one must drive east. This I believe and refuse to be budged by any argument to the contrary.” Faced with this, any trier of the facts would want to hear someone who has something to lose by perjuring himself, and who spends his working hours in close contact with the mentally ill, testify to the degree of resemblance between this accused person and others not so accused, but deemed to be incompetent by that general consensus of which the jury process is but a sampling. Because this kind of testimony is available, few people try to work their way out of a legal predicament by malingering. Also, charges are seldom pressed against truly incompetent people. This leaves for courtroom adjudication only marginal cases, where even the views of competent practitioners could be at variance in a large proportion of cases. Only one view can be right, and the decision is up to the jury. It is true that en articulate pyschiatrist can wield power in court, but only if pitted against an inadequate adversary. Equally, a clever lawyer can literally take terrorists off the gallows if opposed by inferior prosecution. A view has recently been advanced that courtroom verdicts can be bought, whether the money comes from private fortunes or is raised by popular subscription. The implications are disturbing if we face them, but we need not. It is easier to inveigh against psychiatrists and, also, much more fun. MIODRAG RISTICH, Staten Island, Nov. 5,1975, The City's Path to Economic Health To the Editor: The international monetary crises of the early 1970's hold some interesting and possibly useful lessons for the fiscal problems of New York City and for current efforts to resolve them. A substantial transfer of real income over the years to municipal employees and welfare clients, coupled with city and state decisions to spend massively on social infrastructure, have led to significant increases in the relative cost (which includes state and local taxes) of living, working, and doing business in New York City. If we had flexible exchange rates within the United States, the “New York dollar” would now be worth a good deal less than the “Chicago dollar,” the “Dallas dollar” etc., and relative costs between the city and the rest of the country would have fallen into line. In the absence of this adjustment mechanism—which works reasonably well in economic relations between countries that do in fact have different currencies which can change in relative value—the inevitable result will be a continued exodus from the city of investments and people employed in a private sector that in order to survive has no choice but to remain competitive with the rest of the country. After several decades of continued decline under these conditions, municipal priorities will eventually be reordered• along the lines of a “poor” nation or region, a lean and growthoriented mentality will reassert itself and economic resurgence may begin with the restoration of the city's relative cost‐competitiveness. Unhappily, this is likely only after much of New York has become economically dead. The only simple alternative to this dismal scenario is massive and perma‐ nent Federal subsidies to the city, which are rather unlikely. Present plans for city and state tax Increases may indeed improve matters in the short run, but they will invariably The Times welcomes Ittters from ‘ readers.

Countries facing similar competitive disequilibria have, even with massive interim financial support from abroad and reductions in the value of their currencies, been forced to resort eventually to fundamental structural reforms in order to regain their economic health in a fiercely competitive world. New York City, faced with even narrower policy options, will in the end be able to do no less. INGO WALTER Professor of Economics and Finance New York University New York, Nov. 11, 1975 • Responsible New Yorkers To the Editor: I would like to say a few words in defense of the beleaguered taxpayers in New York City. From all accounts, you would think everyone in New York had been living “the life of Riley” on borrowed money; but it should be remembered that New York City has millions of overloaded taxpayers who have been shouldering the major share of burden for a series of fiscally irresponsible city administrations. You might wonder why responsible New Yorkers haven't cleaned up their city administration but it is possible that the responsible New Yorker doesn't have any more say‐so over the city's fiscal management than responsible Americans have over their ballooning Federal deficit I thought New Yorkers might like to know that there is one “outlander” who isn't pointing his finger at New Yorkers for doing exactly what most other cities and our Federal Govern‐ ment are doing. LAWRENCE M. GARY Washington, Nov. 10, 1975 • Our Bilingual Polls To the Editor: It has always been my understanding that, to be an American citizen and a voter, one must be literate enough to be able to read and write basic English. Why then, when we go to the polls now, must we put up with a Spanish translation► of how to vote? Why not German, or Hebrew, or even Chinese? LEON STERINBACH Rockaway, N. Y., Nov. 5, 1975"
Nigerians Oppose Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/20/archives/nigerians-oppose-abortion.html,"LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters)—Nigeria's National Council of Women's Societies has joined the Roman Catholic Church to oppose a proposal by the federal Government to legalize abortion. In a statement the council president said legalized abortion would have a bad effect on society and encourage moral laxity."
Catholic Bishops Approve a Plan to Mobilize Public Support Against Abortions on Request,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/21/archives/catholic-bishops-approve-a-plan-to-mobilize-public-support-against.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20—The Roman Caholic bishops of the United States significantly stepped up today the church's fight against abortion by approving a plan to create nonsectarian “pro‐life” groups in every Congressional district. The gioups would be “mobilized” to persuade members of Congress to vote in favor of a constitutional amendment aimed at ending permissive abortions. They would function in tandem with “pro‐life” organizations already existing in the church's various dioceses. Heretofore, Roman Catholic efforts to fight abortion have depended for the most part on public pronouncements rather than on a highly organized action program. The bishops’ “pastoral plan for pro‐life activities” came out of a committee headed by Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York. It was adopted during the final hours of the four‐day annual meeting here of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the Statler Hilton Hotel along with a statement on Jewish‐Christian relations and a pastoral letter on the country's housing crisis. Persuasion is part of the dem‐ ocratic process, the plan declared, and added: “Essentially this effort demands ongoing public information activity and careful and detailed organization. Thus it is absolutely necessary to encourage .the development in each Congressional district of an identifiable, tightly knit and well organized pro‐life unit. This unit can be described as a public interest group or a citizens’ lobby. No matter what it is called, its task is essentially political.” The plan made it clear that these units would differ from the “pedagogic and motivational” tasks of the diocesan prolife groups and would not be operated, controlled or financed by the church. Church people, however, would be instrumental in getting the plan off the ground. In Commenting on the plan; Cardinal Cooke emphasized that it was not up to the church to propose a specific wording for a constitutional amendment. “That is up to Congress,” he said. “We know that if we went in with that approach it would be the best way to kill an amendment because then you would be playing into the hands of those who say its just a Catholic issue.” “Our surveys show that the ([vast majority of the American people are unhappy with per‐ missive abortion on request,” the prelate declared. Success, the plan emphasized, will require well‐planned and coordinated political action by citizens at the national., state and local levels. “This activity,” it said, “is not simply the responsibility of Catholics, nor should it be Ilimited to Catholic groups or agencies. It calls for widespread cooperation and collaboration. As citizens of this democracy, we encourage the appropriate political action to achieve these legislative goals. As leaders of a religious institution in this society, we see a moral imperative for such political activity.” Other elements in the plan call for a public information and education effort to give the abortion issue “continued visibility,” the issuance of regular anti‐abortion statements, testimony ori pertinent legislative issues, letters to editors, the establishment of pregnancy counseling centers and “continued efforts to remove the social stigma that is visited on the woman who is pregnant out of wedlock and on her child.” The bishops were dealt a blow in mid‐September when a Senate judiciary subcommittee headed by Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, rejected a number of proposed constitutional amendments to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision greatly liberalizing access to abortions. At the time, it was suggested that one reason the subcommittee did not endorse any of the proposed amendments was that pro‐life groups, particularly the bishops, had not supported a specific proposal. At a news conference, Cardinal Cooke called the Supreme Court decision a “disaster,” adding: “We have been subjected to a brain‐washing by people pushing abortion.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/22/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"Energy Bill: Congress’ Gift to the Arabs To the Editor: The Democratic Congress likes to portray itself as a great friend of Israel and of the American consumer. The energy bill it has just passed shows it to be a friend of neither. Sheik Yamani of Saudi Arabia and Colonel Qaddafi of Libya must be smiling. The Congress has effectively voted for a $3 billion foreign‐aid bill to the Arabs. The reasoning is quite simple. The bill rolls back domestic crude prices by 12 percent. Based on the price elasticity of demand observed over the past three years, a 2 percent increase in demand is likely to result, adding roughly 350,000 barrels per day to U.S. consumption. An equivalent depressant effect on domestic production is quite plausible. Thus Congress has legislated 700,000‐barrel‐a‐day widening of the gap between U.S. production and consumption, this amount to be filled by imports, chiefly from the Middle East. This 700,000‐barrel figure corresponds to an 11 percent boost in total imports and will add another $3 billion to the $25 billion‐plus we are already paying for foreign oil. It is particularly ironic that the bill was passed at a time when some cracks are showing in OPEC, as manifest by widespread price‐shaving. The action of the Congress to raise imports will serve to cement those cracks and help preserve OPEC solidarity. It is also ironic that “friends of Is‐ rael” should vote to raise U.S. dependence on foreign oil beyond the 40 percent mark, a considerably higher figure than in October 1973, before the Arab embargo. The era of cheap energy is over. The sooner the Congress stops playing King Canute, the better off we will be. Beating up on the oil companies is great sport and a sure votegetter these days. The beneficiaries of this foolishness are the Sheik Yamanis and Colonel Qadaffis, however, and the ultimate victims will be not the oil companies but the American consumer and the State of Israel. MARK YOGMAN Coraopolis, Pa., Nov. 14, 1975 Harry Pincus Bond Moratorium: Blow To the Small Investor To the Editor: As one of many small individual investors in short‐term New York City notes, I protest the planned three‐year moratorium. Together with many other people preparing for retirement, I. would face serious problems because of the withholding of principal for three more years. To call the moratorium anything but legalized default is subterfuge. How can the state and the city change the law at their convenience to avoid fulfilling their legally binding obligations? If New York City can do this now, it can do it again. Who would dare to buy its notes and bonds in the future? JAY J. CHICHON New York, Nov. 16, 1975 To the Editor: In President Ford's sweeping view of the forest, he has completely overlooked little saplings like me—people (not even residents of Sin City) who have invested their savings in what was a high‐rated security. I understand that in the event of default the plan is to issue long‐term in exchange for short‐term paper. But wouldn't it be possible to spare individual investors from this draconian substitution? Banks and pension funds can sit it out with long‐term bonds, but we human beings don't enjoy eternal life, and some of us have purchased New York City notes and shortterm bonds to pay living expenses during our retirement years. If, as President Ford believes, institutions own the major portion of New York City securities, the cost of honoring those few obligations held by individuals should not be too great. SIDNEY FREIDBERG Washington, Nov. 11, 1975 • The Limits of Compassion To the Editor: Yolanda Rios Colon says that an opponent of the excessive government spending on Taino Towers is a racist [letter Nov. 15]. Undoubtedly, many racists object to Taino Towers, just as some male chauvinists are opposed to abortion and some bigots are concerned about crime in the streets. However, the prejudices of such critics have nothing to do with the merits of those problems. Many of us who are not racists and who firmly support low‐income housing as essential to a compassionate and civilized society are infuriated by the waste of public money at Taino Towers. Public funds are, after all, finite, and because of the reckless extravagance of projects like Taino Towers low‐income families who could otherwise be helped will be abandoned to their squalid surroundings, many of them to live in sullen resentment within a stone's throw of this monument to bureaucratic insanity. I have no objection to renting sixbedroom apartments for $113.28 month to people earning $80 a week, nor do I resent paying whatever part of my tax dollar is used for lowincome housing. The attendant luxuries at Taino Towers, however, are beyond the means of most people earning ten times that amount, and I do resent helping to finance that absurdity. ROBERT D. HUGHES New York, Nov. 17, 1975 Fluorocarbon Study: The ‘Safe’ 3 Years To the Editor: It is encouraging to see The New York Times recognize editorially [Oct. 21] that regulatory action on use of fluorocarbons should be taken only if there are strong indications of danger to the ozone layer. The editorial, however, questions “how much further time could safely be spent on research without jeopardizing the vital supply of ozone for the future.” Work by Dr. Paul J. Crutzen of the National Center for Atmospheric Research clearly suggests the three years industry has requested for research is a “safe” amount of time. That there is no significant risk in taking this time for research was testified to in the recent U.S. Senate subcommittee hearings by Drs. H. Guyford Stever, director, National Science Foundation, and James Fletcher, director, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Dr. Crutzen's calculations show that if predictions of ozone depletion are correct and fluorocarbon production were stopped now, the depletion from the accumulated release of all fluorocarbons produced worldwide to date would be 1.2 percent in about 1985, with a gradual healing of the ozone thereafter. By continuing worldwide production of flubrocarbons for three more years, the added ozone depletion —if the theory is valid—would be an additional 0.5 percent by 1990, with healing after that. The significance of an added 0.5 percent ozone depletion can be related to the natural thinning of ozone from the poles to the equator. This natural thinning results in about percent less ozone for each degree of latitude (70 miles) you move smithward. A 0.5 percent ozone depletion poses about the same risk to increased ultraviolet light as moving your home 35 mileg south. It is clear that the risk to the ozone and to the public health in taking three years to find out whether in fact fluorocarbons do pose a hazard to the ozone is insignificant — particularly when it is balanced against the economic disruption that would be caused by precipitate regulation of “nonessential uses” of fluorocarbon aerosols. The aerosol industry provides the livelihoods for 53,000 workers and involves a $3‐billion segment of our economy. Moreover, if there is a fluorocarbonozone problem, the impact of that problem will reach far beyond the aerosol industry. About 30 percent of U.S. production of the fluorocarbons involved in this question is used in refrigeration and air‐conditioning systems. And, there are no substitutes for these refrigerants. ROY L. SCHUYLER Wilmington, Del., Nov. 5, 1975 The writer is vice president and general manager, Organic Chemicals Dept., E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. Nonpolitical UNICEF To the Editor: A number of UNICEF's well‐wishers and volunteers associated with the programs of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF are understandably disturbed and confused by the recent U.N. General Assembly action of a majority of member countries in adopting a resolution which equates Zionism with racism. The U.S. Committee deplores this action, which it considers divisive. The committee, an independent, nonprofit organization, wishes to reassure public not versed in the intricacies of U.N. interagency relationships that, in the words of Henry R. Labouisse, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, “the resolution has no bearing on UNICEF operations.” The committee intends to continue its wholehearted support for UNICEF for the reasons it has often emphasized: UNICEF is totally nonpolitical; UNICEF is dedicated to helping children in need without regard to religion, race or nationality; UNICEF has its own budget, governing board and executive director; UNICEF is supported entirely by voluntary contributions. UNICEF is, therefore, in a unique position to transcend political conflict and turmoil in order to assist children. The help given to children on “both sides” of conflicts in the Middle East, Nigeria and Indochina, India and Pakistan exemplifies this position. Contributions to UNICEF also transcend political divisions, as they come from more than 120 countries, including Arab countries and Israel. To withdraw our assistance to the children of the developing countries would condemn them to continue to live in excruciating misery. We cannot believe any rational human being would want to penalize the children because of a political action that has no relevance to the operations of this unique organization—UNICEF—which has proved its usefulness over the span of a generation. HELENKA PANTALEON1 President, U.S. Committee for UNICEF New York, Nov. 14, 1975 A Time for Anger To the Editor: It was not surprising to hear that Secretary Kissinger advised that our country ignore the U.N. resolution on Zionism; that position is consistent with Mr. Kissinger's own insensitive Realpolitik. But I was surprised and grieved to read Anthony Lewis’ Nov. 13 column, the more so because Mr. Lewis is my favorite columnist. He has shown much moral sensitivity on many issues, and it was therefore sadly disappointing to read his counsel that the United States should avoid self‐righteous anger at the U.N. because we have committed our own share of sins. It is true that we have shown ourselves to be too like other’ nations: We have committed sins aplenty. But it is shameful to bid the nation not to make clear in some way its moral fury. There is a time, in serving the cause of freedom, when anger is more appropriate than patience. We need to be roused to anger, at this and at many other things, and perhaps in so doing our moral senses will stir to life again, and we can begin to re‐establish the old American idealism that Mr. Lewis says we have lost. MARCIA R. LIEBERMAN Storrs, Conn., Nov. 14, 1975 Saigon's Hostages To the Editor: In a Nov. 6 letter under the heading “U.S. vs. the Vietnamese,” the United States was attacked for its treatment of Vietnam. What the writer failed to state was that the Coalition to Stop the War has instituted a campaign among Communist‐oriented groups to persuade Congress to sponsor legislation for financial goodies, recognition and ending the U.S. trade embargo. The Congressmen named in the letter should know that the war has not ended for 1,300 families whose sons, brothers, fathers and husbands, many known to have been captured alive, have not been returned or accounted for, as provided by the Paris accords. Their efforts should be devoted in behalf of these men. Some twenty noncombat correspondents, including Sean Flynn and Welles Hangen, have not been returned or accounted for; nor have the bodies of the two dead marines left behind in Saigon been returned. This is part of the Communist war on women, children and elderly people, some of whom have already died in the agony of not knowing the fate of their loved ones. The use of these captured and missing Americans and their families as political hostages by these Communist barbarians is illegal, immoral and based on the unacceptable premise that sufficient terrorist activity to these people will be rewarded. The lot of the Vietnamese people has been an unhappy one ever since Ho Chi Minh admittedly slaughtered 50,000 of his people to establish his repressive government. Another million fled to South Vietnam in vain, since that country was ultimately invaded by the Communist horde. It would be as wrong for the United States to come to the aid of this Communist dictatorship while its people live under the heel of its cruel leaders as it would be to come to its aid while our 1,300 brave men repose in its tiger cages and uneasy graves. JOHN M. CoNNouy Jr. Executive Director, Council for Civilized Treatment of P.O.W.'s New York, Nov. 14, 1975"
Christian and Jewish Leaders Feel Ties Are Closer,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/23/archives/christian-and-jewish-leaders-feel-ties-are-closer.html,"This Thanksgiving, as Christians and Jews partake in religious services, often under the same roof, many are expected to express special gratitude for the events that have brought them closer together over the last decade. In the view of leaders of both faiths, the developments that began with the declaration on Catholic‐Jewish relations in 1965 by Vatican Council II have advanced understanding farther than has any similar period since the fledgling Christian church separated from its Jewish roots nearly 20 centuries (ago. Christians and Jews have prayed together in the last 10 years, held common seder services at Passover, marched together for social causes, merged clergy groups, exchanged visits between synagogue and church, and have, generally met face to face to a great degree. They have also worked to remove potential sources of bigotry and harmful stereotyping from teaching materials. Among the targets have been portrayals of Jews as “Christ” killers,” denigrating references to the Pharisees, some of whom were opponents of Jesus, and implications that Jews were; condemned by God for not accepting Jesus as the Messiah. Scholars have sought to erase another common assumption—that Judaism ceased to grow and develop as a vital faith after the founding of Christianity. As scholars, clergy and laity have cooperated and struggled to find pathways through sometimes difficult terrain, mutual respect and appreciation have grown. There remain obstacles in the dialogues, including discussions about Israel, abortion and aid to religious schools. But most leaders assert without hesitation that the new bonds are solid. “The fact that there are today networks of Jews and Christians in practically every major city who meet rather regularly says Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum of the American Jewish Committee, “is a development of unprecedented importance.” Rabbi Tanenbaum, a key figure in the interfaith movement, calls such interaction “on a personal, social and professional basis” unique in religious history. These ties were recently tested when the United Nations General Assembly approved resolution that equated Zionism with racism. To many Jews, the Christian response to the question of Israel's survival is interpreted as an index of the church's attitude toward Judaism. Reaction Criticized After the 1967 Arab‐Israeli war, Jewish leaders expressed disappointment over what they regarded as slow or ambivalent reactions from churchmen. But the 1973 war produced a flood of Christian sympathy, and the coolness that had hampered interfaith dialogue gave way to a new openness. Christians again apparently scored high marks with Jews by denouncing the United Nations resolution on Zionism! and affirming Israel's right to exist. Such assurances, observers say, have paved the way for more substantive talks on other items. Scholars and theologians have become increasingly occupied with two concerns. One is the issue of whether Christians should look upon Jews as needing “conversion.” The second is how to regard the contention by some Jews that the land of Israel is integrally tied to Jewish faith. The Vatican II document, “Nostra Aetate,” on Roman Catholic relations with nonChristians, took a giant step toward eradicating the idea that Jews were collectively guilty for Jesus’ death, a traditional rationale for anti‐Semitism. To an astonishing degree, that problem has been attacked through preaching, the establishment of Catholic‐Jewish relations councils in dozens of dioceses and the revision of catechisms. ‘Potential Christians’ But the adjoining issue, whether Jews are to be viewed as “potential Christians,” remains thornier. Although there is widespread scorn for proselytization, or conversion, many Christians feel ‘impelled to carry out the New Testament mandate to spread the Word without exception. “Christianity makes universal claims,” notes the Rev. Charles Angell of the Atonement Friars, a Catholic order devoted to ecumenism, “while Judaism does not. Christianity has mandate from its Founder to preach Jesus Christ to the world. Judaism sees itself as a covenant for a particular people and does not have this kind of missionary mandate.” Yet Father Angell, like number of other Christians, believes Judaism”s particularism ‘can live side by side with Christianity's universalism. Such conclusions may sound paradoxical, but they are motivated by affection for Christons’ Jewish heritage and the harm done to Jews in the past in the name of “higher” truth. Likewise, while Israel's right to exist as a political state is seldom questioned in church circles, its link to Judaism continues to generate disagreement. The Rev. Avery Dulles of Catholic University underscored the issue in a recent lecture saying that among both Christians and Jews “it is hotly debated question whether the fulfillment of Israel's religious destiny depends upon possession of the land.” A complicating factor is the, Christian tie to missions in several Arab countries. Partly from a desire to protect those missions and from concern for Palestinian aspiration's, many. Christians, particularly those’ from the large Protestant groups especially active in the Arab world, have been reluctant to go too far in asserting Jewish religious “rights” to the land. “Christians must strive to learn how Jews define themselves,” Father Angell says, “and Jews must strive to learn how Christians define themselves.” Long before the guidelines were issued, the American branch of the church was busy forming Catholic‐Jewish agencies. Nearly every dioceSe has had such a program for at least a half dozen years. The first standing committee (in 1966), and perhaps the most ambitious in the nation, is in the Diocese of Brooklyn, which encompasses more Catholics and Jews than any comparable area in the world. Encouraged by Bishop Francis J. Mugavero, fhe diocese sponsors local neighborhood councils to tackle problems such es housing and discrimination, an annual interfaith convocation and teacher exchanges between Catholic and Jewish schools. One priority, Bishop Mugavero says, is to “encourage dialogue in order to understand the Jewish belief that the people and the land of Israel go together—and to help them understand our belief in Christ as the Messiah.” The bottom line is the person in the pew. ‘;We are sharing in a way we never have before,” says the Rev. ‘Villiam Wyler of the National Council of Churches, “but we need to intensify that on a community level.” Father Wyler, an Episcopal priest, represents the new climate. He holds a doctorate in Judaic studies from Hebrew Union College and served as a lecturer in Rabbinic literature for three years in West Germany. The recent. United Nations crises over Israel may have temporarily moved the interfaith dialogue “back to square one” of asserting basic loyalties, Father Wyler says, but at the present time, he believes, the discussion “is right at the threshold” of a new era of progress. To Rabbi Balfour Brickner, director of the Reform Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the logic of a renewed emphasis is also dictated) by “the need Christians and Jews have for each other” in combating a general moral decline. “Someone must address the ethical crisis of urban America,” Rabbi Bnickner says. “If organized religion doesn't respond, who will?”"
New &,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/23/archives/new-novel.html,"When Field Marshal Sir John Durham decides, at 80, to write his memoirs, he insists on veracity, “the truth, all of it, all the time.” This compulsion for veracity gets Sir John right into the Tower of London, as a violator of the Official Secrets Act. The very rumor of Durham's revelations agitates Whitehall, the White House and the Mafia, one of whose members was killed by the Field Marshal's wartime strategy. In the private sector there are those who try to blackmail the old soldier, and a couple who attempt to murder him. The Field Marshal's Memoirs By John Masters. 325 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $8.95. To support his hero's vulnerability, John Masters assigns him a checkered career of ambivalence, indiscretions and sinister implications. And yet the Field Marshal is regarded as a living legend, a national hero without blemish. How come such a fine old party happened to have snuffed out some of his own troops and allies, as well as a very close relative? Did he really steal a fortune in paintings and hang on to other wartime loot? And didn't he know that telling so much of the truth would blow the whistle on his own family and friends? These questions and many you haven't thought of are answered in Masters's exentertainment. The Prometheus Crisis By Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. 321 pp. New York: Doubleday & Co. $8.95. From the team that brought you the screenplay of “The Glass Inferno” comes a disaster novel that makes their earlier effort seem as pale as a cookout. You've been through the On The Beach novels that forecast what atomic bombs can do. Now see what atomic power plants can do! Meltdown! The China syndrome (an atomic pile melting its way right down through the earth toward China)! Scortia and Robinson know their way around a holocaust well enough to make this industrial disaster as horrible as it is plausible. (To skeptical me, anyhow, and I have never even trusted microwave ovens.) What happens at Prometheus One, a brand‐new atomic power plant on the coast of northern California, is what frequently happens to much of American industry—sloppy workmanship. Plus an attempt to open the plant on a too‐rigid timetable, the sort of scheduling that causes aircraft fatalities. Enough? Not quite. Just for good measure the boys slip in a Mad Bomber type who has somehow evaded psychological screening. Anyone who pulls the switch on Prometheus One just doesn't know what he is doing—which is exactly what happens. There are nice stereotypes in the book to accompany the action and give it meaning. Black hat is Cushing, company vice president for reactor safety, who has an actuarial approach toward human life. White hat is Parks, Prometheus's general manager, who thinks machines should be made to work properly before they are used. Brrrr. Are All Italians Lousy Lovers? By Costanzo Costantini. Translated by Eugene Walter. 211 pp. Secaucus. N. J.: Lyle Stuart. $6.95. At age 3, the teller of this tale, a girl named Maria, is mounted by a precocious 4year‐old boy. At the close of the book, Maria, now a grown woman, is confronted by a sexual athlete of 103. In each case, the deepest impression made on the narrator is psychological. And so it goes with all the intervening “lovers” who give the book its title. Giovanni, a schoolmate's father, leaps upon her without preamble or consummation. Her college professor strips to the buff and chases her fruitlessly around his Ping‐Pong table. When Maria marries, her husband turns out to have a urological deficiency. Marriage is followed by abortion, annulment and other unilateral performers. To make things more interesting, Signor Costantini endows his heroine with a double uterus, five breasts and other anatomical accessories. Makes as much sense as anything else. There's a twinkle of a humorous social comment here, but it is very faint. A Proper Place By Joan Lingard. 159 pp. Nashville and New York: Thomas Nelson, Inc. $5.95. The adventures of a young blue‐collar couple, written in the upbeat tempo of the old mass magazines. Kevin and Sadie McCoy leave Belfast with their infant son to find work in Liverpool. Religious differences (Kevin is Catholic, Sadie Protestant), mother‐in ‐law trouble and the depressed city itself only serve to pull the small family closer together. Even Kevin's black‐ sheep brother Gerald, who comes to live with the couple, is just another challenge. The McCoys hit their stride when they find jobs on a farm in Cheshire, where Kevin discovers a knack for cattle and Gerald a way with horses. Sadie is good at everything. Nice. Ambulance By Hugh Miller. 352 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $8.95. Now who would want to sabotage the new super‐ambulance that has just been commissioned by Westfield General to cope with highway accidents? In spite of the formidable medical arsenal of this mobile hospital, its maimed passengers die too frequently, and its equipment malfunctions. Suspiciously. Paul Avery, the young American director of the British ambulance team, tries to find the answers to these questions. The author takes us through the hospital, fills us in with interesting case histories of doctors and patients. Hugh Miller is particularly good at sketching the delusions of patients in the psychiatric wing, where Avery's best friend, Dr. Ernie Hale, hangs out. Among the staff, the outstanding case is Dr. Henry Madison, a veteran surgeon with a few hang‐ups that conflict with his Hippocratic oath. Mr. Miller writes with the relish of a medical buff who enjoys describing the cause as much as he does the cure. If you collect hospital novels, this is one for your bedside bookshelf. The Sea King's Daughter By Barbara Michaels. 245 pp. New York: Dodd, Mead & Co. $7.95. Romantic adventures with a little something for everybody. Barbara Michaels knows her archaeology and seeds the watery explorations off the coast of Crete with realistic subject matter. Besides harboring the remains of an ancient Minoan fleet, the island of Them contains a real, very much alive matriarchal cult, some nasty secrets from WoIrd War II and a working volcano. It's not the most hospitable climate for a girl scuba diver, which Sandy Bishop is, especially when it's time for human sacrifice among the local pagans. The author's fans will know that nothing terminal is likely to happen to her heroine, but you can never be too sure."
RITAN FOR PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/23/archives/puritan-for-president-stubborn-spartan-square-scoop-jackson-takes-a.html,"“Everett has a hell of a lot to do with Henry Jackson,” says S. Sterling Munro Jr., the Senator's administrative assistant. “That's his roots, and he's a roots man.'’ Everett. Wash., a grimy little mill town of 50,000 on Puget Sound north of Seattle, is the unprepossessing end product of a failed dream. James J. Hill and John D. Rockefeller were going to make it the timber capital of the Northwest, but their ambitions perished one day in 1916 when the local constabulary opened fire on a boatload of radical unionists, killing dozens of them. Scoop Jackson—Senator Henry Martin Jackson, 63 years old, Democrat of Washington, Presidential aspirant, chairman of the Senate Interior Committee, the last of the cold warriors—was born in Everett four years fore the massacre. It says something about him that he still lives there when he is not in the East, turning his back on the splendors of Seattle, on Mount Rainier and Lake Washington and the gaudy springtime beauty of hundreds of thousands of rhododendrons. It says something more that he lives in the big white house on Grand Avenue, the finest in town, which once belonged to William Butler, the Dickensian banker who was Everett's liege lord for decades. The house is Jackson's one flam‐ boyance, the trophy of his journey from working‐class neighborhood across town that transformed a Norwegian immigrant laborer's son into one of the nation's most powerful men. “Maintaining your home‐town contacts gives you a sense of continuity about what happens to people during the course of their lives,” Jackson told me one day recently at a corner table in the Senate dining room, “especially if you're from a small town.” Ever since his boyhood days on Everett's wood‐plank streets, Jackson has been the embodiment of the Puritan ethic: One works not for fun, not to eat, but because one must. Achievement in life is everything; everything is possible to him who strives, nothing to the slothful or frivolous. He learned these “truths” from his mother, who took his middle name from the first name of the dour and demanding Luther, and he has never forgotten them. As a newspaper delivery boy (whence the nickname “Scoop”), Jackson set a local record by delivering 74,880 copies of R. W. Apple Jr. is a political‐affairs reporter for The New York Times. The Everett Herald “without a single complaint for nondelivery,” the paper proudly reported. As a 26‐year‐old prosecuting attorney in Snohomish County, he ran the whores and slot machines and bootleggers out of town; for a time, they called him “Soda Pop” Jackson. The same pattern has held in Washington: work, work, work, a Spartan existence, life is serious. Jackson believes in a process of natural selection, which, if allowed to work, will strengthen a nation or a political party or any entity by “cleaning out the weak and the second‐raters.” He has said: “Within certain’ ground rules, I do believe everyone should have to fight his own way up. You help people get a start, then leave them to their own resources. You don't carry them forever.” Thus, he gives money to young men and women to help them through their first year of college; after that, he says, “If they're any good, they'll find a way.” James David Barber of Duke University, who has devised a scheme measure what he calls Presidential character, might find this aspect Jackson's character intriguing. He argues that a man's probable performance ui office can be gauged by paying particular attention to the energy invested in his work and the degree of pleasure derived from it. He classifies the 20th‐century Presidents under four headings, one of which is “active‐negative.” “The contradiction here,” Barber writes, “is between relatively intensive effort and a relatively low emotional reward for that effort.” Presidents in this category, he finds, tend to be confronted with one great problem to which they are unable to respond successfully —Wilson and the League of Nations, Hoover and the Depression, Johnson and Vietnam, Nixon and Watergate. For years, Jackson lived in a Washington bachelor apartment with his grade‐school chum, John Salter, a charming blackguard of an Irishman who was his closest aide for 25 years—his Murray Chotiner, some of Jackson's critics contend. Salter supplied all the qualities that Jackson lacked as a politician—most importantly, wit, conviviality and deviousness. Jackson cooked breakfast every morning—“same goddamned breakfast every morning,” Salter recalls, “always the prunes.” Then, as now, the overachiever from Everett drove a battered car, wore nondescript suits that did little to enhance his oddly pro. portioned body, on which the arms and legs seem too short for the torso, and cared little for night life. (Not that Jackson is without his small vanities; he is sensitive about his height—only 5 feet 91/2 inches—and last year had an operation to correct a droopy eyelid.) On one date, he delighted a young woman whom he had been (Continued seeing by inviting her back to his apartment. Her hopes of romance evaporated when he rushed in and turned on the radio to listen to his favorite news commentator. Jackson was too busy for marriage until he met Helen Hardin, who was working in the office of Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico. At 28, she was 21 years his junior, graceful, pretty in the slightly lacquered way of the late 50's and early 60's. When they were married in 1961 and set out for Hawaii on their honeymoon, Jackson promised to forget politics for while. A week later, he interrupted their idyll to attend a naval briefing at Pearl Harbor on the “increasing Communist submarine threat in the Pa. cific.” She has borne two children (Anna Marie, 12, and Peter, 9) and has subordinated her life and her interests (she holds a master's degree in contemporary literature from Columbia) to his. “He likes to have Peter go swimming with him,” says Munro, who has worked for Jackson for 22 years. “He loves to play father, occasionally even to play husband. But he embroils the family in his act—they don't embroil him in theirs. They're people he loves, but more than that, it's something he For a politician, Jackson has remarkably few close friends. One is Salter. Others are Stanley Golub, 61, a wealthy Seattle jeweler whose liberalism on foreign‐policy questions has never rubbed off on his old law‐school classmate; Jerry Hoeck, 53, a retired Seattle advertising executive with broad interests and a gift of gab; Clarence D. Martin Jr., a California auto dealer who served as Jackson's deputy during his brief tenure as Democratic National Chairman in 1960. and Adm. Hyman Rickover, whose career Jackson helped to preserve by blocking Pentagon plans to retire him. Most people in Washington find him dull. He is not a born politician and, except in the most intimate situations, as one old friend puts it, “a curtain seems to come down between him and the people he's talking to.” Reflecting the prevailing view of Jackson's oratorical style, the Washington comedian Mark Russell told a Democratic banquet recently that “Scoop made fireside chat the other night, and the fire went to sleep.” His humorlessness is legendary, especially in comparison with his Washington colleague in the Senate, Warren G. Magnuson, a bluff, gregarious man of large appetites. One day, Jackson decided that he had to urge Magnuson to lose weight. He went to Magnuson's office and began demonstrating push‐ups on the floor. Magnuson, bemused by his friend's everlasting earnestness, pretended to push a button on his intercom and talk to his secretary. “Jessie,” he asked, “would you please send Mr. Allen in now?” Jackson, falling for the gag and thinking that William M. Allen of the Boeing Company was in the anteroom, leaped to his feet, brushed himself off, struggled into his jacket—and stood there while Magnuson roared. Jackson was not amused. Asked what other politician of this century Jackson reminded him of, Salter thought for minute before replying with the name Scoop Jackson, John Kennedy and Mike Mansfield in 1954: The Kennedys included Jackson in their softball games, but not in their plans for Camelot. hard work than humor—Robert A. Taft. All of these qualities, growing in large part, probably. out of his stolid Norwegian ancestry and his early life, are anchored by discipline. He considers the emotionalism of some of his peers—Hubert H. Humphrey, for example—somehow unfitting, a sign of weakness. Only rarely does he allow himself to slip. Some say Jackson has a temper that erupts only when his personal integrity is threatened. He prides himself on his financial punctiliousness; since 1952, he has donated all the money he earns from speeches and articles—$34,350 last year—to scholarship funds at home. A man who detests phonies and showoffs, he never disclosed his contributions until a new law do At the same time, his qualities have produced an extraordinary sensitivity to criticism sometimes reminiscent of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. He has kept no enemies’ list, but his press secretary, Brian Corcoran, once told a reporter he considered hostile: “We know who our friends and enemies are without keeping a list.” This trait may grow out of Jackson's extreme sense of loyalty; he once pushed Johnson so hard to appoint Representative Thomas S. Foley's father to a Federal job that Foley, a Washington Democrat and no stranger to political maneuver, was acutely embarrassed. Jackson expects no less loyalty from others, hack home. When Brock Adams, an independent‐minded Democratic Congressman from Seattle who may run for Jackson's seat if Jackson is nominated for President. said in 1967 that he could no longer support the Vietnam war, Jackson and his staff stopped speaking to him for a while. And when Henry Seidel, then Adams's administrative assistant and an old‐line radical gadfly originally from New Jersey, began promoting what Jackson considered leftist causes on the Hill. Jackson went so far as to enlist his friends in the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. hierarchy to try to persuade Adams to fire Seidel. “You're with him totally and completely or you're against him,” Adams says. Adds Seidel, who has known Jackson .since 1947: “Why the hell should a United States Senator worry about what a lousy administrative assistant is up to? I'll tell you why: because he's scared all the time, just plain Jackson was infuriated in 1970 when the King County (Seattle) Democratic Convention endorsed his opponent, a black man named Carl Maxey, although he posed no real threat. Jackson all but read the new‐left elements out of the state party, as he did again in 1972, when he said, “The American people are fed up with those who advocate amnesty, legalized prostitution and legalized homosexuality. Some states are putting it into their platforms. They are working for the Republican Party.” In 1972, Senator George McGovern took eight votes from Jackson in the Washington State district caucuses; at Jackson's direction, the dominant element at the state convention highhandedly stripped McGovern of all his votes. This year, Jackson agents strove vainly to push through a Washington State primary law because, one of them said privately, Jackson could not tolerate the remote possibility that some candidate of the left might win a few delegates in one of the districts in his home state. Other candidates are eager to have their states solidly behind them; Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas managed this year to secure passage of a pro‐Bentsen law in Texas. But Jackson is more rabbit‐eared than most. Even John Salter, to whom Jackson's unflinching loyalty has brought lucrative consulting Weyerhaeuser, commented, “He didn't like the Time cover story. I thought it was fine, hut, hell, he doesn't like anything written about him unless Brian Corcoran writes it.” The story in question, published this year, was straightforward appraisal of Jackson's career, not at all negative. There are those who believe that Jackson's hypersensitivity to criticism within his own party stems from his disappointments of 1960. In that year, he thought he had a commitment from John and Robert Kennedy (who were friendly enough with him to include him in their Georgetown softball games) for the VicePresidential nomination. He did not, of course, get ic The conventional explanation of John F. Kennedy's choice of Johnson was the need for help in the South. Some Jackson partisans, and perhaps Jackson himself, in his heart of hearts, believe that his chances were damaged badly by his inability to deliver the entire Washington delegation at a crucial moment in the done so. Washington would have put Kennedy over the top, as Wyoming ultimately did. In any event, despite Jackson's loyal service as national chairman, the episode began a sickening slide in his relationship with the Kennedys. They largely excluded him from Camelot. They skipped his wedding. “They cut him badly,” says an old friend “and it hurt. Scoop couldn't understand that.” The reasons for the estrangement are not entirely clear; several old Kennedy hands speculated that Jackson's personal style simply did not fit as Camelot, with its professors and Irish pots and pool parties, evolved. In the 1970's, ironically, he ended up closer to Nixon, the old Kennedy adversary, who asked him to he Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, than to the surviving Kennedy. Ted. If Jackson is compulsive, if he is a square, those qualities have stood him in good stead in public life. He has not lost an election in almost four decades in politics, and a Republican official in the state of Washington speaks wistfully of “the man's amazing credibility out here, at a time when people are turned off politicians.” His hard work has enabled him, with a mind that is acquisitive and retentive but neither original nor particularly insightful (he finished about one‐third of the way down in his law‐school class), to become one of the Senate's best‐informed members on detense policy, the environment, energy and the economy. It has enabled him to take on the State Department and the Kremlin on such issues as the Soviet trade agreement. And it has won him respect on Capitol Hill, enough so that a Ralph Nader poll of administrative assistants last year rated him the most effective of the 100 Sen‐ William W. Prochnau, who, with Richard W. Larsen, wrote the only biography of Jackson, thinks Jackson's sensitivity to criticism, coupled with his ideological rigidity, might make him a prisoner within the White House. insulated from the workaday world, much like Johnson and Nixon. Others share that view, emphasizing what they consider the Senator's tendency to surround himself with yesmen. (Golub once argued passionately with Jackson against the Cambodian incursion, to no avail. While Jackson was in the room, all the staff members took his side. The minute he left, several turned to Golub and said, “You're right, Stan. . . .” But, for many years, long before the Kennedys made fashionable, Jackson made good use of expert outside counselors, even if his views have changed astonishingly little since he came to Washington. One reason is his own cast of mind: Slow to reach a decision, Jackson gains a kind of Old Testament certitude once he thinks something through. Those who disagree, or who suggest he consider additional data, are brushed aside. His friends speak of his ability to go to the heart of the matter, his critics of oversimplification. Whoever is right, it is clear that Jackson is no Norwegian Nixon. He is, as his whole career shows, a man who takes and clings to positions—a complete contrast, in this Two examples of his stubbornness: In 1972, it was evident after the Wisconsin primary that he could not win, having made no real impression there or in Florida, Golub, who was trying to raise money, and Salter both urged him to give up the fight, as John V. Lindsay and Edmund S. Muskie soon did. Jackson would have none of it; he stumbled on, exhibiting his occasional propensity for political savagery in Nebraska by coining the phrase “acid, abortion and amnesty” to describe McGovern's platform. Later, On 1979. traveling in China, he was determined to see Premier Chou En‐lai. Every day, he pressed his hosts for an appointment; every day, they replied noncommitally. His companions told him they thought he should drop it, convinced that he was embarrassing the Chinese. But, right up to the last night, with his plane due to leave midmorning the next day, Jackson wheedled and cajoled his guide. Shortly after dawn, the call came through: Get dressed quickly, the Premier will see you immediately. Like any member of Congress, Jackson has been shaped by his constituency, and one particular quirk in Washington State politics has enabled him, in part, to withstand the winds of change. Alone among major states. Washington has a “blanket” primary—meaning that all the candidates for any given office are listed together and that any voter, Republican, Democrat or independent, simply picks the candidate he likes best. This arrangement reduces to the vanishing point the importance of the party in selecting candidates; as a result, the Washington State parties are among the weakest in the nation. It puts a premium on name identification, benefiting incumbents, and inhibits the development of alternative power centers. The result: Once in office, the politician has little to fear, even in times of shifting pub‐ Only seven members of either house of Congress have been on the Hill longer than Jackson. Of these, six (Senators McClellan and Sparkman and Representatives Pat‐man, Mahon, Poage and Mills) are from the Deep South; the seventh is Magnuson. The problems faced by the Republicans in trying to oust Jackson or Magnuson burst into public view in 1970, when C. Montgomery Johnson, then the state Republican chairman, publicly dismissed his entire finance committee. He had discovered that they were all secret Jackson contributors and thus reluctant to raise money for his opponent. “It's the damnedest thing you ever saw,” another Republican says. “Bill Allen would stand up and preach the evils of socialism to a chamber of‐commerce meeting at lunch, the Demo cratic big spenders, then have good old Scoop to dinner the same night.” But it would be a mistake to conclude, the view of those who know him best, that Jackson's storied hawkishness proceeds from his friendship for Allen or from the fact that Boeing has its headquarters in Seattle. His voting record may coincide with Boeing's desires in most cases, but that is because he believes in the same things that Boeing does. He would be the same man, says Prochnau. “if he were the Senator from Idaho.” Golub explains, “He came to the conclusion early that the world was a dangerous place, and he has seen no reason to change his mind since.” Nor has he been under pressure from home to rethink his position. Now that he must appeal to a much wider constituency if he hopes to be nominated for President, there are some indications that he may be making minor tactical modifications. He campaigned last year for Allard Lowenstein, the very man he identified in 1971 as typical of “the absolute radical left fringe” that was “dragging the party down to defeat.” And he bluntly criticized President Ford's show of strength in the Mayaguez. incident, an un‐ ackson is fascinated by the technology of defense. There exists photograph of him, taken in his office, in which he is surrounded by no fewer than nine missile models; he is smiling ‘proudly, like a man surrounded by his children. Moreover, he believes in blustering at those he considers the enemies of the United States. In 1945, he spoke of “the utter bestiality” of the Japanese people. In 1949, he urged that it be made “impossible for the Communists to sell their filthy goods” to the rest of the world. In 1956, he called Nasser “another Hitler.” In 1962, he called on the United States to “draw the line” in Laos. In 1968, at the time of the Pueblo incident, he said he was “afraid we will be getting into the use of nuclear weapons,” presumably against the North Koreans, who captured the ship. And, as late as August, 1971, having muted his earlier views, he was still far more bellicose on Vietnam than most Democratic Senators. Even if offensive U.S. troops were out by the end of 1972, he said, defensive units should remain, and air strikes from carriers and from Thailand should continue. He was certainly the only Democratic contender in 1972 who displayed a captured Chinese AK‐47 automatic rifle in his office, and who said, “Thank God for the miiitary‐ Israel is another consuming passion. Chronologically, it antedates his aspirations for the Presidency by at least 25 years having grown, as far as one can tell, out of a sympathy for underdogs, a visit to Buchenwald that he describes as “searing” and an early lecture from his mother on the repugnancy of the word “kike.” But, in recent years, his allegiance to Jewish causes has also been strongly motivated by political considerations. For both 1972 and 1975, the Jackson contribution lists are studded with the names of Jewish contributors in New York, Miami and California; perhaps as much as 80 percent of the money he raised last year for his 1976 effort came from Jews. The concentration of Jews in New York, furthermore, is one of the reasons Jackson counts on that state as a major element in his grand strategy for next His mistrust of the Soviet Union and his commitment to Israel led him to formulate the Jackson amendment to the U.S.‐Soviet trade bill—a typical piece of Jackson legislative craftsmanship in that it contained what Munro called an “action‐forcing device,” a provision linking trade restrictions to relaxed emigration procedures it didn't work, the Soviets repudiating the agreement on the grounds that it represented an intrusion into their affairs. Neither Kissinger nor Jackson won, as things turned out. Kissinger lost one of the key elements of detente, and Jackson, though apparently not hurt in the Jewish community, suffered a critical setback in his relations with organized labor and especially with George Meany, the octogenarian president of the Jackson had been Meany's favorite in 1972, and in the months that followed the election the two were in constant touch, with Meany delighting in Jackson's positions on the cold war, the Jewish emigration cause, energy and many other issues. But Meany, who opposed détente, had been deeply concerned about the Soviet trade bill, so concerned that lie went to Jackson's office—a rare, imperial visit —to tell the Senator that he, Meany, didn't want to see the trade bill passed and that the amendment wouldn't add up to anything because the Soviets would never honor it. Jackson tried to assure Meany that it would work—which left Meany with the feeling that Jackson was naive and had sold him out. Talking to a friend recently, Meany called the Senator a “welsher” and said Jackson should not get the Democratic nomination. He is less firm, however, about what he would do if Jackson were to be nominated; some of his friends suspect that Meany would swallow hard and make From time to time, Jackson argues that he is one of the few true liberals left, that he has kept the faith while his party has filled up with heretics. From time to time, the left activists in the party accuse him of being a reactionary. The fact is that Jackson, with the exception of those issues involving technology and Communism. has been a moderate—a cautious centrist, trying to balance what he takes to he competing considerations. Almost 30 years ago, The Seattle PostIntelligencer described him as a New Dealer, but “the most conservative member of the Washington State Democrat delegation” to Congress. The still fits. Consider civil rights: He voted for all the landmark bills of the 1960's, but often voted to soften them before final passage and took a strong antibusing stand in 1972. Consider the environment: He won the John Muir Award from the Sierra Club for his conservationist activities, including the creation of new national parks, but he pushed the SST and regularly rails at “environmental extremists” who want to “shut down the economy.” Consider the numbers: Jackson supported Nixon in 1974 45 percent of the time and opposed him 55 percent, according to The Congressional Quarterly; he won a 62 percent rating from the Americans for Democratic Action (compared to 100 percent for Hart of Michigan and 82 percent for both Kennedy and Javits); and, perhaps most telling, on the 303 occasions that year when a majority of both Democrats and Republicans supported a bill, he was with the majority more often‐than any other Senator. Henry Jackson was the man Jackson's hatred of Com‐ Growing up in Everett, Wash.: Four‐year‐old Scoop Jackson, second from left, with neighborhood buddies. munism and his domestic civil‐libertarianism collide( most notably during the McCarthy period. Typically, he played it down the middle. Joseph R. McCarthy had already stirred up a good bit of trouble by the time Jackson ran for the Senate in 1952 against Harry P. Cain, the incumbent Republican. Cain ran an ad showing a Jackson mask falling off, revealing the face of Dean Acheson, who was then under fire as an of the Soviets. McCarthy went to Vancouver and attacked Jackson for voting to disband the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. Jackson hit back: He identified Cain with Senator Glen Taylor and Representative Vito Marcantonio, two pro‐Soviet radicals. and said he had supported the committee “five years before Joe McCarthy ever got to the Senate.” The trouble, he said, was that McCarthy was “hunting headlines instead of hunting Communists.” Jackson won in a year when most Washington Democrats lost; the next year, he was named to and then resigned from, McCarthy's permanent investigation subcommittee. But his resignation was not solely motivated, as he has sometimes suggested, by revulsion at McCarthy's tactics. Contemporary accounts make it clear that part of the problem was a partisan staffing dis‐ Jackson later rejoined the committee, clashed repeatedly with the Wisconsin Republican and voted for his censure. “There were people who wanted to introduce this resolution or that,” Jackson re‐ calls. “I was getting all kinds of advice.

That he will not give up easily; that he will electrify few; that he will be ready to discuss issues in detail, something voters always say they want but seldom respond to; that he will seem too conservative to many liberals, too liberal to many conservatives. His issues—energy, Israel, the environment—are the issues of the day. It would appear that his attempt to balance competing goods, such as the need to preserve some of our wilderness and the need to fuel the economy, might strike a responsive chord in an electorate increasingly suspect of pat solutions. Jackson's energy position, for instance, has been carefully worked out to emphasize simultaneously the need for independence (more solar, thermal, offshore‐drill ing and other development efforts), the need to hold down prices (he is a regular sponsor of price‐control meas‐ Jackson at the Great Wall: His pursuit of an interview with Premier Chou En‐tai was a classic example of his stubbornness. total despoliation of nature (he wants strong controls, rather than prohibition, on offshore drilling). With 3‐1 years in Washington, he is by all odds the most experienced of the Democratic contenders llis nostalgia for traditional values fits President Ford's in some ways, although Jackson seems to long for the America of Samuel Gompers, while Ford longs for that of Warren Harding. In a nation weary of conflict, that may be valuable. But, at the same time, every public‐opinion poll and almost every politician's mail suggests that, however weary America is with the status quo, it no longer feels that conventional politicians are very likely to produce a real solution. Seen from that point of view, Jackson's long identification with the system, both in style and substance, seems Henry Jackson and his backers think he can make it. They point to his strengt h among the Jews. They point to his extraordinary success in raising money, particularly before the new finance law took effect last Jan. 1.

They point to the highly professional, well‐paid campaign staff he has assembled, headed by Robert Keefe. a respected operative who has worked successively for Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana. ocratic National Committee. They point to Jackson's consistently prominent place in the Gallup and the Harris polls. Senator Jackson hopes to lay the base for his campaign in Florida, then plans to move to the front in the New York primary, which will take place earlier this year than ever before and therefore may have more influence on the course of the campaign. By the night of April 6, the date of the New York voting, the Jackson people expect to see him universally regarded as the Democratic front‐runner — a term that has been eschewed so far this time by pundits embarrassed by But it is difficult to find much Jackson enthusiasm among rank‐and‐file voters in any of the key states.

"In Addition to Enthusiasm, It Has Money, Doctrine, Expertise",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/23/archives/in-addition-to-enthusiasm-it-has-money-doctrine-expertise-the.html,"WASHINGTON—The nastiest put‐down that some people can come up with about Ronald Reagan is that he is a George McGovern of the Right. But they seem to forget that George McGovern enlisted the Democratic Party's best workers in 1972, tapped its richest contributors, appealed to its most articulate thinkers and won the Presidential nomination on the first ballot. The Reagan Right in the Republican Party believes it can do all of those things in 1976—and more, of course. For the Republican Right, like the Democratic Left, has the confidence of a political movement that commands not only a secure foothold in one of the two major parties, but zealous cadres of activists, a strong financial base, a body of doctrine on economic, social and foreign policy, its own intellectuals, its own communications network and its own view history. In the silver‐tongued Ronald Reagan, a professional actor and past master of TV persuasion, the organized Right believes it has the best campaigner in politics today and in the popular disenchantment with government—a mood that is fed on a no‐win war Vietnam, high taxes, Watergate scandals, Federal budget deficits and the imminent bankruptcy of New York City—the Right sees the makings of a new mass majority. The fact that Alabama Governor George C. Wallace is striking the same chords in a different key in his campaign for the Democratic nomination warms the Republican Right in the way Liberal Democrats used to be reassured by Nelson Rockefeller's high‐standing in the G.O.P. George Wallace says the message differently and reaches different people with it, but to right wing believers that only means their ideas are bigger than party and broader than the gaps between social classes. The modern American Right has its deepest roots in the South—Mr. Wallace's home, the only region where Senator Barry Goldwater won electoral votes as the Republican nominee in 1964, and now the foundation of the Reagan challenge against President Ford. Most conspicuously in the South, the new Right is movement of one time Democrats, exemplified by men like John B. Connally, the former governor of Texas and Clarke Reed, the influential Republican chairman in Mississippi; it has been supported by thousands of nominal Democrats who elected Senator Jesse Helms in North Carolina and keep electing Senator John Tower in Texas. But the picture of the Southern Republican Right as a rebellious stepchild of the national Democratic Party also applies in several ways to the Right general: Mr. Reagan, after all, is a former Democrat himself; Senator James L. Buckley, ConservativeRepublican of New York, another exemplar of the New Right, got the votes of conservative Catholics who had been accustomed to voting Democratic. Elsewhere the New Right as a political movement has been fueled by an angry populist reaction Lyndon Johnson's Great Society extensions of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Not only has it reaped the harvest of resentment, North and South, against the black revolution of the 1960's; it has had the sympathy more broadly of many middle‐class citizens who felt squeezed by a Democratic alliance of limousine liberals and the newly organized poor. If there is a single thread through the thinking the New Right, it may be the theme of Security: heavily‐armed national security in the face of Communist powers that may not really believe in detente; corporate security for defense industries and more and more government‐connected businesses—as symbolized by the fight for Federal loan guarantees to the Lockheed Corporation; personal security against crime—wherefore Ronald Reagan opposes all gun controls; and a kind of cultural and institutional security not only against abortion on demand and relaxed drug laws, but also Federal influences in local public education and even against the Equal Rights Amendment—which Mr. Reagan opposes; over his daughter's protests. A striking anomaly in the economic thinking of the New Right is its low priority of concern for people who never had much security at all. Among Mr. Reag4n's proudest boasts is that he sliced the welfare rolls when he was Governor of California; he still takes a sternly disapproving view of the foodstamp program. Indeed one of the central puzzles about Mr. Reagan's prospects next year is how much force the New Rights moral postures will carry at time of high unemployment and widespread anxiety ahnnt jobs and incomes. As a political machine the New Right has an unimpressive record. Among elected officials it can claim only a minority of the Republican minority. Its advances in Southern state politics have been halted and in many places reversed. Conservatives Congress suffered somewhat more than their Liberal Republican colleagues in the post‐Watergate losses 1974. Even in California Reaganism was pronounced dead last year when Mr. Reagan's designated heir could not win the Republican nomination to the Governor's office. Yet the positive faith of Right‐Wing politics confirmed by the view that the Nixon landslide 1972 was a conservative mandate. The crucial mistake, in the new hindsight, was nominating Richard Nixon, instead ‘of Ronald Reagan, to the Presidency in 1968, but there is still time to correct that. The McGovern model is not entirely discouraging to those Republicans who want an ideological party. It demonstrated at least that issue‐driven activists can control their party's nomination. Ana for some Rightists, Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, who was Senator McGovern's campaign manager in 1972, is an inverse hero: in his own 1974 campaign, if not in Mr. McGovern's, Mr. Hart used a high intensity base to get started and adroit moves to the center to win the election. The confidence of the Right is that Ronald Reagan is just such a candidate, a Goldwaterite on whom “extremist” labels would not stick in two California campaigns, a true believer who can yet make conservative doctrine sound like sweet to new American majority.

Opponents Still Fight Montclair Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/23/archives/opponents-still-fight-montclair-abortions.html,"MONTCLAIR—For the last three months, a quiet band of pickets has marched in front of the abortion clinic set up by the Pilgrim Medical Group on Bloomfield Avenue. Much of the opposition to the clinic in this middle‐class residential town is directed at State Health Department regulations that permit the facility, which is under the direction of Dr. Herbert Wiskind, to operate. “We were very upset when we heard that Dr, Wiskind had applied for a building permit,” said Mayor Peter Bonastia. “That was the first we heard of it. And we never had any say in the matter at all; it was just pushed down our throats.” “I can't get used to the idea that you can just open a store for the purpose of destroying human life and we can't do anything about it said Mrs. Patrick Plaehn, a registered nurse and organizer of Not in Montclair, the main group behind the opposition and the picketing. “But nobody's talking about it now; a lot of people just don't want to believe it's open.” Nothing to Bar It Pilgrim's application, filed a year ago, was a simple one. There were no zoning problems and no local ordinances that could pre‐empt the Supreme Court decision on abortion, which forbids its prohibition in the first three months of pregnancy. State Health Department approval was contingent on a site‐plan review and on the presentation of a Pilgrim survey of local hospitals indicating a need for the facilities in the Not In Montclair joined forces last spring with the Essex County Right to Life group and acquired 5,000 signatures on a petition condemning establishment of the clinic; the petition was then presented to Governor Byrne, State Health Department officials and Mayor Bonastia. Later, more than 1,000 residents attended a Town Commission meeting at which they urged municipal opposition; however, a bid for a local referendum on the question was rejected by town officials as not legally viable because of the Supreme Court decision. The Commission's opposition focused on the usurpation of home rule by the state. Ralph D'Andrea, the Montclair Health Commissioner, contends that Pilgrim's .hospital survey, al‐ though approved by the state, did not include Montclair's three institutions. “There may be a need for a clinic in larger cities like Newark, Irvington or. Elizabeth,” he said. “But there was no need in Montclair. No one consulted our Health Department, OS our nursing or family services.” Mr. D'Andrea said that three Newark‐based organizations were strong supporters of Pilgrim's bid: the Greater Newark Urban Coalition, Community Information and Referral Services Inc. and the Newark Victoria Plan. “If the need was in Newark, let them put the clinic there,” Mayor Bonastia said. “We did all we could, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not totally opposed to abortion per se, but no town's going to want that on its doorstep.” Not In Montclair, unlike the town officials, objects primarily to the lack of state regulations for clinics. Residents also object strongly to regulations that allow minors to demand abortions without parental permission. Dr. Wiskind, who has said “I am the Pilgrim Medical Group,” asserted that he chose Montclair as a clinic site because of its central location and accessibility to transportation. He estimated that the center had treated 300 women since August, with most of the patients middle class, from local towns and with an average age of 30. Dr. Wiskind said he had received support from several Protestant churches in Montclair, as well as from the local chapter of the ecumenical Coalition of Religions. The clinic's staff of 16, including two full‐time physicians, does not encourage walk‐in patients; almost all are referred. Since the $175 fee does not include postoperative treatment, the group will refer a woman to a doctor in her own town if she does not have one already. The fee does not include testing for venereal disease, vaginal infections or sickle cell anemia. There is no birth‐control counseling apart from the abortion procedure. “This was a principle thing with me,” Dr. Wiskind asserted. “I had to give up my private practice because of injuries from a car accident. I have always believed that, if abortion is going to be available, it should be provided in a medically safe way.” Abortion clinics in New Jersey are now controlled by what Douglas Derry, a Health Department attorney, described as “interim regulations.” Mr. Derry said the package would probably be reviewed in the near future for possible revisions. Other clinics like Pilgrim are now operating in Jersey City and Atlantic City."
Choosing a Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/25/archives/choosing-a-justice-factors-considered-in-past-discussed-as-capital.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 —From the moment William O. Douglas retired as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court Nov. 12 because of poor health, one of the biggest questions in town has been who his successor News will be. But almost Analysis as big a question, here and in courts and law schools across the country, is on what basis that successor should be chosen. Should the successor be a woman?” Someone with prior judicial experience? A Jew? A “public person” from government or politics? A Republican? What. ‐role should the Senate play in the President's choice‐and what role geography? How important is an endorsement from thL–American.Bar Association—and how important is the nominee's age? Such are the questions under debate, and there is little if any consensus, on the answers. The only things most people agree on are that the court's 101st Justice should he bright and talented enough to do the court's work—and that in this nomination as in scores before a variety of factors other than talent will determine the, choice. In the past, those factors, have included race, in the appointment of Thurgood Marshall; prior judicial experience, as in several of President Eisennower's appointments; political party loyalty, as in Thomas Jefferson's appointment of William Johnson, a Republican, in 1804, and the need of getting quick Senate confirmation, as when Grover Cleveland appointed Senator Edward Douglas White in 1894 after the Senate had rejected his first, two nominees. Only once, it seems, was there a great groundswell for one candidate in particular solely on the grounds of legal talent—in 1932, when Oliver Wendell Homes retired from the Supreme Court, and law school deans, political leaders and newspapers all called for the appointment of Benjamin Cardozo to the Holmes seat. Even then, some of the other traditional factors may have come into play. ‐Cardozo was a Jew and a New Yorker. President Hoover waited a month before appointing him and there are some who think that the reason for the delay was worry that the Court ...already had one Jew and two New Yorkers. Some Senate Advice In the 12 days since Justice Douglas retired, various inchviduals and groups have offered suggestions on what factors President Ford should eonsider. Nome groups have demanded a woman; some, privately at ‘aast, have said the Court should once again have a Jew‐ h seat; some New Yorkers have complained that no one from their state was on either of the two lists of possible nominees given to the ‐American Bar Association for screening. Last‐ Friclay Senators Edward n. Kennedy, Democrat of Masachusetts; James Abourezk, Democrat of South Dakota, and Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, held an informal and unofcial hearing on the subject, an the theory that the Senate 4‐ould act affirmatively to “adise” the Presdent. The testimony Was often con‐ tradictory. Robert Meserve, former president of the American Bar Association, contended that polititcal or legislative experience was no substitute for professional experience. Dean Louis’ H. Pollack, of the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, disagreed. The testimony did, however,1 suggest a starting pOint for picking a Justice: Looking at precisely what the job entails. As Professor A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School told the Senators, the Court really performs three functions, each of which should be taken into consideration, according to this view: It is a “law court,” meaning that it must decide often complicated legal issues. Thus, a Justice must be able to perform traditional judicial roles. It is a place for resolving important social issues—or ar another witness, the historian Alfred H. Kelly; said, “a new kind of legislative body,” passing on such matters as abortion and the death penalty. Third, if is, in Professor Howard's words, “a mirror of the American people,” a place to which people “whose aspirations have been submerged” look for help. ..Relevancy to Date. In view of these three roles, how relevant are the various factors that have been suggested as important considerations? Judical experience would clearly help in the first role. But at the same time, as Professor Kelly pointed out, some of the great Justices had no prior judicial experience—Felix Frankfurter, for instance. Endorsement by the bar would also seem to suggest a candidate's ability to perform in this first area. But Justice Louis D. Brandeis, one of the great jurists to serve on the Court, was opposed by seven former A.B.A. presidents as unfit when President Wilson nominated him in 1916. Public service, in Congress or Cabinet or state government, perhaps, would seem to be an important consideration in view of the second role Professor Howard described, the role of mediating social change. Several other witnesses agreed; beyond that, history shows that many past Justices were, in their earlier lives, Congressmeri or'diplomats or other kinds of officials for the Court's third role, as a mirror of the American people, a number of factors seem relevant—sex, race, religion, geography. One line of thought argues that “one of each” in each category shotild be represented on the Court. This would be impossible without greatly expanding the number of Justices But it would be possible, as Dean Pollak noted at the Senators! hearing, at least to give all groups access over a period of time. The barrier against Jews has already been broken, he suggested, so the point has been made, and it is not necessary to appoint one now. So, too, with blacks. But there has yet to be a woman on the Court. “Very soon,” Dean Pollak said, “it becomes appropriate for a President to give affirmative consideration” to choosing a woman."
Mexican Families Are Wary of the Birth Control :Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/27/archives/mexican-families-are-wary-of-the-birth-control-clinic.html,"TEPOZTLAN, Mexico—Rebecca Martinez, 35 years old, her bare feet caked with mud, fatigue on her face, sat on chair in her small front yard and cradled Emilio, 3 months old, her seventh child in 12 years. Her husband, Miguel, ‘watchman at the Datsun factory who makes $47 a week, sat next to her and spoke for both of them, as she evidently wished him to. Mr. MarJinez, 45, who wore boots, looked younger, healthier and more vigorous than his wife. A former neighbor asked if the Martinezes wanted more children. It is a question the Government is trying to get all adult Mexicans to ask themselves; a question whose very ,asking, the Government hopes, will lead to smaller families and ‘a slowdown in population :growth. “Life is very expensive and we already haVe seven,” Mr. Martinez said, as if apologizing for a bad thought. The former neighbor suggested that the local free health clinic could he helpful. “I'm sure the doctors know all about that,” Mr. Martinez replied with thinly veiled hostility. Not Been to Clinic Mrs. Martinez has never been to the clinic in this village of 8,000 persons 50 miles south of Mexico City. Her seven babies were horn at home. Her husband explained that she didn't want to he delivered at that clinic because “the next morning they would make her get up and walk around.” Other interviews in Teportlan also indicated a desire to limit family size, but at the same time a reluctance to seek professional advice or admit to contraceptive practices. The conflict explains in part why Mexico's population growth rate accelerated in 1960‐70 to 3.43 percent a year, one of the highest in the world, while elsewhere in Latin America rates were ,slowing. In the view of the Government, a population growth rate of 3.5 percent jeopardizes further rises in living standards and threatens to create huge, unmanageable cities. Already Greater Mexico City's population approaches 10 million, the subway is overtaxed, and the traffic situation in the city center is a nightmare. Mexico's population of 58 million is projected to exceed 100 million before 1990. Such figures imply a tremendous burden on health care, schooling and other public services, and on the economy. For these reasons, the Government began two years ago to suggest voluntary limitations on family size. It was a radical change for this heavily Roman Catholic country. The theme has been expressed in stages. In Phase One, the slogan was “let's make ouri selves fewer. to live better.” Now, the Phase Two slogan on posters, radio and television is “The small family lives better.” In Phase Three, to start in January, the Government will, tell Mexicans directly to visit clinics or consult doctors for advice on family planning, according to Ramon Ojeda Mast re, the general coordinator of the National Population! office buildings, Mr. Ojeda said that of 13.5 million women of child‐bearing age in Mexico, 1.5 million were actively enrolled in family‐planning programs. That represented rapid growth from 250,000 participants year ago, he said, “but it is still nothing in comparison with our problem.” Mexico's population is growing explosively because death rates, especially among infants, have dropped, while the fertility rate has remained high. A 1964 study found that (Mexico City women averaged 3.27 live births more than the rate in seven other large Latin ‘American cities, and rural fertility rate was higher still, according to a paper by Thomas G. Sanders, a population specialist. The paper, “Mexico 1974: Demographic Patterns and Population Policy,” was published last year by the American Universities field staff at Hanover. N.H. “The factors favoring high fertility, while declining, continue strong,” Mr. Sanders wrote. Those factors include high degree of illiteracy, a large rural population and a low rate of employment among women, about 10 percent. Critics contend that the program is too mild and too limited in resources. They contend that to reach into the urban slums, the small villages and farms, the Government must be more assertive. Mr. Ojeda, a 31‐year‐old lawyer with a doctorate in public administration, commented pointedly that the program included a Constitutional amendment that, in his words, guaranteed to every person the right “to decide in a free, responsible and informed way about the number and spacing of children.” In other words, Mr. Ojeda says, compulsion is prohibited. A Priest's Illustration A Roman Catholic priest in Teportlan suggests that even if compulsion were not constitutionally banned it would not ‘to register their children for school they had to have check‐up. The husbands got very angry and wouldn't let their wives see the doctor. Instead, they registered their kids in another school.” Father Campos personally favors the program, despite the Vatican's official disapproval of contraception by mechanical, means. He said he meets with groups of parents to discuss children, education and family planning. He does not discuss limiting family size in his sermons, he said, “because of the children” who attend mass. Expansion Assessed Father Campos wore a blue sports, shirt and slacks during a Sunday afternoon interview across his small wooden desk lin the Church of the Nativity. He said he stresses individual choice and responsibility to his parishioners in family planning and other matters so that they will learn to make decisions independently of the church. He noted that the Roman Catholic church in Mexico had not opposed family planning and in fact had sanctioned it in an episcopal letter. Nor, according to Mr. Ojeda of the National Population Council, is there significant political opposition. He noted that the man who is expected to become Mexico's next president a year from now, Jose LOpez Portillo, has repeatedly endorsed the program. President Luis Echeverria Al‐ varez campaigned in 1970 in favor of population growth, but reversed himself in office as aides underscored the economic and the social costs of Mexico's population trend. Mr. Ojeda said the resources devoted to family planning would‐ have to expand by 20 percent a year until 1980 to make the program available to all women of child‐bearing age. Counseling and clinical work are offered through existing Government‐related health‐care organizations, with pills paid for by the Government. Mr. Ojeda said expansion would not run into bureau. cratie opposition from other health services within clinics and mother‐child care centers. They have found, he said, that family planning cuts costs such as those for prenatal care, milk for babies and treatment of women suffering from postabortion complications. Abortions are largely illegal in Mexico. No official goals have been set. Mr. Ojeda emphasized that population trends shift slowly. For example, he said, because of the growing number of persons of reproductive age in Mexico, no decline in the absolute number of births is likely before 1985. Until then, the council hopes to avoid any increase from the present 2.7 million a year, he said. I Mr. Ojeda declared that traIditional attitudes in Mexico were changing rapidly. However, he conceded that family planning received a weak acceptance among farm workers and the growing number of urban poor. In Teportlan, it is “the ones with more education who accept the idea,” said Mrs. Lazero Royas Ayala, wife of an assistant to a physician. Adding that; few people attended talks at the health clinic, she corn‐ mented, “women often say, don't want more children bu my. husband doesn't accept not Father Campos had a different explanation for resistance to family planning. “Poor women keep having children be‐ cause they believe it's a sin to try to control it,” he said. “The men would like to stop having children. It's too expensive.” It may be that the chief family‐planning counselor in Teportlan is 53‐year‐old Juan Garcia Jimenez, the “herb doctor” who lays out his wares on Sunday at the market. He has herbs “for sexual disability,” for stomach iriflamation, for “bruises, internal and exteinal,” for preparing contraceptive mixes and to in‐ duce abortion. Pointing to a herb he called “zopatle,’ Mr. Jiminez, speaking confidently and fluently, explained that “if you'ie two months pregnant, you make’ tea with it, drink it tepid and massage the abdomen. However, “if you're three months pregnant you'll get a hemorrhage.” “Many women come to don.sult me,” Mr. Jiminez said. “They are not. embarrassed.”, A Mexican poster reads, “Thinking about your children? Then think about how to make a better future for them. And remember: The small family lives better. Let's make ourselves fewer so that we all live better.”"
ABORTION IN ITALY A POLITICAL ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/30/archives/abortion-in-italy-a-political-issue-christian-democrats-aided-on.html,"ROME, Nov. 29 — A small group of women shouted and sang outside the Chamber of Deputies this week, stopped traffic, handed out leaflets and condemned both the political right and left. They were campaigning for “free abortion” and they were clearly unhappy about an unusual alliance on the issue between the dominant Christian Democrats and the Communist Party. Their posters proclaimed “no” to both parties and “yes” to liberalized abortion laws now. “I've never seen a Communist member of the chamber go in the back door to avoid a demonstration,” said one deputy at the front door. “They better he careful or they'll have the women against them.” Measure Being Drafted The abortion issue has developed a one of the most controversial around. After two months of work, a parliamentary committee is in the final stages of drafting legislation that would revise the present abortion laws dating from the Fascist 1930's. The feminists are agitating and holding rallies. Politicians constantly are being asked for their views on the issue. And at least 800,000 Italians felt strongly enough about it to sign a petition seeking a referendum next summer. Rather than face the referendum, the Government of Prime Minister Aldo Moro has decided to change the law. But the changes the Christian Democrats and the. Communists are backing do not seem satisfactory to the other parties in Parliament and even less to the women activists. In political terms, the Communists are staying close to the Christian Democrats for several reasons. Their longterm objective is the “historical compromise” of shared power with the Christian. Democrats and in this case they want to demonstrate that they can work with the dominant party of the land. Base of Agreement “The Communists have made it all a political issue,” said Renato Altissimo of the Liberal Party. “What really interested them was not so much the problem of abortion but the possibility of finding a base of agreement with the Christian Democrats.” The Communists deny the charges, say they merely are following the lines of agreement in committee and are willing to go along with some changes. Others say, however, that the Communists apart from their interest in demonstrating a cooperative spirit with the Christian Democrats, do not want to further antagonize the Roman Catholic Church, which strongly opposes any kind of legalization of abortion. Whatever the reasons, the basic issue has come clown to this: should the woman make the decision on an abortion or should the doctor, with his judgment guided by certain legal limits. “The freedom of choice is just not offered to women,” said one women activist. Conditions Set Under the pending bill, abortion would be permitted in the first 90 days of pregnancy if the mother's physical or mental health is threatened, if she can, prove dire economic or social consequences if there is a risk of a malformed baby or if the pregnancy results from rape or incest. The decision would be up to the doctor selected by the @health council of the local hospital. If he agrees, then the abortion would he carried out without charge. The Socialist Party, the their largest after the Christian Democrats and the Communists, joined the women activists with a statement this week sayin that the present bill “is very uncertain and dangerous cause it subordinates the granting of an abortion to the ?? trary and subjective views O. a doctor.” Other critics the bill would still permit abortions mainly for the privileged few, those who could afford to pay doctors willing to pro‐. vide approval. In any event, even the pending bill would be a major step forward for Italy's reformers. At present, the rich obtain abortions by Going to private clinics here for “miscarriages” or flying to London and other places where such operations are legal. As the feminists point out, the problem in Italy focuses on the poor, who now usually have abortions in back‐street homes. Sometimes a medical amateur merely initiated the abortion so that the woman can go to a public hospital and claim the onset of a miscarriage. Feminists argue that they do not want freedom of choice for the women merely so they can use abortion as a method of contraception. The activists regard it as a necessity in a nation where schools provide no sex education and where the infant mortality rate is second only to Portugal's in Western Europe. Estimates on the number of abortions now carried out in Italy vary. The Government says 800,000 the United Nations, 1.2 million and the Italian gynecologists estimate the total as high as three million."
Anti‐Abortion Candidate for President,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/30/archives/antiabortion-candidate-for-president.html,"MERRICK—Ellen McCormack, who announced her Presidential candidacy in Boston recently, is an unusual figure in American national politics. For one thing, the average voter has never heard of her. A mother of four children and an activist in the antiabortion movement, Mrs. McCormack, an enrolled Democrat, is working from an untraditional political base. She is the only woman Democratic aspirant for President in a field of 10 or more—all well‐known politicians. A representative of people who oppose abortion, Mrs. McCormack said she also spoke for a broad range of dissatisfied people in this country who believe they are not being truly represented in Congress. Long Island volunteers on the Pro‐Life Action Committee, an independent group active in 27 states, consist of a core of 12 members assisting Mrs. McCormack's campaign. They have access to 1,000 people throughout New York State — names they have garnered from the Right to Life organization's mailing list. The group also claims support from the Long Island Coalition for Life, an umbrella organization with 78 member groups in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. According to Mrs. McCormack, the Long Island Coalition represents 50,000 people who are supporting her candidacy. About $12,000 for her campaign has been raised in the two counties. Asked if she really expected to receive the Democratic nomination, Mrs. McCormack parried the question, answering only that her effort was “absolutely serious.” Asked if she was not one‐issue candidate, she replied: “I don't care if ‘they scold me on that. I am basically a one‐issue candidate.” Amendment Sought An important part of her campaign will be to seek support for a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion. Recently she has been joined in this fight by the country's Roman. Catholic bishops, who have intensified the church's fight against abortion by approving a plan to set up nonsectarian “pro‐life” groups in each Congressional district. This program would work to persuade members of Congress to vote for a constitutional amendment banning abortions. As for the Supreme Court, Mrs. McCormack is convinced that its ruling upholding women's right to abortion does not reflect the opinion of most women. On the other Democratic candidates for the Presidential nomination, she says: “I don't sec anyone on any ticket I could vote for. If the right to life issue is at the bottom of their priorities, cannot support them.” Mrs. McCormack says she will enter the New Hampshire primary of Feb. 24 and the Massachusetts primary, on March 2. She will concentrate on one appearance in each of those states. Three Right to Life television commercials have already been produced, to be shown on prime time. Mrs. McCormack is encouraged by the new campaign finance law that went into effect last January. It provides that if a Presidential primary candidate can raise at least $5,000 in 20 states with no one person giving more than $250, the Federal Government will provide matching funds equal to whatever the candidate raises. A Different Background To date, the McCormack committee has received $5,000 each from New York‐; Nebraska, Wisconsin and Indiana. Next week it hopes to come up with the same amount from South Dakota, Colorado, Kentucky and, New Jersey. Mrs. McCormack's background is quite 31ifferent from that of most persons who seek to be President. She has no experience • in state or national campaigns, she is not a lawyer, she did not go to college, she does not associate with political professionals and she has never worked for a political party.. “I think they would ‘like to pretend I'm not here” she said about the local political leaders.. Living in Merrick for the last 20 years, the youthfullooking grandmother was raised in Brooklyn; where she attended parochial high school. She is married to a New York City deputy police inspector who she says is “very supportive” of her political ambitions. A ‘Roman Catholic, Mrs. McCormack has not sought church backing for her condidacy. Nor has the church acknowledged her campaign. She believes if she can induce more people to get into the political arena, “then I've achieved one goal.” “If things have gotten so bad that a housewife from Merrick says she is running for President, then it's time for a change,” she said."

Justices Let Stand a Ban on Abortions At Government‐Aided Private Hospital,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/02/archives/justices-let-stand-a-ban-on-abortions-at-governmentaided-private.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 1—The Supreme Court refused today to review—and thug left in erred — a lower‐court ruling that permitted a private but Government‐funded hospital to forbit a doctor to perform abortions there. The Court's action broke trom recent pattern in abortion teases, in which it has generally agreed to review lower court decisions limiting the availability of abortions. Those decisions, as well as many recent pro‐abortion rulings, in the lower courts, have involved various legal issues that were left either unanswered or at least unclear in the wake of the Supreme Ceugt's landmark 1973 abortion rulings. The rulings struck don state laws that flatly forbade abortions and held that the decision of whether to have an abortion is basically a private one to be made by a woman and her doctor. Earlier this year, the Court seahe stage for a broad review ok the aftermath of its 1972 rulings, accepting several cases that raised a range of subsidiary questions. However, the issue in the case that the Court declined today is not among them. Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent against the refusal to, take the case and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in. “The task of policing this. hurt's decisions in Roe V Wade and Doe V. Bolton [the 1973 cases] is a difficult one,” Justice White wrote, “but having exercised its power as i?? did, the Court has a responsibility to resolve the problems arising in the wake of those decisions.” The hospital involved in today's case is Orange Memorial in Orange County, Tex. It was built by the county government with both local government money and Federal funds. The hospital and the land on which it was built was owned by the county. In 1957, the county leased the hospital and the land to a nonprofit organization set up to run the hospital. The doctor involved in the case, John C. Greco, joined the staff in 1960. In 1973, shortly after the Supreme Court's rulings in the Roe and Doe cases, he began to perform elective—as opposed to medically necessitated — abortions there. The board of directors of the hospital corporation adopted a motion by the medical staff preventing further elective, or nontherapeutic, abortions. The doctor sued to change the rules. The Federal District Court ruled that if the hospital were a public hospital it would have to permit abortions but that since it was private it did not have to. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed—but for mixed reasons. Two of the three judges agreed with the district court that the hospital was not public and thus, since there was no state or government action, there was no constitutional violation. The third judge apparently disagreed on whether there was enough governmental involvement to add up to state action but found no duty to allow abortions in any event. In the brief that his attorney filed with the Supreme Court, Dr. Greco contended: “This court's decision on abortion, like its decision on desegregation, is extremely unpopular in some quarters of the nation. The decision by the court below opens the opportunity for serious mischief on the part of local governments. “The practice of turning over essentially governmental operations to private individuals in order to avoid the mandates of our Constitution has reached a high art following this Court's decisions in the area of desegregation. This Court has uniformly struck down such attempts. “Constitutional rights do not exist in a vacuum. This Court should make it clear to Governmental officials that they cannot avoid the difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions required by our. Constitution simply by transfering facilities constructed with the tax dollars of citizens into so‐called private institutions.” The dissenters noted today that courts in other areas had ruled to the contrary on each rationale used by the Fifth Circuit. “Perhaps, in light of current pressures on our docket, there may be a category of conflicts, involving insignificant points of Federal law, which we simply do not have the capacity to resolve,” the dissent said. “However, it would undoubtedly surprise members of the bar and the public that this Court views the conflicts created by the decision below to fall within such a category.”"
Supreme Court's Actions,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/02/archives/supreme-courts-actions.html,"ABORTION Over the dissents of Justice Byron R. White and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Court declined to review a case raising the issue of whether a private hospital that is largely Governmentfunded may refuse to let a doctor perform abortions there. The lower court had ruled that there was no constitutional bar to the hospital's refusal. (Greco v. Orange Memorial Hospital Corp., No. 75–432). WASHINGTON, Dec. 1‐The supreme court took me following actions today: [News article, this page.] CRIMINAL The Court turned down two opportunities to define further the extent of a defendant's right to be represented by a lawyer in a criminal case. In one case, Harris v. Virginia,” No. 75–205, the Court refused without comment to review a lower court ruling upholding the designation of a Virginia man as a “habitual offender” of the motor vehicle laws — a designation, based on three earlier convictions of violating those laws. Two of those convictions had come in cases in which the defendant was not represented by counsel. The defendant had argued that since he had no counsel, and since those two cases had each involved a possible jail term, the convictions were void under the Supreme Court's earlier right‐to‐counsel rulings. In the second case, Ohio v. Tymcio, No. 75–172, the lower court had ruled that defendants in cases involving possible jail terms must be given court‐appointed counsel when “an accused is financially able, in whole or in part, to obtain the assistance o counself, but is unable to do so for whatever reason.” The Ohio court had liased its ruling in part on previous Supreme Court right‐to‐counsel rulings; the Supreme Court declined to review it, however, saying that the decision appeared to rest “on adequate state grounds.” The Court did, however. further define the extent of another constitutional right —the right to a speedy trial. Last year the Court ruled that this right comes into play as soon as a defendant is indicted. Today, in Dillingham v. U.S., No. 74–6738, the Court ruled as it implied in last year's case—that the right also comes into play when someone is arrested. So, in measuring a defendant's claim that he or she has been denied the right to a speedy trial, the time period to be considered is the period between trial and either arrest or indictment, whichever comes first. Chief Justice Burger dissented from today's ruling. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT Following the suggestion of Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, the Court declined to review a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that ordered the merging of racialy segregated union locals for longshoremen in Texas Gulf Coast ports. (International Longshoremen's Assn. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, No. 75–356.) A Federal District Court had found that the racial segregation deprived blacks and in some cases MexicanAmericans of equal employment opportunities because of their race but had ordered only that hiring halls be racially merged. The appeals court had said that the merger of the locals themselves was necessary. Thirty‐seven locals were involved — 16 white, 19 black, two predominantly Mexican‐American. REGULATORY AGENCIES The Court declined to hear two challenges to a lower court ruling that upheld a Federal Power Commission action involving a curtailment plan for customers of natural gas. (Pacific Lighting Service Co. v. Federal Power Commission, No. 75–350; Calif. and Pub. Utilities Commission of Calif. v. Federal Power Commission, No. 75– 359). [News article, Page 57] SCHOOL DESEGREGATION The Court declined to review—and thus left in effect —an appeals court ruling that could lead to extensive busing of students in Dayton, Ohio. The case was Dayton Bd. of Education v. Brinkman, No. 75–403. A Federal District Court had found that segregation existed in the schools and had ordered certain desegregation steps. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit then affirmed the finding of segregation but ordered a extensive remedy. VOTING The Court also refused to review a case involving three suburbs of New Haven, Conn., that raised the issue of whether the one personone vote principle applied to selection of Members of regional school boards. Both the Federal District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the principle did apply and thus struck down the system in which the regional board for the three towns—Orange, Bethany and Woodbridge—was made up of three members from each town, despite differences in sizes of the town. The appeals court reasoned: “Here we have school districts in which those towns which are paying the most. for the districts' support have to accept a diluted vote in the running of the schools.” (Regional High School Dist. No. 5 v. Baker, 75–496). WATERGATE Without comment, the Court declined to review the unsuccessful effort of a Vermont voter to have the 1972 Presidential election results invalidated because of the way the campaign was waged. (Griffith v. Nixon, No. 75–417). ZONING The Court declined to review the New York Court of Appeals decision that municipalities can use the zoning power to provide for housing for the elderly. (Maildini v. Ambro, No. 75– 378.) [News article, Page 43]"
CITY AGENCY WINS AN ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/05/archives/city-agency-wins-an-abortion-case-state-high-court-says-it-may.html,"The right of the City Health Department to require physicians to report names and addresses of all women receiving abortions in the city was upheld yesterday by the State Court of Appeals The decision was a narrow one, 4 to 3, with sharply Worded written dissents by Judges Sol Wachtler and Jacob D. Fuchsberg. By implication, the effect of the decision will be statewide, since the state has a similar requirement for reporting the women's names and addresses. It will also apply to out‐ofstate women who come here for abortions. The case originated when Dr. Harold Schulman, director of obstetrics at Bronx Municipal Hospital, and a patient referred to as Jane Doe asked that the City Health Department regugation be set aside because they said it violated a woman's constitutional right to privacy. The Majority Opinion Judge Domenick Gabrielli. wrote the majority opinion on behalf of himself, Chief Judge Charles D. Breitel and Judges Matthew J. Jasen and Hugh R. James. In his 13‐page opinion, Judge Gabrielli said all four judges “do not necessarily agree that each of the city's articulated objectives is sufficient to sustain this mandatory reporting requirement.” However, he said that “all do agree that the reporting requirement with centralized computer recording does enable the city to obtain and have usefully available current statistical data on the basis of which to discharge the city's responsibility for effective, upto‐date monitoring of abortion practices as well as to plan for the availability and distribution of services and facilities.” The opinion holds that the required reporting “does not infringe” on a woman's right to an abortion” or interfere with a woman's decision to have an abortion.” It also says that “the city has adequately assured” that the information about the patients “is cloaked by confidentiality and shielded from disclosure to unauthorized persons.” The Health Department Code requiring the information provides that it “shall not be subject to subpoena or to inspection of persons other than the Commissioner of authorized personnel of the department.” Judge Wachtler, in a fivepage dissent, declared that “in my view the right to privacy, which the Supreme Court extended to a woman's decision to abort, necessarily extends to and includes her right to guard her identity from a centralized abortion registry,” and “keep her intimate decisions personal.” A 10‐Page Dissent Conceding that the compilation of public health data was necessary, Judge Wachtler as serted it could be obtained concerning abortions in another manner, using coded numbers instead of names. Judge Fuchsberg, in a 10‐page dissent, declared that “abortion is still an emotionally charged and heavily politicized topic,” adding that “many groups within our society still would stigmatize women involved in abortions if they could do so.” This “potential for stigmatization,” Judge Fuchsberg asserted, “is multiplied by the unnecessary collection and cen tralization” of the information sought. Judge Lawrence H. Cook concurred with both dissenting opinions."

Blumenthal—coupled with an earlier indictment of another Democratic ??ative leader, Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut—will adversely affect the Democratic Party in next year's elections for the Legislature, particularly if one or both indictments resu?? in convictions, in the view, of both Democratic and Republican politicians. News Analysis They also agreed that the indictment of Mr. Blumenthal might have a devastating impact on a career that his colleagues agree was built on integrity and had reached a peak only in the last year, when he was elected majority leader of the Assembly. A's occupant of that post since January, Mr. Blumenthal, a 47‐year‐old West Side Democrat, has been the chief spokesman for his party's position in the lower house. He has been considered the likely heir‐apparent to Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut, who played a major role in Mr. Blumenthal's rise to the top in the Legislature. Mr. Steingut, who has been indicted in Brooklyn on charges of promising a job in exchange for a campaign contribution for his son, is also under investigation by the special grand jury on nursing homes that indicted Mr. Blumenthal. G.O.P. Plight Recalled The legal cloud over the two Democratic leaders of the Assembly will undoubtedly help Republicans in their effort to recapture control of the AsStably. The G.O.P. lost its majority last year after two Republican legislative leaders—then Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea and his majority leader John E. Kingston—were indicted on charges of violation of the election law. The indictments were ultimately dismissed on the ground that the section of the election law that was involved was unconstitutional. If the Republicans regained control, Mr. Duryea would undoubtedly again be the Speaker Mr. Kingston was defeated for re‐election last year. While the indictments of Mr. Duryea and Mr. Kingston may have an effect at the polls, they had little impact on legislative operations, with both remaining in their posts and apparently having little problem exerting their leadership. In fact, there was a general rallying around the two by other legislators, including the opposition party, particularly since there was considerable doubt from the start whether the two Republicans would be convicted. There already is evidence of as similar “club” attitude concerning Mr. Steingut and Mr. Blumenthal. Both were openly supported by their colleagues when the news of the indictments reached Adbany. Politican friends of Mr. Blumenthal, who ran unsuccess fully for Mayor of New York City in 1973, said he had been happy in his work as majority leader in the Legislature, and satisfied to chart his political future there. Promotion to Speaker, if the Democrats retain their majority in the Assembly, would appear a natural course for the West Sider, who began his political career as a liberal enfant terrible who did not hesitate to tangle with party anti legislative leaders, or to get involved with such politically delicate subjects as abortion and divorce. The AbortIon Issue The five‐year‐long effort to liberalize the state's abortion law, which Mr. Blumenthal spearheaded and which succeeded in 1970, proved to be a launching pad for his political career. Although he was a relative newcomer to the Legislature, having been elected first in 1962, Mr. Blumenthal became well known through the abortion issue. It also gave him the opportunity to demonstrate that he was one of the most articulate members of the Legislature and a legislator of uncommonly strong conviction. Even those who bitterly opposed him, generally respected him. As one of the most visible liberals in the Assembly, Mr. Blumenthal became the de facto leader of a growing number of young liberal legislators—many of whom sprang from the Presidential campaigns of Senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern. This unofficial leadership proved to be the key to the next jump forward in Mr. Blumenthal's career—his link with Mr. Steingut. In 1969 he lined up liberal Democratic legislators for Mr. Steingut's bid to be minority leader. Mr. Steingut was elected and Mr. Blumenthal's reward was a newly created post of deputy minority leader. Provided an Aura Mr. Blumenthal provided Mr. Steingut, a charter member of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, with a liberal aura, an ability forcefully to champion or defend a position that even Mr. Steingut's friends concede the Speaker sorely lacks. But Mr. Blumenthal has paid a price for his success and his ties to Mr. Steingut. Some West Side Democrats introduced resolutions in their clubs earlier this year to censure Mr. Blumenthal for his support of Mr. Steingut, a close ally and former business partner of Meade H. Esposito the Brooklyn Democratic leader. The resolutions failed when Mr. Blumenthal went before some clubs to defend the necessity for working within the Establishment. “It's a pragmatic necessity to work with people of widely differing views in the Legislature to get anything done,” Mr. Blumenthal said at one point, adding: “I don't think it makes me any less of a reformer.”"
ROME ABORTION BILL CLEARS AN OBSTACLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/07/archives/rome-abortion-bill-clears-an-obstacle.html,"ROME, Dec. 6 (Reuters)—A bill to legalize abortion in Italy has cleared a major hurdle here, with the defeat of an amendment that sought to classify abortion as a punishable offense except under certain circumstances. The Christian Democrảtic Party, which has close links with the Roman Catholic Church, tried to amend the draft bill in parliamentary committee this week so that abortion would remain an offense, but one that could not be pun ished in certain circumstances. These would include danger to the mother's physical or mental health, danger or deformity in the child, economic harm to the family and incest and rape. The draft bill would permit abortion under just these circumstances during the first 90 day of pregnancy. The bill's approval is now expected because the alternative would be a referendum next year on abolishing all laws relating to abortion. The draft bill had been strongly criticized by abortion law reformers because it left the decision on whether to operate with doctors rather than with the woman concerned. Tonight some 10,000 women marched through central Rome demanding the legalization of abortion. The demonstration was the largest such rally held in Italy."
Opinions by Stevens Hint Attitudes of Nominee to Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/08/archives/opinions-by-stevens-hint-attitudes-of-nominee-to-court.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The Senate Judiciary Committee begins tomorrow its confirmation hearings on President Ford's nominee to the Supreme Court, John Paul Stevens, a Federal appeals court judge whose written opinions have followed established procedures rather than a political or legal ideology. Those opinions, written over the last five years, show the following: ¶A deep respect for precedent. ¶Reluctance to go beyond the facts and law involved in a case, a reluctance to reach out, as the Supreme Court often did in the Warren era, and expand on earlier interpretations of the Constitution. ¶A trust in the legal system, in judges and in lawyers. ¶A readiness to throw out a criminal conviction if the police or the courts did not follow regular procedures. A similar readiness to hold other branches of Government to account for not following appropriate procedures. While the opinions often express concern that the Federal courts may become overburdened by cases that would be better handled in other forums, they also often insist that an individual who does have right to come to court have that right enforced. The result is some of Judge Stevens's opinions would be called conservative by civil libertarians and others would displease law‐and‐order advocates. ‘Representative Opinions’ When President Ford announced his selection of Judge Stevens, a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit since 1970, the White House released a list of 11 “representative opinions.” A one‐sentence summary of each of those opinions would servative.” However, various servative. However, various statements by Judge Stevens and his reasons for some of those opinions would have contradicted such a label.” What Judge Stevens did in some of those opinions was follow his commitment to procedure, tradition and the legal system. One case on the White House list involved the question of whether a defendant had waived his right to object to the admissibility of certain evidence when he did not object at the time of trial. Judge Stevens said that he had. He held that there was reasonable tactical basis for the defendant's lawyer not to have objected to the evidence: assuming that a lawyer was competent, Judge Stevens said, a client must accept his lawyer's strategy because a rule requiring the client's participation in every decision would “make a shambles out of orderly procedure.” In another criminal case on the list, Judge Stevens dissented from a majority opinion that reversed a conviction. The issue was whether a defendant should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea as not “voluntary” because he had not known at the time of his plea that, by pleading guilty, he would become ineligible for parole. Judge Stevens said the defendant should not be allowed to withdraw his plea. He said that the test was whether the failure to tell the defendant, about parole made the proce dure “fundamentally unfair,” and found that it had not—in part because the defendant's “actual confinement” would not exceed what he had been led to expect, and in part because the defendant had been represented by “competent counsel.” In other criminal cases not on the White House list, Judge Stevens has voted to reverse convictions, sometimes in dissent. In the conviction of a former county clerk in Illinois on charges including mail fraud—a trial marked by substantial publicity—Judge Stevens said, in dissent: “As I reflect on the record in this case, I must confess to some doubt as to whether the errors warrant a new trial. For the evidence of guilt is indeed strong, and the crimes of which Barrett has been convicted involve the shabbiest kind of breach of trust. “It is, therefore, unusually tempting to acquiesce in a decision which may well represent the just and inevitable conclusion of this matter in all events. “Nevertheless, because more enduring values are challenged whenever there is reason to doubt that a notorious public trial has been conducted in an even‐handed manner, I fe?? obligated to resolve my doubto in favor of a position which would minimize the danger that fair and regular procedures may be ?? in the future.” Illegal Search Cases The judge's mix of anti‐defendant and pro‐defendant rulings is especially noticeable in the allegations of illegal search and seizure. In one case earlier this year, he rejected a defendant's contention that evidence illegally taken from someone else should not be used in the defendant's trial. The judge reasoned that the right to have evidence suppressed on the ground that there was an illegal search was a right belonging only to the person whose privacy had been invaded. In a case last year, however, he affirmed a lower court's suppression order where the police had entered an apartment without a warrant and I had no adequate explanation of the failure to get a warrant. Judge Stevens's insistence on following proper procedure has also been directed at those outside the legal system. In a labor case, the majority of his court found that the Secretary of Labor was entitled to rely on a union's voluntary waiver of a 60‐day period specified by statute for filing court proceedings. Judge Stevens disagreed. He said that “the Secretary cannot properly avoid his own duty to act by placing the responsibility for his delay on the shoulders of the defendant.” He also suggested that it was “issues like this that really determine whether Congress will remain a viable institution,” for if the executive branch could substitute its own ideas for specific statements of Congress, “larger issues will routinely be decided without regard to our basic constitutional scheme.” Dissent in Groppi Case In one of Judge Stevens's best‐known dissents, the case of the Wisconsin Legislature's summary contempt sentence of the Rev. James E. Groppi after a civil rights protest—a dissent that the Supreme Court later adopted—Judge Stevens again held the Legislature to account. He said that the Legislature's contempt proceeding had violated the precept that a person could not be imprisoned without a chance to be heard. “In my opinion,” he said. “the preservation of order in Our communities will be best ensured by adherence to established and respected procedures.” One distinction that analysts make between the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren and the Court under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger is that the Warren Court was “activist” by reaching out and expanding constitutional guarantees while the Burger Court generally is not. A number of Judge Stevens's opinions follow the Burger Court model. In cases involving attemp??s to broaden rights of women and prisoners, Judge Stevens seemed to have had two choices: He could have stayed closely to the precedents and facts before him, or gone beyond them. Generally, he has taken the first course. Sex Discrimination Two such cases involved women who contended that they had been discriminated against because of sex In one, a woman complained of a singleonly rule for stewardesses, at a time when the airline employed women only as cabin attendants on most flights. Judge Stevens contended, in dissent, that because only women were eligible for the job, the dismissal of a woman because of marriage was not dismissal because of sex, and thus not sex discrimination. In the second case, involving weight‐lifting ability as a job requirement, Judge Stevens also ruled against a woman's sex discrimination contention. The National Organization for Women is citing the two cases as reasons to oppose Judge Stevens. Neither opinion could be said to reflect absolute bias in sex discrimination cases, or establish that Judge Stevens would rule against women in cases before the Court. His airline opinion included the statement, “I also Consider it most doubtful that a job‐related justification for the no‐marriage rule can be proved.” Judge Stevens ruled in an abortion case in 1973 that a private but Government‐funded hospital was not constitutionally obligated to permit doctors to perform abortions there. At least one other Federal court came to the same conclusion, and last week, the Supreme Court declined a request to review it. Other courts have taken the opposite view. In a prisoners' rights case in 1973, Judge Stevens, writing) for the majority, said that a Supreme Court ruling that had specified certain procedural rights in parole revocation cases meant that similar rights had to be given in disciplinary proceedings involving prisoners. A fellow judge said in dissent that the court majority should have gone further in interpreting the Supreme Court ruling. The “reluctance of the majority to give full sway” to the ruling “may perhaps be explain by an understandable reticence to move hastily in an area of major but developing constitutional significance,” the dissent said, but it was “an overabundance of caution.” Judge Stevens has not been totally opposed to changing the law. In one case, he gave a broad reading to the Supreme Court's Miranda decision, involving an accused person's right to be informed of certain rights before being questioned. In another case, in a dissent, he argued that judges should be required to order presentence reports before sentencing a defendant, The “old rule,” he said, “should be changed.” Part of his reasoning sounded a familiar note: It was important for sentencing procedures to be fair, and also “appear to be fair.”"
Democratic Chiefs Cool to Hopefuls,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/08/archives/democratic-chiefs-cool-to-hopefuls.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The Democratic Presidential candidates, doing their standup routines like a vaudeville troupe for the assembled Democratic Governors here last week, got almost uniformly cool, disbelieving reviews from their audience. To Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado, it looked like “10 guys tied for last,” counting Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who declined to participate. “I didn't hear any governor say, ‘Gee, that guy really turned me around,’ “ commented Gov. Patrick J. Lucey of Wisconsin. Campaign Notes Gov. Byrne of New Jersey said, “It left a lot of us feeling it's wide open—and wondering where Hubert was.” But Gov. Wendell R. Anderson of Minnesota, who months ago set early December as the moment to push his mentor, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, into the race, observed that Mr. Humphrey was still doing too well as a noncandidate to change his status. Governor Anderson believes now, as ever, that the Democratic nominee will come from among the primary contenders, but thinks that the shapelessness of the early race encourages Mr. Humphrey to make his entry next spring. One of the Democratic Party's most highly regarded managers, meanwhile, eager to start a Humphrey campaign, has found he cannot even get an appointment with the Minnesota Senator. From a Humphrey, colleague, the word came back to the would‐be organizer last week, “There is no Humphrey campaign.” • The talk in Boston is that former Republican Gov. John A. Volpe, now the American Ambassador to Italy, is surveying Massachusetts on the prospects of a challenge next year to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Elliot L. Richardson, who is awaiting confirmation as President Ford's Secretary of Commerce, considered that race and abandoned it as hopeless. Mr. Volpe's inquiries are said to focus specifically on the chances a Roman Catholic like himself would have of converting traditional Democrats upset about Mr. Kennedy's views on abortion and school busing. • Senator George McGovern's jeremiad on busing two weeks ago, in which he charged his party's Presidential candidates with evading “the transcendent moral issue of three centuries on this continent,” was a critical failure except, curiously, in the two big cities that have gone through the most busing turmoil this year. The Louisville Courier‐Journal commented, “The McGovern speech was useful, especially so because our own local and state politicians have largely quit talking about the issue of segregation.” The Louisville Times said, “By casting the issue where it needs to be cast—as a moral issue involving the right of all Americans to equal opportunity—Senator McGovern has chosen conscience over expediency.” Robert L. Healy, executive editor of The Boston Globe, saw the speech as a longterm favor to the Democratic Party. “What McGovern has done,” Mr. Healy wrote, “is to make the busing question part of the national Presidential debate. This is not necessarily bad because in the last eight years both Congress and the executive have left the busing question to the courts.” • Benjamin Palumbo, who proved to be too aggressive a campaign manager for his candidate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, has gone to work instead for Representative Phillip Burton of California as staff director of the House Democratic Caucus. James F. Flug, formerly a legal assistant to Senator Kennedy, is now directing the new Energy Action Cornmittee—an ad hoc coalition of rich Democratic liberals whose first object is to block any deregulation of natural gas prices. • Gov. Wallace has asked the Democratic National Committee for a report on party moneys spent on and by Jimmy Carter in 1974, when Mr. Carter toured the country—effectively advancing his own Presidential race — as the committee's “campaign director.” As it happens, five members of the committee staff subsequently joined the Carter campaign, and Mr. Wallace wants an accounting of their salaries—as if to suggest they were long‐term investments in Mr. Carter. The committee staff has responded that all its financial records are open and that Mr. Wallace can search for answers to his own questions."
The Right Democrat,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/09/archives/the-right-democrat.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 8—The early signs point toward the nomination by the Democrats next year of a Presidential candidate with a centrist image. “Image” is the key word. In politics, how a candidate is perceived by the public can be more important than his voting record or demonstrated accomplishments. Democrats now are in much the same frame of mind as Republicans after the Goldwater debacle. In 1968, Republicans shied away from an ideological hero like Ronald Reagan. They settled for Richard Nixon, whom they regarded as an experienced old pro who could hold the party together and avoid being tagged as an extremist. In these circumstances, Democratic candidates who are seen as too conservative, such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, or too liberal, such as ex‐Senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma, are at a disadvantage. Mr. Harris, with his stirring neopopulist attack on the corporations and the rich, usually evokes the loudest applause at party gatherings. But privately, Democrats express their fear that Mr. Harris may be “another McGovern.” Senator Henry Jackson of Washington is a liberal on most domestic issues. His steadfast support for the Vietnam war, his enthusiasm for a big military budget, and his criticisms of détente have the political effect, however, of establishing him as a right‐ofcenter figure on the party's own spectrum. Among those Democrats who simply want a winner, there is the fear that he would be as objectionable to McGovern Democrats as Mr. McGovern's nomination was obnoxious to Jackson Democrats. In a word, he is too “divisive.” Although Senator Jackson fails to benefit himself, the centrist or moderate image he has tried to establish is regarded by his rivals as the right one. That is, they want to be acceptable to big labor and not frightening to the business community, acceptable to intellectuals and minorities and also to hardhats and middle‐class suburbanites. Each of the three Democrats who appears to be doing best—Representative Morris Udall, Senator Birch Bayh, and ex‐Governor Jimmy Carter—is trying to establish himself as the right person to organize a broad winning coalition in the final campaign. All three mildly endorse school busing. But that is only an empty gesture to liberal diehards. Unlike Senator McGovern, these candidates recognize that, politically, busing is a dead horse. Senator Bayh picks up useful strength among feminist voters by his support for the Equal Rights Amendment and his opposition to an amendment banning abortion. But the heart of his appeal is that he is acceptable to the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. unions which boycotted the McGovern campaign, and has proved in Indiana that he knows how to win in a conservative state. Representative Udall's appeal is that he has earned the respect of House colleagues from every region. He, too, has shown that as a liberal he knows how to win in a conservative state, Arizona. Arizona is a right‐to‐work state, and Mr. Udall has in the past endorsed a state's right to adopt such laws, which are anathema to organized labor. He is also an outspoken environmentalist, which makes him suspect to some unionists. But he has succeeded in mending his relations with the A.F.L.C.I.O. and is careful to tell audiences that the Democrats cannot win if they lose the support of George Meany and Mayor Richard Daley. Former Governor Carter, although still little known, has earned new respect for his skill as a salesman of himself and as a political organizer. A former officer in the nuclear Navy, a commercial farmer, Mr. Carter has perfected a nonideological standard speech that epitomizes this year's centrist impulses, nicely mixing an appeal to efficiency and to humane sentiment. He favors capital punishment for certain crimes, and has been skeptical of aid to New York. Yet he “gets away with” these views among many liberals because his candidacy, in effect, dangles before the party the exciting prospect that it might regain a substantial share of the Southern electoral vote. In a curious way, his regional background confers an ideological absolution. What would be regarded as proof of conservatism in a Jackson is regarded as understandable coming from a Southerner. Whoever is chosen is likely to be a liberal. In choosing the one who is acceptable to the various power blocs and who best looks like a winner, the Democrats are wise not to insist upon ideological purity. But they would do well to look closely for evidence of good judgment and depth of conviction. As the G.O.P. and the nation discovered with Mr. Nixon after 1968, winning isn't everything."
Collapse of the Old Order,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/10/archives/collapse-of-the-old-order.html,"WASHINGTON — Around Christmas time before each Presidential election, the political world of Washington begins to turn over. The old leaves at the top of the executive and legislative branches start dropping off. There is an obvious change in what officials say and do. They begin thinking about their private lives, their personal ambitions and disappointments, and this is what is happening here now. Even before the primary election struggles in the two major political parties, the structure of the Government here is breaking up. Vice President Rockefeller has pulled out of the Republican Vice‐Presidential race. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the Republican leader in the Senate, has announced his retirement. Mike Mansfield, the Democratic leader of the Senate, will probably decide, like Mr. Scott, that it is time to go home, and Speaker Albert of the House of Representatives is trying to decide whether to jump or be shoved into retirement. In the last few years, there have been more voluntary resignations in the House and Senate than at any time in recent memory, and on the executive side, President Ford has dismissed his Secretary of Defense, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Secretary of Commerce Morton has resigned; likewise David Bruce, the ambassador to NATO. Also David Packard, the fund‐raiser for the Republican Party, and it is not at all sure that Secretary of State Kissinger, faced with a charge of contempt of Congress, will agree to go on and allow himself and his policies to be issues in the Presidential campaign. In a situation like this, nobody knowing what is going to happen, there is no clear domestic or foreign policy, and no informing mind at the top of the Government in Washington. The President has been off in China, Indonesia and the Philippines, for reasons that are not clear to his hosts or even to his Cabinet, which is worried about taxes, busing, abortion, inflation, unemployment and many other things on the home front. Accordingly, there is a tendency now for officials to argue their own personal views in public. Former Secretary of Defense Schlesinger insisted on an increased defense budget before the Congress and in public, and was fired for doing so. Director Colby of the Central Intelligence Agency testified before the Congress on the C.I.A.'s record of subversion and even of planned, if abortive, assassinations of foreign. political leaders, and was dismissed for his candor. So the Ford Administration is in trouble, not only with the Congress but with its own colleagues, and with its policies in the United Nations. It appointed Pat Moynihan as its ambassador to the U.N., because Pat insisted that the time had come to defend America's interests against the unfair and even outrageous anti‐American challenges of Moscow, Peking and the third‐world spokesmen. And Moynihan has been faithful to his promises. He has not only defended the interests of his country, but in the process, has provoked the Soviets, affronted the European allies, and outraged the Secretary General of the United Nations and the new nations of the third world. This troubles the President and Secretary of State Kissinger. They think he has gone too far, but they are not in control in an election year. After firing Mr. Schlesinger for being too Laugh on the Soviets, they couldn't be too hard on Mr. Moynihan, without giving Ronald Reagan of California a compelling argument in the coming Presidential election. WASHINGTON The politics of next year are clearly dominating the policies of the major nations. Nobody knows who is going to be in charge a year from now—in Washington, with an unelected President and a divided Democratic Party; in Peking, with an ailing saint and a hospitalized prime minister; in Moscow, with a sick head of the Communist Party. Even Prime Minister Wilson in Britain, President Giscard d'Estaing in France, and Chancellor Schmidt in West Germany are all in political trouble in a continent where inflation and unemployment are making people wonder whether democracy and the capitalist system can survive. This is why, coming up to the end of the old year, and the beginning of the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, so many oldtimers in Washington are copping out. When you talk to serious men like Messrs. Mansfield, Scott and Kissinger, they agree that it is time for a new generation to take over, but the tragedy is that the new generation is not taking over in the United States, China, the Soviet Union or Europe. It is clear who is going—the Rockefellers, the Schlesingers, the Mansfields, Scotts and Alberts in Washington; the Mao Tse‐tungs and Chou En‐lais in China, the Brezhnevs in Moscow. But it is not at all clear that they will be replaced by the rising generation. What seems likely is that they will be replaced by other men in their sixties, whose visions are in the past."
Stocks as Causal Force,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/10/archives/stocks-as-causal-force-market-accepted-as-an-indicator-may-also.html,"Last week's stunning 41.87 drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, which this week's market action has done virtually nothing thus far to reverse, raises serious doubts about the optimistic forecasts that were so common just before the market broke so sharply downward. Economic Analysis ome analysts are trying to brush off the news. For instance, Roy E. Moor, director of economic research of Becker Securities, writes: “There are times when the stock market seems to go out of its way to conjure up fear stories. One such fear story currently circulating is that the economic recovery may peter out some time next year. There are absolutely no early warning signals suggesting such a development, but fears never need facts.” A number of other analysts sought to find “technical” explanations for the drop, or inconsequential reasons that would soon evaporate. To some, a Brown Brothers Harriman advisory recommending an increase to 30 percent from 20 percent in funds available for common stock buying had triggered the decline. Question of Multiples Others thought the explanation was nothing more complicated than “too high multiples,” with, as Robert Stovall of Reynolds Securities put it, “many investors running to one side of the boat, trying to unload stocks they had bought much earlier in anticipation of a market climb once New York City's financial problems were resolved.” Nevertheless, the cautious advisers drew back. There was much muttering about “fighting the tape” being a hopeless and foolish game. Fred D. Kalstein of Hugh Johnson & Company wrote: “Aggressive investors are best advised not to speculate on how far the decline will carry.” But is there more than folkwisdom in the market's cliché about “not fighting the tape”? A new study by the econo mist Barry Bosworth, published in the latest issue of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, suggests that there is—because the stock market is not only a “leading indicator” of the general economy but also has a direct impact on the economic outlook through its effects on consumption and investment. Mr. Bosworth's calculations indicate that the stock‐market decline of 1973–74 imposed more than $500 billion in paper losses on stockholders. Even if this enormous reduction in their “wealth”—the current market value of their hold. ings—had a very much smaller effect on their incomes, it still apparently caused consumers to cut back their buying significantly. The study finds that the $500 billion drop in wealth resulted in a $15 billion to $25 billion cut in consumption. At the same time, the bear market in stocks might have cut business capital outlays by as much as $15 billion at an annual rate, according to the Bosworth analysis. How big a dollar impact on wealth, consumption and income would last week's decline in the Dow‐Jones industrials have—assuming that it represented a downward shift in equity values that would last for half a year or more? A recalculation of the BosWorth data indicate that for every 1 point decline in the Dow, the total market value of stockholdings declines by $1.25 billion. Therefore, a 42point decline in the Dow would represent paper losses of $52.5 billion to stockholders. Every $1 decline in the wealth of stockholders means a 3‐cent to 5‐cent decline in consumption. Hence the $52.5 billion shrinkage in the value of stock holdings would mean a $1.6 billion to $2.6 billion drop in consumption. And it would also cause a direct cut in business spending on new plant and equipment by about $1.5 billion. But that Is not the whole story—for these direct impacts on consumption and investment would also have a “multiplier” effect in the economy, as the incomes of the producers of consumption and investment goods were cut, and their outlays in turn were further reduced. This multiplier effect approximately doubles the impact of the drop in consumption and investment caused by the stock market decline, according to the Bosworth model. Hence, the total effect on the economy of a lasting drop of 42 points on the Dow would be a cut of $6 billion to $8 billion in gross national product. There is undoubtedly a false precision to these numbers, not only in terms of the events of the past week, but also in terms of the fundamental question of causality. Mr. Bosworth himself does not feel that he has decisively resolved the long‐debated issue of the causal role played by the stock market in economic fluctuations. It is still far from clear—and Mr. Bosworth's critics are even more insistent on this point than he is—whether the market causes changes in aggregate demand or whether causation runs the other way. There is a third possibility—that both levels of economic activity and of stock prices simply respond to other, more basic, economic forces. Nevertheless, whatever the true direction of causality, the empirical fact is that the stock market has been a good forecaster of major cycles in business activity—although, like a trigger‐happy recruit, it does sometimes fire when it sees shadows that turn out to be nothing. But when the market really does see trouble, it seems to compound it by causing a big drop in wealth and worsening consumer and business spending—which is the burden of what the Bosworth study shows. Studies of the market show just such a “real” impact in the drop in wealth in the 1929–32 Depression. Losses In Banking The immediate issue, of course, is whether the stock market last week was seeing insubstantial and flickering shadows or whether it was seeing something real—and if so, what? There has been a marked lowering of economic expectations for 1976. Hardly any economists expect an actual abortion of the recovery, but the negative factors weighing on the recovery have come more clearly into focus. A major one is the heavy losses on loans and investment sustained by the commercial banking system—and the need that many banks have of strengthening their capital positions before they can safely expand their loans and investment. The expectation of a fourth‐quarter loss and the dividend cut announced by the Marine Midland Bank jolted observers into reality on that score—and aroused expectations of similar actions by other hard‐pressed banks. Inflation appears likely to stay in a range of 5 to 7 percent in the coming year. Unemployment, after jumping from 8.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent in October, went down again to 8.3 percent in November—but in effect remained on the same 8 percent‐plus plateau which it has held for half a year. And the outlook for 1976 has been for a slow decline in the jobless rate. Thus the “discomfort” index —the sum of inflation and unemployment — looks as though it will remain high through 1976, in a range of 12 to 15. Low Consumer Sentiment And, as a study by Prof. Michael C. Lovell of Wesleyan University In the same issue of Brookings Papers shows, there is a high positive correlation between the discomfort index and consumer sentiment. The worse inflation‐plus‐unemployment becomes, the worse consumer attitudes and behavior. Is this the common factor undermining aggregate demand? There are other worries—excess office space in many cities (and a growing foreclosure rate); the sluggish housing recovery; the tight liquidity position of many companies; the impact on state and local government spending of the difficulties of New York City and New York State—which will persist, evert if, as now seems likely, both city and state agencies avoid formal default or bankruptcy. The worries also include uncertainty about energy and its costs, taxes, and the whole array of Government policies on which the economy so crucially depends—and which are hung up and confused by the present and coming struggle between the White House and Congress in an election year. Spending Surge Hoped For Many of the optimistic forecasters were counting on election‐year politics to produce the burst of spending and easier money that would strengthen the recovery, as has happened so often in the past. But the realization has been growing that this time it may not happen. The President and his key economic advisers regard inflation as the most serious economic problem facing the nation—and Mr. Ford's political advisers seem to think it also makes good politics to make inflation, rather than unemployment and slow growth, the main target. Many neutral observers believe that even traditional “liberals” are now much more concerned about inflation and fiscal discipline — Gov. Hugh Carey in New York is one who seems to be searching for a middle course between liberal social policies and fiscal caution or conservatism. If President Ford decides to stay with his economic and ideological conservatives, and if Congress is either too divided or too uncertain about where the votes lie after years of Vietnam, Watergate, inflation and declining faith in government, the name of the economic game next year may be stagnation. Yet, paradoxically, this could mean a switch of political control at the White House in November. Is this what the stock market has been sensing?"
A Referendum on Abortion Sanctioned by Italian Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/13/archives/a-referendum-on-abortion-sanctioned-by-italian-court.html,"ROME, Dec. 12 (Reuters) —Italy's constitutional court gave its approval today for a referendum on legalizing abortion. The court admitted as valid a petition presented by abortion backers who collected the half million signatures needed to call a referendum. The two leading political parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, want to avoid the vote. The referendum can now be avoided only if Parliament changes the present law outlawing abortion. A draft bill allowing restricted abortion has been introduced, but is going through its committee stage slowly."
Of State and Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/13/archives/of-state-and-church.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO HROUGHOUT the Iberian world, whose greatest area is Latin America, the Roman. Catholic Church has experienced profound change in the years since its Ecumenical Council, Vatican II, which ended in 1962. With exceptions, especially in Portugal, the episcopal hierarchy has tended to move from what was a conservative stance to an increasingly liberal political attitude. This has nothing to do with dogma and such problems as birth control and abortion. But it does have to do with opposition to repression of human rights or the use of torture. Pope Paul VI (speaking of a Franco decision to execute terrorists this year) said: “We begged the responsible person in the Name of God to choose the way of magnanimity and clemency rather than that of murderous reprission:” From Spain on the Mediterranean to Chile on the Pacific the new Church is trying to ally itself with social justice. This has caused murmurings outside the Iberian orbit. Polish. priests worry lest the new détente between the Vatican and Communist governments undermine their own beleaguered position. Even in Washington there are those in high quarters who see Moscow pondering whether a good occasion hasn't arisen to make a deal with Rome. The hierarchy in South America isn't thinking in such terms or in such a global sense. Moreover, the Church in this area is by no means monolithic; it contains a younger left‐wing faction, an old, diminishing conservative faction, and a generally dominant liberal faction. When the first Spanish conquistadors and Portuguese navigators opened up this continent they were accompanied by a tough group of monks who believed in converting the Indians by force if necessary. But even then there were exceptions. In 1515, the famous Dominican friar, Bartolomeo de las Casas, won vindication of his insistence that Indians possessed souls and must be treated liberally. The recent change in Vatican policy has had significant effect in encouraging liberal priests in Latin Ameiica. This has been complicated by the surge of left‐wing guerrilla discontent a few years ago and its subsequent repression by military regimes. On the whole the Church seems to be trying to moderate such repression without at the same time openly denouncing the governments. One curious personal relationship is that between Pope Paul and Bra?? Cardinal Helder Camara, Archbishop of Recife. When the present Pontiff, then Monsignor Montini, visited Brazil, President Kubitschek designated Monsignor Camara as his aide. Many people here believe the Cardinal, who is a strong and generally leftist force, still has influence on the Pope. The result is an uneasy BraziIian relationship. Cardinal Salles, Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, acknowledges problems with the state. Cardinal Arns, Archbishop of Sāo Paulo, is blunter. He says: “Nobody has the right to lock up a man and yank information out of him.” Brazil's Government tries to minimize friction with the Church but there has indeed been an important change in the latter's attitude. Word has been circulated that Pope Paul feels strongly about tough handling of some priests in recent years and about brutality toward ordinary civilians. The present regime of Gen. Ernesto Geisel, however, is seeking to moderate policy in the vague direction of democracy. In Ecuador, with another military regime, the Church is a kind of South American odd‐man‐out, relatively untouched by the liberal revolt elsewhere. Its leading prelate, Archbishop Mena y Porta, is a former confessor to Pope Pius XII (another era). The Papal Nuncio, who previously served in Taiwan, is leery of any trend to left‐wing priests. The Peruvian hierarchy has an easier position. Lima's army Government is rather left‐wing and the priests endorse its so‐called “revolution.” Even the conservative primate, Cardinal Landazeri Ricketts, accepts this situation.; Nor are there Peruvian torture and human rights problems to polarize relationships. A far sharper cleavage exists Chile where Gen. Augusto Pinochet is unabashedly rough with oppohents. Led by Cardinal Silva, dubbed “the Red Cardinal” by Pinochet's supporters, the hierarchy acidly criticizes the regime on human rights. Only three of two dozen Chilean bishops are pro‐Pinochet (although these inelude his friend the Archbishop of Valparaiso). The odd coincidence in time between liberalization of the Catholic hierarchy in most of the Iberian world, primarily because of Vatican IL. and resurgence of authoritarian governments in South America, has made for two things: a generation gap in the priesthood, with younger clerics moving relatively leftward, and a kind of church‐state confrontation rather unusual in this area."

ONE OF THE OLDER ACTORS Teem . . . This may be O.K. for you young folks but I left my pacemaker at home. FADE OUT: END ACT ONE The scene provided a pretty fair first‐act curtain, all right, except that at the time it didn't seem likely there would be a second act to follow it. As matters turned out, there were several acts, and the denouement, a new Norman Lear sitcom called “One Day at a Time,” will be seen on CBS this Tuesday at 9:30 P.M. The series concerns the trials and tribulations of a young woman who leaves her husband of 17 years and moves from a small town in Indiana to Indianapolis with her two teen‐aged daughters, there to begin living on her own for the first time in her life. But, in the weeks and months ahead, it will be difficult for “One Day at a Time” to duplicate the real‐life drama of that day last April when a telephone call from Perry Lafferty, CBS's West Coast vice president in charge of programing, threatened to cancel the pilot for the series minutes before its scheduled taping, with the members of a studio audience already wait. ing in their seats primed to laugh their leather lungs sore. All of a sudden, the gloom was so thick in the dressing room you could cut it with a clapboard. For the dozen or so actors frozen in various stages of temporary shock, the sudden turnabout meant an early end to a grueling production week and, if the pilot were sold, the chance to be gainfully employed, possibly for years, at salaries hitherto only figments of their agents' fevered reveries. For Norman Lear and a handful of CBS executives, it meant a confrontation that had been building slowly for months, one that was both inevitable and surprising, humorous in its unfolding and deadly serious in its implications —in short, the kind of confrontation that makes for the best of all possible first‐act curtains. The immediate cause of the dispute last April was Lear's refusal to make four minor cuts in the script that had been requested by CBS's program practices department, the network euphemism for censor. Although the lines were all relatively mild sexual innuendoes and would normally have passed through program practices with hardly a raised eyebrow, television censors were taking a particularly hard look at all shows that might air during the family hour in the fall, especially pilots for new series. The networks saw their plan to eliminate sex and at least tone down violence in the first hour of prime time (8 P.M. to 9 P.M.) as a last‐ditch attempt to stave off increased government regulation of the airwaves, and they were determined to impress the seriousness of the situation on the handful of independent producers who supplied them with much of their programing. Lear and other independents, for their part, were fearful that the networks were about to concede. for no good reason, their limited and hard‐fought in television realistic. The scene in the dressing room last spring began innocently enough several months earlier. Norman Lear, who is by all odds the most successful producer of television situation comedies in the land, currently has four top‐ranking shows on CBS (“All in the Family,” “The Jeffersons,” “Maude,” and “Good Times”) and a development contract for a new one each year. For some time, he had been thinking about a show with an “emerging‐woman” theme, a woman somewhere in age and circumstances between the middle‐aged. thrice‐married Maude and Archie Bunker's daughter Gloria on “All in the Family.” Then, a year ago, Allan Manings, the executive producer of “Good Times,” came to Lear with an idea for a new situation comedy about the lives of a beautiful, trendy 38‐year‐old divorcée. who is the editor of a provocative magazine called “Woman . . . Now,” and her equally beautiful, trendy 18‐year‐old daughter. Lear felt that both the mother and daughter were several years too old and entirely too sophisticated for widespread audience acceptance. A more fruitful area to explore, he thought, would be the life of a small‐town housewife who leaves her husband to search for an identity of her own. At that point, Lear and Manings commissioned two freelance scriptwriters to come up with a pilot episode for the projected series. Their script opened on the day Ann Benton, a 34‐year‐old housewife who has just left her home and husband Clinton, Ind., moves to her own apartment in Indianapolis along with her teen‐aged daughter. In the course of the day, she is befriended by Gael, an older, unmarried neighbor; hassled by a telephone installer and a lecherous moving man; and confronted by her husband Ed, a moderately suc cessful refrigerator salesman who is totally blind to her new‐found need for independence. After the first draft was completed last December, Lear telephoned Fred Silverman in New York—Silverman was then head of programing at CBS and has since moved to a similar job at ABC—to ask him if the network would be interested in the project as a new series for the fall season. Although nearing 40. Silverman is still thought of in the television industry as a Wunderkind who began his meteoric rise at CBS as vice president in charge of daytime programing at the age of 25. A gruff, rumpled man in a world of pressed suits and manicured fingernails, he is considered about the best judge of popular taste in the business. Not so surprisingly—television people being neargeniuses at spotting trends several years after they have developed—Silverman responded that he, too. had been thinking a lot about “emerging‐woman” shows. So, under the circumstances, Silverman was only too happy to give Lear the go‐ahead to develop a pilot for the series on the strength of a single telephone call. The costs of a typical pilot, which are generally assumed by the networks, can range from $200,000 for a half‐hour taped comedy to over a million dollars for a two‐hour dramatic show filmed on location. Some of the money can be recovered by airing the pilot during the slow summer months hut, if the show doesn't “go to series,” there will still be a considerable loss. Since network executives take to gambling with all the alacrity of Mormon elders, Silverman's quick response was based on Lear's well‐deserved reputation for bringing home winners. In a more typical case, a production company or program packager would submit a brief story idea to the network development department and, if the idea were approved, sign a “step deal” that would allow it to begin the hazardous course from story outline to shooting script to the actual production of the pilot to a series commitment. Each spring and summer, the three networks receive thousands of story ideas, most of which are richly deserving of the rejections they receive. As the screening process continues, the networks eventually choose about a hundred pilot scripts for production, evenly divided between comedies and dramas, with a few “variety” shows thrown in for, well, variety, and, in late April or early May, they approve about 30 of these pilots for inclusion in their fall schedules. But if Lear had lessened the odds against the independent producer by his very prominence, he had also selected a very touchy subject to build a situation comedy around—divorce. In primetime sitcoms, television executives were not interested in quiet comedy, poignant comedy, true‐tolife comedy, romantic comedy, certainly not tragicomedy—they were interested in laugh‐a‐minute comedy, yuks pure and simple, fearing that if that mythical family they were always second‐guessing, mom‐and‐dad‐and‐sis‐and‐bud, weren't kept in stitches from opening title treatment to closing credits, it would promptly tune in the competition. And the traditional wisdom held that divorce was about as productive of yuks as a sprained ankle. While plenty of blacks and Chicanos were on situation comedies these days, and there were hookers and homosexuals and even women who had been divorced in some dark recess of their past, there had never been, in TV sitcoms, an American family seen in the process of going through a divorce. Divorce was literally too close to home. Lear, of course, was justly celebrated as the man who had brought controversy to television. He was a card‐carrying A.C.L.U. liberal who had a passion for exploring socially relevant topics on his shows and he believed firmly that any subject could be presented tastefully to a mass audience. To prove it, he had done shows on such formerly taboo topics of the day as abortion, alcoholism. homosexuality and breast cancer which managed to be both informative and amusing. He was an innovator; by television's somewhat flaccid standards, he was a flaming radical. But Lear was also realistic about what could be accomplished on television, particularly in a pilot. The purpose of a TV pilot is not to break new creative ground but to sell a product. It must introduce all the characters, establish their relationships, suggest the direction of future episodes and do it all in such a sidesplitting way that the half‐dozen jaded network executives who will decide whether the pilot “goes to series” become convinced the show will make rating history. Looking over their first draft, Lear and Manings agreed that the pilot episode probably shouldn't deal with the day Ann Benton moves into her new apartment—that would be to salt the wound unnecessarily. It could start several weeks later, when she has already settled in, and flash back to that first day in a later episode. Besides, the character of the lecherous moving man in the first draft was too promising to waste on a one‐shot guest appearance. The producers also felt that Ann should have an outside “love interest,” so that the new boyfriend, the husband and the lecherous moving man turned, say, lecherous building superintendent could bump into each other in endless yuk‐a‐minute combinations. In addition, Lear felt strongly that the teen‐aged daughter should be much more prominent in the pilot episode, for he had two teen‐aged daughters himself and he was fascinated by their special jargon and quirky ways. Manings set to work rewriting the script as soon as “Good Times” went on its summer hiatus in mid‐March. In his new version, Ann Benton works as a freelance nurse at an Indianapolis hospital alongside young Dr. Carl Silvers (“not a collar ad but warm and winning”). After parrying his advances for a few pages, she finally invites him home for dinner, but meanwhile her husband Ed, from whom she has recently separated, arrives at the apartment to take 15‐year‐old tulie (“coltish and eternally morose”) back home for the weekend. He makes his own advances trying to win Ann back, then flies into a jealous fit when Gael Morris, the sympathetic upstairs neighbor, mistakes him for young Dr. Silvers. Ed and Ann argue in zingy one‐liners. (Ed: “You're out nere staving over a hot stove for some jerk you hardly know.” Ann: “Would you rather I was hack home slaving over a hot stove for a jerk I've known all my life?”). Young Dr. Silvers arrives, sees the lay of the land, leaves. Ralph, the lecherous‐but‐lovable super, pops in and out wearing a kind of lineman's tool belt that holds a and of wine, a corkscrew and two glasses, and makes hopelessly unsuccessful passes at both Gael and Ann. Finally, left alone at the end, the two women settle down to a quiet evening's identity crisis. Manings's pilot script served to introduce the characters all right (Gael: “This place sometimes seems like a thruway”) but they were cardboard cutups. Worse, although the script was entitled “Three to Get Ready” at this point, referring, one gathered, to the emerging womanhood of the female leads, there was precious little indication of where they—or the series —were going. By far the best parts of the script were Julie's monologues, which caught the sound and rhythm of teenaged speech nicely. Nobody seemed overly worried about the new draft. Television scriptwriting resembles the children's game of hangman's noose in this sense: Everyone playing puts his mark on paper until a recognizable pattern emerges. In the meantime, the show had to be cast. The three female leads were chosen first and most easily: they were the juiciest roles. Mackenzie Phillips, who had played the 13year ‐ old teenybopper in “American Grafitti,” would play Julie, while Bonnie Franklin and Marcia Rodd, two actresses with extensive theatrical credits, were cast as Ann and Gael. Joan Darling, the director, and several of the other actors had much stronger theatrical than television backgrounds, a situation that would add to the normal tension during the production week. For even though Lear's shows are all taped before studio audiences in the form of two‐act plays, the frantic production pace is a far cry from the weeks of rehearsals and out‐of‐town tryouts customary on Broadway. The old joke about spending two weeks one night in Philadelphia is a fact of life in television. At this point in the production of the pilot, the script underwent its final revision, with Lear himself doing a “polish.” Lear is a master of the half‐hour sitcom form partly because he understands rule number one: Subtlety will get you nowhere. He provided the first act with a noisy crescendo by having Ann and Gael and Ed and Dr. Silvers all screaming bloody murder at one another, although there was still no satisfactory resolution to Ann's situation by the end of the second act. Finally, he added his own patented ingredient to the sitcom stew—Significance!—by having Ann announce the emerging‐woman theme early on. “For the first 17 years of my life, I lived in my father's house,” she tells Dr. Silvers in the opening scene. “For the next 17, I lived in my husband's house. For the first time in my life, I'm living in my house.” As soon as the final script was typed and Xeroxed, a copy was sent to CBS's program practices department for its approval, which is required by contract before the network is obliged to pay a producer for his program. In the best of times, Ray Cunneff, the 32‐year‐old program practices director responsible for evaluating the pilot script, was not about to let a Norman Lear script about a divorced woman pass his desk with a wink and a nod. And as far as program practices was concerned, these were the worst of times. A bright, articulate fellow who wore his hair modishly long and dressed in floral ‐ patterned shirts and sweaters. Cunneff was far from the stereotyped man‐in‐a‐gray‐suit image of a censor. Although he preferred the term “broadcast self‐regulation” to censorship as a description of his job, he was not without a measure of humor in his approach to it. On one wall of his office Cunneff had hung a reproduction of Michelangelo's “The Creation” from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, only he had asked an artist friend to retouch God's hand from its original index ‐ finger ‐ extended pose to a thumbsdown position. The official CBS memorandum that Cunneff sent to Lear and Manings began: “The following notes are based on this property as a potential family hour viewing series.” What followed was a list of 26 separatie items, some of them substantial swatches of dialogue, each one preceded by a page reference in the script and followed by the words, “Please delete.” Among the offending lines on the three‐page list were a couple of lighthearted religious jokes, such as Gael's responge to a phony Biblical reference that Ralph the super makes: “It [the Bible] also says, ‘Thou shalt not covet thy tenant's backside.’ “ There were also a few mild scatological references, such as Julie's account of the time “dumb creepy Elliot Pepperdine hung a b.a. on me”—“b.a.” being most harmlessly defined as “bare buttocks.” But by far the preponderance of the requested deletions were sexual innuendoes. most of them relatively innocuous exchanges between consenting adults. “We were good together,” Ed says to Ann. “We are good together.” Please delete. “Superintending sure does make strange bed fellows,” Gael says to Ralph. Please delete. “A regular ‘manage au trois.’ if you know what I mean,” Ralph says. Please delete. At the end of the memo was a list of all the “hells” and “damns” in the script, along with the following instruction: “There are 11 instances of profanity in the script which must be drastically reduced to a maximum of two instances.” It was the toughest critique Cunneff had ever written, but there would be time for some give‐andtake with the producers before the show was finally taped. As Allan Manings explained, “You put in a crap to get two hells and a damn.” Now that the production week had begun, Lear and Manings had other problems on their minds. When the cast held its first reading in a basement rehearsal hall at CBS's Television City, several of the actors complained about their roles. Marcia Rodd thought that her character, Gael, was too much a “cliché Eve Arden part”—the wisecracking next‐door neighbor. As each script revision arrived in the hall from Lear's offices upstairs—yellow Xeroxed pages rseplacing pale blue ones replacing pink ones —Lewis J. Stadlen grew unhappier with the part of Dr. Silvers. At 28, Stadlen had just completed a highly acclaimed run on Broadway in “Candide” and, by comparison, he found his first television script “written by a computer on the blink.” Finally, he threw down the script in disgust and said: “I don't mean to be a spoilsport but I signed to do the part because I liked the character and now they couldn't make him work so they've changed him into Mr, Apoplectic. Well, I'm tired of playing jerks.” As director, Joan Darling encouraged the actors to feel their way into their parts by improvising new dialogue, which didn't make Allan Manings, the scriptwriter, too happy. At one point, Manings held up a hastily penciled placard for her to see: “ ‘ There is nothing shameful about getting good, hardearned, well‐motivated laughs’ —Voltaire.” Manings blamed her for allowing his material to go flat and for overprotecting the cast, putting back lines he had cut because they seemed to her “acting moments” when the script was running 10 minutes long. For her part, the director felt that the writer was insensitive to the subtleties of the emerging‐woman theme. “I want something more meaningful than joke‐laugh, joke‐laugh, joke‐laugh,” she told the producers. “But I can't make a ship fly.” By midweek, matters were at such loose ends that Manings called Lear down to the rehearsal hall to watch a runthrough. Lear was dismayed by what he saw. Some of the jokes had been eliminated or softened and the actors. particularly Stadlen, had been allowed to tone down their parts in a way that Lear felt might work on the stage but wouldn't “play” on television. “Romantic is fine in its place,” Lear told the director. “But romantic isn't funny.” The cast and the producers spent most of a day trimming lines from the script, which had to be brought down from its present running time of 26 minutes to about 21 min utes. (The remainder of the half‐hour segment would be filled with commercials, station breaks, a 30‐second leadin to each episode and, with luck, a couple of minutes of audience laughter — live if possible, canned if necessary.) In the course of the trimming, a few more of the disputed lines fell by the wayside, including a reference to Julie's “push‐up bra.” Over the weekend, the production shifted to a basement sound studio in Television City where the “Three to Get Ready” set—the interior of Ann's apartment—had been hastily assembled for a lateafternoon run‐through of the pilot. Dressed In weekend jeans and sneakers, Lear sat in the audience next to his secretary, who took down his telegraphic comments on the action in a copy of the script: “Reading . . . timing . . . beat missing . . . expression. . . .” Later, in the main dressing room, he gave the dispirited cast a much‐needed pep talk before launching into his notes on the run‐through. “Lew,” he said to Stadlen. “you're a 28‐year‐old doctor who thinks he has to smooth out his bedside manner with a joke now and then. Maybe in 20 years. . . .” “He'll have funnier jokes,” Manings interrupted. “You mean in 20 years I'll get better material,” Stadlen said, glaring at Manings. “In 20 years, you'll be better material,” Manings shot back. “Let's move on,” Lear quickly interjected. “A few lines later,” he said to Tom Aldredge, who played the husband, “when you try to convince Ann to come back home, really pour it on. If you need some more lines about the house you can add ‘ . . oakwood paneling . . a pop‐up toaster . . . two fireplaces . . . a cooking island . . . a Trash Master . . . that double broiler with the rangefinder you wanted so badly.’ That guy really doesn't understand. It's a very tragic moment within the context of a situation comedy.” By Monday afternoon, when the last revised page was run off the Xerox machine, the dispute with program practices centered on four lines that Lear absolutely refused to cut and Cunneff insisted were “no gives” for the network. Two of them were part of Julie's account of her boy friend's behavior at a party: “Quick‐like he tries to sneak up my sweater” and “Darned if he doesn't turn right around and hang a b.a. on me.” The third was the super's boast to the husband: “I got it right here in the building. I walk one flight of stairs, a step and a half in any direction and I'm in score city.” The last was an exchange between the super and Gael during which he “tups her on the backside,” she “pinches him hard in the same place,” and he turns around and says, “You're ready.” On the day of the taping, Lear heard that program practices was preparing a memo to him stating that the pilot would be acceptable to the network only with the four disputed lines deleted, which meant CBS would not be legally obligated to pay for it. In that case, it would be up to Lear to decide whether he was willing to bear the possible loss of over $200,000 for the pilot. He immediately called Fred Silverman in New York and announced that he would cancel the taping if the memo were actually delivered to him. This, in turn, would leave CBS without a potential hit show for its fall schedule. Silverman, who had not been involved in the dispute until now, asked him what the four lines were and Lear said: “They're nothing. I'm embarrassed to tell you. A teen‐aged girl is telling a story about a boy trying to put his hand up her sweater —as sweet and ingenuous a moment as when my daughter Maggie told me it two weeks ago.” Silverman said he'd check into the matter and call Lear back. But by 4 P.M., when the cast was ready to begin a final dress rehearsal before the taping, Lear still hadn't heard from the network. He called upstairs to Perry Lafferty, who said that he had no authority to give Lear the go‐ahead and that Silverman, who presumably did, was “in transit” between his office and his home. Lafferty urged Lear to proceed with the rehearsal, promising him a definite decision on payment before the taping. Lear reluctantly agreed. “You guys just want a free look before you make up your mind,” he said. Lafferty and Cunneff watched the dress rehearsal on closed‐circuit television monitors in Lafferty's office. “It's not just what's being said that matters,” Cunneff explained later, “but how it's being said. We needed to know whether they had toned down the readings of the lines we objected to. We figured we could live with the handunder‐the‐sweatier line, but the rest had to go.” The lines had not been toned down. In fact, the super's pinch seemed more offensively placed to Cunneff now (“low and inside—more rear‐grabbing than a pinch”) than it had in earlier rehearsals. The decision was made to send the producers the memo—known affectionately around CBS as a “zap letter”—that Cunneff had been carrying around in his pocket since the early afternoon. It read: “As requested deletions in this property have not been accomplished, we must advise you that, in its present form. the program is not acceptable for broadcast. You should consider this formal notification.” The dress rehearsal in Studio 31 went extremely well. Although the script still had some glaring weaknesses—the basic one being that the secondary male characters, particularly the super, were funnier and more appealing than the three somewhat fuzzily developed women — the performances were much smoother and the laughs more frequent. The actors, who had not been told about the dispute with program practices, were preparing themselves for the first of two tapings before studio audiences—one at 5:30 and the other at 8—which would be edited together into the final version. As Lear began to read his notes on the rehearsal there was a faintly manic, tension‐releasing hilarity in the room, which Perry Lafferty's call, followed minutes later by Cunneff delivering the zap letter, suddenly reduced to disbelief and then despair. Lear's first instinct was to cancel the project altogether. But when he learned from his company's lawyers that he was now legally obligated to assume the pilot's considerable production costs in any case, he decided to tape the performances after all, hoping to sell the series to another network if matters could not be worked out at CBS. As was his usual practide, he went out to do the audience warm‐up—a few jokes, some welcoming patter and the punch line: “Believe it or not, you are a part of this show. See those microphones over your heads. If you were to laugh or perhaps even applaud occasionally....” After the taping, Lear shouted, “Keep the audio running,” to the sound man in the control booth and ran down to the stage before the audience began filing out. He announced that the network considered the program they had just watched unfit for family viewing and asked if anyone agreed with CBS. Dead silence. “Does anyone disagree?” Enthusiastic applause. It would be the last sound the network officials in New York who reviewed the tape would hear. But by the time the edited tape reached New York 10 days later, it had received program practices' approval. Lear's teen‐aged daughters, who had attended the taping, both told him that “hang a b.a.” was dated 50's jargon and, before leaving for a European vacation that day, he told Manings to cut it. On his own, Manings cut the “score city” line because he felt that the super's character was sufficiently well‐delineated without it. Julie's “hand‐under‐thesweater” narrative left in, but program practices had never felt very strongly about cutting it. The real rub came around the exchange of pinches between the super and Gael, since Manings argued that her quick comeback to the super's advances was “too generic to her character to lose” and Lear's business people complained that the pinches weren't worth a quarter of a million dollars. In the end, Manings edited the pinches out, but he vowed to restore them if CBS accepted the pilot. He never got the chance. All the top‐level CBS executives who reviewed the pilot in mid‐April saw it as a “soft property,” an unlikely bet for a successful series. Fred Silverman found the character of Julie unrelievedly strident (“A complete pain in the rear,” he told Lear later) and Joan Darling's over‐all direction too plodding. But he also found the emergingwoman theme of the pilot intriguing, if a bit heavyhanded, and liked Bonnie Franklin's Ann and Pat Harrington's superintendent very much. Silverman reached Lear in Copenhagen to tell him that the pilot had not met with an enthusiastic response and to ask if he would agree to reshoot it. Lear agreed, but by then it was too late for the show to go on in the fall. At best, “Three to Make Ready” could become a midreason replacement for a failing series. Acting in part on Silverman's suggestions, Lear decided to eliminate the husband from the new pilot and to combine, the two roles of friend and “love interest” (Gael and young Dr. Silvers) into one all‐purpose, friendly love interest, a young lawyer instead of a young doctor. Julie would be softened but remain something of a problem teen‐ager (a pain in the neck instead of a pain in the rear) and, both for balance and for the dramatic possibilities of a sibling rivalry, she would be given a sweet‐tempered younger sister named Barbara. But the most significant changes in the pilot concerned Ann. Since it was felt that a woman with a career, even a nursing career, came across more emerged than emerging, Ann would now be temporarily employed as an Avon lady. More important, she would be recently divorced instead of recently separated, with the action starting a full year after she had walked out on her husband. In June, Allan Manings, along with two other scriptwriters from his “Good Times” show, wrote the new pilot, retaining only a few scenes, as well as the set, from the old version. In the opening scene of the new pilot, Julie begs her mother for permission to go on a coed camping trip, and Ann, forced to make an unpopular decision for the first time in her life, refuses. Fourteenyear‐old Barbara (“confident and all‐together”), who has just become the shortest member of the high‐school basketball team, gets embroiled in the family argument, as does David Kane, the “incurably romantic” young lawyer who has handled Ann's divorce from Ed only to fall in love with her him self. As a pilot, the new script clearly worked much better. There were fewer relationships to establish, more comedy inherent in the situation, a fuller and more sympathetic depiction of both Ann and Julie, a better indication of the direction of future episodes. But, just as clearly, this direction was toward more standard television fare, parent‐children conflict being the basic stuff of sitcoms. This was no longer a series about a couple in the process of getting a painful divorce but about a single woman with two kids trying to make it on her own—a show that might occasionally delve into sensitive areas but could easily turn into an updated version of “Bachelor Father.” By late June, the show was ready to be taped. Bonnie Franklin, Mackenzie Phillips and Pat Harrington were back in their original roles, although, not surprisingly, neither Joan Darling nor Lewis J. Stadlen were anywhere in sight. The elimination of the role of Gael left Marcia Rodd only temporarily jobless; Lear engaged her for a new series for NBC, “The Dumplings.” The only important matter still up in the air was the title of the series. “Three to Get Ready” no longer seemed appropriate. Lear's scriptbook for the pilot.was covered with all the other possibilities that had been tried out in the course of several months: “The Emerging Woman,” “Hello, Ann!,” “All About Us,” “Four‐Way Split,” “Untitled Epic,” “A Long Way to Go,” “Exit Laughing” and “One Day at a Time.” On the day the pilot was taped, the only suggestion not penciled out was “One Day at a Time”—referring to Ann's halting attempts to cope with her new life—and this became the title of the series. The production work went smoothly this time, and everyone seemed delighted with the new version. Everyone except Ray Cunneff, that is. At the end of the production week, he sent Lear a modified zap letter that listed three requested deletions the producers had refused to make and then stated: “If these lines remain in the finished program, this show may not be suitable for broadcast prior to 9 P.M.” When he saw the memo, Lear became particularly upset about one of the lines. During a conversation with David concerning the camping trip Julie wants to take with two of her girlfriends and three boys, Ann says, “That adds up to six sleeping bags. Side by side.” “Sleeping bags with zippers!” David says, “I see your problem.” Included in Cunneff's memo was the following: “David: ‘With zippers!’ Please delete.” A minute later, Lear was on the phone with Allan Burns, the producer of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” Lear and Burns were among the chief instigators of a suit that the Writers Guild of America was planning to file against the F.C.C. and the networks, charging that the family hour was an abridgement of the First‐Amendment right to free speech. “Can you believe that?” Lear asked Burns after reading him the memo. “A reference to zippers on sleeping bags. Not even on flies.” The new pilot was sent to CBS in mid‐July. The network tested all its pilots by inviting people in off the street to a screening room outfitted with approval/disapproval knobs on each seat and tabulating their reactions on a computer. Before the end of the month, Perry Lafferty called tear to tell him that “One Day at a Time” had tested “higher than any other pilot in years.” For weeks, Lear kept hearing about the wonderful test results for “One Day at a Time,” but nothing about whether the network would buy the series, although he was given an order to prepare six scripts, just in case. CBS was clearly waiting for the new season's Nielsen ratings before making up its corporate mind. The results proved to be disastrous. For the first time in years, the network failed to gain a firm lead in the ratings war. In late September, when Lear was finally given the green light to start production on “One Day at a Time,” the network “wanted it to be ready yesterday,” and he agreed to a mid‐December premiere. At that point, CBS executives rushed back to their magnetized scheduling board. Eventually, four shows, including the highly touted “Beacon Hill,” were canceled and others were placed in different time slots. In the new schedule, “Switch,” a detective series that had been airing on Tuesdays at 9 P.M., was moved into the 10 P.M. slot vacated by “Beacon Hill.” CBS's hit comedy, “M*A*S*H,” which had been in a ratings slump all season in a new Friday evening time period opposite NBC's “Chico and the Man,” was moved to Tuesday at 9 P.M. This left a hole in that night's lineup at 9:30, which CBS promptly filled with “One Day at a Time.” The fact that “M*A*S*H” would be the new sitcom's “lead‐in” show pleased Lear greatly. But, oddly enough, the fact that its time period was safely removed from the dreaded family hour did not. In large part, Lear's lack of enthusiasm for the scheduling of his show had to do with the economics of the television industry. A series with two teen‐agers as regular characters would probably do better early in the evening, when the audience tends to be younger. More important, a TV producer like Lear begins to make money from his shows only after their network run is over and he can sell them to independent stations for reruns. But a show that is scheduled after the family hour the first time around could prove more difficult to syndicate, since buyers might worry that its supposedly more sophisticated format would limit the time periods in which it could be safely aired. Their concern would probably be groundless. As the history of “One Day at a Time” illustrated, the sanitizing influence of the family hour seemed to be extending to all the rest of prime‐time television. It was no small irony that, although Lear and the CBS censors had been at one another's throats over family‐hour restrictions for months, when an accord was finally reached, the series was scheduled for a later time period, anyway. The reaction of most TV viewers to the whole dispute would doubtless invoke a curt “Please delete” from program practices. ■"
"Virginia Plant Shut, 28 Hospitalized in Pesticide Case",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/14/archives/virginia-plant-shut-28-hospitalized-in-pesticide-case.html,"HOPEWELL, Va., Dec. 13 (UPI)—Last summer, when a Health Department investigator went to an old gas station that had been converted into the world's only producer of the pesticide kepone he found the employees immersed in the white powdery chemical. “Kepone was everywhere,” Dr. Robert S. Jackson said. “They were sloshing around in it with no boots, gloves or respirators on.” Since then, 28 former employees of the now‐defunct Life Science Products Company have been hospitalized with traces of the poison in their blood. Symptoms include slurred speech, loss of memory, tremors, twitching eyes and liver damage. There is no known cure, and medical officials do not know if the damage is permanent. At least 10 children and wives of Life Science personnel and another 40 former employees have been found to have traces of kepone, which is used to poison fire ants and roaches, but none serious enough to require hospitalization. Of five known pregnancies among Life Science personnel, two have resulted in stillbirths and one in spontaneous abortion. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that kepone causes cancer in rats and mice, but have not determined whether it is carcinogenic in humans. State medical officials are awaiting the results of tests to determine whether residents of this blue‐collar city of 25,000, one of the South's major chemical centers, have been infected with kepone. Last June, one employee, Dale Gilbert, 34 years old, went to the company doctor complaining of tremors and pains. “He said it was probably stress and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer,” Mr. Gilbert said. “But I knew myself, I knew I wouldn't react to stress like this,” he said. Mr. Gilbert's wife set up an appointment with a local cardiologist, Dr. I‐Nan Chou. “I never saw anything like it before,” said Dr. Chou. “I put him in the hospital and sent a blood sample. to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta.” The results showed that Mr. Gilbert had kepone in his blood. Dr. Robert S. Jackson, state epidemiologist, was informed of the findings and went to Life Science where he found “kepone was everywhere.” Within 24 hours, after being told that the state Health Department was prepared to shut them down, Life Science voluntarily closed its operation. Mr. Gilbert is one of 10 former employees who have filed suit seeking a total of $24.9 million in damages. After Life Science was closed, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration charged it with violating safety regulations and assessed fines of $16,500. The charges are being contested."
Peanut farmer for President,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/14/archives/peanut-farmer-for-president-carter.html,"Jimmy Carter was hustling through the first day of his 17th campaign trip to Florida. It was a routine day's running‐for‐President—a Sertoma Club luncheon in St. Petersburg, news‐conference receptions at Sarasota and Port Charlotte in the afternoon—until he encountered the blonde at the bar in the Cove Inn Club. The Cove Inn Club is in the resort town of Naples, and it isn't your typical corner tavern where the Archie Bunker crowd gathers to guzzle beer and cuss the Government. It is sleek and dark and expensive, with Stunning waitresses who were busy serving up Scotch and smiles to the hundred or so well‐heeled Floridians who had turned out to examine this Georgia peanut farmer who aspires to the White House. “Here he is, folks, Gov. Jimmy Carter,” a local Democratic honcho yelled when the former Governor arrived. As the piano player struck up “Georgia on My Mind,” the slightly built candidate answered the ripple of applause with a wave and his quizzical, good‐old‐boy grin, then he was hustled off to a back room to meet the local press. A local TV reporter asked about Gov. George Wallace of Alabama, whom Carter would dearly love to defeat in Florida's Presidential primary next March, and Carter, a deceptively mild‐looking man, cheerfully put the knife to his Southern archrival for a while. Wallace, he allowed, is a “perennial candidate” who's forever running and losing, and who, Carter said, “will probably still be running for President in 1988, if he's able.” He didn't add, “And I assume he will be able,” but sometimes he does, lest anyone think he's suggesting that Wallace has a health problem. Warming up to his subject, Carter commented that Wallace runs very odd campaigns—“he raises a lot of money and spends very little”—but then he dropped the matter and left it to each listener to ponder the mysteries of George Wallace's finances. When the press was satisfied, Carter hurried back to confront the roomful of resort‐town Democrats who, he hoped, would give him their time and/or money in the months ahead. Aware that his name is not yet a household wood, Carter began with a bit of autobiography: Georgia farm boy, Annapolis graduate, naval officer/nuclear scientist, peanut farmer, State Senator, Governor of Georgia. Presidential candidate. He assured his listeners that he isn't after the Vice‐Presidency, that he expects to do well in the primaries next spring and that he'll be in the race “until the last vote is counted.” Carter's easy humor is one of his strong points, and he tossed out the two lines that had been his top laugh‐getters that month. One was his modest, aw‐shucks declaration that he hoped overcome the handicap of not being a lawyer—that got cheers as well as chuckles. The other was his Amy story. Amy is his daughter, and the story concerns the time a reporter asked him, apropos of Betty Ford's remarks about her daughter, how he would feel if his daughter had a premarital affair. The punch line, delivered with exquisite gravity: “I told him that Mrs. Carter and I would be deeply hurt and shocked and disappointed... because our daughter is only 7 years old.” By then, the ice was broken, and Carter moved smoothly into his attack on the “confused, bloated bureaucratic mess in Washington.” It happens that Carter, as Governor of Georgia, did a good job of streamlining the state government, and he tells every audience that he seeks nothing more in life than to get his hands on that infamous mess in Washington. He also reminds his audiences that, unlike most of his rivals for the Democratic nomination, “I'm not a member of Congress, so I'm not responsible for letting that horrible mess develop.” Carter took questions from the audience, and one of the first was about the energy crisis. He quickly branded President Ford a pawn of the oil companies (“I think President Ford is honest and sincere—he's honestly and sincerely wrong about almost everything”), then he heatedly declared that if the Arabs ever tried an oil embargo when he was President, he'd declare “all‐out economic war” before he'd let America be “brought to her knees again.” That was good tough stuff, red meat, as the politicians say, and it drew lusty cheers of approval. Unfortunately, Carter then started on his three‐point energy program, which has to do with things like allocations and decontrols and alternate forms of energy, and which may well be brilliant, but tends to put normal people to sleep. That may be Carter's main failing as a speaker, a tendency to try too hard, to tell too much, as if to overcome whatever preconceptions his audiences might hold about former Southern governors. (Comic Mort Sahl used to have a line about all the Southerners in the Army becoming N.C.O.'s, except the ones who were too dumb and were sent back home to be governors.) So, some heads were nodding at the Cove Inn Club when the blonde at the bar woke them up abruptly. She was tanned, ponytailed, fortyish and mad as hell. “What are you gonna do about those welfare cases who don't went to work?” she demanded. “The ones who've already bankrupted New York City and Detroit and Washington, D.C.?” “I'm glad you asked that,” said Carter, the very soul of reason. “I think the first thing we have to do is to separate those who can work from those who can't.” “They don't want to work,” the lady protested. “I've talked to people on welfare who enjoy it!” “Well, the statistics show that only about 10 percent of the people on welfare are able to work.” Carter said. “The rest are children mothers or handicapped or....” “I don't believe that,” the blonde cried. “Well, perhaps you'd better believe your statistics and I'll believe mine,” Carter suggested, and began to outline his position on Jimmy Carter thinks he knows something other politicians have not perceived. Even now, he is challenging George Wallace by urging compassion for welfare recipients and jobs as the answer to crime. welfare, which is that the system should be simplified, that some sort of national minimum income should be provided, that able‐bodied recipients should be offered training and jobs—and be denied benefits if they refuse jobs—and that those welfare recipients who can't work should be treated with “compassion and respect.” “But they don't want to work!” the blonde persisted, as people began to shush her and mutter that she was drunk. “I disagree with you about the quality of people on welfare,” Carter replied patiently. Then he talked about the wel fare mothers his administration in Georgia had put to work caring for mentally retarded children. But the blonde wasn't buying it, and she interrupted again, raging about bankrupt cities, until Carter cut her off with the comment that either he didn't understand her question or else it wasn't understandable. It had gotten a bit tense in the Cove Inn Club. One feared the irate blonde might cry, “Welfare ‐ mother ‐ lover” and attack the mild‐mannered Georgian. One sensed, too, that many of those in the audience shared the lady's views on welfare. Yet it had been a nice moment, a chance to see the candidate under pressure. Down at my end of the bar, I scribbled in my notebook: “Good—stubbornstuck to his guns,” but at the same time I was wondering if any man could hope to defeat George Wallace in Florida advocating “compassion and respect” for welfare recipients. As it happens, Jimmy Carter and his political backers are wondering the same thing. There was another nice moment at a reception two days later, near the end of Carter's Florida tour. He was fielding questions as he stood beside the swimming pool at a motel in Clearwater, when the leader of a group of schoolgirls asked him how he felt about the Equal Rights Amendment. Carter grinned and replied, “I can answer that in three words: I'm for it.” He might have stopped there. The schoolgirls were cheering and his aides were signaling that it was time to go. Instead, Carter's grin faded, for he had something more to say: “I come from a part of Georgia where almost every woman worked. My mother was a nurse. My wife's father died when she was 13 and her mother became a seamstress, making clothes for the more prosperous women in town. I've seen women working in Southern textile mills in a way that shamed and embarrassed me. I've worked in the fields, and I've never seen men work as hard as those women. We tried to pass E.R.A. when I was Governor of Georgia, and we failed. And do you know who our main opponents were? The John Birch Society and the textile mills!” Minutes later, Carter was speeding toward the airport as a reporter complimented him on his E.R.A. remarks. Carter's aides describe him as an aloof executive who enjoys neither giving nor receiving compliments and he brushed this one aside impatiently: “Half those people probably oppose E.R.A.” The moment of populist passion had passed, the door to his poor‐boy past was slammed shut, and he was once again the cool, self‐critical and very private politician. Jimmy Carter may or may not become President, but he is certainly one of the more interesting men to seek that office in recent times. His career suggests complexity, with its progression from farm boy to naval officer/nuclear scientist to peanut farmer/politician. Personally, Carter is a soft‐spoken thoughtful, likable man, an introspective man who enjoys the songs of Bob Dylan, the poems of Dylan Thomas and the writings of James Agee, William Faulkner, John McPhee and Reinhold Niebuhr. Yet this slightly built, seemingly shy man is also one of the most driven, relentless, downright stubborn political campaigners who ever came out of the South. He stubbornly defied segregation in his little home town of Plains; he stubbornly overcame overwhelming odds to become Governor of Georgia, and now he is just as stubbornly running for President. What makes him run? Rudderless ambition, his critics say. Religion, his aides suggest, a sense of personal destiny. His wife, Rosalynn, a formidable political campaigner herself, says she doesn't know, except that “Jimmy has strong feelings about things; he won't let anybody push him around.” Carter himself waves away such speculation except to say that, upon examining the competition, he's always found himself to be the best man in the race. He is a Southerner, of course, a man whose political engines have been fired by a lifelong conflict between his conservative background and his liberal instincts. Wherever his ambitions havp taken him, his roots have always stayed deep in the flat, peanut and pine ‐ growing country around Plains, in southwest Georgia, where his ancestors arrived in the 1830's and where he, James Earl Carter Jr., was born on Oct. 1, 1924. He grew up in the crossroads community of Archery, about three miles west of Plains, in a wooden clapboard house that didn't have electricity until he was in his teens. His father, a farmer and a storekeeper, was a political conservative and segregationist, and a community leader who, late in life, was elected to the State Legislature. His mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, was—and is today, in her late 70's—quite a different personality. She was a nurse by profession, working in the Plains hospital, and also serving as a kind of community doctor to the people of Archery. (Campaigning today, Carter often denounces doctors who won't leave their offices to practice the kind of preventive medicine his mother attempted.) In 1966, at the age of 68, Lillian Carter joined the Peace Corps and spent two years as a nurse in India. “My mother,” Carter says proudly, “is the most liberal person in the state of Georgia.” As a boy, Carter saw his parents' differing philosophies on the race issue acted out most dramatically. Carter grew up with the crazy quilt of small‐town segregation: In Archery, almost all his playmates were black, but in school or church in Plains all his classmates were white. Carter remembers well when blacks would come to the back door to do business with his father, and he also remembers the times when one young black, who had gone off to college in Boston, would boldly knock on the front door, and his father would leave the house while he and his mother entertained their black friend in the living room. Carter had an uncle in the Navy, who, for years, sent the boy postcards from exoticsounding ports of call, and he grew up with a dream of attending Annapolis. He got his appointment in the fall of 1943, and graduated in 1946, ranked 59th in a class of 820. Just after graduation, he married Rosalynn Smith, a pretty, intelligent, strong‐willed young woman from Plains who would in time emerge as an equal partner in all her husband's activities, politics included. Carter soon rose to a choice assignment: working with Capt. (later Adm.) Hyman Rickover on the development of the nuclear submarine. With his drive and political instincts, Carter might have risen high in the Navy; instead, late in 1953, he resigned his commission. His father was dying of cancer that summer, and Carter was given leave to be with him. As scores of family friends came to visit the dying man, his son became doubly depressed, not only at his father's approaching death but at the course his own life was taking. Despite his pride in his work with Rickover, he felt rootless, adrift. “There was a significance to my father's life,” he says now. “He was an important part of his community. He was his own boss. You have only one life, and I began to wonder if I should spend mine engaged in war, even if I could rationalize it as the prevention of war.” After a heated disagreement with his wife, who hadn't the slightest desire to return to Plains, Carter quit the Navy. He and Rosalynn and their three young sons moved into Plains's new public ‐ housing project, paying about $30‐amonth rent, and Carter went into the peanut business with his mother. Business was not good; 1954 was a drought year, and Carter cleared less than $200. Moreover, the year was marked by the first of his many clashes with his home town over the race issue. The Supreme Court had outlawed racially segregated schools, and all across Dixie angry Southerners were forming White Citizens Councils to fight for continued segregation. One day, Carter was visited at his peanut warehouse by the local chief of police and the Baptist minister, who said they were organizing a White Citizens Council. Carter wouldn't join. The men returned a few days later and told Carter he was the only white man in Plains who hadn't joined. Carter said he didn't care. The third time the organizers came, they brought some of Carter's friends and customers, who warned that his business would suffer if he didn't join. They added that they knew he'd had a bad year, and if he lacked the $5 dues they'd lend it to him. “I've got $5,” Carter told them. “And I'd flush it down the toilet before I'd give it to you.” A boycott of Carter's peanut warehouse proved to be shortlived. (Eccentricity is a major art form of the rural South; much is forgiven anyone who breaks the monotony.) But there were other clashes ahead. In 1961, Carter, as the local school‐board chairman, advocated a schoolconsolidation plan which his neighbors feared was an integration scheme. In 1964, the Carter family cast the only votes in favor of admitting blacks to the Plains Baptist Church. Later that year, Carter's mother's car was vandalized when she was running the local Johnson‐for‐President office, and his son Chip was beaten up at school for wering an L.B.J. button. Looking back now, Carter tends to play down these conflicts, stressing that his neighbors in Plains were good people who had been misled by demagogic politicians. Rosalynn remembers those bad times more vividly. “It was tough back then,” she told me one evening. “I remember when people wouldn't speak to us in church. I'll tell you the kind of thing that happened. In the summer of 1965, we all went on a vacation to Mexico. While we were gone, a rumor started that we were at an integration camp in Alabama. When we came home, right at peanut‐harvest time, we didn't have any customers. One man told us, ‘Nobody's gonna bring you their peanuts, Jimmy; we found out about you and that integration camp.’ We had to track the rumor down to the man who started it and prove it wasn't true. “Before that, there was the time Jimmy made that speech in church, about letting the black people attend, and the time when Jimmy was schoolboard chairman. We'd always had terrible schools. Jimmy had a plan to consolidate. We could have had a great school system. But everybody said he just wanted to integrate the schools. That was another time we got boycotted.” Despite the controversies, Carter built his peanut warehouse into a successful business, one that today has an estimated value of $750,000. In 1962, angered by the defeat of his school ‐ consolidation plan, he ran for the State Senate. He won despite some flagrant ballot‐stuffing directed against him by a local political boss, and soon emerged as an outspoken and hard‐working Senator with a special interest in improving the state's educational sys‐tem. In 1966, after two terms in the Senate, Carter passed up what seemed to be a surething race for Congress to enter a crowded race for the Democratic nomination for Governor. He finished a strong third behind Ellis Arnall, a liberal former Governor, and Lester Maddox, the segregationist restaurant owner, who eventually became Governor. It was a bitter defeat for Carter, not simply to lose but to lose to the oafish Maddox, a man he holds in total contempt. His response was to keep on running. For four years, he crisscrossed Georgia. shaking hands, visiting newspaper offices and addressing civic groups. Still, as the 1970 election neared, Carter's opponent, former Gov. Carl Sanders, was an overwhelming favorite. Sanders had been a good Governor (in 1963–67) and he had solid support from blacks, Atlanta‐area liberals and the state's newspapers and political establishment. But Sanders had one weakness: Many voters saw him as too liberal and as having acquiesced in federally ordered programs of desegregation. Carter was probably more liberal than Sanders, but Carter carefully positioned himself as the more conservative candidate, the candidate of the farmer and the little man. He denounced Sanders as “Cuff‐Links Carl,” a big spender, a pawn of the Great Society and a fancy‐pants friend of the rich: The antiestablishment strategy worked, since Carter defeated Sanders by mobilizing the state's rural, white voters, the same voters who in past elections had gone solidly for Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Although Carter campaigned as pro‐civil rights, many Georgia conservatives seemingly chose to disbelieve him, or to see him as a lesser evil to the known “liberalism” of Sanders. Carter ran with the public support of several of Georgia's leading segregationist politicians, men who perhaps thought they could control Carter if they helped elect him. If so, they were disap pointed quickly, when Carter declared in his inaugural address: “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over. . . . No poor, rural, weak or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity of an education, a job or simple justice.” That declaration, and the actions that followed it, brought Carter his first taste of national celebrity. When Time magazine ran a lead story on the “New South” two months later, it was Carter's face that peered out from its cover. Meanwhile, at the Governor's mansion in Atlanta, Carter and a team of young aides were busy with an ambitious program of government reorganization, conservation and reform of the state's prison, mentalhealth and judicial systems. Carter won legislative approval of a bill that reduced Georgia's 300 departments and agencies to a more manageable 22. A century‐old jumble of overlapping services —multiple state computer, printing and transportation systems, for example—was streamlined, paperwork was reduced and, by the end of his term, administrative costs were cut almost in half. To pass his bill, Carter had to agree that no state employees would be fired, but the state payroll was reduced by attrition from an annual increase of 14 percent to 2 percent. In race relations, Carter set up a biracial civil‐disorder unit to negotiate local disputes, appointed many blacks to state jobs and judgeships, and, in his most dramatic act, arranged for a portrait of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to be hung in the State Capitol. During the ceremony, Carter and an integrated audience joined in singing “We Shall Overcome.” Carter's performance on civil rights was such that two of Georgia's most respected black leaders, U.S. Representative Andrew Young and State Senator Julian Bond, now have high praise for him, and Young is actively supporting Carter's Presidential candidacy. Carter clashed frequently with the State Legislature, as well as with lobbyists for special‐interest groups, and, in the process, won a reputation for being stubborn and inflexible, a moralist with little appreciation for the art of political compromise. Hamilton Jordan, a 30‐year‐old Georgian who is one of Carter's closest aides, recalls a time when a State Senator told him he would vote for the government ‐ reorganization bill if Carter would promote his father, who held a minor state job. “I was elated,” Jordan says. “I went to the Governor and told him we had the key vote we needed. But he said, ‘Hell, no, I didn't run for Governor for four years to pass bills by promoting that guy's father.’ He wouldn't do it. ” But Carter insists that reports of his stubbornness are exaggerated, and that he simply doesn't want to give away in advance what might be saved by hard bargaining. Still, when his program was stalled in the Legislature, his instinct was to “take it to the people,” and he now tells audiences that if he became President and Congress stalled his Government‐reorganization package he would “take it to the people” in the Congressional elections of 1978. As Governor, Carter began attending the various Governors’ Conferences, and he soon concluded that he was as well‐informed as the Rockefellers and Reagans and other would‐be Presidents he met there. The same thing happened in 1971–72, when the various Democratic Senators who aspired to the Presidency began courting his support: “Humphrey, Muskie, Jackson, McGovern—they all came to see me and we'd discuss national issues and I decided I knew as much as they did. I started to think about the Presidency in human terms, not historical term.” Carter opposed McGovern at the 1972 Democratic convention, made a nominating speech for Senator Jackson (the national television exposure meant as much to him as the Jackson cause, his aides say) and even before McGovern's defeat began planning his own bid for the nomination in 1976. (“The first time we talked about it, it was embarrassing,” Hamilton Jordan says. “The words stuck in our throats.”) It was obvious that Carter's greatest handicap was simply that he was not well‐known nationally and that he lacked the media exposure that goes to Washington‐based candidates. To some extent, Carter thinks the Watergate scandals lessened that problem for him, by souring millions of Americans on all politicians and making it easier for him to run as a nonincumbent and a national newcomer. He thinks 1976 may be the year when it is better to run for President as a peanut farmer than as a U.S. Senator. Essentially, Carter's scenario for the nomination goes like this: First, he believes that next year's Democratic convention will not deadlock, and therefore will not nominate a noncandidate like Senator Humphrey or Senator Kennedy. He further assumes the convention will reject Senators Henry Jackson and Lloyd Bentsen as too conservative, and will nominate the liberal candidate who does best in the primaries, probably himself, Senator Birch Bayh or Representative Morris Udall. The early primaries are crucial to Carter's hopes. He has been campaigning hard in Iowa, which holds party caucuses in January, and he says one straw poll has shown him ahead there. He predicts that either he or Udall will win in New Hampshire in February, and then he will look to the all‐important Florida primary in March, where he hopes to upset George Wallace and thus attract the money and the media attention that could lead to victories in the crucial big‐state primaries later in the spring. Carter's scenario does not seem as preposterous at the end of 1975 as it did at the beginning. He has progressed from “Jimmy Who?” when he announced his candidacy in January to being a frontrunner for the Vice‐Presidential nomination and a serious contender for the Presidential nomination. The secret of his success has been simple: hard work. While other candidates have been coy or indecisive, Carter has been on the road 250 days this year, meeting local Democratic leaders, building an organi zation and locking up delegates. “Sometimes, I think we're the only people trying to win this nomination,” one of his aides told me with the quiet arrogance of a politician who sees the tide running his way. Carter and his advisers think that next year's election may he decided more on personality—on character—than on issues, and they hope that his aura of honesty and sincerity will make the difference in post‐Watergate America. They hope, moreover, that in the primaries his lowkeyed, “moderate” style, and his background as farmer and small‐businessman, will win him the Democratic center, while such candidates as Udall, Bayh and Sargent Shriver split up the liberal vote. As he travels about, Carter's pitch is more idealistic than ideological. He says that America is drifting, that people are ashamed of their Government, and that all he wants is to see America with a Government “as idealistic, as decent, as competent, as compassionate, as good as its people.” He closes almost every speech by saying earnestly that he would never tell a lie or duck an issue just to be President—a piety that makes some journalists groan aloud, but that apparently impresses many listeners. Carter does not ignore the issues, of course, and when you move beyond style to substance he shapes up as a fairly conventional liberal, but one whose views take a conservative, bounce now and then. He calls himself a fiscal conservative, and he hammers away at the need for Government cost‐cutting, stressing that as Governor of Georgia he practiced what he preached. Carter favors national health insurance, the elimination of all tax deductions, massive public ‐ works programs to reduce unemployment, taking the Attorney General out of the Cabinet and severe budget‐cutting at the Pentagon, which he calls “the most bloated bureaucracy of all.” On the “triple A” issues—acid, amnesty, abortion—that caused McGovern such woe in 1972, Carter says he favors decriminalization of marijuana, approves the Supreme Court ruling that made abortion a private mat ter and wants a generous policy toward war resisters but doesn't favor “blanket amnesty.” In foreign affairs, seemingly his area of weakness, Carter does his homework, talks a lot about his trips to Latin America, Japan, Israel and other conntries, and sometimes remarks that if “experts” have masterminded recent American foreign policy, perhaps it's time to give a nonexpert a chance. He favors diplomatic recognition of Cuba, Presidential controls that would end C.I.A. illegality and a phasing‐out of U.S. troops in South Korea. He supports Henry Kissinger's Middle East negotiations, but criticizes Kissinger as too secretive, too quick to involve the U.S. in the affairs of other nations and too inclined to ignore traditional allies in his pursuit of détente. He cites Vietnam as a prime example of misguided U.S. involvement in other nations' affairs, but concedes that he supported the war there until the spring of 1971. It is imprudent but not impossible to speculate on the sort of President Carter might be, at least in those domestic areas that parallel his record as Governor. To begin with, there is no cause to doubt that he is deadly serious about Government reorganization, tax reform, national health care, public works and the other domestic programs he calls for. Carter's dream is to be elected next year amid a Democratic landslide that would give him the kind of Congressional majority that L.B.J. enjoyed in 1965–66; failing that, if his reforms were stalled in Congress, he would surely emulate his hero Harry Truman, take his case to the people in ringing, moralistic speeches and either elect his kind of Congress in 1978 or wind up as a sorely disappointed and frustrated Pressident. If he became President, Carter would owe little to the Democratic Party's establishment figures, and we might expect to see many new faces on the Washington scene. Carter's three main advisers as Governor were his wife, who took an active part in his mental‐health reforms and is also regarded as a shrewd and influential judge of men and their motives; Charles Kirho, a folksy, highly successful Atlanta lawyer who has been Carter's senior political adviser since his first campaign for the State Senate, and Hamilton Jordan, 30, who was with the International Voluntary Services in Vietnam before joining Carter's 1970 campaign, and who now ranks as his chief day‐to‐daypolitical operative. To those who feel that race is the most explosive and enduring issue in American politics, perhaps Carter's most interesting positions are those on such race‐related matters as busing, welfare, crime and voting rights. On the busing issue, Carter says he opposes “mandatory busing” and favors the voluntary busing programs now operating in Atlanta and other cities. He refuses to make the politically fashionable attacks on welfare “chiselers.” He told several groups in Florida that the Voting Rights Act was “the best thing that ever happened to the South.” He never volunteered a comment on the crime issue when I was with him, but when an elderly man asked him about it, he said, “I honestly believe —and you may not like my answer—that one of the best ways to cut down on crime is to cut down on unemployment... Your own son, if out on the street and unable to find work, might turn to crime.” There are not many politicians in America today who would run against George Wallace in Florida by urging compassion for welfare recipients and saying jobs are the answer to crime, but Carter thinks he knows something that the other politicians have not yet perceived. He believes the South wants to put the race issue behind it, and that progressive leaders like himself and Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida—not the George Walaces and Strom Thurmonds—speak for the South of today. He talked about his vision of a new South one evening as we drove past the integrated elementary school his daughter attends in Plains. “Look how neat and clean they keep it,” Carter said proudly. “You won't see any vandalism at that school. Those kids don't know who's black and who's white. Sure, their parents have painful memories, but no one wants to go back to the old struggle that's debilitating and embarrassing and counterproductive. It's like an old wound that no one wants to reopen.” Carter thinks that other parts of the country—Boston, for example—are now passing through the period of trauma the South passed through a decade ago, and that they, too, will reach a point of racial understanding. It is a large and tantalizing vision, but whether it is a true glimpse of tomorrow or only wishful thinking, no one now can say. If Carter is right, he may end up on the Democratic ticket. If he is wrong, he may not be much heard from after the Florida primary. But Carter thinks he is right and is therefore fighting stubbornly toward the great goal he has set for himself. When I visited him in Plains, he took me on a tour of his little home town one evening. After returning to his house, we sat in the car and talked for a while. “We built this house in 1961,” he said. “I figured it up one time: This is the 15th house Rosalynn and I have lived in, counting the Navy.” He started to get out, then shook his head and smiled. “There's just one more house I want to live in,” he said. “Then I'll settle down here for good.” ■"
Clergymen Endorse Right to Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/14/archives/clergymen-endorse-right-to-abortion.html,"The New Jersey Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights said last week that 65 religious leaders within the state had signed a statement opposing the adoption of a constitutional amendment that would weaken the United States Supreme Court decision on abortion. The announcement was made by the coalition's coordinator, the Rev. Raymond J. Pontier of Passaic. He said that all the signers had agreed to have their names sent to state and Federal legislators and to the press. Among the signers, according to the announcement, were Bishop George E. Rath of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, Rabbi Bernardalotowitz of the MetroPolitim Council of American Hebrew Congregations, the Rev. Glenn Hatfield of the American Baptist Churches in NewJersey, and Dr. John W. Beardslee 3d, professor at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary and a minister of the Reformed Church of America. The announcement, said that the coalition “was formed nationally in response to pressures to overturn the Supreme Court raling and thus prohibit the freedom of the individual to make a responsible decision and choice for a legal and medically safe abortion.”"
"Summary of Actions Taken on Criminal, Civil and Rights Issues by Supreme Court at Session in Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/16/archives/summary-of-actions-taken-on-criminal-civil-and-rights-issues-by.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 15—The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION It asked the Solicitor General, Robert H. Bork, to present “the views of the United States” on pending requests for Supreme Court review of two lower court rulings involving persons generally eligible for government assistance under the Social Security Act. In one case, Beal v. Doe, No. 75‐624, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled last summer that Pennsylvania's denial of payments for nontherapeutic abortions for‐women who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid violeted the Social Security*Act. In the dther case, Jones v. T— H—, etc., No. 75‐624, a Federal District Court in Utah struck down Utah's regulations requiring, parental consent before minors who are eligible for A.F.D.C. payments and Medicaid can get contraceptive advice andservices from the state's family planning program.. ATTORNEYS With two members dissenting, the Court refused to take up the question of a Federal Court's power to discipline a lawyer who has already been disciplined by a state court. It declined to review—and thus left in effect—a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that said, basically, that when a Federal Court was acting on a record that was made in state disciplinary proceedings, the Federal Court was bound by the state court's interpretation of the record. In the case, United States District Court for the District of New Jersey v. Abrams, No, 75‐487, the New Jersey Supreme Court suspended the lawyer. for one year from the state courts for knowingly assisting a client to niake an illegal $20,000 payment to a Jersey City official. The Federal District Court then disbarred the attorney from practice in the Federal Court. The Appeals Court reversed. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, in a dissent joined by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., said the Court should have reversed the Appeals Court summarily, and noted, “A Federal Court may well determine that conduct found tolerable by another jurisdiction merits disbarment in Federal Court, as our actions disciplining members of this court's bar implicitly demonstrated.” CIVIL RIGHTS At the urging of the Solicifor General, the Court agreed. to decide whether states can be ,required to pay retroac tive benefits and attorneys' fee to people who prove that the states discriminated against them in employment in violation of Federal equal employment opportunity laws. The legal issue is whether the 11th Amendment bars, Federal Courts from making such awards against states. (Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, No. 75‐251; Bitzer v. Mathews, NO. 75‐283). (News article, Page 22) CRIMINAL The Court set the stage for a further review of the rights granted to criminal defendants by the Court's landmark Miranda case in 1966—a case that some critics, and some Justices, say the Burger Court is eroding. It agreed to review an Iowa murder case, Breer v. Williams, No. 74‐1263, in which lower Federal Courts ruled that the defendant had been denied rights guaranteed by Miranda. (News article, Page 24) JUVENILES At the request of Pennsylvania Welfare Department officals, the Court issued a stay, pending appeal, of a far‐reaching Federal Court ruling last month that mandated a series of procedural rights for juveniles who are committed to state mental institutions. The three‐judge Federal Court found that Pennsylvania's existing com mitment procedures were unconstitutional and ordered the state to either recommit the patients—about 9,000—under proper procedures within 120 days, or release them (Jack B. Kremens et al. v. Kevin B. Bartley et al., No. A‐527). SCHOOL DESEGREGATION The Court declined to review a case involving a south Texas community, Uvalde, in which Mexican ‐ American children were traditionally taught in separate schools from “Anglo” children. In the first round of the case, the Federal District Court found no segregative intent; the United States Appeals Court for the Fifth Circuit then ruled the district court findings “clearly erroneous” and ordered a desegregation plan. As a result of the Supreme Court's refusal to take the case, the Appeals Court decision stands. (Shannon v. Morale, No. 75‐598). The Court also declined to review a lawsuit that alleged racial discrimination against black faculty members in the public schools of Charles County, Md., where the ratio of black faculty to white faculty has declined as more white students have come into the schools. The United States Court of Appeals, whose ruling now stands, decided against the plaintiffs (Morton v. Charles County Board of Education, No. 75‐609). TAX The court agreed to hear a case in which the Internal Revenue Service seized assets of a corporation, said to be only a “shell” for an individual, to satisfy the individual's income tax liability. The Court limited its review, however, to only one of the questions for which review had been sought: whether the seizure of automobiles and documents violated the corporation's Fourth Amendment rights. (G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, No. 75‐235). ZONING The Court agreed to decide whether an almost all‐white suburban community has a duty to rezone a portion of its land to allow construction of an integrated low and moderate income housing project, where there is no other reasonable opportunity for such housing and where the area has traditionally been racially segregated. (Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., No. 75‐616 . (News article, Page 22)"
BISHOPS OF ITALY ASSAIL RED PARTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/16/archives/bishops-of-italy-assail-red-party-communists-election-gain-on.html,"ROME, Dec. 15—The Roman Catholic Church intensified its effort to mobilize voters in Italy against the Communist Party today with a new attack saying that one cannot be a Christian and a Marxist at the same time.” A declaration by Italy's bishops, who said their words were in “profound communion” with Pope Paul VI, was clearly designed to deprive the Communist Party of some of its momentum. It is now Italy's second largest party, just behind the Christian Democrats, and threatening to win control of Rome itself in local elections next spring. The Vatican has become increasingly worried about the extent of Communist power in Italy, particularly since June when, after regional elections, the Communists emerged just two percentage points behind the Christian Democrats. Vatican officials said the church had decided to leave no doubt in the minds of the voters on where it stood. Ruling Party Exhorted At the same time the Vatican has made it clear it still regards the Christian Democrats as the main bulwark against any power‐sharing with the Communists. But the governing Christian Democratic Party, which has dominated politics here for more than 30 years, has also been under strong pressure from church spokesmen to clean house and reshape its programs to retain and gain support. One of the most outspoken members of the church on the issue, has been Ugo Cardinal Poletti, the Pope's Vicar for Rome. He has denounced the “atheistic doctrines” of the Communists, called upon the Christian Democrats to pay more attention to the country's problems and stressed that if the Communists win a government role it would be against the wishes of the church and “over its opposition.” Although polling techniques are in Italy, not the best, a sampling last month predicted that the Communists would overtake the Christian Democrats if general elections were held now. Such elections are not scheduled until 1977, though a Government crisis could lead to a vote next year. No Attention to God In their statement today, the bishops said that any support of movements based on Marxism was “incompatible with the profession of the Christian faith.” They added: “Though such movements and doctrines propose admirable human ideals and affirm a readiness to face problems of urgent necessity, they nevertheless pay no attention to primary values concerning the integral vision of man, his history and his relationship to God. They lack real credibility and they inevitably lead to other forms of slavery.” Some Vatican sources said that the statement and previous anti ‐ Communist declarations were aimed not only at Italians in general but also at lay people who work within the church and at priests who tend to sympathize with Marxist ideology. The unanswered political question is how much impact such declarations have. The church suffered a rebuff in May 1974 when Italians voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to retain laws permitting civil divorce. Another referendum, on abortion, was authorized last week by Italy's Constitutional Court. But this one, scheduled for next year, is unlikely to be held because the Christian Democrats, despite Vatican opposition, are pushing through legislation that would legalize abortions under limited conditions. In their statement the bishops once more stressed the view of the church that “abortion is a crime, the killing of an innocent life,” and appealed to legislators, who have been under pressure from women's groups, to set the bill aside."
"SENATE CONFIRMS STEVENS, 98 TO 0",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/18/archives/senate-confirms-stevens-98-to-0-he-will-be-sworn-by-burger-tomorrow.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 17—The Senate confirmed the nomination of Judge John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court by a vote of 98 to 0 today after just five minutes of discussion. Judge Stevens will be sworn in Friday morning by Chief Justice Warren B. Burger as the 101st man to sit on the high court. His swearing‐in will bring the Court to full strength and will clear the way for the resolution of a number of important cases that had been delayed because of the illness of the Justice whom Judge Stevens succeeds, William O. Douglas, who resigned Nov. 12. The swearing‐in will also conclude one of the briefer nomination ‐ and ‐ confirmation proceedings in the Court's recent times. The Senate vote came less than three weeks after President Ford announced the nomination and one week after a three‐day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the main factors in Mr. Ford's choice of Judge Stevens, a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, was the likelihood that he could be confirmed easily. There had been some speculation that the Senate Would proceed slowly, however, and that there would be no vote until January. Instead, the Senate seemed to move with uncommon speed —so much so that today, rounding up and counting the votes took four times as long as the so‐called “debate” on the nomination that preceded the vote. The Senate took up the Stevens nomination after its secret session on Angola, with more than a few of its members absent. Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that the committee had fully investigated Judge Stevens and personally concluded: “I think he'd be a worthy addition to our Supreme Court. In fact I think he'd make a great Justice.” Senator John L. McClellan, Democrat of Arkansas, submitted a written statement. Senator Adlai E. Stevenson 3d, Democrat Of Illinois, Judge Stevens's home state, called Mr. Ford's choice “a most propitious nomination.” Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, remarked on the “thoroughness” of the committee investigation and the high caliber of judicial appointments from his state. Senator Roman L. Hruska of Nebraska, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said that the nominee had been “very frank grid forthright” in his answers to the committee. Two Missing Votes Everyone present when his name was called voted aye. Then those who had been out of the room—more than half of the membership—returned to cast their votes. The nomination was confirmed with only two Senators missing—Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, and James B. Allen, Democrat of Alabama. Mr. Allen was in a hospital; Mr. Bayh's absence was not explained. The Court that Judge Stevens will join is facing a growing list of critical issues, including the death penalty, racial segre gation in private schools, courtimposed “gag” orders on the press and a variety of questions involving abortion. Some of these issues have come up only recently. Some, however, have been on the docket for some time, including a number that the Court accepted months ago for review. None of the most critical cases on the docket several months ago were scheduled for argument this fall, with the exception of a challenge to the campaign financing law. This case had to be heard rapidly because of the approaching election year."
Dow Up 1.97 as Investors Ponder Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/18/archives/dow-up-197-as-investors-ponder-taxes-dow-gains-197-taxes-pondered.html,"Stock prices rose slightly in moderate trading yesterday as investors pondered the outlook for 1976 taxes. The Senate and the House passed legislation that would extend 1975 tax reductions through the first half of next year. The legislation, which the President later vetoed, contains no provision for matching the tax cuts with reductions in Government spending. President Ford had said he would veto tax‐reduction measures not accompanied by spending cuts. If Congress is unable to override the President's action, withholding‐tax rates will rise Jan. 1, a move some analysts feel may slow the economic recovery. This uncertainty, coupled with continuing year‐end portfolio adjustments, led to a mixed trading session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 2.44 points in the first half hour of trading, was down 0.08 by 2 P.M. The index closed at 846.27, up 1.97 points. Of 1,882 issues traded, 803 advanced, 549 declined and 530 closed unchanged. Twelve stocks reached 1975 highs and 18 declined to yearly lows. Volume fell to 16.56 million shares from 18.35 million on Tuesday. There were 107 blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded yesterday, down from 147 Tuesday. The day's most active issue was Merck, which lost 3⅝ to 72¾ on a turnover of 215,000 shares. On Tuesday the company announced that its earnings growth was slowing in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in the pharmaceutical group, Abbott Laboratories fell ¼ at 39¾ and Pfizer dropped ¼ to 26¼. Upjohn, on the other hand, rose 1⅜ at 44¼ and Bristol‐Myers was up ¾ at 71⅛. Personal Income Up Beyond the uncertainties sur rounding the tax questions, investors were given several positive economic reports yesterday. The Government reported that the United States recorded a $1.58 billion basic payments surplus in the third quarter and that personal income last month rose 0.9 percent. “It would appear that this year like 1973 and 1974 saw a significant low on the Dow Jones industrial average, set in the first week of December,” said William M. LeFevre, an analyst at Granger & Company. “Whether or not the 818.80 low of this Dec. 5 will lead to as great a percentage gain as last year depends primarily on a continuation of rather than an abortion of the economic recovery and a continuing improving consumer confidence. “It is a mathematical fact, however, that a 28.5 percent increase over this December low would place the D.J.I.A. above its all‐time high closing of 1,051.70 set back in January 1973.” A.T.&T. Declines American Telephone and Telegraph, the most widely held stock in the United States, was active and lower yesterday after the company reported that its earnings in the fourth quarter slipped to $1.30 a share from $1.32 a year earlier. The stock was off ⅜ at 50½ on a volume of 120,600 shares. Despite the lower per‐share net, total earnings were up slightly. General Electric and Utah International remained active following disclosure of their merger plans Monday night. General Electric was down 1⅛ at 45¾ on a volume of 129,800 shares. Utah International, on a turnover of 122,900 shares, lost ½ at 48¾. One of the widest movers on the downside was Northwestern Steel and Wire, which closed with a loss of 3⅞ at 29⅛. The company cut its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 60 cents. General Motors, which announced plans to raise production, added ¼ at 57½ on a volume of 88,100 shares."

State law enforcement officials said later they had uncovered no evidence to date of any criminality connection with the investigation. Edwin H. Stier, a deputy attorney general, said Mr. Zywot had “cooperated completely” and had been released without thought of being recalled. Mr. ZyWot was one several people who had been with Miss Quinlan when she lapsed into the coma. Jersey Curbs Medicaid Abortions Governor Byrne of New Jersey signed into law yesterday a bill prohibiting the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother. The new law will mean that indigent women in New Jersey who want to abort a pregnancy, but have no compelling medical reason to do so, must either pay their own fees; seek charity, or forgo the abortion. Three Found Murdered in Newark The bodies of three young men, apparently victims of an execution, were found yesterday afternoon in a sparsely furnished apartment in Newark. The police said the motive for the slayings was unclear. Each of the victims appeared to have been shot in the head, but autopsies were to determine the causes of death. They ware identified as William Sessoms, 26 years old, of 15 Girard Place, East Orange, Albert Sessoms, 25, of the same address, and Premera Jones, 25, who lived in the building where the slaying occurred. Beame Stands By Battery Center Site Although a private developer has proposed a citybacked $110 million convention center in midtown, Mayor Beame said that the downtown Battery Park City site now under study by the city “appears to offer the best and most realistic hope.” Donald J. Trump, president of the Trump Organization, a major developer, formally announced his plans for a $110 million center on a West Side site of largely unused rail freight yards between 33d and 37th Streets and bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues. Judge Joseph C. DiCarlo of the Bronx Family Court will not be reappointed by Mayor Beame when his term expires next Monday because he has been found “not qualified” by the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary a City Hall spokesman said. The spokesman said it was Mr. Beame's policy not to appoint anyone found unacceptable by the 25‐member committee, a panel of legal experts who make recommendations on mayoral appointments to Family Court. The committee routinely reviews a judge's performance before the expiration of his term, but does not comment publicly on its recommendations. Writ Signed on Closing Police Station Justice Wallace R.

Farewell To 1975,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/19/archives/farewell-to-1975.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 18—In a few days, 1975 will be gone, another drop of time, and most Americans seem to be saying, “good riddance.” It was mainly a year of tidying up after old blunders and extravagances; of high pries, unemployment and inflation; of sweeping away the stench of Vietnam and Watergate—all useful work, long delayed. “Years have hardier tasks than listening to a whisper, or a sigh,” Stephen Vincent Benet wrote in “The Golden Corpse,” but mainly 1975 whispered and sighed. Like many previous years, it knew what it didn't want, but not what it wanted, and it didn't produce a single memorable speech or exciting vision of the Coming Age. The year was foreshadowed on New Years Eve by the collapse of Mr. Justice William O. Douglas, who had served on the Supreme Court of the United States for 36 years, longer than any other member in the long history of the high bench. On New Year's Day, four former members of the Nixon. Administration —John Mitchell, H. R. Haldeman, John D. Enrlichman and Robert C. Mardian—wet convicted by a jury on all counts in the Watergate cover‐up ‐trial. It was a symbol of the past that was going but knew what was coming. The rest of the year was very much the same Nothing fundamental changed, but everything seemed in the process of changing. There was almost no movement in the relations between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, because nobody knew in their three capitals who would be in charge a year or so from now. 1975 was a reminder of the fragility of human life and power. It buried Francisco Franco of Spain, Chiang Kaishek of China, and Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, the last of the leaders of the thirties. In Portugal, 1975 saw the last of the old empires. In Bangladesh and Chad, it saw the murders of new leeders and foreshadowed the coming struggles of the new independent states. In India, it saw the daughter of Nehru, presiding over the largest democracy in the world,” seize dictatorial power. Nothing disastrous happened in 1975 to change the balance of power or sanity in the world, but everything seemed a little shaky. The economies of the free nations were so wracked by inflation and unemployment that many thoughtful men and women wondered in public whether democracy could withstand the pressure. Still, there were some modest gains in 1975. If it didn't make things much better it didn't make them much worse. It was a year of caretakers in world politics, concentrating on stopping bad things rather than on venturing new things, and it made some progress or at least negotiated some compromises. In the Middle East, there was a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces in the Sinai the Suez Canal was opened to world commerce for the first time in eight years, and the British people voted to stay in the European Common Market. In Helsinki, the United States, Canada, Europe and the Soviet Union met and signed a declaration of political and personal principles, which may mean nothing now, but are at least a benchmark for political judgment in the future. And at the end of the year the major industrial powers were meeting together, and talking with the oil‐producing powers, the underdeveloped nations, and even with the basket‐cases about prices, raw materials, money, and other problems. Depending on, how you read the calendar, it was the last year of the third quarter of the most violent celltury in the history of the human family, and Comparatively, the third quater was not all that bad—at least better, than the first quarter with World War I, or the second quarter with the Great Depression and World War II. Philosophically, the years are useful, for they make us pause and wonder where we are and where we're going Maybe the most important thing about 1976 in the United States is that so many people have been doing precisely that. Even if they haven't settled anything in these last twelve months, they have been analyzing everything—maybe subjecting life to more analysis than it can bear. Talk to any thoughtful person you know these days, young or old, about the family, the church, the schools, the press, or politics, and you find that they are troubled but also that they are searching. Say what you like about our troubles at the end of 1975, no nation in the world has dared to look at the conflicts of private and common life so severely. The issues of abortion and busing, the Constitutional conflicts between the privacy of the individual and the freedom of the press, the struggle between the Federal executive and the legislature over the conduct of foreign policy regarding Angola and Cyprus, the requirements and dangers of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. in a violent world —all these have been under the most serious debate and controversy in 1975. They have raised great doubts. They have eroded our optimism and even our confidence in our political system and in one another. But as Walter Cronkite says, “that's the way it is” at the end of 1975. It wasn't our best year but at least we struggled."

Byrne Signs a Medicaid Abortion Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/19/archives/byrne-signs-a-medicaid-abortion-curb-byrne-signs-a-bill-curbing-use.html,"TRENTON, Dec. 18 — Governor Byrne signed into law today a bill prohibiting the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother. The new law will mean that indigent women in New Jersey who want to abort a pregnancy, but have no compelling medical reason to de so, must either pay their own fees, seek charity from the doctor, or forgo the abortion. The Governor delayed signing the measure for seven months, because of its uncertain constitutionality. However, he said today that he was “committed in principle” to signing the legislation and would wait no longer for a test of constitutionality. A spokesman for the state chapter of the. American Civil Liberties Union said the organization would “go to court as soon as possible because of the obvious unconstitutionality of the new law.” Stephen Nagler, executive director of the organization, said, that “the only women affected by this are poor women who traditionally have been the victims of nonmedical abortionists. They are also the ones least able to beat the financial burden.” The Medicaid issue, which is one of the most controversial associated with the right of abortion, has been the subject of conflicting judicial opinions and is expected to reach the United States Supreme Court in January. On July 21, 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which has jurisdiction over New Jersey, struck down a Pennsylvania regulation prohibiting payments for Medicaid abortions. The, court reasoned that since the state had elected to pay for Medicaid pre‐ and postnatal care, including full‐term deliveries and therapeutic abortions, it “cannot decline to finance nontherapeutic abortions without violating the requirement of Title 19,” the Medicaid statutes. Therapeutic abortions re those performed to Save the life of the mother. Ten days later, in an opposite opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which includes New York, Connecticut and Puerto Rico, upheld a Connecticut welfare. regulation that had refuses to pay for abortions for the noon starting, that nothing in the Medicaid statutes prevented a state from withholding Medicaid payments for elective abortions. New Jersey Medicaid officials reported here today that in 1974 the state reimbursed clients for 5.500 abortions at a cost to the state of $1.7 million Judie Novak, head of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, said today. “Right to Life has long been concerned with the people's tax dollars being used to subsidize the destruction of unborn babies. We trust this is only the first of many laws which in part will restore faith in government.” In January 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that no state could interfere with the right of a woman to have on abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Governor's antiabortion position is consistent with that of his two predecessors, William T. Cahill, a Republican. and Richard J. Hughes, a Democrat. All three are Roman Catholics in a state where the majority of the voters and estimated to be Roman Catholics."

"2 Faiths End Abortion Dialogue, Affirming ‘Sacredness of Life’",https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/24/archives/2-faiths-end-abortion-dialogue-affirming-sacredness-of-life.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 (UPI) —Roman Catholic and Baptist theologians have concluded their first dialogue on the question of abortion without reaching a mutual position on the issue, but jointly affirmed “the sacredness of life.” “Baptists and Catholics can greatly help one another—and the Christian persons to whom we speak and minister—by the snaring of whatever wisdom and insight we have developed out of our study and experience,” the theologians said in a statement issued at the end of their meeting and now being circulated among the churches. Previous dialogues between the two faiths—the largest religious groupings in the United States—have centered on theological divisions rather than ethical issues such as abortion. In the United States, the Roman Catholic Church has been one, of the leading advocates of restrictive abortion laws, while many BaptistS have been, active in the movement for liberalized laws and “free choice.” The meeting was sponsored by the Catholic Bishops Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs and the Ecumenical Institute, a joint venture of Wake Forest University, a Baptist school, and Belmont Abbey College, a Catholic institution. “It was apparent in our dialogue that there were basic differences in the methodology by which we approach ethical decisions,” the statement said. It said that Roman Catholics had a background of “authoritative doctrine and moral law” in developing ethical decisions, and that the Baptist “comes with a freedom for individual decision, with an absence of authority structures or official positions.” “There are risks in both positions,” the theologians said. “While we do not attempt to take fixed positions to summarize our initial discussions,” the statement said, “we do Wish to close this dialogue with a strong affirmation of the sacredness of life, a recognition that God and God alone is the Lord of life.”"
1976 Surprise: Carter Is Running Well,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/26/archives/1976-surprise-carter-is-running-well.html,"ATLANTA, Dec. 25—The surprise of the 1976 Presidential, campaign, thus far, is Jimmy Carter. After more than 260 relentless days of campaigning in some 40 states and 250 cities, the 51‐year‐old former Georgia Governor who boasts about running a national election campaign from Atlanta is suddenly being taken very seriously by other Democratic candidates, by party leaders and by the nation's press and the broadcast networks. They have discovered that, by using a middle‐of‐the‐road pitch, a ready smile and indefatigable energy, Mr. Carter has put together an effective campaign organization, raised a considerable amount of money and, most important of all, built himself into a force to be reckoned with in the early primaries and caucuses that frequently make or break candidates. While the polls indicate that Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota is still the most popular Democrat, they also show that James Earl Carter Jr.—he prefers “Jimmy”—is a genuine contender, neck‐andneck with the rest of the field. Presidential Candidates Fifth in a series But success is proving to be a two‐edged sword for Mr. Carter, as is often the case early in Presidential campaigns. If he is to continue making progress, he must now withstand the close scrutiny that inevitably follows when the mantle of “genuine contender” is cast. If Mr. Carter is to succeed, he also must overcome one Democratic candidate in particular, Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama. American racial history being what it is, political life is difficult for Southern Presidential aspirants. A Southerner like Mr. Carter who takes on George Wallace on his own turf—the Florida primary in this instance—must run very well against the one‐time segregationist or face political oblivion. The Southerner who suddenly trounced Mr. Wallace conceivably could go to the front of the pack. As for Jimmy Carter's centrist political philosophy, with its moralistic, anti‐establishment, anti‐Washington overtones, it is now being subjected to scrutiny, particularly by the liberals who wield great influence within the Democratic Party. If they find him wanting on the issues (he opposes courtordered pupil busing and blanket amnesty for war resisters but favors registration of hand guns and decriminalization of marijuana), hard work and a quick smile may not be enough to see him through to the New York City convention next summer. When Mr. Carter's record as a reform Governor is examiner in detail, it almost certainly will cause him some problems In winning the governorship back in 1970, he courted the right wing, particularly the large constituency of Lester Maddox, the fiery segregationfist Governor who was then a candidate for lieutenant governor. At one point, he caller Mr. Maddox “the essence of the Democratic Party” and added that he was “proud” to be on the ticket with him. A few weeks later, at his inaugural, he declared, “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.” This declaration brought attention to him in the national press as a leader of the “new South.” Two years later, during the early phases of the 1972 Presidential campaign, he repeatedly warned the Democratic Party that it could not afford to ignore the constituency of Governor Wallace. He subsequently refused to join a movement to nominate Mr. Wallace, but he agreed to nominate Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, a man of considerable conservatism. And he worked openly and hard to head off Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, the liberal who was evenutally nominated. Also during his tenure as Governor; Mr. Carter used the word “scapegoat” at one point to describe William Calley, who was convicted of murder in the My Lai massacre in South Vietnam. He added, however, that he did not consider Mr. Calley typical of United States officers in the war, which he began opposing in 1971. After the Calley conviction, Mr. Carter proclaimed an “American fighting man's day,” saying the My Lai events had greatly disturbed” Americans. He went on to warn that some people might “use these events to further their own ambition, to cheapen and shame the reputation of American servicemen and to shake the faith of Americans in their country.” Mr. Carter insists there is nothing racist in his record, nothing opportunistic, nothing that marks him as a rightwinger. Some question whether he has had enough national and international experience to be President, but he insists he is qualified because he has traveled abroad and because as Governor he was particularly effective at tightening budgets and paring bureaucracy. As for running a campaign out of Atlanta, that is a calculated part of the Carter strategy. He wants to be divorced from Washington politics during a time of economic hardship and after Watergate and Vietnam. “The people of this country,” he says, “want a fresh face, not one associated with a long series of mistakes made at the White House and on Capitol Hill. The next President of the United States will be the man who can convince a, disillusioned America that he is not of that old school, that government can work and can be decent.” Besides being anti‐establishment and ideologically centrist, the Carter strategy calls for a strong effort in the crucial early primaries and caucuses, not just Florida but also Iowa and New Hampshire. Straw polls and political soundings in each state indicate that Mr. Carter is running ahead, or at least is even with the rest of the pack. He has already put in more than three weeks of campaigning in Florida. The Carter people do not yet contend that their man, with his crinkled pearly grin, blue eyes, Kennedy‐style blond hair and soft Dixie voice, is a household political name from coast to coast. They concede that he is still little more than “a former Georgia Governor” in many sections of the country. But they are confident that he has caught the attention of the party professionals and party workers in key states and, equally important, that he has caught the eyes and ears Of the news media. They report that his mounting momentum has begun to bring in substantial amounts of campaign money. Such was the Carter plan from the moment he announced his candidacy on Dec. 12, 1974. The Carter strategists, most of whom served as aides while Mr. Carter was Governor, consider the campaign to be right on schedule at this point. The question being asked about their man, they contend, is no longer “Jimmy who?” but “What if Jimmy . . . ?” On the common assumption that he will still be in the race after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire and Florida primaries, Mr. Carter has signed up for caucuses and primaries in every other state. “I intend to run everywhere I can and go to New York and win on the first ballot,” he said. “I am not interested in a brokered convention, I am not interested in the Vice‐Presidency.” Will it work? Certainly the new party rules, which guarantee candidates their proportionate share of delegates in primaries, will not hurt a loner who enters as many contests as possible. The old winner‐take‐all rules would have made the Carter candidacy much more difficult. But ultimate victory almost certainly will also require a number of trades and compromises, some dealing with what Mr. Carter called the “selfinterest” lobbies. There is a surprising lack of Carter activity in this area thus far. Except to come out in favor of common site picketing legislation, he has made no noticeable overtures to labor, and the fact that he was Governor of one of the few states that still have a right‐to‐work law could be an important draWback. He has made no real effort to exploit any groups hit hard by the recession. He has made no special overtures to blacks, though he has a number of things, going in his favor to offset the Wallace and Maddox associations. The Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. is one of his announced supporters, as is Representative Andrew Young, an Atlantan who is one of the most respected blacks on Capitol Hill. Rather than wheeling and dealing, the Carter campaign to this point has been marked primarily by hard work—the steady, deep, detailed, quietly effective kind that lays down the foundation of a campaign early in a manner reminiscent of the 1964 Goldwater campaign or the 1972 McGovern campaign—before they turned disastrous. Over the last year, Mr. Carter has hired 70 full‐time cam paign workers, has openec offices in 16 states and has sent organizers into 20 other states. He has raised—and mostly spent—almost $800,000 in campaign funds, but much of that probably will be replaced by Federal money under the new matching fund election law. Contributions have averaged about $35 each—the new law prohibits any gift larger than $1,000—with a third or so of them coming from Gebrgia and many others from small fundraising dinners or musical benefits. Recently, Morris Dees, an Alabama lawyer who is considered one of the best fund raisers in politics, joined the Carter staff. At the grass‐roots level, no other candidate can match Jimmy Carter's last 12 months, if the statistics from the Carter headquarters are correct. According to his staff's calculations, he has put in more hours than any other candidate (18 a day, five or six days a week), has traveled more miles (200,000 or so), has shaken more hands (upward of 100,000), has given more speeches (at least 700) and has signed up for more primaries and state conventions (all of them). In an era of electronic politics, his one‐on‐one style harkens back to the 1950's and Estes Kefauver. Sometimes it seems that he plans to win the Presidency simply by coralling every single voter on the hustings, though the fact is that he also plans to use a considerable amount of television advertising. To understand what makes Jimmy Carter run so hard, it helps to know something of his early years. He was born Oct. 1, 1924, at Plains, a south Georgia farm town with a population of about 650. His father, James Earl Sr., a farmer and local politician, was a strong believer in the work ethic and sent his son in to the streets of Plains at the age of 5 to sell small bags of boiled peanuts, the main crop in that area. His mother, Lillian, gave him his desire for public service. At the age of 68, she joined the Peace Corps. Although the Carter family is one of the better known ones in Plains, Jimmy Carter was the first member to make it through high school. He then won appointment to the Naval Academy in 1942 and by the early 1950's was embarked on a promising career in the brand new, elite nuclear submarine Force when he suddenly changed course and decided to return to Plains and take up peanut farming and politics. By the mid 1960's, he had become a well‐to‐do farmer and iusinessman, had a wife and our children and had won a seat in the Georgia State Senate after charging his opponent with vote fraud. A 1966 run for the governorship ended in defeat. But in 1970 he ran again in the successful campaign that some of his enemies and critics now say was racist because of his alignment with Mr. Maddox. By the time he left the Governor's office in 1974, he had slashed a number of state bureaucracies from 300 to fewer than two dozen and has tightened budgeting procedures severely—moves that have destroyed much of his political support. Whether or not the reorganizing and restructuring saved the state millions‐of dollars, as he now says, is almost impossible to tell because it was carried out at the time when the state's over‐all annual budget was expanding in response to population growth and inflation. After leaving the Governor's office he toured the country for a year, touting Democratic candidates for the Democratic National Committee, a political ploy that is paying him dividends now and is reminiscent of the way Richard Nixon spent his time when out of public office after the Eisenhower years. As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Carter has taken broad stands on a number of issues. He favors comprehensive Federal healt insurance, establishment of Government day‐care centers, direct distribution of revenue sharing funds to localities instead of through the state capitals, and reform of Federal tax laws to close loopholes that benefit the rich. He would offer public services jobs to welfare recipients unable to find any other work, would strengthen laws regulating lobbying, conflicts of interest and guaranteed public access to government meetings and records. He supports the Supreme Court ruling that leaves abortion decisions up to individuals, thinks the country should rely increasingly on coat and sunlight for its energy needs and says that the Federal bureau cracy and Federal budgeting procedures should be reformed in the same manner that he, reformed Georgia's agencies and budgeting procedures. In the area of foreign affairs, he favors less United States military presence abroad but more economic allowances. He wants, more disarmament, a smaller defense budget and denial of trade, including food sales, to countries that hit the United States with oil embar goes. He thinks the United States should continue trying to find a solution to the Middle East crisis, with emphasis on estabfishing a permanent horne Tot; Palestinians. He feels Searetary of State Henry A. Kissinger ought to be more accountable to Congress and the peoele about his negotiations with other governments. Like Most other Presidential candidates, Mr. Carter has shied away from issuing detailed positions on most issues, lest he box himself in. But he promises those details in time and, in preparation for drawing them up, he has studied the campaign platform of the losing Presidential candidates down through American history. As much as anything that qualifies him as the surprise candidate of the 1976 campaign."

According to his staff's calculations, he has put in more hours than any other candidate (18 a day, five or six days a week), has traveled more miles (200,000 or so), has shaken more hands (upward of 100,000), has given more speeches (at least 700) and has signed up for more primaries and state conventions (all of them). One‐on‐One Style In an era of electronic politics, his one‐on‐one style harkens back to the 1950's and Estes Kefauver. Sometimes it seems that he plans to win the Presidency simply by coralling every single voter on the hustings, though the fact is that he also plans to use a considerable amount of television advertising. To understand what makes Jimmy Carter run so hard, it helps to know something of his early years. He was born Oct. 1, 1924, at Plains, a south Georgia farm town with a population of about 650. His father; James Earl Sr., a farmer and local politician, was a strong believer in the work ethic and sent his son in to the streets of Plains at the age of 5 to sell small bags of boiled peanuts, the main crop in that area. His mother, Lillian, gave him, his desire for public service. At the age of 68, she joined the Peace Corps. Although the Carter family is one of the better known ones in Plains, Jimmy Carter was the first member to make it through high school. He then won appointment to the Naval Academy in 1942 and by the early 1950's was embarked on a promising career in the brand new, elite nuclear submarine force when he suddenly changed course and decided to return to Plains and take up peanut farming and politics. By the mid 1960's, he had become a well‐to‐do farmer and businessman, had a wife and four children and had won a seat in the Georgia State Senate after charging his opponent with vote fraud. A 1966 run for the governorship ended in defeat. But in 1970 he ran again in the successful campaign that some of his enemies and critics now say was racist because of his alignment with Mr. Maddox. By the time he left the Governor's office in 1974, he had slashed a number of state bureaucracies from 300 to fewer than two dozen and has tightened budgeting procedures severely—moves that have destroyed much of his political support. Whether or not the reorganizing and restructuring saved the state millions of dollars, as he now says, is almost impossible to tell because it was carried out at the time when the state's over‐all annual budget was expanding in response to population growth and inflation. After leaving the Governor'' office he toured the country for a year, touting Democratic candidates for the Democratic National Committee, a political ploy that is paying him dividends now and is reminiscent of the way Richard Nixon spent his time when out of public office after the Eisenhower years. Broad Stands Taken As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Carter has taken, broad stands on a number of issues. He favor comprehensive Federal healt insurance, establishment of Government day‐care centers, direct distribution of revenue sharing funds to localities instead of through the state capitals, and reform of Federal tax laws to close loopholes that benefit the rich. He would offer public services jobs to welfare recipients unable to find any other work, would strengthen laws regulating lobbying, conflicts of interest and guaranteed public access to government meetings and records. He supports the Supreme Court ruling that leaves abortion decisions up to individuals, thinks the country should rely increasingly on coat and sunlight for its energy need's and says that the Federal bureau cracy and Federal budgeting procedures should be reformed in the same manner that he reformed Georgia's agencies and budgeting procedures. In the area of foreign affairs, he favors less United States military presence abroad but more economic allowances. He wants, more disarmament, a smaller defense budget and denial of trade, including food sales, to countries that hit the United States with oil embargoes. He thinks the United States should continue trying to find a solution to the Middle East crisis, with emphasis on establishing a permanent home for Palestinians. He feels Searetary of State Henry A. Kissinger, ought to be more accountable to Congress and the people about his negotiations with other governments. Like most other Presidential candidites, Mr. Cakter has shied away from issuing detailed positions on most issues, lest he box himself in. But he promises those details in time and, in preparation for drawing them up, he has studied the campaign platforms of the losing Presidential candidates down through American history. As much as anything, that qualifies him as the surprise candidate of the 1976 campaign."
Unaborted Clinics . . .,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/27/archives/unaborted-clinics.html,"The fourteen family planning clinics operated by the municipal hospital system, which were to have closed next week as an austerity measure, have been given a one‐month reprieve. The delay will afford all health groups in this city a chance to explore possible outside financing for these invaluable clinics or alternate means of supplying their services. The family planning units yield a high return in community benefit. By making birth control services available to the poor with the same ease of access that has long existed for the well‐to‐do these clinics have enabled many thousands of mothers to make rational decisions on family size. One important by‐product has been to cut down the need for abortions to prevent the birth of unwanted children doomed to grow up in welfare households in an atmosphere of defeat and despair. The Health and Hospitals Corporation, faced with the need for drastic cuts in its billion‐dollar budget, decided to sacrifice these indispensable clinics along with other much‐used ambulatory care facilities for the needy. Their prospective elimination is all the more serious in view of plans by the Human Resources Administration for a cut of more than one‐third in funds for its own separate birth control clinics and the scheduled near‐abandonment by the school system of its family living and sex education program. Abandoning the patients who now make 110,000 visits a year to the hospital family planning clinics is designed to “save” $3 million in public funds, But the delusive nature of this saving is demonstrated in an estimate by Planned Parenthood of New York City that more than 3,000 of the deserted clinic patients will now turn to city hospitals for abortions at an annual cost to the community of upward of $4 million. In addition, the number of unwanted children, born into welfare families is likely to rise by as much as 4,000 a year, according to the group's calculations. This could entail a boost of $4 million in charges for maternity care at the municipal institutions, plus a growth of roughly $10 million a year in New York's already gigantic relief burden."
British Put Laws in Force To Bar Sex Discrimination,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/30/archives/british-put-laws-in-force-to-bar-sex-discrimation-2-new-british.html,"LONDON, Dec. 29—The British woman was relieved many of the traditional shackles of this male‐dominated society today and was given markedly more freedom to chart her own life. Two women's rights laws came into force today after years of quiet preparation—a distinct contrast with the violence and hunger strikes of the suffragists who won women the vote in 1918. One of the laws, the Equal Pay Act, promises wages similar to those of men for similar work. The other, the Sex Discrimination Act, outlaws many other forms of discrimination on the job and in other facets of life. Until today there was little requiring, employers to treat women on an equal footing with men. There was no blanket protection requiring that institutions in government, business and education provide the same services to women that they provide to men. The legislation is the first wide effort to follow decades of separate initiatives establishing women's rights in such areas as child custody, property ownership and entry to the professions and, more recently, in abortion and rape. The laws are unlikely to provoke the turmoil that they might have if they had been drawn up and enacted overnight. The Equal Pay Act was passed five years ago, allowing employers time to close pay gaps until it came into force. An Equal Opportunities Commission with a budget of $5 million and a staff of 400 opened for business in Manchester. Its job is to see that the acts are enforced by bringing actions in its own name and guiding women who carry complaints before the courts. Although the laws are breakthroughs for this highly traditional society, they lack some of the breadth and teeth of the American laws on which they were modeled. They also allow a certain amount of separate but theoretically equal rights for the sexes—separate swimming facilities, for example. They leave standing many older laws such as a legacy of the sweatshop era that prohibit: women from working at night without special waivers. The United States has had an equal pay act, requiring that men and women in the same establishment performing the same work receive equal pay since 1963, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin in hiring, promotion, firing and all other conditions of employment. A group of women celebrated the debut of the Jaws by invading El Vino, a popular Fleet Street gathering place for journalists and lawyers that excludes unescorted women. They demanded drinks at the bar; when management refused they vowed to bring a complaint in the civil courts. There was one obvious sign of progress—in classified newspaper advertisements, an area the Government has identified as a prime target, the Evening Standard had none of its usual block of solicitations for “Girl Friday” and “bar maid.” Today's ads included one for a “tea trolley assistant” and others for “clerical assistants.” There were ambivalent signs in another paper of progress in social attitudes, which the laws do not touch. ‘Girls, It's Your Turn Now’ “Girls, it's your turn now,” proclaimed The Daily Mirror, a flashy tabloid that rarely calls adult men boys. On the front page it offered a discreet male pinup, but inside there was Angela, described in the caption as “a nice piece of fluff,” adorned only in a skimpy stole. The prime movers of the legislation were the few but highly visible women in the Labor Party Government, in power in 1970 and now. They are the ideological foes of Etritain's best‐known woman politician, Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative leader. One is Dr. Shirley Summerskill, a Member of Parliament and Under Secretary of State in the Home Office. A physician who mastered the niale bastions of Oxford, medical school and party politics, she was the principal architect of the Sex Discrimination Act. Barbara Castle, Minister for Social Services, is widely credited with developing the Equal Pay Act. Considered the most outspoken feminist in the Government, she is a pillar of the Labor Party's left wing. The women's rights movement now, unlike the one that led to the vote, is centered on such women. This country has produced no Gloria Steinems or Betty Friedans, national leaders outside government who articulate the issues for many American women. It has been a low‐key movement as well, with few marches on Parliament; the consciousness‐raising groups that have proliferated in the United States have made little headway here. Nevertheless, there has been a purposeful campaign dominated by single issues. May Hobbs, a cleaning woman, took up the cause of the poorly paid chars who clean offices in the small hours of the morning, leading them in a pay strike against the Ministry of Defense several years ago. Priscilla Allen, a transplanted American, heads a “wages for housework campaign,” and Erin Pizzey is the defender‐protector of battered wives. Though women feel the acts could be more severe—they do not require, as in the United States, that employers meet quotas in hiring women—they have received them well. “I think they're very important acts,” said Eleanor Stephens, one of a women's cooperative that edits Spare Rib, a bitter, somewhat leftist lowbudget magazine that has become the best known media proponent of women's rights. “It's up to women to put teeth, into them.” Pamela Anderson, president of the Fawcett Society, an influential rights group born in the suffragist movement, said the laws would accelerate a process that has been developing since World War II. “I think I was the only mum at the private school my children attended who worked,” she said. “But when I go to fetch my grandchildren, I found that a third of the mothers worked.” Britain is a forest of institutional discrimination against women. A practice often condemned is the retailer's insistence that when a woman buys something on time, her husband guarantees the financing agreement. That is clearly prohibited by the discrimination act. It applies as well to many less‐publicized practices—the hours of public baths, for example. Many allow each sex three days' access, but Saturdays are usually for men. Working women, the Government believes, could force changes. The laws can benefit men as well as women. The “ladies' ” waiting rooms that British Railways provides could be subject to integration because none exist for men. There are many areas where the legislation, as important as it is, does not invite change. Nothing for a Princess Nothing authorizes a royal princess to inherit the throne if she has a younger brother who wants it. Nothing abolishes the reluctance of women to enter some pubs, particularly outside London, even if they do not exclude them, and nothing will melt the frosty stares they get if they do. It will take more than an act of Parliament to alter the working‐class custom that sees men spending evenings together in pubs and clubs while women stay home. Discrimination may be more subtle in other areas. Women complain that restaurants serve them smaller portions than men get. “You get the worst service,” one said, “and you are invariably sat next to the service door.” Women's rights leaders contend, too, that salespeople invariably wait on men customers first. Plumbers, electricians and appliance repairmen arrive promptly only when a husband telephones, they say. The media are a particular source of resentment. The Sun prints a large, bare‐breasted, pinup every day on its third page, a practice that has spread to The Mirror. In reference, Mrs. Thatcher is always the “blond bombshell” and Mrs. Castle is “Battling Barbara.” Laws ‘'that preserve discriminatory practices include one requiring that the husband in a working couple prepare and take responsibility for income taxes. If there's a rebate, the check is made out to him. Because he prepares the taxes, he Iknows his wife's earnings, but nothing requires him to tell her his. Benevolently intended legislation also causes problems. Civil servants once found that, statistically, the average man marries a woman five years younger than he. So that they could retire together, it was decided that retirement and pension benefits should begin for women at 60 and men at 65. The women, though, are paid less, to the particular annoyance of single women."

Shriver Stressing ‘Kennedy Connection’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/31/archives/shriver-stressing-kennedy-connection-shriver-stresses-his-kennedy.html,"Robert Sargent Shriver Jr. is going at full throttle to win the Democratic Presidential nomination, and his greatest drawing card in that quest is also one of his greatest handicaps. It is called the “Kennedy connection.” Mr. Shriver plays it like casino blackjack dealer. Even though he knows he will lose Presidential Candidates Tenth in a series some votes in the gamble, he keeps tossing out the Kennedy cards. Mr. Shriver, the product of a long line of prominent Maryland Democrats, is an earnest, highly intelligent and ambitious man who, if he had not mar ried Eunice, the most politically aggressive of Joseph P. Kennedy's five daughters, would probably have risen to prominence on his own. As it is, however, he sees himself—and presents himself —as the protector of the Kennedy legacy; the man who, in this election anyway, will carry the beacon of faith lighted by his brothers‐in‐law through the dark ruins of today's government and into the White House. He is trying to build the same coalition of ethnic groups and mainstream Democrats that won the Presidency for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Mr. Shriver has succeeded in enlisting the support of members of the Kennedy family, young and old, and his speeches are always laced with at least one,memorable quotation from President Kennedy. And, with one or two variations, Mr. Shriver's views are similar to those of his brotherin‐law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. While one hand is playing up the Kennedy connection, however, the other is trying to play it down. “Look at my record,” he often says. “Don't rely on what you think I am. Examine what I have done.” Mr. Shriver has a reputation of being an innovative leader. As the first director of the Peace Corps, he helped to build it into one of the most successful government agencies of the 1960's. As head of the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Johnson Administration, he spearheaded the nation's first organized drive against poverty. Later, he became the United States Ambassador to France, establishing a close relationship with President de Gaulle. Nevertheless, Mr. Shriver's image as a second‐class Kennedy haunts him. People have trouble taking him seriously. Some former associates of Mr. Shriver feel that his campaign has not been helped by the failure of Senator Kennedy, who has so far not come out in support of any candidate, to stand behind him. One associate said that Mr. Kennedy's silence was “very damaging, especially since Sarge seems to be trading on the family's reputation so heavily.” Another questioned whether Mr. Kennedy really believed his brother‐in‐law was a winner. “Perhaps he is waiting to see what happens in the early primaries,” the friend said. Massachusetts Test While national political observers are generally cautious about Mr. Shriver's chances, they believe that he could emerge as a real contender by placing first in the Massachusetts primary next March 2. They note that he is the only Roman Catholic in a field of 14 Republican and Democratic hopefuls, that his record is untouched by scandal, and that he could conceivably build a bridge between liberal and conservative constituencies. So far, however, Mr. Shriver seems to have made little progress in that direction. There is little evidence of a solid Shriver organization from state to state, and his name is not one of those frequently mentioned. Patrick Caddell, a Democratic pollster based in Cambridge, Mass., said he had seldom seen a candidate with so much potential that was so unlikely to be used. Mr. Shriver has said a thousand times that he is not a stalking horse for Senator Kennedy. (Mr. Shriver did not announce his candidacy until September because he waited for the green light from his brother‐in‐law, who personally assured him that he would not run for the Presidency.) And his supporters insist that he is not a pawn, a lightweight or a superficial enthusiast. But images die hard. An Unclear Image Unfortunately, it seems at times that the image is closer to reality than he is willing to admit. Mr. Shriver is a man whose honesty and integrity few would challenge. And he is an intellectual who spends a lot of time poring over cosmic questions. He seems to have difficulty, however, in choosing sides, in taking strong stands and in convincing voters that there are pressing reasons to elect him. Mr. Shriver's stands on some issues, although intricate and thoroughly researched, are less than clearly defined. He says he is for school integration but against court‐ordered busing to achieve racial balance, and he proposes alternative solutions, such as special “magnet” schools to attract students of both races, and more integration at the staff and faculty level. But he does not specify how he would apply these longrange solutions to the immediate and explosive problems of South Boston or Louisville, Ky. Mr. Shriver and his wife have been strong opponents of abortion; on the hustings, however, he seldom speaks out against it, but says he would uphold the Supreme Court ruling on abortion while encouraging such alternatives as “life support centers” for pregnant women. “He'd be much better off if he'd just get up there and say, ‘I think abortion is murder and you better know it!’ “ said one strategist who helped run Mr. Shriver's Vice‐Presidential campaign in 1972 after the Democratic Presidential nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, selected Mr. Shriver as his running mate. “Sarge hasn't run in a primary before and it shows,” he said. “It's like he's running for senior class president, where the most important thing is to be liked; he doesn't realize that people would respect him a lot more if he was willing to make enemies, if he could stand up there and tell them honestly what he believes.” It is this quality, however, that Mr. Shriver's supporters—who include such figures as Chesterfield Smith, former president of the American Bar Association, and Cyrus R. Vance, a former Under Secretary of Defense—most emphatically defend. Mr. Shriver's habit of conceiving multifaceted solutions and of refusing easy answers, they say, is part of a new kind of politics he is trying to put forward. “I'm not going to spout a lot of rhetoric or a hundred empty promises I know I can't keep,” Mr. Shriver says. “The American people have been given lies for the past 10 years. can only tell them what I'd like to see done, and whether have the power to do it in a large way is up to them. I'm asking them to elect the next President, not on what he says, but on his character.” When Mr. Shriver gets up before an audience, he seldom sets it on fire, but he almost always succeeds in impressing it with his good sense. He is wide‐eyed and always looks slightly incredulous. His elastic mouth falls open and his chin collapses in a rather British way when he gives forth with a humorous quip. In public, he is succinct, but in private he wanders about like a Socratic philosopher. sprinkling his discourses with references to everyone from Thomas Aquinas to Kurt Vonnegut. Sometimes, if one blinks one's eyes, it is not Sargent Shriver standing there, but slimmer Hubert Humphrey. He becomes ebullient, his arms carving the air, his neck craning, his voice occasionally rising to a slight squawk. Mr. Shriver's main theme as he campaigns around the country is the nation's cynicism and disillusionment with politics—in particular, Washington politics. “I see young people who have only known, violence and deception—the assassination of Kennedy and King, the war in Vietnam, Watergate, the dubious acquittal of Mitchell and Stans, and it goes on,” he said. “They are like wounded animals. They have been hurt. ask myself is Nixon and Agnew the best my generation can give to them? They deserve so much better, and we have betrayed them.” Religious Attitude Mr. Shriver's religion is reflected in his political philosophy. He is a devout Roman Catholic, and he despairs over the breakdown of the American family. “The divorce rate is soaring,” he says. “Young people are not willing to make commitments — marital or otherwise — to each other or to anything. No one is willing to lay down their life for anything. Something has gone out of the people of this nation.” Mr. Shriver's supporters emphasize the variety of his executive and diplomatic experience. “I've worked in and visited 50 countries,” Mr. Shriver says. “I've seen what it is like to live on a garbage dump, to see a 10-year-old girl bent over, shoveling potatoes into a bag held between her legs by a rod.” His law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Kampelman, has represented many American and Western European businesses in the Soviet Union, and Mr. Shriver has closed billion‐dollar deals there. He has also made a major lecture tour of the Soviet Union. He is a firm supporter of détente, as well as arms control, and regards himself as better versed in Soviet diplomacy than any other candidate. “When I go to Moscow, an imperial car meets me at the airport and drives me straight into the Kremlin,” he says. “I visit factories and see ‘socialist competition’ at work, and find that the biggest bank in the world is in Moscow. Our two countries are unbelievably close.” Mr. Shriver has visions of establishing a new international food distribution system designed to keep food and farm prices stable and to guarantee food for the hungry. z On domestic matters, Mr. Shriver envisions another New Frontier. He would combat unemployment by subsidizing jobs in private industry and by creating public sector jobs in such essential areas as police and fire protection. To control inflation, he would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. And he would implement wage and price controls if necessary. He says he would also create an agency for consumer advocacy, put the environment high on his priority list, and push for passage of a national health bill, although he insists that “such a bill has little chance of passing for many years.” Mr. Shriver supports the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and has promised to appoint women to “as many jobs in government as I can.” One of his first steps as President, he says, would be to institute a double‐pronged program to help the American victims of the Vietnam war. He says he would call for unconditional universal amnesty—'We can hardly punish those men of conscience for being right” —and for a comprehensive program to help those veterans who are “crippled, jobless, and hooked on drugs because of our policies.” Although Mr. Shriver is quick to note that he is not an elected official, he concedes that this is a financial drawback in running a campaign. “Other candidates who are Congressmen or governors can use their staffs, and have used them to help with the paper work,” said Richard Murphy, Mr. Shriver's campaign manager, who was a national coordinater of the 1960 Kennedy campaign. “We are on our own,” he said. Inherent Inequities Mr. Murphy says that, while he believes the campaign reform law was, in principle, salutory, it has some inherent inequities in its present form. “Candidates like Jackson and Wallace who have been really running for President for more than a year have big war chests —money which they collected before Jan. 1, and which they use.” He added: “Candidates who recently came in like Shriver are limited by the law—no campaign contributions above $1,000 from any one person and no more I than $50,000 from family members.” Despite this limitation, Mr. Murphy contends that the Shriver campaign, although hurting, is one of the few Democratic campaigns that is in the black. Having collected $350,000 so far, the campaign now has a balance of up to $20,000 each week. Although the Shriver people lost $17,000 on a massmailing campaign (the mailing cost 444,000, and they collected only $27,000, they say they will come out ahead because the Government will match the contributions. The Shriver campaign staff in Washington has nine fulltime paid staff members, five part‐time staff and about 25 volunteers. Mr. Shriver uses, economy‐class flights. Middle of the Road Mr. Shriver's general strategy is to stay in the middle (where he thinks most of the liberal Democratic voters are), between Senator Henry M. Jackson‐ of Washington, Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama on the right, and Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia and former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma on the left. On one hand, Mr. Shriver is trying to appeal to minorities (some of the stacks of campaign literature piled in his headquarters are in Spanish), and on the other hand he is seeking support from party regulars. With that in mind, he has been spending a good deal of time talking to small groups at Democratic clubs and state committee functions. This tactic has been criticized by a coordinator in Mr. Shriver's 1972 campaign who said: “Sarge doesn't realize that the state committees won't deliver anymore. They only want a winner that will carry them right into the big time. If he got up there and slammed something big on a crowd of six or seven thousand and it got on the 6 and 11 o'clock news, that would really be wooing the Democratic establishment.” Mr. Shriver plans to enter the early Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Jan. 19, Mississippi on Jan. 24 and Alaska on Feb. 10, and then on to the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 24 and the Massachusetts primary, a week later. His staff is partly old Kennedy people, such as Richard C. Drayner, former press secretary for Senator Kennedy, and Shriver associates from the Peace Corps, such as Pat Baldi, his deputy campaign manager. There are also a diverse group of people, such as Jean Diamond, owner of a pizza house near the Shriver estate in Maryland, who provided Mr. Shriver with pizza and lively conversation on “lonely summer nights when Eunice and the kids were gone to Hyan nisport.” There is a certain good‐humored disorganization in the staff headquarters. but also a fierce loyalty. “This is a Shriver organization not a Kennedy one,” said a staff member a bit indignantly. Nevertheless, the staff is eager to see the Kennedy family play a large part in the campaign in the coming weeks. Eunice Shriver participates in strategy meetings, helps mold policy, and campaigns tirelessly on her own. Ethel Kennedy recently presided over a fundraiser in Virginia. And, although Senator Kennedy remains silent, Mr. Murphy insists that “the support is there.” “Joan Kennedy is on our committee,” Mr. Murphy added, “and a number of Kennedy children, particularly Robert Kennedy's kids, have said they want very much to campaign for their uncle.” Tomorrow: Morris K.

Shriver Stressing ‘Kennedy Connection’,https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/31/archives/shriver-stressing-kennedy-connection.html,"Robert Sargent Shriver Jr. is going at full throttle to win the Democratic Presidential nomination, and his greatest drawing card in that quest is also one of his greatest handicaps. It is called the “Kennedy connection.” Mr. Shriver plays it like casino blackjack dealer. Even though he knows he will lose Presidential Candidates Tenth in a series some votes in the gamble, he keeps tossing out the Kennedy cards. After all, the odds are always with the house. Mr. Shriver, the product of a long line of prominent Maryland Democrats, is an earnest, highly intelligent and ambitious man who, if he had not married Eunice, the most politically aggressive of Joseph P. Kennedy's five daughters, would probably have risen o prominence on his own. As it is, however, he sees himself—and presents himself—as the protector of the Kennedy legacy; the man who, in this election anyway, will carry the beacon of faith lighted by his brothers‐in‐law through the dark ruins of today's government and into the White House. He is trying to build the same coalition of ethnic groups and mainstream Democrats that won the Presidency for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Mr. Shriver has succeeded in enlisting the support of members of the Kennedy family, young and old, and his speeches are always laced with at least one memorable quote by President Kennedy. And, with one or two variations, Mr. Shriver's views are similar to those of his brother‐in‐law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. While one hand is playing up the Kennedy connection, however, the other is trying to play it down. “Look at my record,” he often says. ‘'Don't rely on what you think I am. Examine what I have done.” Mr. Shriver has a reputation of being an innovative leader. As the first director of the Peace Corps, he helped to build it into one of the most successful government agencies of the 1960's. As head of the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Johnson Administration, he spearheaded the nation's first organized drive against poverty. Later, he became the United States Ambassador to France, establishing a close relationship with President de Gaulle. Nevertheless, Mr. Shriver's image as a second‐class Kennedy haunts him. People have trouble taking him seriously. Some former associates of Mr. Shriver feel that his campaign has not been helped by the failure of Senator Kennedy, who has so far not come out in support of any candidate, to stand behind him. One associate said that Mr. Kennedy's silence was “very damaging, especially since Sarge seems to be trading on the family's reputation so heavily.” Another questioned whether Mr. Kennedy really believed his brother‐in‐law was a winner. “Perhaps he is waiting to see what happens in the early primaries,” the friend said. Massachusetts Test While national political observers are generally cautious about Mr. Shriver's chances, they believe that he could emerge as a real contender by placing first in the Massachusetts primary next March 2. They note that he is the only Roman Catholic in a field of 14 Republican and Democratic hopefuls, that his record is untouched by scandal, and that he could conceivably build a bridge between liberal and conservative constituencies. So far, however, Mr. Shriver seems to have made little progress in that direction. There is little evidence of a solid Shriver organization from state to state, and his name is not one of those frequently mentioned. Patrick Caddell, a Democratic pollster based in Cambridge, Mass., said he had seldom seen a candidate with so much potential that was so unlikely to be used. Mr. Shriver has said a thousand times that he is not a stalking horse for Senator Kennedy. (Mr. Shriver did not announce his candidacy until September because he waited for the green light from his brother‐in‐law, who personally assured him that he would not run for the Presidency.) And his supporters insist that he is not a pawn, a lightweight or a superficial enthusiast. But images die hard. An Unclear Image Unfortunately, it seems at times that the image is closer to reality than he is willing to admit. Mr. Shriver is a man whose honesty and integrity few would challenge. And he is an intellectual who spends a lot of time poring over cosmic questions. He seems to have difficulty, however, in choosing sides, in taking strong stands and in convincing voters that there are pressing reasons to elect him. Mr. Shriver's stands on some issues, although intricate and thoroughly researched, are less than clearly defined. He says he is for school integration but against court‐ordered busing to achieve racial balance, and he proposes alternative solutions, such as special “magnet” schools to attract students of both races, and more integration at the staff and faculty level. But he does not specify how he would apply these longrange solutions to the immediate and explosive problems of South Boston or Louisville, Ky. Mr. Shriver and his wife have been strong opponents of abortion; on the hustings, however, he seldom speaks out against it, but says he would uphold the Supreme Court ruling on abortion while encouraging such alternatives as “life support centers” for pregnant women. “He'd be much better off if he'd just get up there and say, ‘I think abortion is murder and you better know it!’ ” said one strategist who helped run Mr. Shriver's Vice‐Presidential campaign in 1972 after the Democratic Presidential nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, selected Mr. Shriver as his running mate. “Sarge hasn't run in a primary before and it shows,” he said. “It's like he's running for senior class president, where the most important thing is to be liked; he doesn't realize that people would respect him a lot more if he was willing to make enemies, if he could stand up there and tell them honestly what he believes.” It is this quality, however, that Mr. Shriver's supporters—who include such figures as Chesterfield Smith, former president of the American Bar Association, and Cyrus R. Vance, a former Under Secretary of Defense—most emphatically defend. Mr. Shriver's habit of conceiving multifaceted solutions and of refusing easy answers, they say, is part of a new kind of politics he is trying to put forward. “I'm not going to spout a lot of rhetoric or a hundred empty promises I know I can't keep,” Mr. Shriver says. “The American people have been given lies for the past 10 years. can only tell them what I'd like to see done, and whether have the power to do it in a large way is up to them. I'm asking them to elect the next President, not on what he says, but on his character.” When Mr. Shriver gets up before an audience, he seldom sets it on fire, but he almost always succeeds in impressing it with his good sense. He is wide‐eyed and always looks slightly incredulous. His elastic mouth falls open and his chin collapses in a rather British way when he gives forth with a humorous quip. In public, he is succinct, but in private he wanders about like a Socratic philosopher. sprinkling his discourses with references to everyone from Thomas Aquinas to Kurt Vonnegut. Sometimes, if one blinks one's eyes, it is not Sargent Shriver standing there, but slimmer Hubert Humphrey. He becomes ebullient, his arms carving the air, his neck craning, his voice occasionally rising to a slight squawk. Mr. Shriver's main theme as he campaigns around the country is the nation's cynicism and disillusionment with politics—in particular, Washington politics. “I see young people who have only known, violence and deception—the assassination of Kennedy and King, the war in Vietnam, Watergate, the dubious acquittal of Mitchell and Stans, and it goes on,” he said. “They are like wounded animals. They have been hurt. ask myself is Nixon and Agnew the best my generation can give to them? They deserve so much better, and we have betrayed them.” Religious Attitude Mr. Shriver's religion is reflected in his political philosophy. He is a devout Roman Catholic, and he despairs over the breakdown of the American family. “The divorce rate is soaring,” he says. “Young people are not willing to make commitments — marital or otherwise — to each other or to anything. No one is willing to lay down their life for anything. Something has gone out of the people of this nation.” Mr. Shriver's supporters emphasize the variety of his executive and diplomatic experience. “I've worked in and visited 50 countries,” Mr. Shriver says. “I've seen what it is like to live on a garbage dump, to see a 10‐year‐old girl bent over, shoveling potatoes into a bag held between her legs by a rod.” His law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Kampelman, has represented many American and Western European businesses in the Soviet Union, and Mr. Shriver has closed billion‐dollar deals there. He has also made a major lecture tour of the Soviet Union. He is a firm supporter of détente, as well as arms control, and regards himself as better versed in Soviet diplomacy than any other candidate. “When I go to Moscow, an imperial car meets me at the airport and drives me straight into the Kremlin,” he says. “I visit factories and see ‘socialist competition’ at work, and find that the biggest bank in the world is in Moscow. Our two countries are unbelievably close.” Mr. Shriver has visions of establishing a new international food distribution system designed to keep food and farm prices stable and to guarantee food for the hungry. z On domestic matters, Mr. Shriver envisions another New Frontier. He would combat unemployment by subsidizing jobs in private industry and by creating public sector jobs in such essential areas as police and fire protection. To control inflation, he would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. And he would implement wage and price controls if necessary. He says he would also create an agency for consumer advocacy, put the environment high on his priority list, and push for passage of a national health bill, although he insists that “such a bill has little chance of passing for many years.” Mr. Shriver supports the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and has promised to appoint women to “as many jobs in government as I can.” One of his first steps as President, he says, would be to institute a double‐pronged program to help the American victims of the Vietnam war. He says he would call for unconditional universal amnesty—'We can hardly punish those men of conscience for being right” —and for a comprehensive program to help those veterans who are “crippled, jobless, and hooked on drugs because of Although Mr. Shriver is quick to note that he is not an elected official, he concedes that this is a financial drawback in running a campaign. “Other candidates who are Congressmen or governors can use their staffs, and have used them to help with the paper work,” said Richard Murphy, Mr. Shriver's campaign manager, who was a national coordinater of the 1960 Kennedy campaign. “We are on our own,” he said. Inherent Inequities Mr. Murphy says that, while he believes the campaign reform law was, in principle, salutory, it has some inherent inequities in its present form. “Candidates like Jackson and Wallace who have been really running for President for more than a year have big war chests —money which they collected before Jan. 1, and which they use.” He added: “Candidates who recently came in like Shriver are limited by the law—no campaign contributions above $1,000 from any one person and no more than $50,000 from family members.” Despite this limitation, Mr. Murphy contends that the Shriver campaign, although hurting, is one of the few Democratic campaigns that is in the black. Having collected $350,000 so far, the campaign now has a balance of up to $20,000 each week. Although the Shriver people lost $17,000 on a massmailing campaign (the mailing cost 444,000, and they collected only $27,000, they say they will come out ahead because the Government will match the contributions. The Shriver campaign staff in Washington has nine fulltime paid staff members, five part‐time staff and about 25 volunteers. Mr. Shriver uses, economy‐class flights. Middle of the Road Mr. Shriver's general strategy is to stay in the middle (where he thinks most of the liberal Democratic voters are), between Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas land Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama on the right, and Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, former Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia and former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma on the left. On one hand, Mr. Shriver is trying to appeal to minorities (some of the stacks of campaign literature piled in his headquarters are in Spanish), and on the other hand he is seeking support from party regulars. With that in mind, he has been spending a good deal of time talking to small groups at Democratic clubs and state committee functions.

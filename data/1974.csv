Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/04/archives/a-comedy-of-terrors-books-of-the-times-the-death-accommodator.html,"It was a sensible precaution to print the words “a suspense novel” on the cover of “The Ambassador and the Spy” because the book is so well written that many readers might never have known. Though guns are fired and one of the two principal characters is a spy, Mr. Brome's book could. if he chose, have come naked into the world as a novel, without the qualifying adjective. In fact. I wonder why all novels should not have this encouraging legend on their covers to remind readers that suspense is as much the business of art as it is of entertainment. Have you read the suspense novel “Crime and Punishment” by Fyodor Dostoyevsky? “The Good Soldier” by Ford Madox Ford? “Moby Dick” by Herman Melville? “The Ambassador and the Spy” opens with a man named Robinsohn hammering on the gates of a British Embassy, demanding sanctuary. Only a few minutes behind him are other men, determined to shoot him down. He does not know though that they are the lesser threat, that in the embassy he can save his skin only at the cost of losing his soul. The inviolability of this sanctuary—which was once the business of the church—applies only in a very special sense. Once you are inside, you are protected against foreign government—but not against your own. You will not be tortured, but you may be tickled to death. In making an ambassador host to a spy, Mr. Brome is amusing himself and us with an ironic juxtaposition. The ambassador is a creature of codes—honor, dignity, integrity and so on—while the spy is essentially a decoder, one who translates the euphemisms of diplomacy into the profanities of force, Politics has made them strange bedfellows, and now neither can sleep soundly. The Death Aceommodator The embassy is in “Veralia,” a small country under the influence of the Soviet Union. The British and the Veralians have been negotiating an important “chromium” deal—which is no more obscure than anything else in today's ceaseless negotiations —but Robinsohn's arrival has upset the process in its penultimate insincerity, only one dissimulation away from success. Hand him over, the Veralians warn, or the deal is off. The ambassador can't do that, and so he tries to find out what it is that makes Robinsohn so valuable to them. When asked about his allegiances, the spy answers, “I work for the side that tolerates me.” His purpose in this life is, he says, “to accommodate death.” His identity, or character, he dismisses as a mere “cover,” And all the while, as he speaks to the ambassador, “his expressionless face managed to convey a—was it a vacancy?—as if he were in another place listening simultaneously to a quite different and much more profound conversation.” The ambassador is troubled by the erosion of values, “the infinite perspective of speciousness,” which the spy represents, while Robinsohn is unnerved by the erosion of his nihilistic efficiency in the conventional chaos of the embassy. Life here is being undermined not by the. tensions of residing in a hostile country, but by another sort of strain altogether: by sex. The first secretary's wife is having an affair with a Veralian intelligence agent disguised as a lawyer. The ambassador's secretary—whose clothes are “almost transvestite in their determination to impose femininity on her flat chest and square shoulders""—is having an affair with another Veraalian intelligence agent disguised as a journalist. The military attache is drinking himself to death trying to repress his homosexuality. Fixation, Frustration, Neurosis The ambassador's wife, who is cheated of her conjugal rights by the pressures of her husband's career, falls to teasing the spy, who has a mother fixation. The ambassador himself is frustrated by his teenage daughter, who—in spite of her feminist and anticapitalist convictions—wants him to finance an abortion. If I read him rightly, Mr. Brome is insinuating that democracy has lost its bearings in this particular area of behavior. The figute of the ambassador dramatizes the death of one type, and Robinsohn the birth of another. The diplomat's life is little more than a neurosis expressed in a compulsive ritualism; the spy's symptomatology is to submerge himself in an equally compulsive efficiency. Yet each of these men is, in his own way, a hero. And halfway between them, like Buridan's logical jackass who starved between equidistant appetites, lies humanity. Just a diffident footnote. With a less accomplished author, it would be precious to point this out, but I can't bear to see someone of Mr. Brome's quality misquoting as “sent abroad to lie” Sir Henry Wotton's delightful pun: “An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the commonwealth.” Since I'm sure he appreciates the difference, it can only have been a slip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/06/archives/ideas-trends-correction-black-colleges-bleak-prospects-just-how.html,"Abortions, long confined to the backrooms and illegality, are now in the mainStr.eam of modern medical care. A New York Times survey shows that thousands of women are going to clinics and hospitals all over the country to have the operation performed. The change has come about as a result of the Supreme Court ruling a year ago that abortion in the early months of pregnancy is a matter not for the law but for tbe woman to decide. The ruling has apparently put most illegal abortionists out of business, The Supreme Court ruled that all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy are unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that abortions after the first three months are also legal but are subject to limited state regulations. The decision, in effect, overturned laws in all but four states—Alaska, HaWaii, New York and Washington, which already had liberalized laws. The results have been dramatic. For example, in Atlanta, which had been subject to Georgia's strict antiabortion law, there now are seven abortion clinics, some performing 100 operations a week. Detroit, which serves as an abortion center for much of the Middle West, has 22 abortion clinics and referral agencies. In some states, however, the situation has not yet changed. Arkansas, for instance, enforces a state law—which to date has not been challenged in court—specifying that abortions may be performed only if the pregnancy “threatens the life or health” of a woman. Authorities say that, from a medical standpoint, nothing really new has been learned from the experiences of the past year. No new conclusions have been, reached as to the “safe” time limit for an abortion. The medical profession advises that the best time for an abortion is in the eighth to tenth week of pregnancy. Doctors are more inclined to advise abortions and to perform the operations. As one expert in the field put it, “the whole process is becoming less traumatic.” In New York City, where abortion has been legal for three years, a recent report showed a decrease in infant and maternal deaths and illegitimacy. For instance, last year there were four deaths associated with legalized abortions (or 2 per 100,000 abortions), compared with eight the year before (3.5 per 100,000 abortions) and eight in 1971 (4.6 per 100,000). Known deaths associated with abortions under illegal auspices were five last year and seven each the two previous years. The biggest discernible change, authorities say, is in attitude. “Women feel that an abortion is their right,” one counselor said. “We don't have to assuage their guilt. Women just want the facts—where they can go for the best and least expensive abortion.” Just How Dirty Are the Oceans? Can ocean pollution—even at levels considered safe for drinking water—seribusty harm the marine life on which man depends heavily for food and oxygen? What will be the condition of the oceans in the year 2000 if pollutants are added centinually at the present rate? In an attempt to find the answers, seven oceanographic institutions in the United States, Canada and Britain have joined in a $6‐million assessment of the long‐term effects of ocean pollution. The study will go on for six years. In varying degrees, all water contains pollutants such as dissolved metal compounds. Each pollutant has a content level Which is considered safe for humans. For drinking water, for example, the level so low that people are normally unaware of any foreign content. ‘,Some scientists speculate that ocean pollution, even at extremely low levels. can, over a long period, cause harm to the microscopic marine plants and animals known collectively as plankton. They sear. that destruction of the drifting plant. life cOuld eliminate a major means for replenishing the oxygen of the atmosphere. Even partial elimination of such plants would ,undermine the food chain that supports the forms of marine life on which much of‐mankind is dependent. In the C.E.P.E.X. project, large siloshaped plastic bags of sea water will be suspended in the seas off British Columbia and Scotland. They will be stocked with marine plants and animals. Then, pollutants such as metals, pesticides and petroleum products will be introduced. Correction In the introduction to a recorded disctission of the American Psychiatric Assoelation's recent decision concerning homosexuality, which appeared in this section Dec. 23, that ruling was erroneously described. In addition to deciding that homosexuality per se was no longer to be Considered a psychiatric disorder, the A.P.A. said homosexuality should be de fined as a ‘sexual orientation disturbance” only in those persons seriously troubled ...by their homosexuality. Black Colleges: Bleak Prospects Many of the nation's 100 black colleges, faced with increasing financial difficulties and decreasing enrollments, are moving closer toward extinction, and so is the already limited opportunity of poor Southern blacks seeking higher education. The black colleges were established in an era when black youths, many from the rural South, had no chance of attending white schools. Even now, despite integration, more than a third of the country's approximately 470,000 black undergraduates are in the black colleges. In general, they are not getting sufficient funds, from either private or public sources, to meet growing operating expenses, much less improve their programs, a New York Times study has shown. The amount of available Federal aid has increased in recent years, but its impact has been minimal because many of the schools have been unable to meet a matching‐fund formula. State aid, controlled by white‐dominated legislatures, and foundation assistance have fallen short of needs. And few of the schools have large endowments or rich alumni to help. In addition, many black students are now going to the large white colleges on scholarships, an exodus that means a loss of both tuition money and state aid based on enrollment. As a result of all these factors, many of the weaker black colleges are in danger of being forced to close or be merged with white universities. Many educators think merger would be a logical and even pogitive development. Others argue that would shut out thousands of blacks who cannot afford, or are not prepared academically, to attend other colleges. And there are many black students who are in black colleges because they prefer them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Including a pink Male Chauvinist Pig pillow,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/06/archives/the-new-womans-survival-catalog-a-womanmade-book-edited-by-kirsten.html,"A Woman‐MadeBook. Edited by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie. Illustrated. 223 pp. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan/ Berkley Publishing Corp. Paper, $5. Glossy red, supersized, cast in the format of “The Whole Earth Catalog,” “The New Woman's Survival Catalog” is a sprawling smorgasbord of sentiment and services heady enough to satisfy even the most misanthropic women among us. Nonetheless, although “this book catalogues and documents activities which . . . are aimed explicitly at the development of an alternative woman's culture,” one can find beneath its barrage of self‐congratulatory, inflated and italicized Movement rhetoric enough solid and vital information—or enough addresses and avenues to pursue for further assistance — to warrant its purchase by (and I quote the preface again) “a wide spectrum of American women” weathering another winter of discontent, including “those who would most . . . indignantly deny affinity with feminism.” If the catalogue bails you out on only one occasion, it will still have been worth the price, but there is a mind‐set on many of its pages that seems counterproductive — an attitude of self‐righteous indignation. The less desirable side‐effects of an overindulgence in paranoia can be seen scattered throughout the catalogue, cheek by jowl with its more coherent entries and its more practical excerpts and directories. Take, for example, its selection of products and posters for sale that, presumably, celebrate the new vision: four jewelry enterprises run by women, which, to judge by the accompanying illustrations, limit their designs almost exclusively to variations on the Venus symbol (enabling the wearer to emphasize, I gather, the notion that biology is destiny, is identity—a notion some of us aging optimists are still hoping to dislodge); a pink Male Chauvinist Pig pillow, with personal monogram (for that special Pig?), which might more appropriately be found in Cosmo's Shopping Guide next to the I‐LoveYou‐Kiss‐Me cushions and between the satin sheets; a stained‐glass lamp‐shade company, the one outfit included not for “political” but for esthetic reasons (the same reasoning should have prodded the editors to include a. state‐by‐state directory highlighting woman‐made or designed services, so that we might patronize our own); a feminist tailor who says she makes non‐sexist clothes (“elegant or sensual to taste”); an apron and a poster which proclaim “— Housework,” an approach not . only inimical to the needs of the many professional household employees who seek more dignified working conditions (rather than further downgrading of their jobs; this observation applies to the “— Office‐work” poster as well), but an approach which also reinforces the idea that housework is somehow an avoidable evil (demeaning work or “woman's work”) rather than something which both men and women, indeed boys and girls, ought to fec: obliged to do for themselves or to share; two films demonstrating how women masturbate; a self‐help gynecological slide show; and—my favorite—a poster entitled “The Discovery of the Clitoris” for those sisters who apparently need a graphic reminder. I mention these things because they seem redolent of the superfluity and snobbery that we correctly resent in society as presently constituted. In the introduction to the section on feminist bookstores, the editors say that you will not find “at these stores any of that putdown—from would‐be‐Thomas‐Wolfe clerks who couldn't even make it into the copy‐editing department of a publishing house.” Hear, hear! Are the editors of the catalogue unaware That (a) copy‐editing is done largely by women, that (b) it requires considerable skill and concentration, that (c) it is undervalued and underpaid precisely because of this kind of erroneous social spective (competitive rather than cooperative) which views certain necessary labors as inherently inferior to others, and—as a corollary—that (d) the put‐down from a “would‐beThomas‐Wolfe clerk” should be dismissed wholly on the grounds of its arrogance, and not because it emanates from someone who “couldn't even make it” into the higher ranks of the literati. The point is, at the risk of beating it to death, that Women's Liberation ought to earn for its adherents more than a license to be as derisive and insensitive as our oppressors have been —otherwise none of us will be the wiser for it. But that is all the quibbling wish to do, and perhaps future editions of the catalogue will weed out these no doubt unintended insults and expand some of the areas—such as pregnancy and child‐rearing—that could benefit from more material. There is a fairly exhaustive list of feminist publications, together with over a dozen lesbian journals representing every shade of purple from The Lavender Woman to Cries from Cassandra, the latter launched “as a protest against the ‘wishy‐washy’ politics” of the former. There is an excellent section on women's health collectives and clinics offering birth control counseling and abortion referral services; and a chapter on rape crisis centers and self‐defense. Although there's virtually nothing on marriage, there is plenty of advice on how to get out of one; and if you are interested in starting day‐care center, obtaining vocational counseling, pursuing feminist studies, getting non‐sexist children's books, locating a psychoanalyst sensitive to the grievances of women (did you know that “therapist” breaks down into “the/rapist”?), you will find ample information in these pages. You will also find some fascinating and curiously flexible statistics. In debunking the myth that most women work to earn “pin money,” we are told on page 167 that in 1968 48 per cent of all women workers were either the sole support of themselves or their families, or had husbands who earn less than $7,000 per year; adjacent to this, on the same page, the figure climbs by 1972 to include nearly two‐thirds of the female workforce; and by the time one turns to page 186 this number has mushroomed by more than 50 per cent over the original estimate to cover three out of every four working women in the United States in 1973. If these discrepancies reflect a trend and not merely the problem of which labor newsletter one reads, they tell us about a startling change in American life in the last five years. Finally, every catalogue worth its salt should present to the sluggish imagination at least a suggestion of possibilities not previously entertained, of horizons suddenly foreshortened to within the distance of a postage stamp. “The New Woman's Survival Catalog,” while not a match in this regard for Sears's semiannual bonanzas or some of the more elaborate do‐it‐yourselfs, did introduce me to a tantalizing resource that threatens to radically rearrange my entire fantasy life. Featured in a two‐page spread is a magazine, Country Women, whose function is to get the farmer's wife out of the kitchen fast (or away from her granola station hard by the communal stove) by showing her how to load hogs, castrate goats, deliver calves, drive a bulldozer, buy acreage, live off the ocean—replete with stunning graphics and a “contact” page “for all those women in cities and suburbs who have ever harbored an urge to live on the land.” For 60 cents an issue, who could ask for anything more?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, There Are People ‘Out There’ Who Believe",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/06/archives/yes-there-are-people-out-there-who-believe-a-new-tv-series-finds-a.html,"“RLLIGIOUS AMERICA” is not about religion in America, and that's why its content is so engrossiug. The 13‐week PBS series, which starts tonight at 8:30 on WNET/13, deals with religious Americans—people who have a spiritual center their ‘,ives. The discovery of that center, and the surprising ways it takes shape, results in a stimulating look into piety in the 20th century. Filmmaker Philip Garvin made a good choice when he decided to turn his cameras on people rather than on “religion” or “the church.” To be perfectly frank, speaking as one who has always been professionally involved with “religion,” the topic is not always very interesting. Nor it, in these days, always hopeful. Religion in America can mean the dying congregations in our central cities or rural areas, where a handful turn out on Sunday trying to recapture a past era. Or it can mean a faddish fanaticism for yoga or transcendental meditation or natural foods. To some it means worship the East Room of the White House (a practice now restored after a long hiatus), or Billy Graham sidestepping the here and now for the by and by. Religion in America can mean the pomp of a pontifical high mass or the business empire of the Mormons. Frequently, it means infighting within denominations and among various church bodies over abortion, the Middle East, or aid to parochial schools. It's more, of course, since religious faith in America today also includes Philip and Daniel Berrigan, William Sloane Coffin, Father Theodore Hesburgh, Congressmanpriest Robert Drinan, or the humanitarian efforts of the Salvation Army or the Catholic Workers. Gripping films can and should be made about these topics. But Philip Garvin chose a simpler and perhaps more profound way of looking at religion in the United States. His “Religious America” is a hopeful series, full of variety, encouragement and fascination. The films are intensely personal documents for Mr. Garvin. The idea for the series grew out of his own spiritual odyssey, which has included experiences with Hasidic Jews, Pentecostal Christians, and Buddhist monks Southeast Asia. But he does not emphasize the bizarre offbeat. Mr. Garvin looked for sincerity and diversity the spiritual lives of many “common” Americans. “This country has religious freedom as one of its reasons for existence,” he said in a recent interview. “Therefore it gratifying to find a tremendous variety of religious expression and involvement. It's as though at least one of our reasons for coming into existence as a nation has been fulfilled.” The series proves that religious expression in the United States cannot be pigeonholed. Although we have long recognized denominational differences, rarely have we seen such a graphic portrayal of spiritual variety. “Meeting in the Air,” which leads off the series tonight, shows the frendtic‐mystical service at a Pentecostal congregation. The Riverside, Calif., church is filled with emotion‐packed singing and dancing, but the film also lets some of the worshipers talk about their faith. The explanations may sound exotic to those who have never experienced Pentecostalism. However, Judy, the church organist, the Rev. Yarborough, and an elderly worshiper speak simply and convincingly of what their faith means. In a later show, “Crow River Christmas,” the quiet piety of a rural Minnesota Lutheran congregation provides another kind of intensity—less activity, but just as much spirit. With phrases unembellished by liturgical verbiage, a .farmer prays for Christmas blessings. The congregation gathers in the small frame church on the prairie for a Christmas Eve service, and later we see the pastor leading hymns and prayers at a parishioner's dinner. table. He is surrounded by faces out of a Norman Rockwell painting. A Christian commune in Loleta, Calif., brings together more than 100 young people who cheerfully run doughnut shop, make belts and pray practically all the time. This episode, called “Lighthouse in Loleta,” centers on Sarah, a former drug pusher who hated the commune at first but had nowhere else to live. The film lets the radiant faith she found speak for itself. During the filming, two members of the commune, David and Nancy, fell in love and announced their engagement at community prayers. A wedding among the Hasidic Jews is a focal point in “Lubavitch.” In this episode the viewer is taken into the everyday lives of the Hasidim in Brooklyn. The men of the orthodox community close their shops for afternoon prayers and regularly study the scriptures through a passionate and often argumentative method that is one of the cinematic high points of the series. “Lubavitch” also shows the community packed (Continued on Page 15) Into a house for a bris, the circumcision rite celebrating the birth of boy. “Religious America” cannot be faulted for a lack of variety. Other programs deal with the tension between a young brother and an older Trappist monk; the community service projects of a Baptist congregation in Gary, Ind.; an “Ashram” which bases its piety on oriental mysticism, and a Navy pilot who developed what he calls a “spiritual bond” with his wife during six years of imprisonment in North Vietnam. Philip Garvin scrupulously (one almost has to say religiously) avoids adding any comments about the scenes he lifted. “I can't add anything to someone's religious experience,” Mr. Garvin said. “Narration would simply get in the waY of the viewer.” That approach, while giving strength to, the premise of the series, also represents a weakness in the total effect of “Religious America.” One wants to know more about why the people in the series feel so intensely about their spiritual life, and to see more of the environment which colors their various religious practices. One's history, education, and even geography contribute to the development of faith or non‐faith. It would be helpful to know more about these matters. Are the experiences shown in “Religious America” fair portrayals of their subjects? There will be mixed responses to that question when the series is aired. Urban Lutherans will look at the congregation in “Crow River Christmas” and say, “That's not like our church.” Reform and Conservative Jews practice their faith differently from the Hasidim in Brooklyn. The Pentecostal experience defies limitation to any one style of expression, and neither a Trappist monastery nor a Mexican‐American parish are “representative” of American Catholics. The series shows a prisoner of war whose faith intensified ding his imprisonment; others may have lost faith in similar circumstances. Nonetheless, those familiar with the various manifestations of religion in the United States will find familiar faces in “Religious America.” I had to convince a New York acquaintance who had never seen a Pentecostal service or rural Lutheran church that there are really places where those things happen. And that's the point, says ,Mr. Garvin, who sees the series as a very optimistic picture of spirituality in this country. There is no one‐dimensional view of American religion, even though we all like to toss everything into a box labeled “religion,” with separate compartments for Protestant, Catholic and Jew. “Religious America” does not pretend to be representative or even documentary in the narrower sense of the word. The series carries a simple message to those who see religious faith in America as an establishment tool, an ecclesiastical bureaucracy, or a vestigial remnant of an unenlightened past. It says that there are people “out there” who believe fervently and who practice their belief openly. Their faith permeates their lives and often changes the lives of people around them. Their motivating force not those often demonic powers which shape politics or economics or sexuality or other “worldly” concerns. Their lives are shaped by matters of the spirit—often diverse spirits, to be sure, but who is to pass final judgment on that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Israel Feminist Wins Big Electoral Upset,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/08/archives/israel-feminist-wins-big-electoral-upset-place-in-record-books.html,"JERUSALEM, Jan. 7—The biggest upset in Israel's parliamentary election last week was achieved by a matronly redhaired mother of three who campaigned on a platform of consumerism, feminism and anti‐establishmentism. Shulamit Aloni, a 44‐year‐old writer, lawyer and feminist, defied Israeli political tradition by bolting from the governing Labor party, running as an independent and winning. Not only did she win a seat for herself in Parliament, but, according to the final, unofficial results announced yesterday, she carried in two other members of her embryonic Civil Rights party. Mathematically, the three seats could entitle Mrs. Aloni to a Cabinet position if she was to join the next coalition government. Politically, however, it is unlikely since her archenemy in the Labor party is Israel's other successful woman politician, Premier Golda Mein Whether Mrs. Aloni enters the Cabinet or not, she has already emerged as the major surprise, victor in the election. While several small parties were losing votes or being driven from Parliament, she appeered as a political figure to be reckoned with. Place in Record Books She has also earned a place in the political record books. Only one other former member of the Labor party has run independently and won more seats—former Premier David Ben‐Gurion, who ran on his own in 1969 and carried three supporters with him. Mrs. Aloni's victory is a clear manifestation of the widespread dissatisfaction displayed during the election with the established leaders of the big parties. A protest vote swept her into office, and no one knows it better than she. “The people who voted for me are fed up,” she said in an interview today. “They are sick of the red tape, the bureaucracy and corruption they see in the present Government, so they had no interest.in voting for Labor.” She continued: “They can't accept Begin and they couldn't bring themselves to vote for the radical left or the Communists, so they voted for me, to express themselves as individuals, as a vote for civil rights.” The hoarse‐voiced, aggressive Mrs. Aloni is no stranger to either the public or politics. She gained attention a decade ago with a popular radio program on which she championed consumer rights, an unheardof cause in Israel in the early nineteen‐sixties. She writes a popular column on consumer affairs for Yediot Aharonot, a mass‐circulation newspaper. Palestine‐born and educated, Mrs. Aloni is married to Reuven Aloni, a senior official with the Lands Authority. Two of their three sons are in the army. Rabbinical Control Opposed As a lawyer Mrs. Aloni has fought the rigid control exercised by the Orthodox rabbinate over marriage, divorce and all other matters of personal status. She has taken a number of celebrated cases in the civil courts in which individuals, usually women, have attempted to overturn rulings by rabbinical courts on matters such as community property. Mrs. Aloni is also a leader of the fledgling women's liberation movement. She has writ ten articles and books charging that the much‐advertised notion of sexual equality in Israel is more myth than reality, and. she has fought for abortion reform and equal pay for equal work. Elected on the Labor party list in 1965, she caused a sensation when she appeared at the swearing‐in ceremony on opening day in a low‐cut black, sleeveless dress. Orthodox members protested and the buxom Mrs. Aloni henceforth appeared in less revealing attire. Her career in Parliament the first time was short and stormy. Although she was elected as a member of the Labor bloc, she harassed. the Establishment about the patronage system and other issues and soon ran afoul of Mrs. Meir, then Secretary General of the Labor party. As a result she was dropped from the Labor list in the 1969 election and was not invited to rejoin it this year. Last‐Minute Decision Her decision to run independently was made at the last minute, forcing her supporters to accumulate the necessary signatures on the eve of the deadline. A list of candidates was quickly put together, including Marcia Freedman, a 35‐year‐old philosophy instructor at Haifa University who is also a feminist, and Dr. Boaz Maov, a biology lecturer at Tel Aviv University who has been active in the drive to replace the systern of proportional representation with a constituent election system similar to that in the United States. Both won. The campaign was a shoestring affair, run from a cluttered apartment‐office in down town Tel Aviv. Mrs. Aloni crisscrossed the country, speaking three or four times a day at kibbutzim, campuses and supermarket rallies. In all, the Civil Rights party spent about $35,000, less than half of what the Labor party spent for each parliamentary seat. The money was raised from individual donations and bank loans. Mrs. Aloni is considering the possibility of forming a parlimentary bloc with the Independent Liberal party, which won four seats and is a coalition partner in the outgoing Government. Their combined total would entitle them to two Cabinet seats if they decided to join the new coalition. Support for Geneva Talks Mrs. Aloni doubts that it will happen. “I just can't see myself sitting in the same cabinet with Golda Meir and the National Religious party,” she said. “These are the people have been fighting these last years.” Despite her differences with Mrs. Meir, Mrs. Aloni supports the Government's decision to enter peace negotiations at the Geneva conference. “We'll back them all the way at Geneva,” she said, “regardless of whether we are in the coalition or not. The people who voted for me were voting for peace, ,and Geneva is ,our best chance."" Meanwhile, Mrs. Aloni will continue to press her campaigns for changes in domestic; life—diminution of the power of the Orthodox religious groups, election reform and consumer protection. “It's going to be an interesting four years,” she said with a smile. “Never a dull moment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old Plot With New Cast,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/10/archives/old-plot-with-new-cast-democratic-legislature-seen-facing-tax.html,"TRENTON, Jan. 9—The overwhelming Democratic majorities that took control of the Legislature here yesterday confront a number of highly controversial issues this year. These include casino gambling and public financing of governorship elections. But the issue that may determine the political future of the Governor‐elect, Brendan T. Byrne, most certainly will be a tax reform program that will probably include a state income tax. This battle will be joined at the special session that Mr. Byrne, a Democrat who takes office next Tuesday, plans to call in late spring or early summer. News Analysis Last fall, when he conducted a highly successful election campaign without taking hard positions on most controversial issues, Mr. Byrne said the state would not need an income tax “for the foreseeable future.” Byrne Changes Mind Recent statements by Mr. Byrne, a former Superior Court judge, indicate he has changed his mind. In a recent interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times, the Governor‐elect said that among the proposals the special session of the legislature would have to consider were alternatives to the present system of governmental financing, including an income tax.” In his final annual message to the Legislature yesterday, Governor Cahill, a Republican, appealed for tax reform. While the appeal was hardly backed by any political power, it still generated considerable comment in a legislature that is still hostile to an income tax, which was overwhelmingly rejected two years ago. Some leaders seemed to support Mr. Cahill yesterday, but by no means did they reflect actual legislative sentiment. Nevertheless, they appeared to convey the realization that the Legislature most likely will be forced to adopt some form of tax revision this year. Last April the State Supreme Court struck down the present system of ‘financing public schools in New Jersey on the ground that it failed to fulfill a state constitutional mandate that every child be given “thorough and efficient” education. Although the court did not strike down local property taxes, it did say that any system that continued to rely primarily on such levies, as the New Jersey plan does, most likely would be rejected too. The court gave the Legislature until next December to approve a new system of financing public schools, presumably with a tax system that no longer depends on local property taxes for approximately 70 per cent of its revenue. And while Mr. Byrne has refused to speculate on what he intends to propose to the special session, a number of Democratic legislators fully anticipate that he will ultimately recommend a state income tax as part of a comprehensive tax reform program for the state. Inequities Are Cited New Jersey is one of the last major states without an income tax. It is not surprising that the state has the highest local property tax rates in the nation. Under the existing system, wide disparities have developed between wealthy suburbs and slum‐ridden cities that have seen their property tax bases crumble as people move out because of crime, poverty, racial unrest and urban decay. The disparities have created what the court here described as major inequities. For example, many suburbs can afford to pay $1,500 a year to educate every student, while most cities and many rural communities can barely spend $800 or $900. “Is there any member of this Legislature who believes the present system is just?” Mr. Cahill asked yesterday. When the Democrats commanded a 2‐to‐1 majority here in 1966, Gov. Richard J. Hughes a Democrat, attempted to get an income tax approved and failed by one vote. Six years later, Governor Cahill attempted the same thing. Again, the Legislature resisted and Mr. Cahill's tax reform program was overwhelmingly defeated in a politically divided Assembly. In his message yesterday, Mr. Cahill called the vote on the tax program his “most bitter, disappointing defeat,” one, he said, that gave him no pleasure to recall. Despite the Legislature's traditional hostility to an income tax, Mr. Byrne is still given good chance of succeeding where his two predecessors failed. One reason is the court's mandate; another is that Mr. Byrne, who has the advantage of better than 3‐to‐1 majorities in both houses, has committed the regular Democratic organizations in the state behind his legislative initiatives by including virtually all of them n the Legislature's new leadership. Odds Grow Smaller In addition, Mr. Byrne should perservere if for no other reason than ‘the conviction held by many legislators that, despite earlier rejections, the Legislature will be forced to accept an income tax, sooner or later, and the odds against the adoption of such a tax grow smaller every year. Of the other issues that are expected to dominate the session that convened yesterday, the public financing of governorship elections, a major campaigng pledge, is expected to be approved quickly, perhaps before the end of February. However, Mr Byrne's plans for casino gambling and the prospect of high rollers shooting dice or playing roulette in some refurbished Atlantic City hotel will have to wait until next year, since the proposal to extend legalized gambling would require approval in state referendum in November. Another issue that could cause controversy in the marble corridors of the State House for the next six months involves abortion. The Legislature has consistently avoided the issue, leaving the state without a law to enforce the liberal guidelines handed down by the United States Supreme Court. The chances are that the matter will be ignored again unless pro‐abortionists succeed in getting the courts to force the Legislature to deal with the issue. Still another possibility is Congressional redistricting, which Representative Peter W. Rodino of Newark, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has been pushing hard. He wants to have his predominantly black district redrawn and considerably widened in an effort to head off the prospect of a black political foreclosure in the not distant future. However, there seems to be no sentiment to entertain Mr. Rodino's request for a new bloc of white voters, largely because all of New Jersey's 14 other Representatives oppose any redistricting for this year's electiOns and partly because such an effort would undoubtedly be interpreted as an assault on the state's black minority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How French Women Got That Way—And How To Handle Them,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/how-french-women-got-that-wayand-how-to-handle-them-a-traitor-in.html,"IN FRANCE, the plumber will speak only to monsieur. He has always spoken to monsieur C'est conune ca. Although the French Revolution Was supposed to have liberated all citoyens and citoyennes in 1789, the Napoleonic Code relegated women to the status of minors and convicts, and they are just emerging. French women didn't get the right to vote until 1945—the only other European countries, to giant that right later were Italy, Belgium and Switzerland. They then had to wait until 1965 to open bank accounts without their husbands’ permission and until 1968 to buy contraceptives. But far from being kept down on the farm, French women have always‐been prominent in intellectual and professional life. From Jeanne &Arc to the Duchess of Longueville (who commanded troops in battle in the 17th century two hours before having a baby) to Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, French women have never hesitated to take iliberties the law did not grant them. It is, of. course, a paradox, and the visitor who is able to grasp it will better understand La Belle France and be better able to avoid embarassment, besides. He will understand, for example, the occasional rudeness of the salesgirl, the surliness now and then of the waitress, and why the female concierge, in particular, has become notorious throughout France for making life difficult. He will, in short, have an insight into the subtleties (the French abhor the obvious) of France's oppression of women—and the aggression this has bred in them. He will understand, too, that such aggressiveness is not directed against him personally, nor against his country. The French, he will know, are democratic even in their contrariness. Indeed, the reputation of French women as sex kittens is so widespread that some Parisiennes have been known to pass themselves off as Swiss or Belgian, just to avoid the inevitable leering when they declare, “I am French.” More often than not, though, French women seem to thrive on being sex objects; this, of course, makes them all the more attractive. When asked if they wish to be liberated, many reply, wide‐eyed, “From What?’ ‘Wpm oppression,” would be the obvious answer. The law, reinforced by France's Roman Catholicism, traditionally has kept women tied by their apron strings. After France lost 1.5‐million men In World War I, it became a crime to sell contraceptives. Women were to stay home and have babies to replenish the nation's stock of patriots, and Government payments for each child made it worthwhile. Even today only 6 per cent of French women take birth‐control pills. Divorces are hard to get, and expensive—the cheapest runs about $1,000. A woman must catch her husband committing adultery within his domicile to divorce him—what he does elsewhere is not grounds. And he can divorce her if he catches her in a compromising situation anywhere. What's more, alimony and child support laws are not enforced. By American standards, the French feminist consciousness is about as leavened as a matzoh, and only recently have events provided enough yeast to get the first women's movement off the ground. One of these involved six womet who were arrested in August, 1970, while putting a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The inscription read: to commemorate “His Wife—The Only One More Unknown Than He Was.” The women's slogan. “One Frenchman in Two Is a Woman,” was taken by outraged French manhood to mean that 50 per cent of the men were homosexuals. The six women were members of the radical Mouvement pour la Liberation de la Femme (M.L.F.), which is frequently lampooned in the press for its commando tactics. (The better newspapers still do not cover women's lib affairs: “Not serious,” they say.) Though Militant, the M.L.F. seems more tolerant than its counterparts in the United States. Lesbians and heterosexuals work together to free women, and there is no pressure for members to wear hair shirts or become plain Janes, A ‘Traitor” in New York Claudine Serre, 24‐year‐old doctoral candidate and etarter M.L.F. member, is the daughter of France's most famous mathematician, Jean‐Pierre Serre. Describing a recent international meeting in New York where she lectured, she said: “I was afraid to wear make‐up for fear they would be suspicious of me. Some people thought I was a traitor because I was wearing a bra.” The M.L.F. has alienated many women by raiding National Medical Association offices for its stand on abortion and by forming picket lines, on the ChampsElysees dressed up as children to protest the hypocrisy of Mothers Day. The The M.L.F. Women's fair last June, which included the presentation of a series of outdoor skits intended, to debunk miisogynous ‘myths, ‘wound up as a love‐in of all variants. On the other hand, the M.L.F. has gained support through its sit‐ins to protest conditions in unwed mothers’ homes and through arranging $10 abortions for the underprivilieged. An international festival of films by and about women will be put on by the M.L.F. In the Museum of Modern Art In Paris next April and should figure on any liberated tourist's agenda. The M.L.F. also organized France's first mass meeting to raise feminist consciousness in May, 1972, when 3,000 women gathered to gripe about housework and male tyranny while female bouncers manned the doors. “Reading the program,” wrote the right‐wing l'Aurore newspaper, “one would think the women were born in Spain about 1680 in the worst period of the Inquisition.” Since these protests by the M.L.F., French women's lives have changed, but most of the changes will elude the average tourist. French women, after all, did not exactly remove veils upon liberation; many did remove bras, but this was more in celebration than in protest against the female condition. ,Last summer on the Riviera, women were admitted topless to restaurants, and the sight of a nipple dangling over the glade Nigoise was not uncommon. There are few sartorial taboos in the country that dreamed up the bikini. The only thing the French do cavil about seems to be shorts in cities, whether on women or. men, but slacks and bare arms are appearing in church. More French women are dining out together at night and are responding less and less politely to attempts to pick them up. Unless it's in Pigalle or along tine Rue St. Denis, the tourist might find that it's safer to leave lone‐women alone. Kissing Her Hand When dining in female company, French men still pour the wine, however and follow rather than precede women into rooms, and sometimes even Kiss their hands (the lips should never tquch—just brush—the hand), but these gestures are welcomed by French women, young and old. Furthermore the tourist should remember that it's still de rigueur to bring flowers to the maitresse de maison when invited to French home. The M.L.F. girls take hard line on social rituals in which the male constantly takes the initiative, yet they do not react aggressively when Men perform them. As a result, the tourist on a date need not worry about getting snapped at, even if he steps out with a militant women's libber. But even though French men might still condescend to kiss milady's hand, they consider themselves completely liberated compared to the overly do masticated American male, who always wears an apron in French stories. “The only men I've ever seen pulling out chairs and scurrying behind me to walk on the outside of the street are Americans,” says Hughette Leforestier, a middle‐aged member of Choisir, a more conservative women's action group. “In ‘America you never had valets, so the men had to take the valet's place. And they're still doing it.” On the whole, this means that the American male visiting France can relax, since few French have ever ordered for women in restaurants or opened car doors. One Frenchman visiting the United States pulled up at his date's house and waited for her to get out of the cat', but she waited for him to open the car door. Mistaking her to budge for an invitation, he leapt into her lap. This finally induced her to open the door for herself, but she promptly slammed it on the Frenchman. Even sexual attitudes are changing in France, although the country was never exactly noted for its virginity cults. Male and female students, for example, have been living together in Paris practically since the Dawn of Enlightenment, a situation that probably stems as much from the lack of central heating in Paris as from anything else. Extramarital sex for men has always been condoned, even by wives, but for women fonds, perish the thought. “Five years ago, my family offered to let my boyfriend and me live in an apartment next to theirs, but only If we got married,” feminist Laurence Brun, photographer, told me. “So we did. Now my sister is living there with her boyfriend with my father's permission. The biggest change is that now a woman is entitled to enjoy sex before marriage.” French women point out that the women's lib movement in France is not anti‐man. “The confrontation is not taken into the bedroom as in America,” said Ingrid Carlander, whose collection of interviews with American women has just been published here. “French men are less obsessed with virility than Americans. They are sure masculine is best, so they don't have to prove it all the time. France is a hierarchy, and they know they're on top.” This makes them easier to get along with on a day‐to‐day basis, she feels. “There's no such thing as winning the battle of the sexes,” said novelist Francoise Sagan. “The point is to,help each other. There Is more emotional equality in France. Men and women try harder to please and interest each other.” Claude Servan‐Schreiber, French correspondent for Ms. magazine, commented, “Upper‐class women have good professional positions today because French men don't resent intellectual women.” However, author Christiane Rochefort, one of the M.L.F.'s founders, said, “The situation here is miserable. French lovers have international reputations but unfortunately no longer deserve them. And at home, it's still papa's law.” Lawyer Gistle Halimi, who defends left‐wing militants including author Jean‐Paul Sartre against the Government, is even more intransigeant. “The world is cut like this: there are the oppressors and the oppressed. And the most oppressed is woman.” She believes, along with author Simone de Beauvoir, that you must break the law to change it. In 1971, lawyer Halimi founded Choisir in an effort to change France's 1920 abortion law which permits that operation only when the mother's life is endangered. About 300,000 to one million illegal abortions a year take place in France, one of the highest rates in Europe, and countless women who can afford it go to clinics in England and Switzerland. The offense is punishable by fines up to,. $260 and two years in jail. The abortion issue has been the most effective consciousness‐raising tool in this Roman Catholic country. The movement first gained national notoriety when 343 women signed a confession published in the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur in 1971 saying they had had illegal abortions. Among the names were Francoise Sagan, Simon de Beauvoir and film stars Catherine Deneuve and Jeanne Moreau. No one was prosecuted . A new abortion law is now up for vote, and 12,000 mothers have already written in protesting the “license to kill.” A battle rages daily on French radio between women's groups and the rightwing organization called Let Them Live. Not long ago a documentary film on abortion was seized in a public cinema on orders from the Minister of Cultural Affairs, and 13 people protesting the seizure in Grenoble were wounded in clashes with the police. Because of the increased coverage of the abortion controversy in the press, the issues are now being openly discussed by the lower classes, even in rural areas, where the repressive 1920 law has become a symbol of the French woman's beleaguered status. Women's lib has had a tough row to hoe in these areas, mainly because the farmer's wife often had it better than the factory worker's wife. She counted the sous, and doled out an occasional franc to her husband for a glass of yin rouge if he was lucky. Colette, 29, and her husband, Paul, 32, have a farm in the rocky land near Brest on the Brittany Coast.. While her life is rugged, she is happier than her friends in the Brest factories, for she feels more in control of her life. She takes care of 64 calves, compared to the traditional farmer's wife, whose chores were limited to sprinkling chicken fedd and gathering the eggs. “Paul knows he couldn't run the farm without ‘me, and he respects my work,” she told me. “There's no boss here.” Equal Salaries If the abortion issue has brought women's lib ideas to servants and rural women, the question of equal pay for equal work has rallied salaried women to the bandwagon. Almost 40 per cent of the French work force is made up of women, and more women work in France than in any other country (46 per cent, compared to 40 per cent in Germany, 29 per cent in Italy and 26 per cent in the Netherlands). In France 55 per cent of the women workers earn under $200 a month and as a whole they earn an average of 30 per cent less than men for comparable work. In the rugged, coal‐mining districts of northern France, girls are still not considered fit to be educated. Marie Longet, 21, told me, “When I was 15, my sister and I went to work in a dress factory to pay for our brother's studies. Now he lean engineer, and we are still, in the factory.” No wonder French girls in the provinces still dream of hooking a husband so they won't have to work. No wonder their walls are still papered with photographs of Mireille Mathieu and Catherine Deneuve. To make matters worse, French life is not geared to the working woman, as a popular film called “She,..Always on the Run” pointed out last year. No supermarkets or laundromats are open at night or on Sundays and few people have freezers, so shopping must be done daily. Children are out of school on Wednesdays instead of Saturdays, and don't eat lunch at school. They anust be picked up at 11:30 and returned at 1:30. On Wednesdays many of the 5,531 mothers who work at the main post office in Paris are forced to bring their children to work with them. “We give them coloring books and sit them in a corner on the floor,” one ,mother said with a shrug. Husbands, too, head home for lunch, and their working wives scurry home to wait on them. In her book, “Place aux Femmes,” Christine Callet, of the weekly news magazine Le Point, cites an office worker in Limoges who considers herself lucky. VI have two hours for “her” lunch: at noon she takes the trolley home, at 12:20 she fixes her husband's and daughter's lunch, at 12:40 she eats her own lunch standing up while serving them, then at 1:20 she hops back in the trolley after doing the dishes. The first real evidence of the working class woman's heightened consciousness has been her participation in recent strikes. Up to now, salesgirls and wait. resses have vented their frustrations on customers, as every tourist knows, Salesgirls frequently let a customer wait 10 to 15 minutes while they chat about the boyfriends to the girls at the next counter. If he has a question, he is sent from counter to counter. The sales girl's attitude is partly due to the lack of upward mobility in France, her sal. ary, $150 to $190 a month, and the fact that French women are discourager. from taking initiative or responsibility. Indeed, American businessmen in France have long, complained about their French secretaries’ inability to cope. Salesgirls’ Strike The traveler in France, and the French themselves, may soon be getting better treatment now that salesgirls are taking their gripes to the right place—their employers. At the Nouvelles Galleries department store in Thionville, in eastern France, salesgirls struck last year for salary increase from $160 to $200 a month. However, 160 of the 300 women employes refused to strike, saying they would rather be paid less and not take any responsibility. One nonstrikur explained, “I don't think we should be paid as much as the men. We don't have the same responsibilities.” A few weeks ago, workers from the Lipp watch factory near the Jura Mountains in eastern France descended on Paris to popularize their six‐month strike. The crowd asked, many ,questions dealing with women's problems, “How did you cope with your children during the strike?” a girl sporting a red Afro asked. One of the women strikers answered, “I don't understand why people think children only belong to women,” and this was greeted by massive applause. “Who ran the strike, men or women?” someone asked. Janine, mother of four whose husband and she have been making Lipp watches for 21 years, answered, “At first, the woman swept the floors and made the sand. wiches, and the men did the talking. Then we understood that we must talk too.” Two years ago, one suspects, the questions would have been limited to labor relations. Considering working conditions and salary discrepancies, if is not surprising that 84 per cent of French women work out of economic necessity only, and that 63 per cent of French men feel that this is the only justification for the wife leaving the house. La femme au foyer—the mistress of the house—. is still a French ideal and even a status symbol. “Why shouldn't the worker's wife get to stay home like the emu. &is wife?” one laborer asked me. Shining His Shoes The working woman's plight is ag. gravated by the fact that France is still a man‐centered society. It is the only “advanced” country I know of where women of all classes, except those with servants, shine their husbands’ shoes. Most men, especially the members of the working class, don't help with the housework, yet, because the French who are fond of insist it be im‐peccable. Because of this attitude, the my, thinks women's lib will be longer in making real progress in France than in the United States. “American men are smarter,” Claudine Serre told me. “They have tried to understand women's problems. But French men have reacted by blocking it all out and taking refuge in ridicule. The symbol of France is le coq—the rooster—and that's not art accident. He is the French man, beating his wings and crowing. But when the hens gather round and say they don't want to be ruled by the rooster anymore, he just keeps saying co‐cori‐co.” (That's, French for cockle‐doodledo.) The Status of Women's Lib in Europe The women's liberation movement in France is far ahead of those in other Latin countries, but it trails behind the rest of Europe. A woman's movement in Italy started to jell over the battle for divorce in 1970 and an activist newspaper called F was sporadically published. But Italians are restrained even more by the Catholic Church than the French, who are often Catholic in name only. Not only do Italian women have to contend with the mamma‐mia syndrome, but also with their men's notorious machismo. (Italian men have been known to proudly wave handfuls of speeding tickets as symbols of masculinity, and their pinching speaks for itself.) The potent combination of General Francisco Franco and the Catholic Church continues to subjugate Spanish women, the least‐liberated of the Continent. Of the non‐Catholic countries, Switzerland has the least active women's lib movement and women received the right to vote in 1971. Despite French rumors that the wealthy abort in Switzerland, its abortion laws are as strict as those in France. Fewer women work because they were never massively injected into the economy by the world wars as were women in other European countries and the United States, and they are far less active in politics. German women have gone beyond the frontiers of the three K's—Kinder, Kirche, Kilche (children, church, and kitchen) —that were once the limits of their universe, and laws that emancipated French women in the late 1960's were enforced in Germany a decade or more earlier. Germany accorded women the right to vote in 1919, one year after England, while French women had to wait until 1945. Today, 6 per cent of West Germany's parliament are women, while the French National Assembly numbers only seven women out of 480. And girls were allowed out unchaperoned in Germany at a time when this would have been scandalous in France. Clara Malraux, 70‐ish author and ex‐wife of Andre Malraux, told me that her mother in Germany had to send her contraceptives after her marriage because they were outlawed in France. The Belgian women's lib group is proportionately much stronger than the French: on Women's Day, Nov. 11, some 10,000 wothen turned out for a rally and 100,000 showed up in defense of a certain Dr. Peers, accused by the state of having performed abortions. English women are perhaps the most liberated in all of Europe, in both law and practice. They re ceived the right to vote in 1918, earlier than any country except those in Scandinavia, and the 1967 Abortion Act made England an abortionists’ haven. The signature of two doctors is all that is needed to authorize the operation. Girls from all over Europe head for England for abortions, if they can afford it, and in 1970 England passed an equal work‐equal pay law for women. The swinging London image of the 1960's “seems to have done Victorianism in for good, and the colorful assortment of four‐letter words bandied about by most young English women would certainly be frowned upon in France, even by the M.L.F. English men think nothing of wearing aprons and have been doing the dishes for years, while some Continental men would still be hard‐pressed to locate the kitchen.—J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three novels (one by an American) from England; Sweet Dreams; By Michael Frayn. 173 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $5.95.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/three-novels-one-by-an-american-from-england-by-dee-wells-285-pp.html,"Impossible not to overpaise Michael Frayn's latest novel, “Sweet Dreams,” I say to myself—and then ask myself, whatever do I mean? How could one overpraise so charming a book? It is lucid intelligent, delightful stylish, extremely funny, and I have no reservations about it at all I recommend it wholeheartedly. Michael Frayn has a most unusual talent. His books seem so deceptively simple, but they linger in the mind for years, and can be re‐read with the greatest pleasure. “Sweet Dreams” is no exception. It is a fantasy, but let not that deter—there is nothing wild or difficult or provoking about it. As he assures us, it is a middle‐class fantasy and it is a sweet one. His hem Howard Baker is transported, while waiting at a green light in Highgate to Heaven — which, American readers will be interested to note, bears a ‐striking resemblance to a dream America. But Heaven contains all things—the past, the present the glorious future. There, Mends at dinner parties laugh at one's jokes in the right way, one gets the right kind of job promotion, one's wife and one's mistress and children prosper. There are, it is true snags but they can all be turned to glorious Good in the end. It is also true that little sneak reminders of reality creep in—Howard Baker, who lands a good job designing the Alps, at first laughs to scorn the idea that the. Matterhorn is a threat to life because people will try to climb it and fall off it—why ever should they? he says laughing loudly. And when forced to admit they will, he has to construct a whole new ideology which contains the ideas of pain, trial and endurance—a whole new middle‐aged philosophy. The novel is a satire on modern fashions—clothes houses jobs attitudes beliefs—but it's more than that. It's an account of growing older it's a comment on the nature of man. (One of the characters is designing not the Alps, but Man and a poor job he makes of it.) The accuracy of Frayn's observation is dazzling; in a few words he creates a man, a room, a dinner party. What he does, he _ does precisely. And it isn't a small talent. Most satirists and writers of Utopias dislike pbople profoundly, but Frayn's work is informed with the most beautiful goodwill. It isn't innocence because he is knowing (though one suspects he suspects that others suspect at times that he is an Innocent). It is a kind of goodness. One of the rarest qualifies, and how could one ever overpraise it? Jane By Dee Wells. 258 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $6.95. Dee Wells's first novel is one of those books that one can't put down. One feels rather guilty about not being able to put it down—is it not after all slick, trendy, derivative ever racist, and certainly non‐serious? But its sheer readability wins out, and one is left reading in the small hours, longing in rather an old‐fashioned way to know how it is going to end. For unlike many smart and trendy first novels, “Jane” has a plot of awesome simplicity and undeniable effect. Jane is a liberated American, in her mid‐thirties, a film critic earning a large salary and living in stylish affluence in unstylish Covent Garden above a warehouse “full of bananas. She has three lovers, one a lord, one a burglar who fell through her window one night, and one a black American lawyer. She conceals each from the others, and seems at the beginning of the novel to be managing her life extremely Well—who said women couldn't manage to enioy promiscuity? But of course (and here the novel begins to get dubious in sexist as well as racist terms) she actually like a heroine in an Old World novel like an antique incompetent, gets herself pregnant when the plastic coil drops out unobserved, and finds herself thrown back into that unliberated timeless nightmare: who is the child's father and which if any of these men should she marry? The effect of the discovery on her and On the men is the substance of the book, and we watch breathless to see who is going to stand by her and who will walk out. She is forced to realize that she greatly prefers the black lawyer, and longs for the child to be his, but there are some interesting skirmishes with the English lord's mother, a frightful duchess, which almost persuades her to marry the lord out of spite: Of course, the real paternity of the baby is left for a last chapter denouement, and neither is it the last twist. It would be wicked to give away Miss Wells's secrets: they are worth waiting for. And on the way she produces some very funny jokes about British and American life (she is herself an American living in England), some Amislike moments of loathing, a good cameo of a country house, a child hood with Nanny and a plausible scene in a morgue. ¶uite a range And if at times there is something not quite so funny about the liberated woman caught in a very old trap one feels that that too, is part of the writer's scheme She is offering some serious comments on modern life but more important her story and her jokes are good. The Heyday By Bomber Gascoigne. 221 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $6.95. “The Heyday” is a scholarly exercise in nostalgia. Set in the first decade of the century, this novel recounts a year in the life of a young actress traveling with a touring company, but her story is told at several removes, and is narrated by her grandson, a baronet and unsuccessful author. When the book opens its heroine is still alive a flirtatious old lady, determined it appears to flirt beyond the grave she leaves her wicker basket of memories to her grandson, who constructs from its unpromising contents the story of her heyday, which was the year before she married his grandfather. Bamber Gascoigne is himself a scholar, and has written two books about the theater, as well as plays and revues This book is definitely a book for theater addicts. It re‐creates the atmosphere of a touring company with loving precision. There is the leading lady who insists on playing Hamlet the cast of extras hired in each town the theatrical digs where landladies are always called Ma and omelettes are cooked on gas rings in corridors. There are the daring escapades in provincial hotels, and the Sunday trains famed for carrying Actors and Fish. The research is thorough, the nostalgia intense. The young actress, with her innocence and gaiety, loves an actor and is pursued in classic fashion by a baronet who sends her tulips and follows her from box to box: finally she marries him, but why, and what was it that happened between her and the handsome actor, and who is the butler who watched over her in her old age? The plot holds no dramatic surprises: the novel's charm lies in its accuracy of detail Even the recipes of the period (from Mrs. Beeton) are given, as well as the amazing prices of cigars and drinks. On this level, the book is a success, and should charm all those who enjoy old post ers, old photographs, and oat mugraphies of the Edwardian idyll. But one can't help regretting that its subject is so slight. The grandmother's dead passions, much as they are explored and questioned, never really come to life they are as the narrator finally admits, gone forever, forever obscure, The pity is that one does not much care what they were. One has only to think of L P. Hartley's masterpiece, “The Go‐Between,” which uses some of the same tricks —a lost diary, nostalgia, a misunderstood passion, a lost youth—to realize that “The Heyday,” pleasant though it is, is pleasant in a small scale. It has none of the deep emotion of “The Go‐Between.” But then, L P. Hartley was a real Edwardian child, and Mr. Bamber Gascoigne, however diligently he seeks for the past, cannot give us the real experience of it. ■ For Ages 4, 5, . . . 15 Phoenix Feathers A Collection of Mythical Monsters.

Here are accounts by authors as old as Ctesias, a fourth century B. C. Greek and as modern as Theodore Sturgeon, 20th century science fantasy writer. Each fabulous bird or beast once thought to inhabit the earth is described first by an ancient author, then placed centrally in a story by a modern. Included are such long‐time favorite tales as Kenneth Grahame's “The Reluctant Dragon” and Frank Stockton's “The Griffin and the Minor Canon.” Credit is due Mrs. Silverberg for her superb orchestration of the volume. My Dad. Lives in A Downtown Hotel By Peggy Mann. Illustrated by Richard Cuffed. 92 pp. Doubleday. $4.50. (Ages 8 to 11) Joey's reactions to his parents impending divorce follow a prescribed psychological pattern disbelief hatred, the feeling of rejection. Finally, accepting the inevitable, he eagerly anticipates the forming of a secret club for kids with no fathers at home. While the author's dialogue always rings true, her first‐person narrative too often sounds like an adult's attempt to imitate childlike thoughts and prose patterns. A book with good intentions but whose suc cess is marred by simplistic resolutions to a complex and confusing problem. Ike Abilene to Berlin. By Stephen E. Ambrose. Photographs. 220 pp. Harper & Row. $5.95. (Ages 12 to 16) A professional historian, who helped edit Ike's military papers and knew the General personally, makes it clear that this biography is a labor of love, that Ike was “the kindest most thoughtful human being I have ever known.” But Ambrose does not ignore Ike's temper earthiness stubbornness, his early insulation from the realities of politics his mistakes. The result is a portrait all the more impressive because it is whole. What is most important about this book is its appreciation of Ike's character of how it was molded early by his family and Abilene and of how the nature of that character affected history. The Goblins Giggle And Other Stories. Selected and Illustrated by Molly Bang. 57 pp. Scribnees. $4.95. (Ages 9 to 12) Taken with one dark and stormy night, this collection of ghost stories should satisfy any phantophile. There are five, each originating in the folk literature of a different foreign country—Japan, China, France, Ireland and Germany—yet the tone is the same throughout, dispassionate, almost cold, which is always the best way with ghost stories, Molly Bang has a splendid feeling for general chill, and her choices are all scary but end comfortably so as not to keep anyone awake for long. Her illustrations are unique and intriguing. Grimm's Fairy Tales Twenty Stories. Illustrated by Arthur Rackham. 128 pp. Viking‐Studio. $6.95. (Ages 8 and up) How does this new edition serve to further acquaint the world with an artist of RaCkham's stature and integrity? The black‐and‐white drawings are faithfully reproduced. But to compare the color reproductions with the original 1909 edition would fill any artist, and any person who admires Rackham, with indignation. For example, the illustration for “The Goosegirl” used on the jacket and repeated in the book is so leaden, so coarsened as to be totally unrelated to its original. Then too, many‐illustrations have lost all their warm, natural color relationships. Dig A Journey Under the Earth's Crust. Written and Illustrated by John and Faith Hubley. Unpaged. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $5.95. (Ages 6 to 10) A book adaptation of an original TV film, “Dig!” is a long and tedious “journey under the earth's crust” done with script‐style dialogue and panels of comic “stills” for illustrations. On the trip a boy and his dog are guided by a talking rock back through time and geological eras where they meet Uncle Iggy (igneous rock), Aunt Sadie (sedimentary), Cousin Meta (metamorphic) and others. Best left unearthed. The Endless Pavement By Jacqueline Jackson and William Perlmutter. Illustrated by Richard Cuffed. 48 pp. Seabury. $4.95. (Ages 9 to 12) In a futuristic world of constantly moving Home‐a‐rollas, Fix‐a‐rollas, Hearse a rollas, Eats‐a‐rollas, Disposa‐rollas, a girl called Josette defies the Great Computer‐mobile and eats of the “round red” fruit of a tree—and frees all the rolla people from their computerized existence. The authors are concerned with man's complacency about the automobile TV the bulldozing of nature and technology in general. Fine.. But one reads this fuzzy twist on the Widen of Eden story as an adult nightmare not as a children's story. Growing Up In a Hurry By Winifred Madison. 168 pp. Little, Brown. $5.75. (Ages 12 to 15) Formula: teen‐age girl flute player unloved at home finds love with a Japanese chemistry student plus pregnancy. Boy rejects girl. Girl has abortion, and comes to maturity prepared for life. Dull with flat characterizations and the obvious conclusion that life is rough. The, Supreme, Superb, Exalted And Delightful, One and Only Magic Building By William Kotzwinkle. Illustrated by Joe Servello. Unpaged. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $5.95. (Ages 4 to 8) An elusive parable concerning a proud Oriental Emperor and a humble carpenter called Old Ridgepole. “Smoothly did their blades go, and never bend, buckle or stick.” Such tortuous locations indicate the Eastern locale. It has escaped Mr. Kotzwinlde's attention that the Grimms's tales read in English do not “sound” German, nor Perrault's “sound” French. And is creating and describing mystery as simple as writing that Old Ridgepole is “glowing with a mysterious inner light""? Some of the woodcuts are pleasant but the artist like the author has failed to notice that imitating the East can sometimes be a royal road to the ridiculous. Baba Yaga's Geese And Other Russian Stories. Translated and Adapted by Bonnie Carey. Illustrated by Guy Fleming. 128 pp. Indiana University Press. $5.95. (Ages 10 and Up) A good sampling of Russian folk tales, fables, proverbs and riddles and modern fairy tales. While Bonnie Carey's knowledge of Russian and affection for her material are fully evident, she does not always catch the character and spirit of the tales in her narrative style. Even though the book does not always rise to the level of the best English translations (all the anthologies of Russian tales are quite old), it merits respect for its earnest scholarliness and freshness. Dreamland Lake By Richard Peck. 147 pp. Holt, Rinehart & Winston. $5.95. (Ages 11 to 15) Two boys discover a dead body in an abandoned amusement park. Flip, impulsive and aggressive, begins to find evidence of a Nazi cult, and his excitement sweeps Bryan along. Both boys resent the attempt by Elven, the school's despised fat boy, to join them, and decide *to put him down. Ending with a sudden and shattering tragedy, this is more somber perhaps than the usual teenage mystery. Yet the author has a light, controlled touch, and an emotional depth to his narrative that turns it into an unusually strong and subtle novel of early adolescence. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Television; Next Week, Of Course, It May Be ‘Out’ to Be ‘In’; A guide to what it's acceptable to be caught watching if you're one of those people who never (well, hardly ever) watch TV.",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/next-week-of-course-it-may-be-out-to-be-in-television.html,"NOT so long ago, in Certain Circles, If you admitted to watching television—any television—it would have been tantamount to a confession of fondness for Mantovani or for eating cardboard. But now, with the admission of blue‐collar culture and the commonplace into these same Certain Circles, you not only may watch TV, you must (just as you must frequent McDonald's — cf., eating cardboard, above). These Circles have always been rather natrowly drawn, of course, so the TV shows you see have to be the Right Ones, or you may find yourself Outside the Circumference—a fate worse than depth. In order to help you stay Inside, I shall furnish you with a brief guide to nighttime television programs, some of which are de rigueur and some of which are square. “COLUMBO”: In. Peter Falk's glass eye, wrinkled trench coat, rattletrap car and poor posture against an ineluctably elitist criminal. A sub rose treatise on Marxist class warfare which almost always features a decadent, money‐ or power‐hungry killer who is brought low by the prole cop who seeks no reward but justice. Falk's charter membership in the man's‐man Cassavetes‐GazzaraHamill axis makes watching his show all the more hip. “THE WALTONS”: Out (surprise!). Recently criticized by pop‐culture vultures Pauline Kael and Anne Roiphe for sentimentalism and inaccuracy, “The Waltons” has experienced what may be the second‐briefest ascendancy In television history P.G. (post‐Gobel). People have started to realize that this show includes principals named John‐Boy and Jim‐Bob. Are you kidding? “LET'S MAKE A DEAL”: In. Required viewing, in fact. This game show, in which audience members wear bizarre costumes and try to trade their way up to the Big Deal (a cartload of appliances, vacation weekends, etc.), is discussible on many levels—for instance, as a 30‐minute demonstration of Marcuse's theories about the psychic dislocations caused by American materialism. Do not, however, admit to tuning in for Marcusian reasons. Instead, do as I do: Sit in front of the tube shouting advice at a participant dressed as an M‐16 rifle, or waiting for some dinette‐set‐winning hysteric in a Snoopy, costume to all but rape Monty Hall, the m.c. “WILD KINGDOM”: In. For the Campy pleasure of watching venerable Marlin Perkins thrash around with gryphons in a mud puddle in “created” sequences (always accompanied by appropriate thrashing‐around‐with‐nature music), some of which appear to take place in the good old St. Louis Zoo even when the show is supposed to be about the Faeroes. Also amusing for classic commercial segues: “The female oagadagou does everything she can to make sure her cubs get plenty of grubs and centipedes for dinner; at Mutual of Omaha, we do everything we can to make sure your youngsters get along should something happen to you.” JOHNNY CARSON VS. DICK CAVETT: In, Out. Johnny, besides still being one of the best comedians around, is genuine Middle Americana, breast and bathroom obsessions included. Cavett, who, like Carson, comes from Nebraska, acquired an overlay of Yalie arrogance, and insists on inserting his smug liberal prejudices into discussions that take place far above his head. Cavett lost it for good when he frisked like a puppy at the feet of Marlon Brando, in what was probably‐the most embarrassing interview ever conducted on TV. “KUNG FU”: Out. Tops “The Waltons” as the briefest ascendancy P. G. Oriental self‐defense is pretty hip right now, but you can see more martial and more artistic martial arts in any of the late Bruce Lee's movies, without having to listen to Master “Flashback” Po, the hero's Shaolin guru back in China, opine, “Grasshopper, in order for there to be good, there must be bad; do we blame the lovely moth because he eats our socks?” and without having the camera stare repeatedly into the sun & la a cheapo David Lean. “MASTERPIECE THEATRE”: Out. Except for Fred Wiseman documentaries, all public television is Out, though you must do your $15‐subscription, anyway, to fend off the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy. There hasn't been much of faddish interest on public TV since “The Great American Dream Machine” went off the air. Just talking heads, knee‐jerk liberals, demonic lady gardeners, and highbrow music. Particularly noisome: Joan Sutherland's program, “Who's Afraid of Opera,” which will give you plenty of reasons. NETWORK NEWS: Marginal. Cronkite and Chancellor are Out. Smith and Reasoner—the only two network newscasters to call for the impeachment of the President—are In. “HAWKINS”: Out. At first glance, show about the triumphs of a West Virginia country‐boy defense lawyer might seem pretty fashionable, Sam Ervin and Herman Talmadge having recently established a national cult of rustic wisdom. Unfortunately, however, Jimmy Stewart's acting has become arch and self‐conscious, and has thus deprived Billy Jo Hawkins of the humility and naturalness requisite for folk heroism. “MAUDE”: In. Not so much for Bea Arthur's harridan mother‐wife act (very outré) as for controversial plots (the two notorious abortion episodes) and exposure of shallow liberalism. Florida, Maude's maid, provides the proletarian touchstone. “Maude” offers proof that we must start by bombing the suburbs. “ALL IN THE FAMILY”: Out. Because, according to Nielsen, it is the most popular show on television. “POLICE STORY“: In. Nobody has more Pop currency right now than the American cop, thanks largely to the novels of one man, police sergeant‐writer Joseph Wambaugh. So the fact that Wambaugh created this series confers upon it instant cachet. “Police Story” scores points for hard‐nosed realism about urban life; the black street, people on this show walk’ and talk like real black street people, instead of like Percy Sutton and Leslie Uggams. “THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW“: In. Of course. Mary fights the good women's‐lib fight, and her boy friends generally furnish her ample reason to stay single. (We could certainly do with a lot less of Georgette, Ted Baxter's bubbleheaded, bimbo, who seriously interferes with the show's latent feminism.) Mary is so In, actually, that it has become especially fashionable to drift into the den at a party—or even go home—at 9 o'clock on Saturday night because you “simply must not miss” her program. N.B.A. BASKETBALL (especially the Knicks’ home games, which are telecast only on “the cable,'): In. The only sport that has elevated the urban black to total preeminence, pro basketball is must viewing. Knick games on television furnish you with a further opportunity to escape any other activity —from arroz con polio dinner parties to dreary board meetings. In discussing the game with your psychiatrist or your boss the next day, make sure to use ‘a good deal of jargon and only the players’ Knicknames: “Were you watching when Action [Phil Jackson] got the defensive ‘bound [rebound], gave the outlet [long downcourt pass] to the Pearl [Earl Monroe] who went backdoor [executed a specific kind of tricky pass] to Dollar Bill [Bill Bradley] who got the chippie [scored an easy basket]?” As you have no doubt noticed, the judgments made in this list rest on shifting and arbitrary criteria—esthetic, political, biographical, nonexistent, but that's O.K.: this sort of trendhawking has to be as ephemeral as the trends being hawked. Secrets made public rapidly’ lose their savor, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this article self‐destructs the minute you finish reading it.

Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/14/archives/metropolitan-briefs-police-seek-boys-body-in-lake-atom-plant.html,"Police Seek Boy's Body in Lake Using a helicopter to break the ice of Prospect Park Lake, police emergency crews worked into the night grappling for the body of Daron Pritchard, a 13‐year‐old boy who fell through the ice while playing with a friend. The friend, Eric Hines, 13, who, like the missing boy, lives at 108 Christopher Avenue, Brooklyn, sought to pull the Pritchard youth to the safety of thick ice. When he failed, he called the police, who began their search of the milelong lake. Atom Plant Closing Said to Kill Fish The closing of a nuclear power plant in Lacey Township, N.J., for safety reasons last Friday has resulted a massive fish kill in Oyster Creek in Ocean County, ac‐cording to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Department officials, who had tried to prevent the week‐long shutdown or to delay it until summer, said the abrupt drop in water temperature could kill as many as a million menhaden and other fish drawn to the creek in winter. The fish are attracted by the warmth of coolant waters discharged by the plant of the Jersey Central Power and Light Company. The discharge makes Oyster Creek usually 20 degrees warmer than surrounding waters the winter. New Presbyterian Synod Formed The Synod of the Northeast, a new regional governing and administrative unit within the three‐million member United Presbyterian Church, was formed in Newark at a two‐day constituting convention that brought together 200 representatives of nearly half a million churchgoers in eight states. The Rev. Conrad H. Massa of Rochester was elected moderator, or presiding officer, and the Rev. W. Eugene Houston of Springfield Gardens, Queens, was named stated clerk, or chief executive officer. The Synod of the Northeast unites under one banner the former Synods of New York, New Jersey and New England. Cooke Scores Abortion, Euthanasia Cardinal Cooke restated his opposition to abortion and euthanasia at a service honoring about 300 couples from the metropolitan area who will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary in 1974. Speaking from the pulpit of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Archbishop said that “deliberate abortion at one end of the life spectrum and deliberate euthanasia at the other are fundamental moral evils to be opposed in every instance.” Although the family‐life celebration is a 20‐year tradition in the archdiocese, it was the first time that the Archbishop had used the occasion to speak about abortion. From the Police Blotter: The police seized an assortment of firearms, nylon stocking masks, handcuffs and ammunition when they arrested two men who had parked their car outside McDonald's hamburger shop at 80‐03 Queens Boulevard Elmhurst, Queens. Employes, made suspicious by their behavior and recent robberies at other McDonald's branches, alerted the police, who later identified the arrested men as two cousins from Manhattan, Ernest, years old, and Lloyd Gilpin, 18, of 87 Columbia Street... A man said to have had a long police record was shot and killed with four bullets seconds after he entered a Harlem tavern on Lenox Avenue, near 139th Street. The police identified him as Milton Butts, 37, of 530 West 144th Street. ... Carbon‐monoxide fumes from an idling car in a repair shop at 743 East Sixth Street, near Avenue C, killed a man and critically affected another. A young couple and their 8‐month‐old son, who are living above the shop and reportedly called the police after being awakened by the whimpering infant, also were hospitalized for observation.

New Science Courses Stress Solutions to Practical Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/16/archives/new-science-courses-stress-solutions-to-practical-problems.html,"Armed with test kits, small group of students under Prof. Abe Berlad at the Stony Brook College of Engineering have been traveling from home to home, measuring the efficiency of residential oil burners on Long Island. They have found that oilburner efficiency can be increased by 15 or 20 per cent and that fuel consumption can be cut by one quarter. Even if the oil burner gradually goes out of adjust ment again, an average fuel saving of 15 per cent would not be difficult to achieve, with lower cost for the homeowner and a significant contribution to the regional energy problem. Adjustment of the fuel injector for optimum efficiency accomplishes more than tuming down the thermostat by 4 to 6 degrees. On a national basis, such savings would correspond to a billion galIons of home heating fuel. Gil‐burner efficiency measures the amount of heat that goes into the circulating water, or steam, compared with the heat in the fuel used. An efficiency of 50 per cent means that half the fuel is wasted; part is not usefully burned and gases going up the chimney carry heat. A properly adjusted oil burner may give 75 to 80 per cent efficiency; older unadjusted units can run well below. 60 per cent. Homeowner Informed After making a measurement the Stony Brook students inform the homeowner of his furnace efficiency compared. with what it would be if properly adjusted. The homeowner can then decide whether to call a serviceman. The measurement takes about 20 minutes. If a cluster of homes is studied the same day, costs are only a few dollars per home. This example dramatizes the new thrust in science education, from elementary school to college and beyond. ‘Through such projects, students are learning science to understand today's problems. The goal of such understanding is a population better able to insure that technology is used properly so that it improves the quality of life. These activities are central to a high school course, called the Man‐Made World, developed by the Engineering Concepts Curriculum Project at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The course is taught to almost 40,000 students in 1,000 high schools throughout the country. Other Projects Related courses are given in at least 40 colleges, as well as in adult education programs and junior high schools. The entire program TM Now York TImes/Jan. 16, 1974 has been developed over the last eight years with support primarily from the National Science Foundation. The Man‐Made World course is one of a large variety of new developments in science education. At Florida State University, a program called the Individualized Science Instructional System will have project‐based minicourses covering the three years of high school science education. At the college level, Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts is converting its entire under graduate program to student project activity. The common theme of such education changes is the breaking away from a classical pattern that regards science as a distinct field, with its elements of physics, chemistry, biology and earth sciences. In this traditional approach a course in physics, for example, is designed to introduce the basic ideas of physics on which the student can build later knowledge. Thus, the sequence of physics work represents a logical structure for the subject; the earlier years emphasize the most basic concepts and touch only rarely on the ideas that relate to the student's background and experience. By contrast, the new programs start with a familiar problem or project—a challenge to the student to seek understanding and to formulate possible solutions. Traffic Flow Studied In one part of the ManMade World course, for example, the students study traffic flow in their community or school. At one Idaho school, the class determined that the town's two one‐way streets should be interchanged. After they presented a formal argument to the town political leaders, the change was voted. In the process of doing this project, the students had to learn the scientific principles underlying traffic flow—the dynamics of moving vehicles with the fewest possible bottlenecks, and techniques for studying alternative designs by simulations. At the same time, science is no longer separate from social science. Doing something constructive about traffic flow requires consideration of the costs, the behavior of people, the political process and the effects on commercial establishments along the streets. Technological Literacy The emphasis is on technological literacy—that is, an the limitations of this technology? In other words, technounderstanding of the technology that surrounds us and impinges on so much of our lives. What are the concepts that underlie the modern computer, communications, and automation technology? What are the capabilities and logical literacy should help a person in two ways: How can the individual live smoothly and comfortably with today's technology by understanding how it behaves and how it interacts with people? How can the individual participate intelligently in the social and political decisions that control how future technology is developed—to contribute to the effort to insure that the development does indeed improve the quality of life? In the former category, we are finally seeing the appearance of communication equipment on expressways to inform a driver of congestion ahead, of alternate routes, and of special speed limits or driving instructions. For the driver to make logical use of this information, au must understand how the system operates and why seemingly senseless red lights occasionally block his entrance. In the latter category, the emergence last fall of a national energy policy can successfully promote a conservation ethic only through a knowledgeable public that can demand and understand an equitable distribution of the sacrifices required to cut the growth in energy consumption. A Greater Breadth Because of the focus on today's problems and on the man‐made environment in which the students live, these new programs involve parts of science that have a much greater breadth than the conventional courses. In the Man‐Made World, for example, the following problems illustrate the way in which study ranges over the sciences and social sciences: Islats in a baby's crib should be no more than 3¼ inches apart, according to a Government recommendation. With wider spacing, the baby can wriggle through the bars until his head is caught and he runs the risk of strangulation. A doctor argues that this regulation is too lenient and that the slats should be no more than 2 inches apart. A student visits two department stores and finds that the spacing of the slats varies from 2¼ to 3½ inches, with the most expensive brand failing to meet the Government recommendation. Curing the nineteen‐sixties, poison control centers were started in many areas of the United States. These centers kept records of all accidents reported. From this data, it was found that infant aspirin in large quantities constituted a serious health threat. As a result, a new regulation forbade the sale of such aspirin in large bottles. Now, even if a child swallows an entire bottle of infant aspirins, the nose is hot lethal. ¶On Nov. 1, 1966, Romania made most abortions illegal. Previously, abortion was the primary method of birth control, with four abortions fix each live birth. Eight months later, the birth rate nearly tripled and reached the highest level in the nation's history. During 1967, there were twice as many births as in the year preceding, In 1972, the baby boom hit the school system; in 1985 it will hit the job market. This one governmental action’ has had profound effects on the country's health, economy, education, employment and social systems. 3 Basic Problems The Man‐Made World course demonstrates that a science‐based program can be developed, emphasizing those aspects of science that begin to explain the techno Although the rate of increase in enrollment in colleges and universities has slowed, the total number of students is still growing. The present enrollment in America's institutions of higher education is 9,662,763, up by 3.9 per cent from what it was during the 1972‐73 academic year, according to the United States Office of Education, Much of this year's enrollment increase was accounted for by women and part‐time students, a trend that many educators think reflects some changes in directions at colleges and universities. There is a feeling that one logical world. Furthermore, in schools where the course is well taught, a wide variety of activities has developed in which the students fan out into the community to take a close look at specific systems, often with constructive results in improvement of the environment. There are three basic problems in such an educational venture, however. First, the science teachers have usually been trained in the classical disciplines (physics or chemistry). This course—and more recent curriculum developments in environmental or consumer problems—is based on ideas and viewpoints taken from a range of fields: computers, systems, operations research, and information theory. No Simple Solutions Second, the course deals with problems that often have no simple solution. In developing an energy conservation policy, for example, there is no obviously optimum strategy for this country or for a particular town. The typical science or math teacher is accustomed to material where there is only one correct answer, one best way to solve the problem. But, in this course, the students often know as much about an application of the concepts as the teacher knows. The wellrun classroom tends to be an open discussion, in which the teacher's role is to guide the of the areas of greatest potential for future enrollment expansion is among adults — working men and women and housewives who have decided to return to school. Educational programs are being revised to meet the needs of such students and class schedules and prerequisites are becoming more flexible. Two‐year community colleges continued this year to be the fastest growing sector of higher education. Such institutions are often conveniently located, inexpensive to attend and undemanding in admissions require flow of ideas, rather than to lecture. Finally, the project has selected one set of concepts and the associated analysis methods as the entree to technological literacy. These concepts have previously been taught only at undergraduate and graduate levels of science. As these ideas are brought down to a level appropriate for non‐science majors, there has to be a concern by the teacher that he may be giving students a false sense of knowledge. For example, it is easy to criticize the Romanian Government for the birth‐rate explosion in 1967 but such criticism should not be taken too seriously unless one studies in detail the political and social life of that period in that country. A central objective of the course is to teach the students to be wary of simplistic solutions to important socio‐technological problems. Yet, the more such problems are included within our educational programs, the greater the pressure to be simplistic. There are no simple solutions to big problems. But if we are to come even close to solving them, all of us have got to try to understand the world that man has built. Dr. Trexal is dean of the College of Engineering of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I. ments. Even at such colleges, however, it was among the part‐time students, not the full‐time students, that enrollment increased the most. The cost of going to college, which is higher at private institutions because of their steeper tuition charges, continues to affect the growth pattern. Enrollment growth at private colleges and universities is creeping along at an even slower pace than at public institutions, and if it’ were not for a whopping increase in parttime students the private institutions would be in even worse shape in terms of enrollment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Associate Justice Bork?,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/17/archives/associate-justice-bork.html,"The public knows of Robert H. Bork as the bearded Yale Law School professor whom President Nixon appoint. ed as Solicitor General; and who moved up to the post of Acting Attorney General when Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson resigned, and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus refused to obey the order of his commander in chief to fire Archibald Cox. Mr. Bork was supposed to have caught the President's attention when he was one of the few academics who came to the defense of the President's antibusing bill. A lawyer of dazzling abilities, he was the author of the Justice Department memorandum that helped to seal the fate of Spiro T. Agnew as Vice President by arguing that only the President—and not the Vice President—is immune from criminal prosecution. Mr. Bork served his commander in chief well as Acting Attorney General and as the outstanding legal brain. truster of the Nixon inner circle. But now that William B. Saxbe has been sworn in as the President's fourth Attorney General, Mr. Bork can give his full attention to the post of Solicitor General, the third‐ranking officer in the Justice Department. The office of Solicitor General has traditionally been one of special distinction, generally characterized by certain measure of independence from the political side of the Justice Department. Past Solicitors General, Republican as well as Democratic, have occasionally demonstrated this independence by advocating positions before the Supreme Court at variance with the views of the Administration. Solicitor General Simon E. Sobeloff, during the Eisenhower Administration, refused to sign his name to a Government brief defending the security‐risk program. President Johnson's Solicitor General, Thurgood Marshall, “confessed error” in a large number of cases in which illegal wiretapping was discovered. And Mr. Nixon's first Solicitor General, Erwin N. Griswold, publicly clashed with Gen. Lewis B. Hershey by filing a brief that opposed the Selective Service System's practice of punitively reclassifying young men who protested against the Vietnam war and the draft. President Nixon has little reason to fear any such kicking up of heels by his new Solicitor General. He has found in Mr. Bork someone who may be expected to encourage the four Nixon‐appointed justices on the United States Supreme Court to continue to revise downward the civil‐liberties accomplishments of earlier decisions. In an article in The Indiana Law Journal, Mr. Bork expresses the view that the First Amendment protects only what he calls “explicitly political speech.” He wrote: “There is no basis for prejudicial intervention to protect any other form of expression, be it scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or pornographic.” And regarding political speech, he rejects the classical Holmes‐Brandeis “clear and present danger test” as mere rhetoric. He would allow legislatures to penalize any advocacy of violation of the law—not acts, but advocacy—regardless of the constitutionality of the law or the remoteness of any danger. Presumably this would have included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s advocady of peaceful violation of segregation laws. In an article written for Fortune magazine, Mr. Bork admonishes President William J. McGill of Columbia for having proposed rules to effect orderly change on college campuses. According to Mr. Bork, student distrust of university administrations reflects “paranoid feelings” and is “usually without objective justification.” One wonders how he feels about Kent State and Jackson State. Moreover, he opposes bringing to the courts such issues as “abortion statutes, the death penalty, environmental issues, the rights of women, the Vietnam war,” since in his view these are questions for the political process, and going to court means seeking an “authoritarian” solution. It is hard to imagine a worse nightmare than a vacancy occurring on the non‐Nixon side of the Supreme Court and Mr. Bork's being selected as the fifth Nixon justice, The Court would then remain as a legacy of the Age of Nixon for many years after Mr. Nixon himself had been repudiated by the American people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Belgian Government Collapses As Iran Cancels Oil Project,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/19/archives/belgian-government-collapses-as-iran-cancels-oil-project-belgian.html,"BRUSSELS, Jan. 18—The coalition Government of Belgium collapsed today after the National Iranian Oil Company announced that it was pulling out of a joint project to build &refinery near Liege. Premier Edmond Leburton said after a Cabinet session that he would hand in the resignation of the Government to King do alit, The loctialistChris rAiberal coalition Government had come into power last Jan. 25.  The controversial refinery project had the strong support of the Socialist meinbers of the Government, led by the Preinier, who considered it vital to give the Government a foothold in the privately owned Belgian oil industry. But politicians in both the Flemish Christian and the Liberal parties attacked the plan as uneconomical. Wednesday morning, after an all‐night Cabinet session, the Government said it would accept the project on the condition that new guarantees were obtained from Iran on the price and on the supply of oil for the refinery. A preliminary contract had been signed last December by the Belgian Government and the Iranian company. The Iranians had set Jan. 15th as a deadline for a decision on the Projeet After two confusing days, the Belgian Government received a message from Teheran today Saying that the deal was off. Some sources here said that Iran had been irked by the Belgian failure to meet the deadline. The reason cited by Iran was that the conditional approval given by the Belgians made too many new demands. The news of the cancellation stunned the Belgian leaders, who had planned to travel to Teheran to obtain the needed guarantees about the refinery. Belgian Leaders Stunned Premier Leburton held a twohoar discussion with the King this afternoon and afterward the fine Socialist ministers of the Government to abandon the coalition. At a late night news conference, Mr. Leburton said: “We have conrirmed that the project has create3 a division among the parties which puts into doubt the basic accord we reached at the start. We have therefore drawn the proper conclusion.” Most observers In Belgium believed the next step would be to call elections, although Mr. Leburton would not confirm this tonight. The Socialists have said, however, they would not form a new Government with the Flemish Christian party, which makes a new vote almost inevitable. Besides the refinery project the Socialists and their partners had also faced hard decisions on the Wires of abortion liberalization and of giving new powers to Belgian‐language regions. Observers believe these issues will also play a big role In a future election. The refinery project in the Liege region in eastern Belgium was conceived by Socialists from the area as a means to stimulate the economic growth of the depressed region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mental Effect of Abortion Called Mild,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/21/archives/mental-effect-of-abortion-called-mild.html,"A study of the psychological effects of abortion, in which women undergoing abortions were compared before and after with women having babies, has shown that abortion is no more traumatic — and may be less so — than giving birth. The authors of the study, who were all at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Center for Social Studies in Human Reproduction at Baltimore when it was done, concluded that they “strained at a camel and swallowed a gnat” in looking for differences between the groups of patients studied. The “few differences” they found indicate that an early abortion by suction may be “more therapeutic than carrying a pregnancy to term,” the authors added in a report published in the current issue of Family Planning Perspectives. The findings run counter to the long‐standing myth that women undergoing abortion often suffer long‐term psychological consequences. But the results support previous, less precise findings of earlier studies that indicated that women rarely experienced anything more serious than mild, short‐lived depression after an abortion. Earlier studies either failed to measure the women's psy chological state both before and after the abortion or did not compare abortion with having a baby. In the Johns Hopkins study, women scheduled to undergo an early abortion by suction, late abortion by salting‐out and full‐term birth (38 in each group) were matched for socio‐economic status, number of living children, age, race and marital status. Before the medical procedure, each woman was interviewed, for an hour and a half and each took tests to measure her sense of social integration and self‐esteem. Thirteen to 16 months after the abortion or birth, the women were reinterviewed and retested. The follow‐up tests also included al personality inventory and a test of psychosomatic symptoms. In the follow‐up study, patients giving birth scored somewhat higher on the “paranoia” measure than the abortion patients. Women who underwent suction abortion had fewer psychosomatic complaints afterward than either those who had a late abortion or those who had a baby. But there were no differences among the groups —either before or after the procedures — in measures of their sense of social integration or self‐esteem. Nor did any of the procedures make any difference in the women's sexual practices. attitudes and enjoyment, in their marital happiness or relationships with their parents. The only significant change that occurred concerned the women's use of effective contraception. More than a year after the abortion or birth, more than 70 per cent of the women said they used either the pill or intrauterine device consistently, whereas half had used these methods at any time before their pregnancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nixon's ‘New Majority’ Seems Shattered for Him and the G.O.P,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/21/archives/nixons-new-majority-seems-shattered-for-him-and-the-g-op-straw-poll.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 20—At his second inauguration a year ago, President Nixon still enjoyed being compared with Franklin Delano Roosevelt as coalition builder, an architect of realignment in American politics. The importance of 1972, he had told Theodore H. White, the campaign chronicler, was that it had “shifted allegiances” in the South, among workingmen and Catholics. He’ had. won unusual Repulican majorities among union members, manual workers and.voters with grade‐school educations the rank and file of Mr. Nixon's middle America. “The new majority,” the President told Mr. White, “was what this election was all about.” Now, at the start of a new election year, the new majority appears shattered by , White House scandals, inflation and the oil shortage. It is gone, clearly, not only.for President Nixon, whose popularity has dropped 41 points in the Gallup Poll since the start of 1973, but also for his party — the choice now of less than a quarter of the American electorate. The new‐majority converts to the Nixon coalition in 1972 were the first to leave it in 1973. Most of them still call themselves Democrats. And most of them are inclined to vote Democratic this year in what pollsters project as a historic sweep of Congressional races, if the current mood holds. Straw Poll The puzzle for analysts is a national straw poll by Louis Harris late last month ‘ that shOwed Gerald R. Ford, the Republican Vice President, leading Democratic Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Henry M. Jackson of Washington in soundings about the 1976 Presidential campaign. Does that mean, as some Republicans argue, that the new majority is intact, in hiding? Does the poll reflect rather the political harmony and favorable publicity that attended Mr. Ford's confirmation last fall? Is it more important that Mr. Ford's voting record through 25 years in the House of Representatives was conservative, or little known? Most important, does Mr. Ford symbolize continuity with Nixon Administration policies or a departure from Nixon scandals? Those are the questions confronting political strategists trying to discover whether a “new” new majority, will emerge in Presidential politics. But there is a base of evidence that the “old” new majority is dead. First, with respect to Mr. Nixon, the decline of his popularity is steepest among the new‐majority groups he courted and won in 1972. The Gallup Pall found that among Catholics, approval of Mr. Igixon’ dropped from 71 per cent to 22 per cent during 1973—down almost to the small share of the’ Catholic vote that Mr. Nixon won in 1960 against John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic President. Among labor union members and their families, another newmajority target in 1972, Mr. Nixon's approval has dropped from 61 per cent to 20 per cent in the last year. George Meany, the labor leader, who was neutral in the President's last campaign, is now calling for Mr. Nixon's impeachment. And among independent voters, a mobile, rapidly growing group that includes conservative former Democrats and liberal former Republicans, Mr. Nixon's approval has dropped from 73 per cent to 25 per cent. Second, with respect to party identification, the Gallup Poll has reported that voters who call themselves Republicans are down, after a four‐point drop last year, to 24 per cent of the electorate, the smallest share for a major. party in this century. Far from “the emerging Republican majority” that Kevin P. Phillips, a conservative analyst, divined in the Nixon victory of 1968; the Republican party now seems to be contracting on an aging, white Anglo‐Saxon Protestant base. In Illinois, for example, in the latest examination by Market Opinion Research of Detroit, a polling company that works mainly for Republican candidates, only 22 per cent of a statewide sample labeled itself Republican. Among those Republicans, according to Robert M. Teeter, president of ‐the researeh agency, ,a quarter are over 65 years old; half are over 50; three‐quarters are over 40. By race, 98.5 per. cent are white. In contrast, 87 per cent of the electorate are white. Only 27 per cent belong to unionmember families. About BO per cent, are ‘Protestants (58 per cent is the statewide figure) and about 80 per cent are homeowners, 9 points higher than the state total. Third, with respect to political choices, voters appear to be turning sharply against the Republicans. A Gallup Poll late last year found that Democ rats were favored over Republicans for election to Congress by 58 per cent to 30 per cent. A national survey by Louis Harris found a 53 to 31 per cent split in favor of Democratic candidates for Congress, the largest margin is a decade of Harris surveys. Survival of the Nixon “new majority” in Presidential politics is debatable. To some of the Republican tacticians who organized the “new majority” campaigns of 1970 and 1972, Vice President Ford's lead in the Harris straw poll confirms their old analysis that, as one said: “If we have an attractive candidate who's conservative on the social issue, the new middle‐Class, traditionally Democratic vote will go Republican.” In the White House, Patrick J. Buchanan, a speech writer, says, “It's oversimplifying it to say the new majority was adding Southern Protestants and Northern Catholics to the solidi Republican base, but that's a significant portion of it, and it's still out there.” Opposition to Abortion Charles W. Colson concurs, and if he were shaping Gerald Ford's appeal to that new majority, as he did for President Nixon, he would urge the Vice President to stress his opposition to abortion and his support for aid to parochial schools, as Mr. Nixon did in 1972. To many other analysts, including Mr. Teeter,. who did the polling for the Nixon campaign in 1972, the “new majority” was ‐a dubititis description to begin with and is unlikely to be reconstituted as a political coalition. Presidential races will mostly be close battles ‘between “two minority parties” over a volatile middle group of voters, contends Richard M. Scammon, the political statistician and writer. Even if the second Nixon term had prospered, Mr. Scammon believes, the class identification” with the Democratic party would have prevented Mr. Nixon from consolidating a new majority for the Republicans. Louis Harris, the pollster, is sure that the Nixon majority in 1972 was never the “new majority,” as described. Mr. Nixon's strongest appeal, the Harris surveys found, was in foreign policy where the emphasis of Mr. Nixon's trip to China and detente with the Russians was change, not conservatism. On economics and the “social issue,” including forced school busing, Mr. Nixon did not have majority approval at election time, Mr. Harris asserts. Mr. Harris adds that “new majority” elements, like union members and aging ethnics, are shrinking fractions. Union members that formed 23 per cent of the vote in 1966 will be only 5 per cent of the vote in 1976, he writes in his new book, “The Anguish of Change.” Mr. Harris believes that year of Watergate shocks has hastened the rearrangement of symbols and issues in American politics. “When a candidate runs a law‐and‐order campaign today, people think: ‘chances are he'll turn out to be crook.'” “In 1967,” Mr. Harris observed in an interview, “subIstantial majorities of our sample‐60 to 75 per cent—thought the following people were ‘dangerous or harmful to the country:’ people who didn't believe in God, black militants, student demonstrators, prostitutes, homosexuals. In the fall of 1975 we couldn't find a ma jority to say that any one of those groups was dangerous. “Today,” he continued, “the people considered ‘dangerous’ by a majority of Americans are these: people who hire political spies (52 per cent); generals who conduct secret bombing raids (67 per cent); politicians who engage in secret wiretapping , (71 per cent); businessmen who make illegal political contributions (81 per cent); and politicians who try to use the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service for political purposes or to try to restrict freedom (88 per cent). “That,” Mr. Harris said, “is what has happened In America.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Italians Campaign on Repeal of Divorce,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/22/archives/italians-campaign-on-repeal-of-divorce-government-divided.html,"ROME, Jan. 21—Campaigning has begun for Italy's referendum on repeal of the three‐year‐old law permitting divorce. Houses all over Rome are covered with such slogans as “Family, yes—divorce, no!” and “Divorce plus abortion equals cancer.” Supporters of divorce are holding rallies and distributing handbills to denounce as a “provocation” the drive by ‘conservative Roman Catholics and neo‐Fascists to repeal the divorce statute. The nationwide vote on whether to repeal the legalization of divorce is expected to be held late in April or in May. The tensions that will inevitably result from the referendum could bring down the sixmonth‐old Government of Premier Mariano Rumor. Government Divided The Premier's own Christian Democrats, Italy's strongest party, have always been opposed to divorce. But their three allies in the present Government—the Socialist, Social Democratic and Republican parties—are fighting against repeal. Efforts to stave off the referendum on the ground that it will be dangerously divisive have been conducted for several months and were stepped up recently. Saturday, however, spokesmen for the major political parties said that negotiations on avoiding the vote had failed. The divorce battle appears to be particularly distasteful to the Communist party, the nation's second largest. The Communists, who voted for the divorce bill in Parliament, are afraid that the referendum may split their membership. The Communist leadership fears that many women in the party will disobey its orders and vote against divorce. A top Communist, Giorgio Amendola, has publicly admitted that the party is worried about the votes of millions of women in Southern Italy whose husbands have gone away in search of jobs and who are afraid of being abandoned. The Communist party is also embarrassed by the referendum because it runs counter to the party's avowed policy of seeking‐ governmental collaboration with the church‐supported Christian Democrats. The Communists have for years avoided attacking the Vatican. Some Christian Democrats are also perplexed, mainly because their only ally among political parties in the divorce battle is the Italian Social Movement ‐ National Right Wing, the parliamentary arm of neo‐Fascism. Even some priests have publicly declared that they are against the referendum, and part of the church hierarchy is known to be unenthusiastic about it. The Vatican has consistently opposed the introduction of divorce in Italy, and has apparently prevailed upon the Christian Democratic party to go ahead with the referendum on repeal. The neo‐Fascist party is fighting divorce for tactical reasons rather than for ideological ones. It hopes that the referendum will strengthen conservative currents within the Christian Democratic party and the church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOTH SIDES PRESS ABORTION VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/23/archives/both-sides-press-abortion-views-demonstrations-are-held-by.html,"The first anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion on demand was marked yesterday by demonstrations for both sides of the dispute. In Washington, more than 6,000 representatives of antiabortion groups converged on the Capitol, spending the morning trying to talk to Congressmen and the afternoon rallying on the steps of the building seeking support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Court's ruling. A proabortion church service held in the capital was attended by about 200 people. In New York, the National Organization for Women and a group called Catholics for a Free Choice staged separate demonstrations, the former at the East 45th Street office of Senator James L. Buckley, the New York Conservative Republican who has sponsored the constitutional amendment. Speech by Buckley At the time of the demonstration, Senator Buckley was in Washington, speaking at the antiabortion rally sponsored by the National March for Life Committee, a Washington‐based organization made up of many Right to Life groups. The demonstration, which drew people by the busload from all over the Northeast, had been planned since November, according to its chairman, Nellie J. Gray, a Washington lawyer. Many demonstrators said they had been designated as representatives of local Roman Catholic parishes or schools. The New York demonstrations included the “crowning” of a woman “Pope” on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Catholics for a Free Choice. The NOW demonstration included a street march in which some women were chained to symbolize what they called Senator Buckley's attempts to enslave women by unwanted childbirth. In Albany, a 45 year‐old salesman, Joseph O'Leary, was arrested and charged with herassmen after he allegedly ran up the steps of the State Capitol and tore up a placard in support of legal abortion held by two young women. The incident Interrupted a rally of 400 persons in support of a constitutional amendment negating the Supreme Court decision. Signatures Sought The antiabortionists, led by the Catholic Church, contend that abortion is murder. Car dinal Cooke, the Archbishop of New York, said in a speech yesterday that he felt legalizing abortion was leading to a more favorable climate for mercy killing; which he also opposes. The proabortion forces say that denying safe, legal abortions results in increased maternal deaths and child battering. The purpose of the Washington demonstration against abortion, its organizers said, was to get Representatives to sign a petition of discharge, which would move a House version of the Buckley amendment out of the Judiciary Committee without a vote of the committee membership. The signatures of 218 Representatives, a majority of the House, are needed to effect such an action. The proabortionists were demonstrating to keep their point of view before the public. Complacency by abortion advoeates was blamed for the passage of a 1972 bill that would have repealed New York's liberal law if Nelson A. Rockefeller, then the Governor, had not refused to sign it. Resistance to Decision “The Right to Life people have not accepted the Supreme Court decision and continue to press to resist it, subvert it and to turn it back,” a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of New York City, Inc., said yesterday. “We felt that abortion as a right had been established fairly by the Supreme Court as the last word,” she said “We felt the job of the pro abortion people was to go ahead and get services and make them available so that the option was not just words but tangible services for people who, wanted to use them. “Unfortunately, we have not been able to keep that as our goal.” Dr. Alan F. Guttinacher, president of Planned Parent hood of America, said of the demonstration in Washington: “Today's demonstration against the Supreme Court abortion decision is an attempt to make a public issue out of what the Court has determined in its historic ruling to be private matter.” “The quiet, unfolding history of legal abortion has been one of declining maternal death rates, declining hospital admissions for botched up abortions, declining out‐of‐wedlock, births,” he said. When the Supreme Court is sued its decision, only New York, Alaska, Hawail and Washington had laws that met the Court's standards. Since then, services have become more available around the cam try, but in an uneven pattern, a check of 12 cities by The New York Times showed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Truth in Labeling,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/24/archives/truth-in-labeling.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 23—One of Fred Allen's radio characters was an amnesiac who kept trying to remember who he was by the process of elimination. “Bduh, I don't carry an umbrella,” he would muse, “so I can't be Neville Chamberlain.” Few of us at that time caught Mr. Allen's subtle socio‐political message —that people tend to identify themselves in• terms of what they are net. Thus, many of us apply political labels like “liberal” or “conservative” to others, resisting the application of either label to ourselves, or permitting only a sister‐kissing label like “moderate,” which is a better description for drinkers than voters. There are those of left and right who proudly wear a label: For example, the true believers of the right are gathering in Washington this weekend at a political action conference. The conference is to be addressed by such right‐wingbacks as Gov. Ronald Reagan and Senator James Buckley. The trend toward self‐identification as “conservative” has not been stopped by the decline in the President's popularity or the Agnew scandal: When The New York Times surveyed New Yorkers in 1970, those who called themselves liberal outnumbered selfdescribed conservatives by 33 per cent to 27 per cent, with 31 per cent moderately sister‐kissing; the same poll conducted only two months ago showed crime‐conscious New Yorkers flip‐flopping those figures, with conservatives now decisively on top. Because the best way to sell candidacies is to attack the opposition, even people who accept the label “conservative” define it in terms of what they are against: coddling criminals, raising taxes, or what have you. Rarely do conservatives define their label, in terms of what they are for, and for a, seemingly good political reason: A fundamental’ split is built into conservatism. One side of conservatism emphasizes traditionalism, pernianent moral values, respect for institutions ,and order in society. The other side stresses libertarianism, individuality, and holds personal freedom to be the great value. These two sides of conservatism will agree on the need for self‐reliance; diversity, and for halting the growth of big government, and will ‘feel comfortable sallying forth together against the centralization of power. But the two sides of conservatism will tear up the turf in great doctrinal battles of their own: Most traditionalists will take positions against pornography, prostitution, drug usage and abortion, while many libertarians will argue those are matters for the individual to decide, not government. That is why William F. Buckley, in a fascinating new book, “Four Reforms,” can look at the increasing number of victims of crime and call for an end to what he considers the abuse of the Fifth Amendment by the accused—while a minority of other conservatives march in the opposite direction, calling for more protection of individual rights and an end to the growth of Federal police power. Conservatives in conclave have frequently derided the “zigzagging” of the New Federalists, who try to decentralize administration with one hand and to centralize welfare with the other. But the Right has not faced up to the challenge, and the opportunity, of examining the divergent forces inside conservatism's tent—which can be a great source of strength. Might it not be useful; for conservatives to open up their “movement,” to recognize conflicting causes within it, and encourage inwardly the same kind of diversity it espouses outwardly? In that spirit, like mothers sewing labels in clothing to accompany kids to camp, we could identify our political positions in the specific way that invites acquaintance and discussion. Labels could then cease to be onerous or fuzzy. “Libertarian conservatives” would then be able to gauge what they held in common with “Great Society disillusionees” and Malthusians could dance with Marcusians. Oxymorons would abound, as moderates exchanged their meaningless tags for something like “egalitarian elitist” or “pragmatic moral absolutist” or “principled opportunist.” Names are not things but nameless things do not communicate ideas: political labeling can serve a useful purpose, if we specifically identify our own line of thinking along with that of our opponents. My own label? I'm working on that, by identifying and eliminating alternatives. Conservative traditionalism is not for me, nor Galbraithian liberalism; New Federalism with an underpinning of libertarianism has its attractions. Sometimes I like to carry an umbrella. Maybe I'm Neville Chamberlain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kicking a Farm Habit,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/24/archives/kicking-a-farm-habit.html,"CHICAGO — The petroleum panic has prompted warnings that the nation's farmers will have insufficient chemical fertilizer this year. United States agriculture Is a big consumer of products that are oil‐ and petroleumbased such as fertilizer and pesticides, so there seems cause for concern. Some large‐scale farmers, however, are unworried. They are members of a growing group of American farmers and livestock men who have kicked the chemical habit. Ken Livermore of Valley, Neb., said he was glad to take time from his chores to talk about his adoption of organic farming‐that Is, agriculture without use of chemicals. “I got more than fifty bushels of soybeans to the acre this year, and my chemical neighbor only got 25 bushels,” he said. “Our land smells sweet again,” he exulted, and talked about how the earthworms, songbirds, pheasants and seagulls have returned to his place. “We have life on our farm again.” Mr. Livermore and a neighbor, Del Akerlund, switched to organic farming half a dozen years ago because they were seeing “blighted, sore spots on our land.” They had had to use everincreasing amounts of chemical fertilizer to try to keep their yields constant. “The ground is like an alcoholic,” Mr. Livermore said, “the more chemicals you use, the more you need to use.” Other Middle Western farmers cite a. variety of reasons for eliminating chemicals. “We thought these chemicals were harmful to the people who ate our food,” said Margaret DeBlauw who with her husband grows milo, corn, oats and alfalfa near Fordyce, Neb. Ralph Engelken is one of a dozen commercial organic farmers around Greeley, Iowa. He and his children broke out in painful skin rashes. “There was no choice for us. It was give up chemicals or get out of farming,” he said. The rashes disappeared after they switched to organic agriculture thirteen years ago. The Engelkens farm more than 700 acres on mostly hilly ground, averaging 125 bushels of corn to the acre, a considerably larger yield than most farmers in their county obtain on better land. But for the Engelkens and other organic farmers, the quality of their grains and meat is even more important than the quantity. Mr. Engelken said that the protein content of his corn was considerably higher than that of chemical farmers, that his cattle needed less of his organically grown grain and that they gained more weight on the reduced amounts they eat, and that his meat, corn and vegetables tasted much better. “Our veterinary bill has been nil since we stopped using chemicals. Our cows and sows don't have abortions like they used to,” Mr. Engelken said. “We raise fifty bulls a year and in the last twelve years, we've never had a sterile bull.” About 10 per cent of the bulls raised by “my chemical neighbors” are sterile, he said. “A lot of my neighbors laughed at me, and some were hostile, when I stopped using chemicals,” Mr. Engelken said. Now farmers drive up the dirt road to his prosperous place every week to see how he does it. The rising price of chemical fertilizer has led some farmers to examine the use of natural fertilizing methods: manure, fish oil, crop rotation and the plowing under of a cover crop as “green manure.” The inquiring farmers also learn how organic farmers rely on the natural balance of their fields and use natural predators, such as ladybugs, for insect control. The Middle Western organic farmers I have talked to in recent weeks cultivate big spreads and make their living from farming. Most sell their products at regular prices on the open market, rather than reap extra profits from selling to consumers who prefer natural foods. These organic farmers say that their fertilizer cost is much lower, that they have to do less work on their crops, and that their yields are as high or higher than those of chemical farmers. They say that more farmers would switch to organic methods if they could obtain reliable information on them from their county agents, state univer sities, farm organizations or from the press. An agricultural consultant in Iowa, Roger Blobaum, was skeptical about the commercial feasibility of largescale organic farming until he visited Ralph Engelken's and Del Akerlund's farms. “The organic farmer uses less fuel to till his land, and he doesn't need the large amounts of energy and petroleum that go into making fertilizers and pesticides,” Mr. Blobaum said. Even among many farmers who say they will never switch to organic techniques, there is a growing feeling that there has been indiscriminate use of chemicals on American soil. Farmers who are spurred by the oil shortage to rethink their methods may decide that they are not only the reapers of the land but also the stewards of their soil. If they do, they might even catch some of Mr. Livermore's contagious happiness: “When I learned I could farm without chemicals, it made my soul feel good.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Margaret Mead Puts Single Life in Perspective,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/25/archives/margaret-mead-puts-single-life-in-perspective.html,"The Barnard ‐Columbia Alumni Social Committee, a year‐old group referred to by some of its members as “the city's most intellectual singles club,” gathered the other night to hear one of the city's most intellectual singles, Dr. Margaret Mead. She told them, among other things, that this country's 43 milion single adults “are being tolerated by society right now because, on a whole, society does not want more children right now.” The 72‐year‐old, silverhaired anthropologist then went on to warn that the single life‐style would one day be frowned upon again, “the minute we get worried for fear that we don't have enough people. and its associated “demeaning singles bars.” “We were fed up with Fire Island, East Hampton and organization mixers,” said the group's president, Dr. Barbara Lovenheim, an assistant professor of English at Bernard Baruch College. “So we decided to set up a social group with an intellectual basis.” Dr. Mead, wearing a navy pants suit and carrying her familiar wood‐carved staff, likened the present singles situation with that of Europe in the Middle Ages. “They were terribly afraid of overpopulation in those days, too,” she said in the wood‐paneled Biddle Room. “Therefore, people could be single, and both men and women would consider seriously whether they wanted to get married, or go away and live in a monastery.” ance for the unmarried, single people were still being “punished” to a certain degree. “It's still hard for single people to live together, to get any kind of housing, or even a mortgage,” she said. “And there is still a belief that for a man to live with his mother, or a woman with her father, is pretty crippling.” The twice‐divorced anthropologist also touched on number of far‐ranging subjects, including: ¶Single mothers: “I think the single mother has a horrible time. For anybody who would elect it, I can't think what she's up to. I think that the women who are taking off with their children today because they're afraid of being left would be better off to stick around and get several more years of support.” (Apartment complexes for singles: “Dreadful. I understand they are devoted solely to future mating, and that women resent this rather heavily.” (Male friendships: “We are moving into a period where men are permitted to enjoy each other's company. In the past, society was very destructive to any male friendship. It was always expressed by that terrible bang on the back.” (Parenthood: “We are going to see many fewer parental families, and those we do see will be better families, because the people who are doing it are wanting to.” After the speech, club members mixed, mingled and met over drinks. The sex ratio appeared to be about 50‐50, and the age range from 25 to 40. So far, the group has had one marriage and “numerous liaisons” resulting from its parties, lectures and ski trips, according to Stephen Katz, a 35‐year‐old Manhattan printing executive. “At a group like this, women don't feel like they're pick‐ups,” said Susan Helper, a 28‐year‐old administrative assistant at the Guggenheim Museum. “Here there's another purpose, such as hearing Margaret Mead.” Margaret Mead knows the real purpose, however. Cannily, she had cut her question‐and‐answer session short, saying, “After all, people came here to meet each other.” And she, if anyone, ought to know. “And when that happens,” she said, flailing the air with her right hand, “women's rights will be immediately contravened again, and so, perhaps, will things like contraception and abortion.” Speaking on “Singles: Past and Present,” Dr. Mead addressed an overflow crowd of about 400 members of the social committee, who were meeting in, of all places, the Harvard Club, at 27 West 44th Street, because neither Barnard nor Columbia could come up with an adequate meeting room. The Barnard ‐Columbia Alumni Social Committee was formed last April by five disgruntled Barnard graduates who were tired of the traditional New York singles scene The nineteen‐fifties ushered in ‐what Dr. Mead called “an attack of matrimony” in this country. “There was absolute panic, with everybody getting married,” she said. “In those days, it was almost impossible for single people to live together. Girls who formed cooperative living arrangements, for example, had to explain how much they hated group living, and that they really wanted to get married.” Dr. Mead, who has degrees from both institutions involved in the singles club (B.A. from Barnard, Ph.D. from Columbia), and who is curator emeritus of ethnology. at the American Museum of Natural History, said ,that despite society's new toler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRS. CHESIMARD EXPECTS A CHILD,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/27/archives/mrs-chesimard-expects-a-child-lawyer-believes-pregnancy-will-delay.html,"Joanne D. Chesimard's lawyer confirmed reports yesterday that her client was pregnant and expressed the belief that Mrs. Chesimard's trial for the murder of a New Jersey state would be postponed.The lawyer Mrs. Evelyn Williams, declined to speculate nancy was or whether Mrs. Chesimard would seek an abortion or have her child. Mrs. Chesimard, 26 years old, is an alleged leader of the Black Liberation Army, which has been dscribed by the police as a loose amalgam of terrorists bent on assailing policemen. Her husband is Louis Chesimard, who was acquited last June after a Federal trial on bank robbery charges. Mrs. Chesimard is charged, along with Clark Squire, 37, with the murder last May of Trooper Werner Foerster on the New Jersey Turnpiqe in East Brunswick. Jury selection was postponed on Friday after Mrs. Chesimard became ill in her cell at the Morris County Jail in Morristown. N. J. Judge John E. Bachman adjourned the proceedings until 11 A.M. tomorrow, when he will receive reports from doc tors who examined Mrs. Chesi mard in her cell. The examining physicians !were Dr. E. Wyman Garrett, a gynecologist; Dr. Louis P. Cardi, a general practitioner, and Dr. Robert E. Davis, an obstetrician and gynecologist. Last month, Mrs. Chesimard and Fred Hilton were acquitted in Federal District Court here on charges of having robbed a Bronx bank of $3,700. Fourteen jurors have been selected so far for the 16member panel in New Jersey. Jury selection was switched to Morristown after attempts to pick a jury in New Brunswick failed. Mrs. Chesimard was moved to New Jersey on Dec. 28. She has been in police custody since last May. Because of frequent out bursts during the Manhattan trial, she and Mr. Hilton were detained in a “holding pen” outside the courtroom, where they listened to proceedings over a loudspeaker. During these periods they were guarded constantly by Federal marshals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
North Africa plans Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/27/archives/north-africa-plans-birth-control.html,"ALGIERS —North Africa, whose biggest production is people, is worried. Neither Tunisia, Algeria nor Morocco can handle her present population, let alone the big increases that come every year. Will Europe, now faced with economic recession, close its doors to all those who need to seek abroad the jobs they cannot find at home? At the moment, close to a million North Africans are working in Europe while their home countries struggle desperately to develop their economies so that all those old enough to work can do so at home. But even in Algeria, where development prospects are the brightest, population experts predict that until 1980, no sizable dent will have been made in the backlog of unemployment and underemployment. West Germany recently instituted a temporary halt on further entry of foreign labor. Relatively. few North Africans work there, but the measure was, nonetheless, seen as a sign of hard times to come. In France, where the hulk of Algerians, Tunisians and Moroccans have gone, a slowdown is forecast in 1974, with a consequent increase in unemploymet. Even though there may be no mass return to North Africa, it is feared that France could also cut off further entries. The dimming prospects In Europe have underscored the urgency of meeting the population problem at home. But differing ideologies and economic outlooks have meant different approaches. With capitalist economies and few internal financial resources, Morocco and Tunisia are promoting foreign investment in job‐creating industries. Both. have formulated liberal investment codes giving big tax advantages and other facilities to outsiders. Algeria's Socialist‐oriented Government has kept foreign investment at a relatively low level, confining it mainly to oil exploration where foreign techniques are needed. Meanwhile, with’ the oil they already have, with the naturalgas reserves that are now being developed and with sizable foreign loans, the Algerians are creating a state‐managed industry on a scale previously unknown in the Arab world. But North Africa's population is increasing at an average rate of some 2.8 per cent annually, creating huge budgetary demands for housing, education and health, and to a large extent nullifying economic progress. Partly because her resources and development prospects are the poorest, Tunisia has emphasized population‐growth limits much more than Algeria and Morocco, Less bound by centuries of Islamic tradition, which sees a blessing in large families, than other Arab leaders, President Habib Bourguiba has, in fact, made Tunisia a pioneer in the Arab world in the field of birth control, The most spectacular example came last September when Tunisia legalized unrestricted abortion and made it available without charge in public clinics, one of the few countries in the world to do so. Population control has now become an integral part of economic planning under a semi‐autonomous office. A birth‐control policy had been in effect for more than 10 years, but results were only modest until now because of bad organization, lack of per sonnel and lack of information. Without such controls, it is believed that Tunisia's population would increase from the present 5.5 million to 13 million by 2000. With planning, it is hoped to restrict the total to 10 million. In the meantime, Tunisia is able to generate only 30,000 new jobs a year, against 50,000 new job needs. Consequently, 200,000 Tunisians are in Europe and in booming Libya. Algeria is curiously traditionalist in matters affecting women and’ the family, despite the revolutionary talk one hears. Population control has not been openly promoted, and President Houarj Boumediene has, indeed, deprecated such efforts, saying that they have not worked anywhere up to now. The official thesis is that with development, the population increase, now put at 3.4 per cent annually will slow down naturally as it has in industrialized, countries. The President has also said that Algeria could easily support a population of 20.million, but it, may go, to twice that by the end of the cen tiry, If the present growth rate remains unchecked. But despite the official reticence, birth control is being practiced in Algeria, albeit with no publicity. Some 170,000 women are said to be taking the pill, and the program as a whole is presented as a health measure, part of the services that are devoted to the protection of mothers and children. Some 450,000 workers are in France. The Government has proclaimed as its goal their repatriation, but with a million unemployed or underemployed at home, such a mass return is not for tomorrow, even with frequently recurring anti‐Arab incidents in France. In remittances alone, French jobs mean some $300‐million a year in badly needed foreign exchange. Officially, Morocco has 350,000 workers abroad, many more if clandestine workers are included, In 1973 they were estimated by King Hassan 2d to have sent back some $230‐million. But the population pressures at home are still enormous and were a big factor in the program begun in 1973 to recover foreign‐owned lands. Population growth is estimated at 2.7 to 3 percent, and the present total of 16.3 million is expected to grow to almost 26 million by 1990, even assuming that contraceptives come into general use. Because there is much hostility of a religious and nationalistic nature, birth control has not been pushed by the Government, rather the task of enlisting public support has been left in private hands and these groups have not operated to any great extent in the rural areas, where the bulk of the population lives. Where facilities are available, they are said to be readily accepted, as is the case throughout North Africa. Officials say that with better health facilities and education, a “social conscience” will develop and slow down the birth rate. In the years before such a conscience takes hold, Morocco is threatened with a steadily increasing unemployment problem, aggravated by the steady move from farm to city, unless investment is vastly stepped up in both;industrial and rural development If the European safety valve Were to be cut oft Morocco, like Algeria and Tunisia, would face critical moments before things got better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Albany, the Women Show Their Strength",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/29/archives/in-albany-the-women-show-their-strength-snickers-disappear-need-to.html,"ALBANY—Two weeks into the new legislative session may seem a bit early to be spotting trends, but there is one development here so‐sudden and dramatic that it has taken the normally slowstarting state capital almost completely by surprise. Women have become good politics in New York State. On the first working day of the session two weeks ago, a bill that repealed the requirement for someone other than the victim to corroborate an act of rape sailed through the Assembly without a dissenting word or vote. The passage—approval in the State Senate is virtually assured—came after years of defeats and compromises that had made obtaining a conviction for rape almost impossible in the state. It also followed five months of intensive campaigning by the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus and Women Against Rape that culminated in almost a day of testimony before the Senate and Assembly Codes Committees. Snickers Disappear “It was a magnificent job,” said Assemblyman Alvin M. Suchin, a Westchester Republican who was the bill's chief sponsor and who had tried for four years to repeal the corroboration requirement. Mr. Suchin recalled that when he first introduced a repeal bill in 1970, his colleagues would snicker in the elevators and tell him that “I was opening the door to a lot of false rape accusations.” This year, Mr. Suchin heard not a snicker. “I'm sure there's still a trace of male chauvinism in the legislature,” he said mildly, “but it's now become impolitic to express it.” In addition to disposing of a law that more and more women had come to regard as unjust and discriminatory, the assembly's 130 to 0 vote on the rape bill gave a tremendous psychological lift to the small but growing women's lobby in the state capital. “It was a thoroughly good political experience,’ said Norma Kraus, a member of the Manhattan Caucus who was an active lobbyist for the bill. “It showed us what we can do, and showed the legislators that women are a credible constituency with which they can deal — and have to deal.” Young as the women's movement is, the movement as a political force is younger still. Only in the last two years have women, many of them taking time off from work, paying their own expenses, and learning their own way around, begun to join the stream of well‐paid, established—and almost entirely male — lobbyists who travel regularly to Albany to press their cases. Need to Be Heard One of the first was Barbara Shack, assistant director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who had made frequent trips to Albany to lobby on civil liberties issues. “I met so many professional lobbyists who were preempting everyone's time that I realized that if women didn't organize to deliberately create an impact, no one would ever hear us,” she said. In 1972—the Legislature's almost successful attempt to repeal the state's liberalized abortion law was the big feminist issue that year—Barbara Shack and Ross Graham, a legislative assistant to State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, compiled an index of the legislators votes on issues of importance to women. Called “How Did They Vote on Women's Rights?’ the index will be prepared again this year and distributed on behalf of the Women's Political Caucus and the National Organization for Women. “The index creates instant responsiveness because the legislators know people are watching,” Barbara Shack said. ‘Tuesdays in Albany” But the Assemblymen and Senators should know they are being watched long before the end of the session. The New York State Women's Political Caucus, in the movement's first regular lobbying effort here, has organized “Tuesdays in Albany.” Every week, two or more women, drawn from a pool of several dozen, will come to the capital to lobby on specific bills. Roberta Welner, the legislative coordinator for the state caucus, initiated Tuesdays in Albany earlier this month with a schedule that left her barely time for a cup of coffee, let alone a leisurely expense‐account lunch at one of the Albany restaurants favored by lobbyists and their friends. Her day began with a three‐hour trip on the 7 A. M. bus from Manhattan, where she works as a freelance writer and political consultant. At 10:30, she was in the office of Senator Leon E. Giuffreda to talk about the rape bill soon to come before the Senate. At 11 o'clock, she talked about a gay‐rights bill with the counsel to Senator H. Douglas Barclay, chairman of the Senate Codes Committee. At 11:30, she met with Assemblyman Eugene Levy on the question of providing workmen's compensation coverage for pregnancy‐related disabilities. At noon, she went to the office of Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, a newly‐elected Staten Island Democrat, to welcome her as the seventh woman in the 210 ‐member State Legislature. Thirty minutes later, she talked to an aide to Senator Bernard G. Gordon, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, about ending the automatic exemption for women from jury duty. Busy Afternoon At 1 P.M., she met with Assemblyman Lucio F. Russo, chairman of the Assembly Banking Committee, on prohibiting discrimination in credit. At 1:30, she talked to Assemblyman Joseph M. Reilly, chairman of the Assembly Labor Committee, about labor bills of interest to women. At 3 o'clock, she met with Assemblyman John G. McCarthy, chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, on including housewives in no‐fault insurance benefits, presently based on earned income. Finally, the day was over. “By coming back week af ter week,” Roberta Weiner said, “we tell them not only that we're here, but that we're here to stay. We're not here to scare anybody. I try to tell a legislator why a bill would be good for him. The most threatening thing I can say is that we'll be back.” Jane. Small Sanford, a tax accountant who describes herself as the “chief noodge” of the Albany Women's Political Caucus, has turned the ground floor of her nearby townhouse into a caucus office. She and several other Albany women will meet every Friday to review the legislative index and the calendar for the coming week and set up appointments for the lobbyists. What About Tomorrow? This month, the Albany caucus mailed to each legislator a list of the state caucus's 12 legislative priorities. These are the issues Roberta Weiner lobbied on, and include child care, unrestricted sale of contraceptives, a state equal rights amendment, an end to discrimination in job interviews, free access by both girls and boys to all school courses and facilities, and cominunity property rights in marriage. “The rape bill was fine, it was the logical thing for them to give us,” Mrs. Sanford said. “But let's not get carried away. What are they going to do for us tomorrow?” If the legislative accomplishments of the women's lobby so far have been less than overwhelming, the lobbyists all agree the the change in atmosphere has come surprisingly fast in the notoriously slow‐moving legislature. “It's an absolutely, extraordinary change,” Barbara Shack said. “At first it was hard even to get appointments. Now they know they can't ignore us. We're 53 per cent of the state, and they know it.” When Roberta Weiner tried to persuade one legislator to support a bill allowing contraceptives to be sold to those under 16, one of the caucus priorities, the lawmaker demurred on the grounds that “it's an election year.” “That's a two‐way street, you know,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assembly's Debate to Be Shown Over State Public TV Network,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/31/archives/assemblys-debate-to-be-shown-over-statepublic-tvnetwork-mrs-wilson.html,"TRENTON, Jan. 30 — New Jersey's state legislative proceedings will be opened to the state's public television network tomorrow, beginning with the debate on rules changes scheduled for 2 P.M. in the General Assembly. The Assembly session will be videotaped by New Jersey Public Television Authority cameras and then telecast over the authority's four “Jerseyvision” channels that cover the state at 8 P.M. Other programs will be televised live from the legislafive chambers or committee rooms, according to present plans. About 10 other states allow some form of television coverage of their legislatures, and New Jersey's decision to allow the state's public television authority into legislative sessions and hearings was based in part on what was described as the “highly successful” telecasts of the Connecticut legislature, which began in the 196869 legislative session. Senate Is Receptive The announcement of the public television arrangement was made jointly by the Rev. S. Howard Woodson Jr., the Speaker of the Assembly, and Dr. Lawrence T. Frymire, executive director of the state Public Television Authority. that he had “informally” notified the television agency that the upper chamber at its hearings would also be open to its The Senate president, Frank J. Dodd, an Essex County Democrat, said in an interview Senator Dodd added that he had given the authority “virtually carte blanche permission,” but urged it to use its discretion by limiting its telecasts to “issues of real public interest,” such as the income tax, abortion and the environment. “A rules committee debate would be about as interesting to the public as watching paint dry,” he remarked. Mr. Woodson nevertheless said that “the citizens of our great state have the right to see and hear what is happening in their state capital for themselves, and our statewide television now provides us with the vehicle with which to make it possible.” Mrs. Wilson Gets Credit Mrs. Betty Wilson, Democrat of Union and Morris Counties and the majority whip in the Assembly, was credited by Mr. Woodson, a Democrat, with having played a major role, in arranging for the project through negotiations with Douglas Leonard, programming director for the public TV network. She also saw the development as “opening up the process of government.” “Most people can't get to Trenton, but they can turn on their television set,” she said. At least one high official of the state government, however had reservations about the prospect of turning the legislative chambers and committee hearing rooms virtually into television studios. “My God!” she exclaimed “Can you imagine what some of those members are going to be like if they know they're on television?”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Senate Cuts Off Filibuster on Legal Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/31/archives/senate-cuts-off-filibuster-on-legal-aid.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30—The Senate voted today to cut off debate on legislation that would create a public corporation to operate the legal services program for the poor now in the expiring Office of Economic Opportunity. The vote was 68 to 29, three more than the two‐thirds majority needed to limit debate in the Senate. Two previous efforts to halt a filibuster against the legislation had fallen short in December. It was only the 15th time in 82 attempts that the Senate had successfully invoked closure since the rule was adopted in 1917. The first successful vote involved the 1919 debate on the Versailles Treaty. Ten of the votes have come in the last decade as Senators have increasingly lost patience with the filibuster. Although opponents of the program for legal assistance for the poor technically have an hour of debate apiece left, final passage appears likely tomorrow, after the most serious of some 100 pending amendments have been disposed of. The White House was reportedly instrumental in providing enough Republican votes to assure closure. Melvin R. Laird, counsel to the President, personally reached some Senators last night, and the Republican divided 24 to 17 in favor of limiting debate. Democratic senators voted 44 to 12 for closure. There had been some concern that President Nixon's expressed support for continuing the legal services program was more apparent that real Suppprtera of the program now expect the White House to press for final approval of the more restrictive version of the bill passed by the House last June. The Senate bill will have to be compromised in conference with the House measure, which places more limits on the kinds of activity permissible for legal services attorneys in their representation of poor clients. The program has become controversial in many sections of the country where activist lawyers have brought suits financed by Federal funds, against the local business and political establishment. Calling White House support “indispensable,” Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, said the closure vote demonstrated that there was Senate support for antipoverty programs and that the members “will be vigilant against any abuse of the filibuster power.” Senator Javits is sponsor of the bill. Before recessing this afternoon, the Senate adopted without opposition a prohibition against legal services attorneys helping any client obtain an abortion if it is contrary to the individual's “religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Supporters of the legislation defeated, 56 to 36, an attempt by its opponents to write a terminal date of June 30, 1978, into the program. This would have required Congress to approve an extension before that time to keep the corporation alive. Sponsors of the measure also agreed to accept an amendment limiting to two years in advance the period for which Congress can make appropriations for the program. The Senate bill calls for funding the corporation with $71.5‐million for the 1974‐75 fiscal year, $90‐million for 1975‐76 and $100‐million for 1976‐77 and thereafter. When it began operations in 1966, the legal services program cost $26‐million. According to the Senate bill, the corporation would have an 11‐member board of directors, all appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At least six must be lawyers, and no more than six could be members of the same political party. Legal services lawyers would be prohibited from engaging in political activity and from participating in or encouraging any demonstration, picketing, boycott or strike, They would also be barred from lobbying except when representing a client's legal rights or when requested to appear by a legislative body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPATE COMPLETES PLAN ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/01/archives/state-completes-plan-on-abortion-proposals-are-expected-to-allow.html,"TRENTON, Jan. 31—The State Department of Health anpounced today it had completed its proposals for licensing abortion facilities for pregnancies in their first three months. The proposals, which will no?? be effective until the end of April at the earliest, call for allowing seven applicants to seek licenses for health clinics. The seven have already applied. The licenses are essential for Medicaid reimbursement for the poor; only hospitals are now licensed. The action by the state is considered to be a major step in unraveling the bureaucratic entanglement that has prevented legal abortions from being performed in New Jersey in health clinics, where costs run substantially lower than in hospitals. Thousands of Operations In the one year since the United States Supreme. Court ruling prohibiting any state from interfering with first trimester abortions, about half of New Jersey's hospitals have performed tens of thousands of abortions at a cost of about $375 each, according to a Health Department spokesman. The exact number is not known. In addition, a much smaller number of abortions are being performed in private physicians' offices at a charge of about $150 or less. To date, efforts to establish clinics in New Jersey that can perform low‐cost abortions, many of them for the poor, have been stalled by the state's failure to license health‐care facilities. The proposed Health Department regulations would require clinics to have access to hospital not less than 10 minutes away in case of an emergency, and to detain patients for three to six hours after the operation. The Health Department has not yet issued its rules for second and third‐trimester abortions. One of the seven applicants is Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood Cliffs, who has been openly challenging the state's abortion restrictions since March, 1972, 10 months before the Supreme Court ruling. Commenting on the Health Department action, Dr. Livingston, who with five other doctors at the Palisades Medical Group is performing over 150 abortions a week at fees “averaging $100,” said he was “very happy” with the latest state development. Lack of Reimbursement Nevertheless, Dr. Livingston took issue with the state for its failure to allow Medicaid clients to be reimbursed for abortions performed in his health facility. Every day, he said, poor women, many of them teen‐agers, are being referred to clinics in New York City because of New Jersey's restriction. Furthermore, Dr. Livingston foresees several more roadblocks and at least six months before any license can be obtained. For one thing, a new Commissioner of Health has yet to be appointed by the Byrne administration, and the doctor considers it unlikely any new Commissioner will issue a favorable abortion ruling for several months after assuming office. Second, if the state insists on having a legal definition of the term “health clinic” before a license can be issued, as it has in the past, Dr. Livingston expects the State Attorney Gen eral to “snag” the abortion questions in May or June.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/01/archives/letters-to-the-editor-with-the-presidency-in-the-balance-tuition.html,"With the Presidency in the Balance To the Editor: It seems to me that the most compelling reason for impeachment is to set a precedent for the future. While most public servants are undoubtedly honest and dedicated souls, politics probably always will attract some who are hungry for power and/or wealth. In this age of television, with charisma being the most desirable characteristic for a candidate, we must be on the alert more than ever against a despot or a crook winning the Presidency. Such an aspirant must know in advance that when there are strong indications of “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” the American people will hold the President accountable and bring him to trial through their elected representatives. Conversely, failure to impeach President when there is well‐grounded suspicion of an impeachable offense is to invite worse trouble in the future. HUGH SAMSON Princeton, N. J., Jan. 21, 1974 To the Editor: It appears that our elected representatives devoted their holiday to the search for a sign. “What to do about impeachment?” None asked me. He must serve out his time. He and America deserve each other. We elected him, and we don't have a due process by which to elect an interim replacement. His political character was forged in our mill. Do we not share responsibility for it? We have always known about the loose use of political contributions and why they were made. We have known as much as we cared to know, and more than we were willing to acknowledge, about contrived and deceptive election practices, and we have always condoned those who worked in our favor and condemned those of the opposition. We can't purge ourselves by removing him. Has he performed the functions of his office? Is he not more than ever likely to perform ethically for the remainder of his term? Beware of the. elected official who says, “What about his credibility?” Ask yourself about his credibility. Will the Presidential replacement have more credibility, and executive ability, or less? R. A. CLEAVES Lakewood, N. J., Jan. 23, 1974 To the Editor: The most serious objection to Richard M. Nixon's remaining in office the bad example he sets for children. He is the most visible and instructive father figure we have, our most impressive teacher. What does he teach our children? To give almost nothing to charity, to cheat in money matters at every opportunity, to lie, to reject all criticism, to be indifferent to the needs of strangers, to treat laws disrespectfully, to love only close friends and relatives and sports on television, and to carpet‐bomb at Christmas. KURT VONNEGUT JR. New York, Jan. 27, 1974 Tuition and the State To the Editor: Your Jan. 14 editorial “Wanted: Students” is a commendable commentary on the financial difficulties facing students and their families when they consider attending college. We must attempt, as the editorial stales, to obtain more assistance for students from the Federal Government. I would add to this, however, that the state also has an obligation to its students which should not be overlooked. Here in New York, the Joint Assembly‐Senate Select Committee on Higher Education has proposed a new Tuition Assistance Program to provide financial help to students from lowerand lower‐middle‐income families. The program was developed with care over many months and in consultation with the higher‐education community, The long‐range goal of the program, the committee said, is to subsidize tuition at public schools completely and at private schools to a level of $2,000 for the lowest‐income student. These amounts will be scaled down as income rises. The estimated additional appropriation required for the first year, to begin the four‐year effort to phase in this program, is $35 million. It is substantial sum at a time of prospective fiscal stringency, but we have an opportunity to buy futures here, in a sensible way which directly reaches many families in New York State. DALE R. CORSON President, Cornell University Ithaca, N. Y., Jan. 16, 1974 The Pro‐Life Bandwagon To the Editor: I wish I were sure that the pro‐life demonstrators in Washington [news story Jan. 23] also opposed capital punishment, war and the quality of life lived by the poor and the aged. wish I were sure they were really so much pro‐life, and not simply prochurch dogma. I do not recall seeing much of this stratum of society when there were protests against the killing in Vietnam. Nor have I heard them protest the blood bath of executions that are only one Supreme Court decision away. Insofar as they are not concerned about the totality of life they lose credibility. I too am pro‐life and anti‐abortion. I welcome their getting on the bandwagon of life on this issue and invite them to stay on for the whole trip, for human life is becoming altogether too cheap. (Brother) ROBERT F. WILLETT, C.S.C. Flushing, N. Y., Jan. 23, 1974 Sex and the Little League To the Editor: As the individual who initiated the complaint against the Little League which resulted in the Nov. 7 decision in New Jersey, I feel compelled to answer Dr. Johnson's Op‐Ed article of Jan. 5, “Boys and Girls Together.” Dr. Johnson was brought in by Little League as a witness after they had failed to prove that girls would be unable to compete with boys and would be more susceptible to injury. His testimony, like his article, stated that it is healthier for boys and girls to band together in homogeneous groups. One wonders if Dr. Johnson feels that the mutual “normal disdain” which boys and girls in separate groups have for each other contributes to a well‐adjusted individual. The anxiety to which he refers, of boys in dealing with girls, is probably fostered by this sex segregation and would be minimized by increased integration of activities. His discussion about learning “what it means to be a boy or a girl” really refers to learning separate sex roles, which other psychologists agree belong to the Freudian, Victorian Age. At the hearings, it was brought out under cross‐examination that children have plenty of time to band separately on an informal basis if they so desire, without this segregation being enforced by formal organizations which are places of public accommodation. An extension of Dr. Johnson's ideas would encourage segregation on racial, religious and ethnic grounds, which is also contrary to law. Another child psychiatrist, Dr. Antonio Giancotti, testified that integration of boys and girls would contribute to the mental health of both sexes. As he said, “The question is, do we perpetuate... patterns which probably have outgrown their utility and are contrary to law or move toward sexual integration?” With regard to the Little League, the hearing examiner was correct in the decision that there was “absolutely no reason why that piece of Americana should be withheld from girls.” JUDITH S. WEIS Past President, Essex County Chapter National Organization for Women Maplewood, N. J., Jan. 6, 1974 Of Mideast Oil, Israel And National Interest To the Editor: Mr. Reeves' Jan. 19 letter suffers from two flaws in his concept of the economic and of the geopolitical aspects of the Middle East war. He concedes that “over the long run, the United States and other industrial nations may have been heading for a confrontation with the Arab nations anyway” and thus, inferentially, admits that the energy crisis with its vast increase in the financial power of the Arab oil‐producing states has basically nothing to do with Israel. This is precisely the conclusion reached by Walter Lacqueur (Times Magazine Ian. 20): “... it began to dawn on the British that Israel was perhaps not the core of the issue after all; that irrespective of whether Israel existed or not, there was the problem of economic extortion.” It is only necessary to substitute U.S.A. for Britain. Mr. Reeves' other error is to confuse the battle against Communism with the battle against Communist imperialism and colonialism. Russia, China and their satellites have cleverly and skillfully hidden their imperialistic and colonial expansion policies under the guise of Communist ideology. If the Rhine was our eastern frontier during the Roosevelt era, then the Mediterranean area (the underbelly of Europe) is also our frontier. It is vital to our national interests that Russia not dominate this area, and “... if nations are ... cheerfully suffering for the support of the Israeli cause,” it is because these nations (few as they are) understand the geopolitical importance of the Mediterranean Sea. I suggest that Mr. Reeves and others study very carefully Mr. Sulzberger's article in the same issue of The Times. Let them digest the implications of the statements that “Moscow has steadily gained in the superpower race” and that “the United States has gradually lost in the superpower rivalry.” The fact is that Russia would be the gainer and U.S.A. the loser if we had to withdraw from the Mediterranean area—Israel or no Israel. The fact is that in the event it becomes necessary in our national interest to land troops and planes and supply our ships in this area, Israel would be the only country that would cooperate with us. The fact is that our Mediterraneanbased “allies” deserted us when we wanted to refuel our planes. Finally, I suggest that Mr. Reeves read the report “Military R & D: Hard Lessons of an Electronic War” in the Nov. 9, 1973, issue of Science. “The Defense Department is likely to apply its lessons [Middle East war] to good advantage.” In sum total, the U.S.A. owes a debt to Israel and, conversely, Israel owes a debt to the U.S.A., but Israel needs no defenders in the U.S.A. to argue for our support—even if we pay 1 small, nonlethal price for it. CHARLES R. MESSELOFF, M.D. Bronx, Jan. 21, 1974 ‘Grand Giveaway’ To the Editor: Payments by oil companies to the sheikhs and shahs were not always treated for tax purposes as tax credits. They were, in fact, deducted as royalty expenses and included among other deductions. That is, until the late John Foster Dulles, as Secretary, of State, worked out a treaty convention with Saudi Arabia in which he categorized the payment as a foreign tax, hence allowable as a tax credit. By this stroke of the pen, Secretary Dulles saved a company like Aramco $250 million a year in taxes. When questioned about the treaty, Dulles offered the excuse of national security. The late Drew Pearson ran a number of columns on the grand giveaway. SOL, KLASS Maplewood, N. J., Jan. 21, 1974 Landlord Penalty To the Editor: I own a 36‐apartment building at 2454 Webb Avenue. My net income from operations, according to my accountant's statement, was $7,732 for 1973. My oil bill was $5,619, at an average of 12 cents per gallon. I was just advised by my agent that the price of No. 6 oil was 38 cents per gallon. This means that my expenses would be increased for oil alone by over $8,000, not to mention the tax increase. Why must this calamity fall on the landlord's shoulders? Why not assess tenants and landlord in proportion and permit us our moral rights to pass along this outrageous cost? J. L. NUNBERG New York, Jan. 21, 1974 To Bump Our Speeders To the Editor: Potholes are not what the city's streets need. However, they are aiding pedestrians to some degree in restrain ing irresponsible drivers, who are forced to respect their depths instead of belting along at careless speeds, which, at most, cause accidents and, at least, give the hapless pedestrian a good soaking in the rain. What the city does need are “thank you, ma'am” rounded elevations at cross‐street intersections to curb the speed rate when traffic is light. These humps do not hinder moderate driving, nor are they a maintenance or drainage problem. And they also are “stepping stones” for pedestrians to avoid the normal six inches of water or slush at crossings in stormy weather as property owners are so lax in keeping crossings cleared.

Judge Rules Husband Can't Block Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/02/archives/judge-rules-husband-cant-block-abortion.html,"DECATUR, Ill., Feb. (UPI) —In a precedent‐setting ruling, Circuit Court Judge Joseph Munch ruled yesterday that a husband had no legal right to prevent his wife from having an abortion. The ruling came in a hearing on a request by Mrs. Sharon Pound, who is suing her husband for divorce, to dissolve a temporary restraining order preventing her from having an abortion. Mrs. Pound's husband, Merrill, 21 years old had gone to court in an attempt to prevent his wife of four months from aborting her pregnancy. But Mrs. Pound, 29, and the mother of two children, argued that a third child would make it more difficult to raise her children alone. A temporary restraining order was issued earlier this week, forbidding Mrs. Pound having an abortion.

A fine specimen of the power—and profit—of the press in Middle America,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/03/archives/the-little-old-daily-of-dubuque-a-fine-specimen-of-the-powerand.html,"DUBUQUE, Iowa. There are 1,761 daily newspapers in the United States, but in the national consciousness, only 129 of them count. These are the powerful city papers with more than 100,000 circulation; their names are usually known throughout the land, and they reflect the popular image of American newspapers as metropolitan thunderers whose armies of reporters can cause the nation to leap out of lethargy. They are hated and cultivated by Presidents, and their histories are studied with seminarian reverence in every school of journalism. But there are 1,632 other dailies, neither national thunderers nor often celebrated. Their names are mostly unknown to students of journalism or to anyone else outside their native habitats. Yet they deserve attention, in some ways more than the giants. For one thing, most of them enjoy monopoly power in communities of less than 50,000 where the big‐city papers do not penetrate. They constitute a peculiar feature of American journalism. In most developed countries, a few national papers blanket the nation. In Japan, for example, Tokyo‐based papers control 70 per cent of daily newspaper sales nationwide, and, in England, London papers control a similar 70 per cent of national circulation. But in the United States, the newspapers of New York and Washington, combined, account for less than 9 per cent of American daily circulation. In addition, the small dailies, if they lack direct national influence, still dominate the areas where city councils, county supervisors, school boards and members of Congress are elected. Indeed, Congressmen or candidates for office may or may not read the big‐city papers, but they pay meticulous attention to what their home‐district paper says, regardless of its size. They do it because this is the paper the voters are reading. It tells them what information their constituents are receiving about the issues. If this news is narrow or inadequate or doctrinaire—or simply missing—it can have a profound impact on how the local politician acts and votes. So the examination of such a paper—a specimen is currently alive and well here in Dubuque—offers a unique insight into the modern process of American politics, a glimpse of the forces, diffuse and confusing, that shape an important segment of public opinion. The Dubuque Telegraph Herald (circulation: 41,000) is not necessarily typical of the small daily. It has its weaknesses, but it is better in editorial content than most of its size, a size that is in the middle range of American dailies. In addition, the paper is one of the more handsome in the country to look at; its striking graphics, quality photographs and well‐organized contents regularly win it national awards for appearance and state prizes for general excellence. And as a business enterprise, it is thriving—it made over a million dollars last year—not untypical for such papers, despite the periodic lament that the small daily newspaper is an endangered species. Papers like The Telegraph Herald are so prosperous that they constitute one of the hottest items in the great American corporate game, Conglomerate. Bill Woodward, the 34‐year‐old lawyer who runs the paper his family owns, approached at least once a month by a big chain trying to buy the paper. He turns them all down. But he is bucking a trend: Chains currently control over two–thirds of all the daily papers in the United States and are acquiring the remainder at a rate one every five days. The Telegraph Herald reflects the basic situation of the small daily newspaper as it deals with the news and manages its business affairs. Its operators are candid about how they work. They don't conceal the second most sacred secret in American newspapers, the private surveys that show what their readers really think of them. And they are fairly open with the most sanctified data of all, their profits. According to the coastal stereotype, Dubuque is a “typical” Middle Western city, but in reality is not. For one thing, it sits on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, lacking the featureless plains that in theciry shape the “Middle Western mentality.” But the idea of Dubuque as the national symbol of small‐town parochialism, Babbitry and boredom was fixed in the national literary consciousness by a single sentence written half century ago by Harold Ross. In his prospectus for The New Yorker magazine, he wrote: “The New Yorker . . . hopes to reflect metropolitan life and affairs of the day, to be gay, humorous, satirical, but to be more than a jester. . . . It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.” Since that day, the city has become a reluctant pulse of Middle America. Journalists come from distant places to test the mood of America by testing the mood of Dubuque. They discover that the city contributed playwrights Richard Bissell and David Rabe and columnist Nick Thimmesch. Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times visited the place and found a stereotypical “old lady from Dubuque” duly selected by the Chamber of Commerce and consistent with Harold Ross's image. But she also found an old lady who led vigils against the war in Vietnam and another one who headed local boycotts against nonunion lettuce and had her high‐school class hold sensitivity sessions to deal with race prejudice. (The late Dorothy Kilgallen wrote a syndicated column on how surprised she was to find Dubuque a gambling, swinging city, but unfortunately she was in East Dubuque, a different town across the river in the state of Illinois.) The community is largely industrial, with a John Deere plant on the outskirts, a big meat‐packing plant and a sprawling door‐and‐window factory that, among other things, is said to have produced windows that are installed in the White House. The city attracts sociologists because of its tradition of distinct ethnic groups. The community is two‐thirds Catholic and one–third Protestant, but national divisions cut across the religious groupings. One hospital is largely German Catholic, another Irish Catholic and a third is Protestant, all developing independently to produce a surplus of beds. There was a time when Catholic high‐school football teams in the area didn't play Protestant or public‐school teams, when fhe Protestants—Presbyterians, Lutherans and Congregationalists—had German‐speaking churches and English‐speaking ones. Today, the divisions remain but have been blurred in some areas. There is a joint Dominican‐Presbyterian‐Lutheran seminary, and there is increasing cooperation between the Presbyterian‐oriented University of Dubuque and the local Catholic colleges, Loras and Clarke. Sharp social class cleavages are also apparent the city. They are clearly visible in housing patterns: The higher you live on the hilt overlooking the river, the higher your social status. The city is heavily Democratic in a Republican state (most of the Democratic votes are downhill, Republican votes uphill). The city went for McGovern in 1972 while Iowa as a whole gave Nixon about 60 per cent of its vote. It is in this setting that The Telegraph Herald operates: It is a monopoly paper owned by Protestants believed to be Republicans. Yet the city is mostly Catholic Democratic, and a readership survey taken for The Telegraph Herald showed that the paper Is most popular with lower‐ and middle‐class families. Such a disparity between newspaper owners and their readers is not unusual. Most newspapers are major business enterprises in their cities, and like most industrial leaders, their publishers tend to be Republican and conservative, more so than their readers. (Most citizens could not appreciate the full irony of White House attacks on the “liberal monopoly press.” The papers attacked were among the few remaining competitive dailies in the country, and no mention was made of the dailies that endorsed Nixon in 1972–93 per cent of all papers making an endorsement—almost all of them monopolies in their communities.) The Telegraph Herald is produced in a three‐story modernized building in downtown Dubuque with a central black facade bearing large gold letters: “T H Inc.” (The first time the managing editor saw the new gold letters, he said, “Christ, now everyone in town will say we can't even spell ‘Think.’ “) The paper's news and editorial staffs work in a clean and well‐lighted office; the 33 full‐time men and women make up 23 per cent of the 145 who work for the paper, and they absorb 16 per cent of its budget. Both percentages are high for small dailies. The news staff is young—the average age is 30—and well educated. The top editorial man at The Telegraph Herald, James Geladas, is called the managing editor. He's 49. He was Marine photographer in World War II, edited his college paper at Denison University, and has worked at various small‐ and medium‐sized dailies. He was editor of a small daily, The Globe, in Worthington, Minn., in the midfifties when he decided he wanted to edit a larger paper and took a job that put him in line for the editorship of The Dubuque Telegraph Herald. He is a dark‐haired, darkeyed, taciturn man who chews gum with a barely perceptible movement of the jaw. He lets his staff work freely within general limits, keeping out of detailed, daily decisions. “One of the joys of being on a paper this size is that you can do several things and see results,” he says. “I love photography and typography, and I can experiment; I can be a photographer myself and and teach good photography. I can have rapport with everyone on the staff. These are things that can't be done on a larger paper.” There is a camaraderie among working staff members, perhaps because most of them are young. The executive who makes daily decisions on local news is Anne Henderson, who at age 28 is the senior city editor. Her coeditor is Mike Tighe, 25. With the wire editor, Larry Pauley, 29, who handles incoming nonlocal news, they select which stories will go into each day's paper and how they will be displayed. They usually divide their space equally between local and nonlocal Miss Henderson grew up in Coin, Iowa (population, 300), and once worked on.the most prestigious paper in the state, The Des Moines Register, but she prefer; the freedom and opportunity for women in Dubuque. “I can't see spending my life on a big‐city paper marking paragraphs. Besides, it's fun to work here. There's a smaller staff, and we know each other and have a good time. It's idormal and we can dress the way we like, like the blue jeans I'm wearing. And people in Dubuque need a good paper as much as people in any other city.” One reporter, John McCormick, 23, a serious, bearded man, is a graduate of Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He worked as a copy boy at The Chicago Daily News and believes he could have become a reporter there, but he decided to start his career in Dubuque. “At my age, I can work at a number of things, at labor, at energy, at utilities, and get a lot more experience. I've learned how to do reporting about people that I continue to meet face to face. And I can sit here and see the city desk and get an idea how everything works. It's all in the open.” In covering the news, The Telegraph Herald, or “T H,” as it is called in town, is strong on local reporting and weak on national and international stories; as a molder of opinion, it takes a half‐hearted approach, with few editorials and heavy reliance on syndicated columnists. Notably, the paper manages to avoid two faults common to other dailies where the publisher's political and social outlook differs markedly from that of readers: campaigning blatantly for the publiiher's viewpoint or, alternatively, staying away from controversy altogether. In fact, daily decisions in The Telegraph Herald newsroom are taken in professional manner, even though some people don't believe it. Woodward says: “When I listen to people here who say that of course something was put in the paper because I ordered it in, it scarces the hell out of me. That tells me what those people would do if they were in my place.” To cover the local community, the small but active staff operates with less regard for sacred cows than is the case on many papers. And the management accepts the anger of local groups who dislike it. Such anger is not restricted to any specific Reporter McCormick, covering a meeting of union members, overheard threatening statements against the paper by some workers who were only partially joking. But in another part of the city a powerful businessman with no love for unions also expressed anger: “Hell, that paper crucifies the very people who advertise. A man here runs a big store, has a little trouble with his income tax and, bang, there it is on page one. Another businessman has a little accident with his car and there it is, right in the same paper the man advertises in. I don't understand it. You don't do that to your custom ers. Don't those people at The T H have any sense of loyalty?” A professor who studies the social structure of the city said: “The Catholic leaders here think The T H doesn't print enough Catholic news because the paper's owned by Protestants.” But Geladas, told this, signed as though he had heard it all before: “There's a town called Decorah in our circulation area. It's a Lutheran community, and we just can't get very far selling them The T H because they think were too Catholic.” Some people in the community think there are diplomatic lapses in the paper's reporting. When a popular local priest became a layman there was no publicity. There was little reporting on a regionally unusual event, negotiations between faculties of the local university and seminary, who had unionized, and the administrations of the institutions. But the paper's record on local‐issue reporting is good. The owning Woodwards seem not to wield a heavy hand on news involving their friends. A close companion of Bill Woodward said, “I'm a Republican, and I think the paper's too goddamned neutral.” When a personal friend of the Woodward family, .a former local judge, Edward Failor, became controversial with an appointment to the Federal Bureau of Mines and as an official of the Committee for the Re‐Election of the President, the stories were played prominently and straight in the Woodwards' paper. Files of the paper show uninhibited coverage of sensitive local issues like abortion, and nonhostile reporting on Catholic rebels like the Berri Some of the most useful journalism in The Telegraph Herald occurs in special reports in depth on local problems. These have dealt with housing and the city's important waterfront. And a notable example considered a bizarre weakness in the city of 62,000. There are 112 black men, women and children in Dubuque, but the city has a racist streak that goes back to cross‐burnings and Klan parades that older inhabitants remember. The paper ran a series in 1969 by its reporter Peter Anderson, who in eight articles described the treatment, nonviolent but hostile, of the few blacks in the city and in the city's university and colleges. The series began: “Dubuque has a race problem. “Not one that is likely to burst into riot this summer; not even one that is likely to route civil rights marchers through our streets soon. “But the problem is here, very much here, and it is frightening. . “We're bigoted. “We love our wives, raise our children, do our work, help our neighbor, give to charity, vote at elections, go to church . . . and we're bigoted.” Like most papers its size, The Telegraph Herald has no Washington bureau or parttime correspondent in the national capital. But it periodically sends one of its own staff to follow a local story when it leads to Washington, not a common thing for a small paper located 800 miles from the Potomac River. When a previously unpublicized Government report critical of the city's large meat‐packing plant — biggest employer within the city limits—was disclosed, the paper printed it, although it brought outrage from the owner and a petition by 1,500 employes threatening to boycott the paper. The paper then sent a reporter to Washington to try to get more details on the report, and although the reporter saw top officials in meat inspection, he received only polite noninfonnation, which he duly reported. There is an “Action Line” column to which readers send complaints; the paper investigates and prints what it finds. One complaint was critical of an advertiser, a savings and loan company. The company admitted error, but threatened to reduce its advertising if its name was used in the “Action Line” item. The paper printed the name, and the savings and loan company reduced its advertising as threatened. Businessmen in town were disturbed by this, and Geladas started what has now become a, periodic column, “Letter From the Editor,” explaining to readers why the paper does what it does. On that occasion, Geladas wrote, “The news does not belong to us. It juggle.” The most significant and obvious weakness in the paper is the brevity of its national and international coverage. When Gelatin first came to the paper, it subscribed to both major news services, Associated Press and United Press International. He canceled U.P.I. when he discovered that his small paper was paying the same rate as The Kansas City Star, which is eight times bigger. Prices paid for syndicated services are determined by Byzantine bargaining, but they tend to be related to the size of the paper. But Geladas has notified A.P. that after a two‐year cancellation clause expires, he intends to drop it and resume United Press International, The A.P., he said, was insufficiently responsive to local queries. Even with its major wire service, the paper suffers because it does not subscribe to the A.P.'s main news wire. Both A.P. and U.P.I. offer specialized news channels for sports, financial and regional news, which includes a digest of national and international news. These are usually received on separate teletype machines. The Telegraph Herald takes these, including the regional news services for Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois, all of which are included in the paper's circulation area. But it does not subscribe to the main news wire of A.P., which carries national and international news. Nor does it have any other news service to supplement the condensed national news that appears on its machines. Consequently, there are few individual stories on national events that exceed 600 words. This is especially constricting for an evening newspaper (which gets to most homes in midafternoon or early evening) because its deadlines are about midday, and by that time most people have seen the morning news on television or heard it on their radios and increasingly look to newspapers, particularly afternoon papers, for more analytical and interpretive articles on the main events already announced on television. And good analysis and interpretative reporting require space. An example of this problem was clearly apparent in the Oct. 25, 1973, edition of the Telegraph Herald. That day, the paper notified its readers of what it obviously considered a spectacular development. A single‐word overline topped the front page: ALERT Under that was a headline across the entire paper: U.S. WAR MACHINE POISED But the story underneath was only 540 words long, or the equivalent of less than four minutes of broadcast news. What appeared about the alert under the alarming headline was the most dra matic portions of official statements, with little qualifying detail, resulting in an oversimplification of the story. Such treatment of major events is common to small newspapers, and it can be blamed in large part on the reluctance, usually for financial reasons, to subscribe to the main news‐service wires. If The Telegraph Herald, for example; took the main Associated Press wire for national news, it would have been able to print on Oct. 25 Henry Kissinger's statement, in the face of the alert, that “as of now the Soviet Union has not taken any irrevocable action.” The paper, in an accompanying story to the military alert, quoted Kissinger as saying he “flatly rejected the introduction of U.S. or Soviet forces into the area in whatever guise.” But the main A.P. national news story, available well before Dubuque's centralstandard‐time deadline, also had Kissinger saying that “the United States is willing to supply some personnel to an observer team under United Nations supervision”‐4n im Because it did not subscribe to the lull service, the paper was also unaware of the interesting sequence of events in Washington as they seemed on the morning of the 25th. The national wire story the Dubuque paper did not see described how the National Security Council met at 3 A.M. without the President but with the President later approving its moves. But the story also quoted the Pentagon as saying that the Secretary of Defense ordered .the alert at about midnight “on Nixon's instructions”; this made the action of the Security Council ambiguous. The A.P. did not deal with this point in its main story, but at least the known sequence of events was given for those readers who wished to ponder for themselves. Neither did the shortened story run by The Telegraph Herald report a bitter exchange, available on the main wire, that occurred during the Kissinger press conference: “Twice Kissinger was asked whether there was any link between Nixon's domestic problems and the crisis abroad. He reacted icily. ‘There has to be a minimum confidence that senior officials of the American Government are not playing with the lives of the American people,’ he said.” The main wire, not seen in Dubuque, also gave its readers evidence of an apparent contradiction, one that might well have tempered an editor's judgment. One story quoted Senator Henry Jackson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as saying, “We're right at the brink again” and that he understood that the Russians already had sent a contingent of troops to the Middle East. But at the same time, the wire carried another story from Israel saying that country was unaware of any added Soviet military activity. All of this is worth some thought. The details given quickly and in all practical fullness are sometimes confusing because the situation is confused. The undetailed, condensed, simplified story is not so confused—it gives the impression of a clear‐cut slide toward military activity. And in this case that impression turned out to be wrong. Reporting real confusion is necessary; giving an impression of unreal simplification is dangerous. As a carrier of the paper's own judgment on issues, The Telegraph Herald's editorial page is almost nonexistent; it carries only about a half‐dozen editorials each year. In 1973, the paper editorialized against renovation of the Dubuque traditional City Hall because the paper favored consolidation of city and county government, move that would necessitate a new building (the bond issue for renovation was defeated). Another editorial urged the City Council to stop *kering with its city manager. A third commented on vacillation of the City Council on local issues. Another editorial called for consolidation of all hospitals in the city, a courageous stand in a city whose hospitals reflect deep ethnic loyalties. And another noted the poor turnout in past city elections. That editorial also raised questions the new council members would face, though it did not suggest answers to the questions, and it noted that there were 13 candidates for the council and In light of the dreary writing that fills many of the nation's daily editorial columns, there is a refreshing quality to Managing Editor Geladas's explanation of the paucity of editorials: “We don't write them unless we have something to say.” Nevertheless, if the editorials of a newspaper are supposed to be the thoughtful opinion of the publisher and his editorialists on public issues of significance, it is hard to believe that public issues worthy of comment or conclusion occur only once every two months. In 1973 it would have been interesting for Dubuquers (or Dubuquelanders) to know what their paper thought of Watergate, the wheat deal, impeachment, unionization of local university faculties and many other issues beyond the six dealt with. Instead of daily editorials, the editorial page prints nationally syndicated political columns in somewhat the same format as editorials, which may explain why a survey showed that 80 per cent of the readers did not realize that the paper seldom ran editorials of its own. Political and social opinion, then, comes mostly from these columnists. The Dubuque native, Thimmesch, usually gets top position and is influential in the business community. The weight of these columns is conservative. In the month of October, 1973, for example, the editorial page carried 13 columns by Thimmesch, 8 by William F. Buckley Jr., 7 by Paul Harvey, and 6 by Max Rafferty. On the liberal side were 6 by Max Lerner, leaving the page 85 per cent conservative, unless one also counts Art Buchwald (7 columns) as a liberal columnist, which would make it 72 per cent conservative. The page also ran 11 columns by Editorial Research Reports, a The commentary on national affairs, as a result, is doctrinaire and not even the most thoughtful conservatism. On Nov. 12, for example, during a period of intense talk of impeachment because of newly discovered “missing” Presidential tapes and the energy crisis, the only two pieces of political commentary were from Paul Harvey, who praised the growth of private, especially Christian, parochial schools as opposed to public schools, and a William Buckley column suggesting total embargo or military invasion of the Arab oil states. The paper once carried, but has canceled, Nicholas von Hoffman, Ralph Nader and Evans and Novak. Geladas canceled von Hoffman because, he said, his columns added little and were not popular. He canceled Evans and Novak because he found a serious factual error about Gov. Pat Lucey of Wisconsin in one of their contributions. And Nader, though popular and cheap ($5 ‐a week) offended him because Nader's syndicate offered him the power to deny the column to a paper in an adjacent area, and this struck Geladas as a hypocritical move by a syndicate offering a national leader in the fight against monopoly. What do Dubuquers think of their paper? The Telegraph Herald readership survey showed that 15 per cent think The T H is excellent; 50 per cent rated it good and only 6 per cent considered it poor. Those with gripes (46 per cent had none) complained of inaccurate news, insufficient local news, insufficient world news, and 3 per cent disliked the way the ink came off on their hands. Ralph Nader was rated highest among the columnists (though he was later dropped) and William Buckley was lowest (though he is retained). In addition, the survey gave a rundown of other publications read ‐by Dubuquers: Reader's Digest, 43 per cent; Better Homes & Gardens, 26 per cent; Family Circle, 15 per cent; Ladies' Home Journal, 15 per cent; Time, 12 per cent. The coming generation, people between the ages of 18 and 24, are different. Their main reading list, in order of popularity, includes Newsweek, Reader's Digest, Time and Playboy. (The New Yorker, which sells 133 copies a week in Dubuque County, appears only marginally with younger readers, and disappears completely among older readers, including the old ladies for whom the magazine is not edited.) If the survey is correct, one in every five young adults in Dubuque reads or at least looks at Playboy regularly. Bill Woodward is part of the family and corporate dynasty that owns the paper, a microcosm of similar hierarchies and struggles in more publicized journalistic royal families. The paper claims to be a descendant of the first paper in Iowa in 1836, but there is some historical fog between the time the first paper died and the first proven forebear of The T H, came out. In 1851 something called The Miner's Express combined with a new paper, The Herald, and from then on the genealogy is impeccable. A later paper, The Telegraph, combined with The Herald in 1901 and was run by a man named Patrick J. Quigley. At that point, the Horatio Alger story of first‐generation publishers begins. A few years before The Telegraph and Herald were joined, a local boy named Fred William Woodward, aged 10, started delivering the paper for $1.25 a week. In 1901, he became an office boy, worked his way up to circulation manager, and then to secretary of the corporation. When Mr. Quigley died in 1917, Mr. Woodward owned two‐thirds interest and Mrs. Quigley inherited her husband's shares. Then, in the nineteen‐sixties, the Woodwards devised an interesting policy. They stopped declaring dividends. Presum ably this did not cause serious family financial problems, since four Woodwards—the grandfather, his son and two grandsons—each drew salaries from the paper. There was a long lawsuit culminating in the Woodwards' buying total control in 1965. Today, the board of T H Inc. consists of the grandfather as president; his son, F. R., “Old Bob,” executive vice president; his grandson, F. R. Jr., “Young Bob,” vice president; and his other grandson, Bill, treasurer. Jeanne Woodward, wife of “Old Bob,” is also a director. Two longtime employes complete the board. The patriarch, “Grandpa Fritz,” can be seen walking around the building, cigar in his mouth, cane in hand, no longer exerting power. Titles can be misleading in the newspaper business. Geladas, for example, is managing editor, which usually means a nuts‐and‐bolts operating chief, but he is realty executive editor, operating only at a high policy level. Bill Woodward is called general manager, usually a hired hand who makes sure the machinery and books remain defensible, but he is in fact the chief executive of the paper with the authority of the most powerful publisher (his grandfather holds the title, “publisher”). Family‐owned papers have a lot of advantages, but they have the problem of heirs and in‐laws who often fight for control and draw salaries that grow in Malthusian proliferation. Dozens of American family papers have been torn apart by internal family fights, with chains picking up the pieces. Grandfather Woodward ran the paper with an iron hand while indulging in town politics. His On, F. R. Sr., recognized the problem, and transferred power early to his two sons while they were young and in their prime. Young Bob, now 37, went to Culver Military Academy, Brown University and then Drake, where he majored in journalism and began working up the T H hierarchy. His younger brother, Bill, also went to Culver, spent two years at Brown, and transferred to University of Iowa to be near the girl who is now his wife. He graduated from Iowa Law School, moved quietly into the paper; by maneuvering with what is described as velvety skill, he ended up running the family prize, The Telegraph Herald, while his older brother runs the company radio stations. But it all stayed in the family. About 10 per cent of dividends are shared with employes who have been with the paper one year or more; 5 per cent goes to the Woodward Foundation for kical charities. But all the stock is held by Woodwards either through family trusts or in direct holding of stock by the grandfather, father, the two grandsons and their mother. Compared to most proprietors, Bill Woodward has done a spectacular job of putting out a good paper and an even more spectacular job of making money. He financed modernization or the paper with retained dividends. In the midsixties the paper was making a profit before Federal taxes of $50,000 a year. Today the paper has the same circulation it had 10 years ago, though Dubuque County population rose almost 30 per cent in that time. This is ex plained by the fact that half the circulation is outside the metropolitan area in rural areas that have been losing population. Despite this standstill in circulation, the paper now makes $1‐million a year on a gross of $4.5‐million. How much “over $1‐million” is not stated, but the paper is obviously a highly profitable operation, with profits aided by a deliberate policy of raising subscription rates every other year for the last six years. Some might think such profitability would give Bill Woodward a sanguine ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eeling about The Telegraph Herald, but his attitude is anything but secure. Asked why he doesn't use some of the profits to strengthen the paper with more news space and more news services, he has two answers. One is that the improvements have already gone as far as is practicable; the other is his fear that if Dubuque has a bad year and the company is short of money, the giants will move in on him. “The chains are gobbling up everything they can put their hands on,” he explains. And he talks of taking chainhimself to pro tect his independence. “In order never to be caught needing money or having a crisis in a bad year in Dubuque or facing monstrous estate taxes forcing us to sell, we have to expand, to diversify. So we ourselves are looking for other papers.” Yet he remains suspicious of bigness as a diluter of quality. “For the most part, chains are breeders of mediocre papers. They don't let a paper of theirs get too bad because they send in a manager to keep it in the black. But they don't have the local freedom to experiment and innovate. No matter what they say, chains have bureaucracies and bureaucracies don't like real innovations. They result in reliability, in mediocrity. I don't want The T H to be part of that mediocrity.” Bill has three children, Bob four. Asked how he would prevent the possibility of seven children plus seven spouses fighting for power when they become adults, Bill threw up his hands: “By then the laws will have changed, the children will be fighting with each other," and it won't be my problem.” ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
House Election Is Watched for Impact of Watergate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/03/archives/house-election-is-watched-for-impact-of-watergate-ford-and-mondale.html,"JOHNSTOWN, Pa., Feb. 2—Like it or not, this gritty, old steel town has become a barometer for Republican electoral fortunes in 1974. It began in November when Representative John P. Saylor, a Republican in his 13th term, died unexpectedly, thereby setting the stage for this year's first Federal election. Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday's voting, it seems certain to have an impact beyond this area. If, for instance, State Representative John P. Murtha, the 41‐year‐old Democratic candidate, captures the vacant seat, the almost inevitable conclusion will be that the Watergate scandals have substantially and perhaps irreparably damaged a local Republican. On the other hand, if Harry M. Fox, 49, the Republican aspirant, wins, the nation's oracles might deduce that the Nixon Administration's problems have very little to do with the realities of a Congressional contest. In either case, there is a clear, nonpartisan consensus here that this city, known principally as the scene of one of the worst floods in modern history, will have served as an important, electoral test tube out of which will be poured the early lessons and logic for both parties' off ‐ year campaigns. Ford and Mondale Visit “The whole country is watching the 12th District,” Vice President Ford said last week in a brief appearance for Mr. Fox—and last night, Senator Walter F. Mondale echoed that observation before an audience of Democrats supporting Mr. Murtha. “Everybody's looking at the 12th District,” the Minnesota Democrat said. “They all want to see what's going to happen here.” Nevertheless, as the campaign entered its final weekend, precisely what the country might see in the Fox‐Murtha confrontation was less than clear—as murky, in fact, as the local skyline, daily shrouded by the ubiquitous smoke from the mills of Bethlehem Steel. The six‐county district, which also includes a large coal‐mining industry, is predominantly Democratic in registration, yet its voting record is raggedly inconsistent, much like its mountainous terrain. Since 1948 it has given its alternate approval to the Presidential candidacies of Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, while steadfastly returning Mr. Saylor to the Republican side of the House and electing mixed collection of state and local officeholders. The picture is further clouded by the individual campaigns of Mr. Murtha and Mr. Fox. Both have been extremely low‐key with an emphasis on face‐toface meetings with voters and little effort to delineate contrasting positions. Both candidates are as conservative on social and philosophic issues as the majority of the people they seek to represent. Both oppose abortion, both favor some form of capital punishment, both are against any form of gun control, both espouse tax and campaign, reforms, and neither is overly fond of wage and price controls. Similarly, neither man has devoted much attention to the Watergate scandals, and both insist it it either unnecessary or irrelevant. “I don't have to talk about it,” Mr. Murtha said in the interview yesterday. “It's already there in the mind of every voter.” Mr. Fox takes an understandably different tack. “It just does not apply,” he says. “I wasn't there, Jack Murtha wasn't there and nobody around here was there.” Although Mr. Murtha, a decorated Korean and Vietnam war veteran, began his campaign with the slogan “One Honest Man Can Make a Difference,” he has since begun emphasizing another phrase—one with a distinctly familiar ring for those who recall Senator George McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign. Billboard Campaign Plea “Democrats, Come Home,” the new Murtha billboards urge, and with a Democratic edge of slightly more than 8,000 in enrollment, most of which is here in his home town and surrounding Cambria County, the boyishfaced candidate faced the last few hours of his campaign with a muted confidence. In contrast, the Republican strength lies in the five, more rural counties of the district, and Mr. Fox, a native of Armstrong County, needs desperately to stay quite close or break even with his opponent here in the Johnstown area if his rural muscle is to have any effect. There are 225,000 registered voters in the district, and 100,000 belong to some labor union. Mr. Fox's campaign has focused on the legislative experience he gained as Mr. Saylor's administrative assistant for 24 years. Both candidates have imported champions from outside the district. Mr. Fox hosted not only the Vice President but also several Republican Congressmen from nearby districts. For Mr. Murtha, Senator Mondale was preceded by Senators Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, Henry M. Jackson of Washington and Joheph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. Nevertheless, both candidates share a similar caution about the presence of aliens in their campaigns. Mr. Fox, for instance, declined to invite Mr. Nixon to the district on the public premise that the President was much too busy; and Mr. Murtha canceled a visit by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, explaining that there was really nothing the Massachusetts Democrat could add to the campaign. Still, neither man can deny or ignore the national implications of their contest. Contributions have poured in from sources far removed from these Allegheny ridges, and organized labor has chosen the district as the first battle in its 1974 war against the Republicans. “We want very much to win this one,” Michael Johnson, the executive vice president of the Pennsylvania American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial Organizations said today. But what we really want is to win really big, big, big,” he continued. “Watergate is there but the chief issue—and everybody knows it—is economics. The question really is what has Nixon done to our dollars.” So, from one end of the district to the other, both volunteers and paid union organizers are trying to gather the miners and the steel workers and the garment workers behind Mr. Murtha, warning them that the impending dismissal of nearly 5,000 employes from Bethlehem Steel's 11,500‐man force will further exacerbate the area's long‐time struggle to survive economically. Despite the uncertainties of the election, one thing clear in Johnstown. However intransigent the area may be, neither its isolation nor its boulder‐like conservatism has totally eliminated change from the fabric of its life. For example, as Mr. Murtha and Mr. Fox campaigned late and long here over the last few weeks, many of their constituents were going to see “Deep Throat” and “The Devil in Miss Jones” at a local theater, which, not many years ago, was the Presbyterian Church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Parents' Group Is Teaching Religion at Home,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/03/archives/a-parents-group-is-teaching-religion-at-home-question-on-leadership.html,"EAST NORTHPORT, L.I. — Five Roman Catholic couples are giving religious instruction to their children themselves instead of sending them to the traditional preparatory program offered by the church. The couples, all members of St. Anthony of Padua Church here, have been gathering weekly in each other's homes since September, holding small, informal classes with their children —22, in all—in living rooms, dens, kitchens and bedrooms. Each class is led by a husband and wife team. They use the same textbooks that the church does in its Saturday morning catechism program, but stress a “rap session” technique in which the children “search their minds for their true feelings.” “We feel it's the job of parents to teach their children religion,” said Dr. Thomas Bonomo, who originally suggested the idea to the parents. “We had a group called the Christian Family Movement in St. Anthony's and we talked about the idea at out meetings. We kicked the idea around for a year until it finally crystalized last summer. Five couples decided to do it. At least seven of the parents involved have taught in the C.C.D. (Confraternity of Christian Doctrine) program. We thought we could do a better job. One child in the group will receive his first holy communion at home this April, and several others are preparing for their confirmation next year. Question on Leadership Dr. Bonomo added, “I think the big benefit here is that a community is slowing evolving—a bond is being established between all the children and all the parents. My wife last year had a class of about 36 at the confraternity program and I had 28. It took weeks and weeks to learn who was who. Most of the time the children were not enthusiastic.” On a recent Tuesday evening, in a bedroom of one of the homes, Mrs. Joan Haynes asked five children who were huddling together across the top of a bunk bed, “What's the main quality you would want a leader to have? Think of Jesus, or Pope Paul, or Martin Luther King, or Gandhi.” A bunk‐top conference of the 9‐ and 10‐year‐olds produced an answer: “A leader should be a good person. That's the main thing.” While topics ranging from the meaning of the ten Commandments to intermarriage were being taken up in the other bedrooms of the house and in the kitchen, the discussion among the young teen‐agers gathered in the living room had turned to abortion. “The church has a hangup about abortion,” declared a 14‐year‐old girl. “What do you mean by a hangup?” asked John Bozzella who is a junior high school teacher in East Meadow. “Well, they talk about it all the time, the girl answered. “Don't you think it's important enough for them to bring up?” asked Mr. Bozzella. “What do you think they should do?” After a lengthy discussion, the girl said softly, “I could never, never have an abortion.” Explaining the parents' educational approach, Mr. Bozzella said: “We challenge the children with questions. We don't want to be rigid. We try to get them to search their own minds for their true feelings. Then we offer guidance after we know their feelings. We're flexible enough to be able to go with the things that bother them most. We play it by ear, and hopefully the relationship we build with the kids will allow us to deal with those issues.” Mrs. Betty Pinto, who has continued to teach at the confraternity classes held at the church, commented, “In church it's a lesson. Here it's a rap group. The children experience a greater feeling of community in our group. This way they see both parents of all the children involved and there's a family feeling.” Enthusiasm for the weekly sessions has been running high among the children. “When we're going to someone else's house, the kids yell, ‘Quick, quiet, we're going to be later!’” said Mrs. Jane Sapio. Thomas Haynes, 14, who is an enthusiastic participant in the teen group, said, “We're not limited. We can talk about controversial things and express our feelings freely. I feel free to disagree with the position of the church if I want to.” The Rev. Thomas Judge, pastor of St. Anthony's, said of the parents' undertaking, “We had about 2,200 children between first and sixth grade for religious instruction. If some of the parents wish to assume that task themselves, fine. This particular group are very fine Christian people. Many of them have taught in our program. But not all parents are equipped to do this. These people can present their children for the sacraments. If they are morally convinced that their children are prepared to receive sacraments, we certainly would take their word.” A spokesman for the diocese of Rockville Centre, the Rev. Daniel S. Hamilton, asked to comment, said, “I hadn't heard of this, but there would be no objection to it. Parents are encouraged to participate in the preparation of their children for the sacrament. It is desirable and necessary. In most cases, the education of children is in conjunction with the parish program. But the pastor of the parish has the right to determine whether the children are prepared to receive the sacraments.” And in Washington, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee ?? Liturgy said: “The church's revised rites on reception of the sacraments emphasize the role of parents in the religious education of their children. The church community has responsibility for this but it is secondary to the role of the parent. Church doctrine emphasizes the need for parents to work together with others in the Christian community, including the priest and religious educators, in this matter.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MEDICAID DENIAL BY STATE UPHELD,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/05/archives/medicaid-denial-by-state-upheld-payment-for-abortion-done-elsewhere.html,"TRENTON, Feb. 4 (AP)—The Appellate Division of Superior Court ruled today that the state's Medicaid program does not have to pay for abortion or other medical services performed out of the state unless the medical facilities have been approved beforehand by New Jersey officials. The decision concerned payment to a New York hospital and physician for 16 abortions performed for New Jersey women in December, 1971. The court noted that the state's Medicaid regulations require prior state approval of the medical facilities. The only exceptions are for patients temporarily out of the state, when it is customary for New Jersey residents to use out‐of‐state facilities, or in emergencies. The Appellate Division said Madison Avenue Hospital in New York City and Dr. Howard Weitzner had failed to establish at a hearing that the 16 abortions were emergency operations. They also said that they, had had no prior approval. The court said the state had the power to require prior approval of the facilities to “exercise fiscal responsibility and to prevent subsidization of substandard out‐of‐state facilities.” The hospital and Dr. Weitzner argued that to deny them payments for abortions performed in New York would deprive women of their constitutional rights to have abortions. The court disagreed, saying the only issue was whether New York doctors and medical facilities may be paid with New Jersey Medicaid funds. Under Medicaid, poor persons get state and Federal assistance to help pay their medical bills. New Jersey's abortion law has been ruled unconstitutional by a three‐judge Federal court, and the United States Supreme Court has said that states may not prohibit abortions in the first three months of pregnancy. The State Health Department has recently proposed regulations for abortion clinics in New Jersey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/07/archives/the-uses-and-abuses-of-wit-books-of-the-times-unanimous-intersexual.html,"JANE. By Dee Wells. 258 pages. Viking. $6.95. In the first chapter of “Jane,” by Dee Wells, two women say witty things to each other, without intermission, for eight and a half pages. On Page 39, we learn that Jane, an American girl living in London, is sleeping, in rotation, with three men: an English Lord, a Scottish burglar and a black American lawyer. Oh, I said to myself at that point, it's going to be one of those books. But this just shows the inadequacy of all such generalizations, because it is and it isn't. Despite the lack of verisimilitude in so much smart patter ...despite the improbability of a woman's concealing from one another three men who saw her every week ... despite the credulity‐straining coincidence that they were all three beautiful and “wonderful in bed” ... Miss Wells has made a better novel of “Jane” than anyone could reasonably have expected. Malicious, Affectionate Observer She rises above her strenuously jocular beginnings because she is a talented observer, both malicious and affectionate. In one chapter, for example, she caricatures palatial English country home by telling us, in almost obsessive detail, how splendid is. Naturally we know, in our worldliness, that nothing can be that splendid without a catch. And, of course, the people who live in the house are the catch. They are a neat illustration of “perspective by incongruity.” Their possessions are the only admirable things about them—and the choices were not even theirs. They have inherited world they neither made nor appreciate. The author has a good ear too, at least for the parodistic elements in people's speech that witty writers like to pick up. But while it reads well enough, this kind of writing tends to be confining because it eliminates those heavy, all‐too‐human moments when the heart labors and the pace slows. Relentlessly witty writing is rather like Herb Alpert's once‐famous bossa nova beat: no matter which tune he played, the dancers could never get a really comfortable grip on one another. I think witty writing needs intervals, like chiaroscuro, if it is to go beyond mere tickling. “Hamlet” is a perfect instance of wit's lighting up the dark places of the soul. Shakespeare could make tragedy and comedy kiss in a pun. I mention this because Miss Wells does have some serious concerns—like a lump of coal in a snowball—concealed in her clowning. Jane is a film critic and her father was a brilliant film maker with message until he committed suicide after having been blackballed by Hollywood. She has inherited his message and sometimes sounds as if the author had named her for Jane Fonda. Though they don't know it, that's a Procrustean bed Jane's lovers are leaping into. She stretches or foreshortens them according to the dictates of her politics, The author has been living in England for 20 years, and in some details she is bit out of date. When she wants to say something good about America, she maintains that our car handles do not fall off and our buses run on time. That's about as far as her patriotism will stretch, and like many of the disenchanted, she remembers the wrong things fondly. Unanimous Intersexual Tolerance Inadvertently supporting Freud's view that anatomy is destiny, Jane's intrauterine device falls out and she becomes pregnant. Now Miss Wells's novel becomes bit like those guessing games on television. Who is the father? What will the white lovers do if the baby is black, and vice versa? Jane must either be a very compelling girl—or else someone has been telling lies about men—for all three of her lovers are ready to do the right thing by her, even after they know about the sweepstakes nature of the event. And despite her determined sophistication, her dissatisfaction with all countries and cultures, Jane is willing to bring an innocent child into this world. She even allows herself to become sentimental over her suitors, and each of them reciprocates in his turn by breaking down his own peculiar ethnic, class or psychological reticences. I can't remember the last time I saw such unanimous intersexual understanding and tolerance. Jane can't have an abortion because, according to the physicians, she has already had her quota. Besides, she is 35 and feels rotten‐ripe for motherhood, which may seem something of a non sequitur coming from such an emancipated swinger. It is enough to make you believe those old wives' tales about hormones. In any case, the baby will serve as a catalyst, so to speak, one that will clarify her position vis‐à‐vis her lovers. I've been reading quite a few novels by women lately, and I suspected that, despite Miss Wells's 20 years in England, we were not going to get a Dickens ending. How were her lovers going to fail her? I wondered. What flaws in their characters, in the social structure or the human condition, would provide the denoument? Here was a situation that would test the mettle even of a writer like Iris Murdoch. But this is only Miss Wells's first novel, and we can't expect her to turn people inside out before our. very eyes, as Miss Murdoch so often does. Let's just say that her conclusion is qualitatively consistent with the rest of the book, and that “Jane” is generally fun to read and perhaps a little more than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TOWN HAIL SERIES RECALLS ITS PAST,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/10/archives/town-hall-series-recalls-its-past-politics-and-cookery.html,"When Mary Travers, Melba Moore, Tammy Grimes and Blossom Dearie sing Thursday I night—along with appearances by women of the theater and women athletes — in the last of six National Organization for Women benefits at Town Hall, that forum can be considered to have come full circle in the 80th‐anniversary year of its founding by six “suffragettes.” It may even have lapped itself a few degrees, in fact, in all‐out feminism. “This is really one giant consciousness‐raising session,” said Myrna Lamb, the playwright, concerning a previous evening in the Town Hall “Women for Women” series. The four‐hour “theater marathon,” which was also open to men, explored wittily, stylishly and often musically, such “women's issues” as family roles, sexual identity, aging, abortion and rape. ‘Politics and Cookery’ In 1884 the members of the League for Political Education, although they had founded Town Hall to help achieve voting rights for women, scheduled Miss Nellie Dot Ranches cake‐baking lessons alongside Miss Adele M. Fielde's classes in parliamentary procedure. In a yellowed clipping kept in Town Hall's safe, a newspaper of the period requested, rather snidely, that the league shed some “light” concerning “this newly discovered relationship between politics and cookery.” The series that New YorkN.O.W. conceived to celebrate the 80th anniversary and feminist origins of Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, included show by Yoko Ono and the allwomen rock band called Isis. Another, co‐sponsored by the National Black Feminist Organization, featured women jazzmusicians, gospel singers and African dancers The cumulative effect would have been a revelation in new tactics to the League for Political Education. The league and Town Hall, as an organization, were both born in the drawing‐room of the fashionable Fifth Avenue home of Eleanor Butler (Mrs. Henry M.) Sanders, the wife of a clergyman, Just after a votes‐for‐women amendment to the New York State Constitution had been defeated. Eleanor Sanders's name, carved in a marble tablet, remains over the main entrance to the present Town Hall. In its offices hang pictures of her and the other five founders she had as guests that day. They shared her belief that the defeat of the suffragists stemmed from the public's lack of political education. But otherwise, like today's femin ists, they were widely disparate. Miss Fielde, the only unmarried woman of the six, had spent 10 years in China as missionary educator and translator after sailing there to marry her fiance, also a missionary, and finding that he had died while she was at sea. Lucia Gilbert Runkle was the first American woman to write for the editorial pages of metropolitan daily newspaper. Dr. Mary Putnam‐Jacobi, born of the publishing Putnams, was the first woman admitted to the Ecole de Medicine in Paris and the first woman member of the New York Academy of Medicine. Practicing here with her husband, Dr. Abraham Jacobi, she specialized in diseases of women and children. Catherine A.B. Abbe, also the wife of a surgeon, was influential in the city's music, art and education circles. Lectures Attract Men Lee Wood Haggin, the youngest of the group and generally identified as “a celebrated beauty,” was the wife of Ben All Haggin, mother of the painter of the same name and civically active herself. Men as well as women soon thronged to the lectures and forums that the league organized—mainly in the shabby Berkeley‐Lyceum Theater at 23 West 44th Street. The question for debate on Dec. 19, 1902, was: “Does the economic Independence of husband and wife conduce to the moral welfare of both?” Both debaters were men. Eventually, the League for Political Education and other civic groups raised $1.25‐million—much of it contributed by prominent women—to build the present Town Hall, which opened 53 years ago last month. When musicians discovered its remarkable acoustics, it became a favorite setting for debuts and concerts as well as a platform for the famous and controversial in many fields. “America's Town Meeting of the Air,” an influential weekly radio forum for 21 years, began broadcasting from the hall in 1935 and soon afterward the League for Political Education became The Town Hall, Incorporated. Candace Leeds, assistant director of Town Hall—now division of New York University—called the attention of New York‐N.O.W. to the suffragists fragile, old scrapbook of news clippings. “But I would never let it out of the office,” she said firmly. “It's too valuable—it reminds us that Town Hall was breaking new ground—the way we're trying to make it again.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jackson Warns on Basing '76 Campaign on Watergate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/10/archives/jackson-warns-on-basing-76-campaign-on-watergate.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UPI) —Senator Henry M.

Paperbacks of the Month,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/10/archives/paperbacks-of-the-month-by-peter-s-feibleman-new-american-library.html,"By Elizabeth Taylor. Curtis Books. 95 cents. When “At Mrs. Lippincote's” was first published in 1946, the Book Review's appraiser was not amused: “Reading it is like sympathizing with the harassed inventiveness of a raconteur who has forgotten his joke midway.” Nearly 30 years, a dozen novels and scores of New Yorker short stories later, Elizabeth Taylor has a modest, most devoted following, who see her as carrying on the tradition of Jane Austen, Virginia. Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen. This first novel, about the World War II year Julia Davenant camp‐followed her soldier‐husband to an English seaside town, is certainly not as accomplished as most of her later works; but readers who enjoy a lightly plotted comedy of manners told with wit and relish will be happy that it's back in print. The City and the Pillar By Gore Vidal. New American Library. 95 cents. The author of “Burr,” the current No. 1 fiction best seller, was a precocious youth: he wrote “The City and the Pillar,” his third novel, at 21, and it was published two years later in 1948. Gore Vidal was trying to lay to rest the impression that he was “just a war novelist,” with this story of a doomed young ox named Jimmy, who develops homosexually as a high‐school lad, cabin boy, tennis bum and drifter through the gaudier fleshpots of Hollywood and the East. In the Book Review C. V. Terry observed that, although Vidal's first novel had been more than merely promising, “this time he has produced a novel as sterile as its protagonist.” In retrospect Vidal sees it this way? “Despite some stunning bad writing: it has rude power and honesty which has kept it alive some years now.” The Columbus Tree By Peter S. Feibleman. New American Library. $1.95. Peter S. Feibleman's first two novels—currently out of print —piqued the expectations of critics for “The Columbus Tree.” It is the story of a social‐climbing American matron, her daughter and son (New World innocents) abroad in Andalusia, where they encounter an aging Spanish count who is death in disguise. Before reaching the inevitable tragic ending hundreds of thousands of words later, the reader meets innumerable very, very good and very, very bad people, has to cope with awkward symbolism and endure many not too stirring incidents— an inconsequential murder, an abortion, a costume party, a death, some torture, to name a few. D. Keith Mano, the Book Review's reviewer, concluded that Feibleman can write well, but he didn't in “The Columbus Tree.” The Devil Tree By Jerzy Kosinski. Bantam Books. $1.50 Ever since his 1965 novel, “The Painted Bird,” Polishborn Jerzy Kosinski has been dazzling and perplexing American readers. He ran true to form in “The Devil Tree.” Jonathan James Whalen, his anti‐hero, is sole heir to a legendary fortune. In short order he flunks out of Yale, whores around on three continents, dopes up in Rangoon, tears about in a revved‐up Ford dressed like a bum back home. Finally, assuming the direction of his late father's corporation, he plots the murder of a pair of troublesome stockholders and hires experts to turn him into a championship skier. The sentences are short, occasionally embellished by an elaborate simile. In these columns Robert Alter concluded: “A dismal disappointment because from beginning to end it is a loose web of stylistic and cultural clich)s.” Elephant Bangs Train By William Kotzwinkle. Avon Books. $2.45. As a Times critic remarked when this collection of eight short stories was first published in 1971, they reveal William Kotzwinkle as fabulist, gifted bard and natural storyteller. With their Chinese concubines, Indian princes and Russian counts, some of the tales remind a reader of. Charles Perrault and Borges. Others—perhaps the most effective‐‐expose the dark corners of childhood and growing up. All are the work of a narrator testing his skills and leave the reader wondering what he will try next. The answer to that is to be found in his latest novel, “The Fan Man,” reviewed on Page 8. Israel Potter By Herman Melville. Warner Paperback Library. $1.75. “Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile,” Alfred Kazin points out in his Introduction to this new edition, “has probably been the least read of Melville's novels up to now; it has rarely been available outside of Melville's collected works.” It was first published in 1855, when Melville was beginning to venture beyond his career as a writer of best‐selling nonfiction novels (“Types,” “Omoo”) and was experimenting with the “visionary” novels of which “Moby Dick” is the supreme triumph. Loosely based on the career of an undistinguished Revolutionary War soldier who spent many miserable years in English exile, it is by no means a successful work. But—again quoting Kazin—“Melville's versatile, comic, beautifully extreme talent comes through .... despite every possible handicap from Israel Potter himself.” The unsparing portraits of Franklin, John Paul Jones, Ethan Allen and George III are fascinating. Julian By Gore Vidal. New American Library. $1.25. Like Gore Vidal's current best seller, “Burr,” this is fictionalized biography. But the time in the case of “Julian” is ancient (4th century A.D.), and the place is for the most part Constantinople and the eastern cities of the declining Roman empire, over which its hero ruled for 16 stormy months. Julian was a complex, witty, unpredictable human being, remembered today chiefly for his unsuccessful attempt to reimpose the pagan gods. Vidal tells his story through notes jotted down by the emperor, with a choral antiphony by two of his elderly mentors who copied the manuscript after Julian's death in battle at the age of 32. Dudley Fitts, reviewing it on its publication in 1964, was impressed by the way Vidal caught Julian's flashing vitality, but Fitts had reservations about “intimations of Hollywood” —elephants, dancing girls, jeweled eunuchs and “one considerable Orgy. . . . In the end [‘Julian’] does not rise above the level of high entertainment.” The Oldest Confession By Richard Condon. Dell Books. $1.50. This bravura novel, published in 1958, was Richard Condon's first and it offered a fair augury of the career to follow. It tells of the son of an American businessman who, sickened by the thievery he sees in the New World, hies off to Spain to commit crime with Old World panache. Helped along by a duchess, a bullfighter, and a U.S. Congressman with a nymphomaniac daughter, he steals three price. less paintings. “Everything is handled, and handled well, from the viewpoint of the cosmopolitan insider who knows everything there is to know about such matters as art critics, custom inspectors, wire services, bull fights and fine food and drink,” the Book Review reported. “Yet through all the ingenious plot turns the author is unable to convey any sense of the real morality unfolding before the reader.” The Original By Larry Smith. Bantam Books. $1.25. Larry Smith's turn‐of‐thecentury Michiganders are in keeping with the tradition of Erskine Caldwell's Tobacco Roaders and Sinclair Lewis's Gopher Prairie farmers. In this first novel he tells of Lige Barrett, farmed out at the age of 14 to an uncle, who eventually comes into possession of 40 acres and nine children of his own. The best and brightest of the latter is Jere, a prodigiously strong, large souled and industrious lad, who wants to do “something good and big and important.” Lige's callousness eventually makes an alienated son out of a boy of vast promise. Smith, according to reviewer Martin Alwyn, “paints a big, gloomy realistic panorama in which the rich atmosphere of horse‐drawn husbandry mingles with frustration and paradox. The landscape could have done with a bit of pruning, but there are enough originals among the characters to catch the eye.” Pigeon Pie By Nancy Mitford. Curtis Books. 95 cents. Like Elizabeth Taylor's “At Mrs. Lippincote's,” this was a fruit of wartime England, the early work of a young writer who later made a considerable place for herself in British letters. “Pigeon Pie” tells of Lady Sophia Garfield, who survives the Bore War of 1939–40, with its dreary first‐aid chores, by wallowing in fantasy—then is shocked out of it by a few deaths in the family and unwitting involvement in a spy ring. The story is wildly inventive, the manner sometimes self‐consciously arch, but the now‐celebrated Mitford style and wit both there. Return to Paradise By James A. Michener. Fawcett/Crest. $1.50. With the money he made from “Tales of the South Pacific,” his Pulitzer Prize‐winning book of semifictional reminiscences of World War II service (and royalties from the smashing musical comedy based upon it), lames A. Michener went back to see how the old places had changed. This 1951 volume of alternating essays and stories about Samoa, the New Hebrides, Fiji, New Guinea and Australia, and the manner in which white, yellow and brown men had moved in on them with their diseases and exploitations, was the result. Its romance‐cum‐realism appeal remains strong even two decades later, but a reader is left wondering what the jetand‐yen age, with its armies of American and Japanese tourists and businessmen, has been doing to Paradise since. Silas Snobden's Office Boy By Horatio Alger Jr. Popular Library. $1.25. While doing research for biography of Horatio Alger Jr., Ralph D. Gardner happened across this story serialized in the files of the old Argosy magazine. It's an almost‐typical yarn by the 19th‐century master of the American success story. It tells of Frank Manton, $4‐a‐week office boy who, in order to support his mother, takes a job as companion to an orphaned, ailing young boy who is then kidnapped by Frank's ex‐con stepfather. The chase that follows is mechanical, but as. John Seelye observed when “Silas Snobden's Office Boy” was first published in book form last year—Alger writes “with a startlingly modern style, simple and realistic, [conveying] an accurate picture of New York in his day, picking up, as he goes on, current topics both literary and newsy.” The Taking of Pelham One Two Three By John Godey. Dell Books. $1.75. This thriller, Newgate Callendar said when it appeared in hard covers last year, “offers new concept in hijacking. Four adventurers take over a subway train on the I.R.T. Pelham line and hold the passengers for ransom. . . . The reader will be on edge to see how it is carried out, or if it can be carried out. This part of the book is absolutely tops. Less satisfactory is John Godey's presentation.... He uses too many tired formulae of the Arthur Hailey school, what with characters being introduced with flashbacks, with each person carefully selected to represent a type.... Formulae or not, this book will have you breathing a little more heavily.” To coincide with “Pelham's” paperback appearance, Berkley Publishing is bringing back into print a more run‐of‐the‐mill yarn Godey published in 1948 under his real name, Morton Freedgood. “The Blue Hour” (95 cents) was received at the time as “fast, loose and entertaining... a good thriller.” Wild Pitch By A. B. Guthrie Jr. Popular Library. 95 cents. This marks the debut of the author of “The Big Sky” and “The Way West” in the detective‐story genre. True to his past, A. B. Guthrie Jr. gives the flavor of the great outdoors—a small town in the Far West, where kids are still interested in baseball and fishing, where the head cop is a strong, silent yet sensitive type. But Guthrie tries something new for him: murder. The reader feels the tension building up through the pastoral atmosphere. “A curiously attractive book,” was Newgate Callendar's verdict, “tightly plotted, beautifully worked out.” General The American Woman By William Henry Chafe. Oxford Univerity Press. $2.95. With all the talk and writing about woman's lot, there have been precious few serious historical, studies of her social, political and economic role in recent times. William Henry Chafe's “The American Woman” helps make up for that. It traces her progress, upward, backward and sideways, since the 19th century, with particular emphasis on the past 50 years. The 19th Amendment didn't help much, the Depression brought a setback, organized labor has been a definite obstacle, in‐fighting has held up an Equal Rights Amendment, real hope finally arrived with the feminism of the 1960's. This is not the work of a sociologist or anthropologist or polemicist but of a historian whose sources are the census, manuscripts, the popular magazines. A valuable contribution for the serious layperson. A Christian America By Robert T. Handy. Oxford University Press. $2.95. A Union Theological Seminary professor examines here the Protestant elements in American history from colonial times to the present, with special emphasis on Protestantism's evangelical effort to shape the nation's religious, moral and ethical standards. Robert T. Handy finds that the effort is being increasingly hampered by differences among the churches themselves, by immigration that has diluted the country's Protestant majority and by an industrialization ‐ urbanization that has encouraged the growth of secularism. A useful study in American social history that, the Book Review said on its publication in 1971, “gives a good account of Protestantism's busyness and secular stances, but not enough about its spiritual qualities.” Death as a Fact of Life By David Hendin. Warner Paperback Library. $1.50. The subject of this book is deathly: how doctors tell, or do not tell, a patient that he's dying; how children should be told about death; euthanasia; how the dying face the future; how and why people grieve and why the bereft are themselves more likely to die soon; the mania for cryogenic freezing in the expectation that science will some day find a cure for death; and the new movement to make recreation centers out of the two million acres of choice land now used exclusively as cemeteries. Author David Hendin is a science editor and, no literary artist; yet as David Sanford observed in the Book Review, Hendin's book is full of macabre facts and he “stays away from matters outside his competence.... It is all quite engrossing and not that depressing.” The Eating of the Gods By Jan Kott. Vintage Books. $1.95. Jan Kott is the Warsaw professor of literature whose “Shakespeare Our Contemporary” (Anchor, $1.95) startled, stimulated and in some ways irritated English‐speaking readers into a fresh appreciation of the Bard. This later work, an interpretation of Greek tragedy, has had a less surprised reception. In discussing the relations between gods and men manifested in the works of Aeschylus (“Prometheus Bound”), Sophocles (“Ajax,” “The Woman of Trachis,” “Philoctetes”) and Euripides (“Alcestis,” “Heracles,” “The Bacchae”), Kott addresses not fellow literary critics but those who are or could be stage directors, and his effort is always to make the playwright seem a contemporary. His state of mind is not unlike that of Camus: “Being deprived of hope is not depressing.” The translation is by Boleslaw Taborski and Edward J. Czerwinski. The Enjoyment of Scripture By Samuel Sandmel. Oxford University Press. $2.95. This is a discussion, by a distinguished Jewish scholar, of the people, events and insights of the Old Testament. Samuel Sandmel's emphasis is on the literary and diverting aspects of the Scriptural narratives, but he does not ignore their religious message. Carroll E. Simcox, reviewing the original hardcover edition, said, “This book is a mine of helpful knowledge and understanding. It has made me more aware of the element of humor in some of the oldest narratives. And it contains the best introductory essay on Hebrew verse and poetry I have ever read.” Fear and Loathing : On the Campaign Trail By Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. Popular Library. $1.75. Self‐styled “Dr.” Hunter S. Thompson covered the 1972 Presidential campaign for Rolling Stone magazine. Using the material he gathered on the road — diary entries, tape‐recorded interviews and telephone conversations with the candidates and their managers —compounded with personal narrative, occasionally irrelevant fantasies and even an extended interview with himself, he has produced an extraordinary account of what happened on the hustings between December, 1971, and the mornings after election day. He got closer to the Democratic possibilities (the urinal next to George McGovern's in a New Hampshire hotel) than he did to Richard M. Nixon (whom he knew only as an image on closed‐circuit television). “The best account of what it feels like to be out there in the middle of the American political process,” was the way Tom Seligson responded to it in the Book Review. The Invisible Government By David Wise and Thomas B. Ross. Vintage Books. $1.95. This is a dramatic narrative account by two Washington newsmen of the way the Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations responded to the challenges of the cold war with organizations (especially the C.I.A.) that secretly manipulate and even subvert foreign societies. Published in 1964, it was one of the first books to inform the American people of what was being done under the name of protecting their security. It named names And made charges against private cooperating institutions (like M.I.T.) that created a great stir. Although it may have instructed the people, it has not greatly changed the ways of the Government. Wise and Ross pleaded for a joint watchdog committee of Congress with active, independent members—to no effect. They did not raise the question of the nation's need for such clandestine operations—a basic question yet to be answered. Nevertheless, “The Invisible Government” remains indispensable for any bookshelf dealing with “national securlty.” It's Good to Be Alive By Roy Campanella. New American Library. $1.25. Roy Campanella, as even the tiniest baseball fan knows, learned the game on the sandlots of his native Philadelphia, played with the leading Negro teams until he was able to break the big‐league color line I with the Brooklyn Dodgers, hit 242 home runs and won three Most Valuable Players Awards, then was crippled in a car accident in 1958. That story and Campanella's courageous response to his tragedy are the subjects of this autobiography, which is to serve as the basis of a C.B.S. TV special Feb. 22. As the late Arthur Daley observed in the Book Review, “Campy relates the whole story with sparkling good humor .. . and his whole personality glows in the words that he himself could not write because of his disability. His editorial assistants, Joe Reichler and Dave intrude.” Jesus Rediscovered By Malcolm Muggeridge. Pyramid Books. $1.25. Eyebrows were raised when Malcolm Muggeridge, former socialist, agnostic, editor of Punch and longtime gadfly of the Establishment, published this collection of loosely related essays on religious themes. He tells how on a visit to the Holy Land for the purpose of making three television programs about the New Testament, he came to “a curious, almost magical certainty about Jesus's birth, ministry and crucifixion . . . became aware that there really had been a man, Jesus, who was also God.” His book is not only a moving, personal commentary on the Gospels and the life of Christ, but a mordant, stylistically brilliant attack on the fads and shibboleths (within and without institutional religion) that, the author feels, distort or deny Christian values and beliefs. The Myth of the Middle Class  By Richard Parker. Harper & Row/Colophon. $2.95. The widely held notion that the United States is a homogeneous middle‐class nation populated by organization men enjoying a universal affluence is rothing but a myth spread by the likes of John Kenneth Galbraith. Such is the burden of Richard Parker's book, published in hard cover last year. Mr. Parker trots out figures to show that the lower middle class shares economic inequality with the poor now, as in previous generations. Taxation and government spending devised to spread the wealth more equitably, he goes on, have failed utterly. The author's presentation is nontechnical, his manner fervent. A Nation of Strangers By Vance Packard. Pocket Books. $1.75. At least 40 million Americans change their residence every year. In many cities and towns more than 35 per cent of the population changes annually. is not unusual to find a junior executive who has moved 15 times in 20 years of marriage. A different school each year is a commonplace for many kids. This rootlessness an old American tradition; the present‐day forms it takes —the sprawl‐malls of suburbia, the Welcome Wagons and “home‐finders,” the loneliness of the birds of passage, the trailer migrations of retirees—are the latest concern of Vance Packard, our most successful practicing popularizer of sociological research. Granville Hicks, who reviewed the book in these columns, liked it but wished that Packard's style had been less affected by the jargon of the specialists whose work he is trying to make available for ordinary readers. Resistance, Rebellion And Death By Albert Camus. Vintage Books. $1.95. From 1937, when he was a young man in his native Algiers, to his sudden death in 1960, when he was one of the foremost men of French letters, Albert Camus devoted much of his energies to journalism. From his editorials, articles, essays, interviews and lectures he chose, shortly before his death, 23 that represent the ideas and views by which he wished to be remembered. “The record is all the more revealing,” Germaine Bree observed in reviewing this volume, edited and translated by Justin O'Brien, “because it is that of a man richly endowed with sensitivity and intelligence living at the center of events.” It clarifies and illuminates some of the thoughts suggested in his fiction. SDS By Kirkpatrick Sale. Vintage Books. $3.45. Students for a Democratic Society (S.D.S.) was founded in 1960 by a group of young Americans who hoped for an American left, free of pre‐cast, European ideologies like Marxism. Before it died, effectively, in 1969, it had become the center of the confident turbulence that shook the campuses, turning from protest to resistance to revolution (and Marxism). Its tangled story has never had a good history. This book by a close observer of what went on is, according to Wilson Carey McWilliams, “the most detailed, and best documented to date.” But McWilliams has reservations: Kirkpatrick Sale often seems “bemused and idiosyncratic,” too concerned with the formal records at the expense of the personalities involved, his “partisan rhetoric all the more flat because of the disillusionment he himself suffered.” Shadows on the Grass By Isak Dinesen. Vintage Books. $1.65. As the Baroness Blixen, Isak Dinesen lived on a farm in the East African bush, almost always alone except for her servants, mostly Somalis and Kikuyus, until the collapse of the coffee market sent her back to Denmark in 1931. She wrote of that life in a marvelously evocative book, “Out of Africa” (Vintage, $2.45). In this brief volume, published in her late years, she evokes memories of the time of her leaving—of her work as a doctor for the natives, of the poetic excitement of a lion hunt, of the hazards of raising coffee on the Equator. The past lives on in this charming book. Sixties Going On Seventies By Nora Sayre. Curtis Books. $1.50. This collection of pieces from a freelancer's scrapbook—first published in the London New Statesman and other magazines—casts a shrewd eye on American outcroppings during the past decade: political conventions and demonstrations; Off‐Off Broadway extravagations; student rebellions, gay lib, drugs and other manifestations of the counter‐culture. “Considering the period being flung up to light again,” Robert Sherrill said in this Review, “this could be a painful and embarrassing book; instead, one comes away liking this dotty country a bit more than before . . for every page shows Sayre to be a reporter who balances toughness with humor and kindness.” A Surgeon's World By William A. Nolen, M.D. Fawcett‐Crest $1.50. In his best seller of a few years back, ‘The Making of a Surgeon” (Pocket, $1.50), Dr. William A. Nolen recalled the five years he spent as an interne at New York's Bellevue Hospital. In this new book he carries the story on — what it's been like practicing in Litchfield, Minn., the past dozen years; the patients he meets and the problems they bring; relations with other physicians; what the life of a doctor's wife is lice. It's anecdotal, rambling, candid, thoughtful but not profound. Target Blue By Robert Daley. Dell Books. $1.75. Robert Daley, who was a newspaperman himself once, was the unprecedentedly visible Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Police Department in charge of public relations for one year and a few days under Commissioner Patrick Murphy. From that vantage point he has written this “insider's view,” a compendium of episodes of that stormy time of mob shootings and strange goings‐on in the narcotics division. His portrait of Murphy is none too genial—but, after all, Murphy asked for his‐resignation. Daley offers some clarifying points on the career of Frank Serpico, whose career is currently flickering across the nation's movie screens. The work of “an incurable romantic,” concluded Mary Perot Nichols in her review. True Resurrection By H. A. Williams. Harper Colophon. $2.45. The resurrection with which the English theologian H. A. Williams is concerned in this volume is not the traditional Christian belief in the resurrection of the dead; rather, he seeks to expand our understanding of resurrection to include personal experience and relationships and to show how these can be enriched and vitalized by the help of religious, moral and spiritual values. “True Resurrection” is sensitive, reflective statement, buttressed by well‐chosen literary and theological values, which, as one reviewer expressed it, “reflects a profound concern for the dynamic element in the Christian faith” and “enables the believer to continue to rise from the dead self of his alienation to a new life that has no ending.” The Unfashionable Human Body By Bernard Rudofsky. Anchor Books. $5.95. Bernard Rudof sky believes that human beings dislike their bodies, yet conceive of them as potentially alluring. “The Unfashionable Human Body” is lavish miscellany of things they de to “the envelope of the flesh” or add or subtract to It as a means of heightening its effect on others. The book's aim is not a systematic account of fashions through the ages but something closer to a gallery of absurdities achieved in covering or decorating the body. Rudofsky, Harold Rosenberg concluded in the Book Review, “writes easily and with wit.... An outstanding virtue of his book is its illustrations.” Why Johnny Can't Add By Morris Kline. Vintage Books. $1.65. The reason Johnny can't add, according to Morris Kline, professor of mathematics at New York University, is that educational fad of the 1960's, the New Math. It was, he declares, conceived by pure mathematicians interested in training other pure mathematicians. Dr. Kline acknowledges the shortcomings of old methods of teaching mathematics, recounts the history of the New Math movement and lines up the criticisms that have been leveled against it. For the future of science and technology, he concludes, the traditional curriculum will have to be reformed to emphasize both scientific and humanistic aspects. A harshly polemical, yet most readable indictment. Young Readers Dominic By william Steig. Illustrated by the author. Dell‐Yearling. 95 cents. (Ages 9 to 12) “What a howling and a yowling erupted! What a caterwauling! What shrieks, yelps, screams! What a running and tumbling, what diving into ditches, what scrambling to hide—in deep grass, among trees and bushes, even in brambles.” What's going on? A horde of avenging wasps are scattering the Doomsday Gang, a villainous band of “noxious nobodies,” foxes, ferrets, weasels, tomcats and rats, besieging Dominic. This is just one in a series of picaresque adventures the piccolo‐playing, hero hound has as he follows his nose. Besides other tangles with the Doomsday band there are encounters with a pig named Badger, a turtle named Wallaby, a goose named Fox, a mouse called Lyon, etc., before the end of the book where Dominic finds a sleeping princess pooch and begins “a great new adventure.” Nominated for eventual classic status by some critics, the New Yorker illustrator's first full‐length novel has too many solemnities, too many fragmentary, rapturous musings to achieve that pinnacle. If you loved “The Wind in the Willows,” you'll see the point. Kneeknock Rise By Natalie Babbitt. Illustrated by the author. Avon‐Camelot. 95 cents. (Ages 9 to 12) From the top of a mistshrouded peak, Kneeknock Rise, “on stormy nights when the rain drove harsh and cold, an. undiscovered creature would lift its voice and moan. It moaned like a lonely demon, like a mad, despairing animal, like a huge and anguished something chained forever to its own great tragic disappointments.” The villagers called it the Megrimum. In human memory no one had climbed the cliff. Enter the boy Egan, a young visitor who ascends to slay the Megrimum, believe it or not—and the villagers don't. This is a fine and not too frightening tale, wise and delicious in the telling, about the need to believe in the mysterious. Mom, the Wolf Man And MeM By Norma Klein. Avon. 95 cents. (Ages 11 to 15) We've come a long way baby. How about this dialogue in book for children? An 11‐year‐old girl hears that her mother wants to turn normal and get married for the first time: “‘You'll have a father,’ Mom said” “‘I don't want one,’ said.” Mrs. versus Ms., morality versus sexuality, honesty versus propriety — the message of this “daffy” and “daring” and “remarkable” novel as it was hailed over a year ago, is if you're matter‐of‐fact and unselfconscious, an alternate life style can be a real life lived—and a happy one at that. The Mouse and His Child By Russell Hoban. Illustrated by Lillian Hoban. Avon‐Camelot. 95 cents. (Ages 10 ta 13) Low in the dark of summer, high in the winter light; a painful spring, a shattering fall, a scattering regathered. Given this prophecy from a psychic frog, two wind‐up mice, no longer toyshop new but old and broken, set off on an arduous quest to find the lost paradise of their first home and their first “family.” The plotting of this allegory is as intricate and as carefully fitted together as the works of a clock. Beneath its face it is as enigmatic and as ultimately simple as a metaphysical conundrum in which fate seems to repeat itself in ever‐widening circles of time and place crisscrossed by coincidence. Like the fantasies of Tolkien, Thurber, E. B. White, “The Mouse and His Child” is filled with symbolism and satire, violence and vengeance, tears and laughter. Seven years ago it was greeted here by a mixed reception and went on to receive raves abroad. Now in paperback it has perhaps met its destiny: a wide and appre■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters: On the Status of Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/10/archives/letters-on-the-status-of-women-happiness-in-vermont-the-price-of.html,"TO THE EDITOR: I was surprised to read in “How French Women ant That Way—And How to Handle fhem” b y Justine DeLacy (Travel Section, Jan. 13) a quotation she attributes to me which does not reflect the content of our brief telephone conservation. I am quoted as having said to the reporter, “The point is to help each other (i.e. men and women). There is more emotional equality in France. Men and women try harder to please and interest each other.” And further on: “Upper‐class women have good professional positions today because Frenchmen don't resent intellectual womem” I did not use these words to describe the relationship between women and men in my country. Furthemore, I have repeatedly written during the last months in several widely read French publications on the subject of the professional status of women in France, and these articles, like others written by feminists or nonfeminists, all point to the discrimination women have to endure in their work, whatever the nature of their job, their training and their personal background. If only to set the record straight, I would like to mention that 8 per cent of employed women in France earn more than $460 a month (the equivalent figure for men is 24 per cent) and that 2 per cent of working women earn more than $700 a month (as compared to 10 per cent of the men). As in all European countries (this is also true of the United States) women are placed at the bottom of the professional ladder and stay there. There are, indeed, in France as in other countries a handful of women who hold key positions in the professions, and it is true that most of these women belong either by birth or through marriage to the upper classes. But generally speaking, all women are severely discriminated against in the work force as in French society as a whole: Contraception is not encouraged, abortion is illegal, sexist practices are the rule in politics, in education, in the//arts. My feminist sister Christiane Rochefor seems to have been quoted more accurately than I with the simple statement: “The situation regarding women is miserable in France.” I can only endorse this opinion, which I unequivocally share. CLAUDE SERVAN‐SCHREIB?? Saint‐Germain‐en‐Laye, France To the Editor: I read with great interest Justine DeLacy's article and I would like to call your attention to one inaccuracy. The author states that “Children are out of school on Wednesdays instead of Saturdays.” In fact, the midweek day off not Wednesday, but Thursday. That is the day the French children are sent to their parish priests and nuns for religious education. If both parents are working, the children can be left with the nuns all day if necessary. ALBA MCKEON Massapequa, L. I. To the Editor: In Justine DeLacy's article, I was surprised to read that Wednesday is the day off from school. Isn't it Thursday, the way it always has been? MIRIAM APRIL Haverford, Pa. [The French Government Tourist Office in New York says the day off has been changed to Wednesday.—Ed.] THE CHARM OF PARAGUAY TO THE EDITOR: Hans Koning's article “There Exists in the 20th Century a 19th‐Century Dictatorship, and It's Name Is Paraguay” (Travel Section, Jan. 27) would tend to discourage the tourist from visiting that country. I believe it's more to the point to refer to Paraguay as a 19th‐century country which happens to be a dictatorship. The poverty exists, and just a change of government is not likely to bring Paraguay into the 20th century; more probably, the present dictator will be replaced by another. To have compassion for the victims of poverty is quite different from trying to shelter one's eyes from the existence of this poverty. Having seen six South American countries, I am most eager to return to Paraguay in spite of its poverty, in spite of its dictatorship. It has something overwhelmingly beautiful which I did not find in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia or Uruguay. The people are proud to be Paraguayans. They are proud of their Guarani heritage. The charm and courtesy of the people is a 19th‐century trait which we could use more of in our alienated, mechanized 20th century. TED BAKER New York TO THE EDITOR: Mr. Koning does not paint a very interesting picture of Asuncion. Perhaps he did not take the time to learn about the people and life there. I have taken the time in my three visits there to get to know some people. Visiting a small town about 15 miles from Asuncion and meeting a family were the highlights of my last trip. Although there is a language barrier, the people of Paraguay are some of the most friendly and nicest people in South America. I find Asunción a very refreshing change from the hustle and bustle that exists in the other capitals of South America. HERB ALAN SCHWAPTZ Old Westbury, L. I. TO THE EDITOR: I agree with Mr. Koning that the Iguacu Falls are hardly worth a special trip, but on my way back to Sao Paulo, I happened to meet a stewardess of the Paraguayan airline. Elodia's beautiful, natural complexion and tremulous smile contrasted vividly with the toothpaste‐grin and affected manners of her colleagues from more “advanced” countries. President Stroessner may not be the most progressive leader of our times, but, to paraphrase W. C. Fields, “A man who owns a country where Elodias bloom, can't be all bad.” EDWARD D. ADLER New York THE PRICE OF CULTURE TO THE EDITOR: On a trip to Athens last November, I headed straight for the Department of Casts and Molds of the National Archeological Museum, as mentioned in “What's Doing in Athens” (Travel Section, Sept. 16), and bought up a storm. There were, however, two pieces that I wanted that were out of stock: a large statue of an ancient goddess and the double‐flute player that had been mentioned in The Times. The salesgirl suggested I order them by mail. To my surprise and dismay, when I attempted to order them I found that the prices had risen enormously. The goddess had quintupled from $32 to $160, and the flute player had doubled in price. ALAN WEINSTEIN Quee?? HAPPINESS IN VERMONT TO THE EDITOR: I read with much interest Grace Lichtenstein's “Can a Skier Spoiled by Vermont Find Happiness in the Poconos?” (Travel Section, Jan. 27). Anything that mentions Vermont is of interest to me as a new resident of the state. I'm also familiar with the Poconos since our family vacationed there for many years. There's no mistaking the fact the gas crunch is on in Vermont, but not for skiers. Bromley, Magic Mountain and Stratton Mountain have all Installed gas pumps for the use of lift‐ticket guests. We may not have a minister on our mountain, but we do have four nuns (friends of mine) in a convent in Hart. ford, Conn., who periodically pray for snow in Vermont. So after kid stuff in the Poconos, it's back to skiing with the Big Beautiful People in Vermont. RENEE KLEINMAN Weston, Va. TANIA'S MEMOIRS To The Editor: I was moved to both laughter and tears by Tanta Grossinger's delightful article, “Growing Up at Grossinger's, or, Raised Without Reservation” (Travel Section, Jan. 13). I was a counselor in the Catskills and as such was neither fish nor fowl, neither a “family member” nor an L.P.G. (lousy paying guest). However, I remember smugly leaning toward the “family member” side. In the early 1950's, I worked at the Esther Manor run by the Goldstein family of Monticello. Not a “Grossingees,” it was nonetheless a pleasant and homey resort that catered to its guests, paid its help as meagerly as possible, but provided priceless adventures for me. Tanla's memoirs took me back to the summer days of . . . ¶Sleeping in a tiny one‐windowed, bathroomless cottage with the fat cook named Bertha. She smelled of old cooking fat and soaked her underthings in a large tub under her bed constantly filled with water and bleach. My quarters were an aromatic mixture of the clean and the rancid. ¶Necking with the saxaphone player from the three‐man band in his claustrophobic room behind the stage. ¶But the bitter‐sweetest of them all was, like Tania, losing my boy friends to the “L.P.G.'s.” BARBARA BASS GRUBMAN Reseda, Calif. To the Editor: In Tania Grossinger's warm article about growing up at Grossinger's and all the colorful people she met there, she omitted one important name. It was when the late boxing champion, Barney Ross, became the first fighter ever to train at Grossinger's that the hotel started to draw prominent people in sports, entertainment, the arts and public affairs. MORT CURTIS New York To the Editor: As the former “brat” of an “L.P.G.,” I want to tell you how much I enjoyed Tania Grossinger's article. Maybe it's just because I was there at the time, but I got a great kick out of her stories and would even like to see them expanded into a book. She left out several unforgettable characters, and there are also some wonderful dining‐room stocies to be told. I'm sure that aft the New York kids who worked as waiters, waitresses and busboys would have a great tales to tell. Lots BERKOWFrZ Washington, D.C. “YOURS TRULY, HANS” After the publication of an article on German tourism, “EMs, Zwei, Drei, Vier . . . Hans and Fritz Are Coming Here” (Travel Section, Jan. 20), this department received the following interesting communication: To the Editor: Having read the article on German tourism with the proper mixture of interest and horror, I would like to disclaim — on behalf of myself and at least six thousand fellow Danes — your use of “Hans” as designation of a German person.

A Guide to Filing Income Tax Properly...,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/10/archives/a-guide-to-filing-income-tax-properly-filing-status.html,"The following section is designed to help you prepare your tax return, which must be filed by April 15. Emphasis has been placed on recent changes in the law, on court decisions interpreting it and on advice that goes beyond what is found in official instruction material. Sidney Kegs, a lawyer and accountant—he is a partner of Main Lafrentz & Co. and the man who lectures professionals on tax matters for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants—has acted as collaborator. Filing Status To begin, put your name and address on the tax return. The next step: choose your tax status. Surprisingly, this is one of the most common areas for error. Glance at the tables for married‐taxpayers filing joint returns and those for single taxpayers and it will be evident that single persons pay no more than 20 per cent above the tax imposed on those filing joint returns. Filing Status—check only one: 1 ☐ Single 2 ☐ Married filing joint return (even if on 3 ☐ Married filing separately. It spouse spouse's social security number in desig The taxpayer who is hit hardest is the married taxpayer who files a separate return. It may still be an advantage to file separately if the husband and wife have roughly similar incomes and one of the taxpayers has far larger deductions, such as medical expenses. In almost every instance, though, married taxpayers pay more tax by filing separate returns on roughly comparable incomes than do single taxpayers using their lower rate table. How do you decide your status if you're living together as husband and wife without the benefit of clergy? If common law marriages are lawful in your state as they are in the District of Columbia, where the matter was decided in the courts, you may file a joint return. If you can qualify as a head of household under the complex rules spelled out in the I.R.S. instruction sheet, there is a considerable tax saving over the rate for a single taxpayer. Ordinarily, to qualify as a head of household, you must have a dependent or an unmarried child or grandchild living at your principal residence. The child or grandchild can have an income of his own and not even qualify as your dependent and you'll still be able to file as a head of household. A case last year points to the importance of qualifying a parent as a dependent to claim head of household status. The taxpayer's mother had rental income of $1,500 and expenses on the rental property of $1,200. Since the mother's gross income, $1,500, exceeded the $750 income limit for a dependent, the taxpayer could not qualify as a head of household. You can also qualify as a head of household even if you have a parent living elsewhere. But the parent or parents must qualify as your dependents. If your spouse died last year, you are entitled to file a joint return, just as though you were still married. If you have one or more dependent children, you can continue to use the jointreturn rate table for two years following the year of death. That's a total of three years. Don't file as a head of household under these circumstances. The joint return rates are much lower. After three years, you file as either a head of household or a single taxpayer, depending upon your circumstances. Exemptions To the right of the filing status box on Form 1040 is the exemption box. The deduction for each exemption claimed is $750. Taxpayers aged 65 or older by the end of 1973 get an additional exemption as do blind taxpayers regardless of age. The I.R.S. instructions spell out the general rules for dependency. Generally, the taxpayer must contribute more than half the support for any person he claims as an exemption. Where there has been a divorce, exemption claims can become complicated. The basic rule is that the parent who has custody for the greater portion of the calendar year can claim the exemption regardless of whether that parent actually furnishes the major support. However, a parent may qualify for the exemption even without custody if the divorce decree or separtion agreement provides that he or she is to have the exemption. Further, a parent without custody who provides $1,200 or more in support—regardless of the number of children covered by the payments—may get the exemptions. This can be true when the parent with custody does not prove payment of a greater sum. Keep this recent development in mind. Under a ruling, a divorced and remarried parent may get a break. Take this example: John and Mary were divorced. Mary remarried and contributed $300 to the support of a child in 1973. Her ex‐husband contributed $1,300. Her new husband contributed $1,100. Under the old rule, John got the exemption—the new husband's contribution did not count. Under the new rule, Mary will prevail as her new husbands contribution is added in determining who contributed more than half the support.  c First names of your dependent childr you d Number of other dependents (from As for establishing support, a recent decision said that the cost of sending a son or daughter to college is to be included in the calculation. The instruction sheet spells out a special rule for determining who gets the exemption under a multiple‐support agreement. The law provides that the dependent's gross income must have been less than $750 unless the dependent was the taxpayer's child under 19 years old or an older child who was a full‐time student. Parents who have lost an infant shortly after birth should be aware of a new ruling. So long as the parents can show that the child was “alive” under local law—as evidenced by birth certificate or other official document—the parents may claim a dependency exemption. Income If you had more than one job last year, there's a good chance that you paid too much Social Security tax. The only way to get back an overpayment is to apply to the I.R.S. Make your claim of overpayment on line 62 of page 2. For 1973, the total Social Security tax withheld should amount to no more than $631.80 per individual. This tax is also referred to as F.I.C.A, (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax. Income 9 Wages, salaries, tips, and other e 10a Dividends on p(See instructions on age 6)$..... 10d (Gross amount received, if differ 11 Interest Income 12 Income other than wages, divide Dividends and interest are now reported on lines 111a and 11. Remember that schedule B has been eliminated. If you are married, you and your spouse get a dividend exclusion of up to $100 each if you own stock jointly. A husband and wife filing a joint return, may each exclude up to $100 of dividends that he or she received separately. However, neither may consider any portion of the dividends received by the other. Adjustments to Income Once you have totaled your income, there may be items that you can exclude. For example, if you have been out ill, you may have a sick‐pay deduction. This can amount to as much as $75 a week for the first 30 days and after that you can exclude as much as $100 a week. Form 2440 may be obtained from the I.R.S. to claim this widely overlooked exclusion. It is not included in the taxpayer kit. Part 11 Adjustments to In; 39 “Sick pay.” (From Forms W‐2 and W A sick‐pay exclusion that may have been overlooked is your disability pension which will qualify as tax‐free sick pay until you reach retirement age. There is, however, a dispute as to when an employe reaches retirement age for purposes of qualifying disability payments as sick pay. Several recent court cases have held that the I.R.S. regulations are wrong. The I.R.S. position has been that when a disabled employe is permitted early, retirement under a company plan, usually at age 62, his disability payments are taxable income and no longer qualify for the sick‐pay exclusion. However, in several recent court cases it was held that the payments can be treated as sick pay until the mandatory retirement age, usually 65. Moving expenses are deductible in many cases and they should be claimed on line 40, page 2. The distance rules, modified in 1969, have always been tricky. The move must be connected with your job or business. Among the expenses you can deduct are the cost of moving your household goods, personal goods and members of your family. Expenses while traveling to your new home are also deductible. You may deduct limited pre‐moving, house‐hunting costs—transportation, meals and lodging costs on one trip to find a residence. There are two more adjustments in income of which you should be aware. One is employe expenses for which your employer did not reimburse you. The other item is for taxpayers who have an HR‐10 plan—a retirement plan used by self‐employed persons. Itemizing If you do not itemize your deductions and you show an adjusted gross income of less than $10,000, go to the optional tax table in your official instructions and compute your tax. If your adjusted gross income is $10,000 or more, the tax computation using the standard deduction is a little more elaborate. Taxpayers are entitled to claim a standard deduction that reduces the amount of income subject to tax. The standard deduction is the larger of the percentage deduction and the so‐called low‐income allowance. For your 1973 return, the percentage standard deduction is 15 per cent of your adjusted gross income, with a deductible limit of $2,000. Married taxpayers filing separate returns are limited to $1,000 each. As for the low‐income allowance, the deductible limit is $1.300 for all taxpayers. That sum is divided in half for married persons filing separate returns. The standard deduction is automatically built into the optional tax tables used by those earning less than $10,000. Those earning more than $10,000 will use the percentage deduction and figure their own deductions. A note of caution has been inserted between lines 15 and 16 on page 1. This refers to unearned income of dependents. If a taxpayer, usually a fulltime student or child under 19 years of age, may be claimed as a dependent on his parent's return, the dependent taxpayer is not allowed to use the “low‐income allowance” or standard deduction as an offset against his unearned income. As an example, Junior is in college and has interest income of $1,400. This is unearned income, as are dividends. He can only apply his personal exemption of $750 against this income. The balance—$650 here —would be taxable. If the income were from part‐time employment or a summer job, the low‐income allowance of up to $1,300 plus his personal exemption of $750 would more than offset the $1,400 income and he would be subject to no tax. He can, in this situation, use either the low‐income allowance or the percentage standard deduction, whichever produces the lower tax. If he has some unearned income, he doesn't necessarily lose the right to offset income against the standard deduction. It all depends upon the amount of each type of income. Listing Deductions You may lose hundreds of dollars by simply taking the standard deduction. Many taxpayers, fearful of making a mistake or getting bogged down in detail, don't itemize when they should. If you are paying off a mortgage, the interest and taxes on the house combined with your other deductible expenses will ordinarily lead you to itemize for tax savings. If you choose to itemize you must list your deductions on schedule A. Medical Expenses Before you add up your deductible medical expenses, check to see whether you have paid premiums for medical insurance. You are permitted to deduct outright half the premiums you paid directly, up to $150. Do not make the error of lumping this payment with your general medical expenses, which must be offset by a sum equal to 3 per cent of your adjusted gross income. While most people know that a dependent's medical expenses can be claimed by the taxpayer, few realize that some medical expenses are deductible even though the taxpayer cannot claim a particular person as his dependent. For instance, you may claim expenses for any nondependent who would have been a dependent had he not had income of $750. Also, you may claim the medical expenses of a person who would have been a dependent had that person not filed a joint return. Thus, if a father paid more than half the support of his married daughter—probably married to a college student—he could claim the medical expenses he paid for her even if she filed a joint return with her husband. Medical and Dental Expenses (not com or otherwise) for medicine and dr nurses, hospital care, insurance prem etc.  One half (but not more than $150 insurance premiums for medical, (Be sure to include in line 10 below 2 Medicine and drugs ... Remember that you needn't list all the doctors and hospitals you paid, just the total for each. You will, however, continue to itemize other medical expenses such hearing aids, eyeglasses and transportation. There were a number of medical‐deduction rulings this year that showed an increasing awareness of modern social problems such as population control, drugs and alcohol. The cost of a vasectomy or the sterilization of a woman—even the cost of a legal abortion—were ruled to be deductible medical expenses. The cost of birth‐control pills was also ruled deductible. The Chinese rapprochement has led to a ruling allowing medical deductions for acupuncture. The I.R.S. also ruled that payments by an inpatient for treatment of alcoholism or drug addiction at the therapeutic center and for meals and lodgings furnished there are deductible medical expenses. Payments for supplementary medical insurance under Medicare are deductible. The monthly deductions are $5.80 from January through August and $6.30 for the remaining four months of the year, a total of $71.60. Contributions In recent cases on the deductibility of contributions the I.R.S. ruled that: ¶A fixed amount designated as a “donation” but required to be paid to a private school in addition to tuition was not deductible. ¶A payment to an adoption agency to secure a child was ruled nondeductible as a charitable payment even though the amount of the charge was based on the taxpayer's income level. There are several often‐overlooked deductions. Remember to deduct out‐of‐pocket expenses for your charitable activities such as the cost of parking, tolls, telephone calls and uniforms. Mileage is deductible at a rate of six cents per mile. Contributions (See instruc 21 a Cash contributions have receipts, cancel b Other cash contr donees and amounts Taxes The manner in which state and local income tax is handled is confusing. Many make mistakes. Do it this way: For 1973, deduct state income taxes withheld, plus any estimated taxes paid in 1973 plus the additional state or local income tax on 1972 income paid in 1973, plus any deficiency paid in 1973. If you received a state or local income‐tax refund in 1973, include it as income on your 1973 return to the extent that the earlier deduction reduced the 1972 income. The state or local tax refund is now reported as income on line 35 on page 2. Note, however, that a refund received for a year in which you took a standard deduction does not have to be included as income. If you are an investor and traded securities in 1973, make an effort to separate any transfer taxes you paid. They should be indicated on your brokerage statements. You save tax by reporting this as a deduction on schedule A rather than as an offset to the selling price on schedule D, which is for capital gains and losses. In figuring your deduction for state sales taxes, use the sales tax tables supplied with your instructions. In calculating income, in this context, include the amount of money you may have received as Social Security veteran's and railroad retirement benefits, and workman's compensation. These are all added to the adjusted gross income. Furthermore, add to the sales tax figure the actual tax paid on the purchase of an automobile, boat or airplane. Residents of New York City and other municipalities that impose local sales taxes should add to the amount claimed for state purposes the taxes paid locally. Interest Costs The Truth in Lending Act has led to several new rulings in the deductible interest area: ¶Oil‐company credit‐cards finance charges are deductible. ¶Interest on revolving charge accounts are deductible. ¶Finance charges on bank credit cards are deductible. The biggest interest deduction, of course, relates to mortgages. If you purchased a home last year, you can deduct any “points” paid to secure financing in addition to the deduction you are entitled to for the regular interest you paid on the mortgage. Points are deductible from the face value of the mortgage. For example, assume the mortgage was for $20,000, but that the taxpayer actually received just $19,000. The $1.000 payment is deductible. If you pay the interest on your parent's home mortgage, however, you cannot deduct it Since you had no legal obligation to pay it, you are not permitted ta take it. Child Care “If you are a working mother and are getting a divorce make sure at least one child qualifies as your dependent if you will need household help or plan to send a child to a nursery. Those mothers who found themselves in that situation last year probably qualify for a deduction under a fairly recent change in the law. Since last year, the law has permitted substantial deductions for child care and for the care of certain other dependents. The maximum, deduction for child‐care payments and related expenses has been raised to $400 a month. When the child or physically or mentallydisabled dependent is actually at home, the deduction can range up to $400 a month. This would include the services of a maid, babysitter and/or cook. It would not include the expenses of a chaffeur or gardener. The limit on summer camp or nursery school is $200 a month for one child, $300 a month for two children and $400 a month for three or more. The total deduction for expenses in and out of the home cannot exceed $400 a month. But watch for this secondary limit. If the taxpayer's income level is high it may re duce the deductible monthly sum. It works this way. Taxpayers earning up to $18,000 a year qualify for the deduction up to the $400 limit—whatever is spent. The amount allowed as a deduction is reduced by fifty cents for every dollar of income above $18,000. This is figured against the yearly potential deduction—not the monthly. Thus, a taxpayer who otherwise qualifies for the full $4,800 in a given year, and earned $19,000 would be able to deduct only $4,300. That Is, his extra $1,000 in income would reduce the yearly benefit by $500. (Fifty cents for each dollar In excess of $18,000) to $4,300. In other words, if you earn $27,600 or more, you can't qualify for the deduction. There are some important side issues as well. The mother may not claim this childcare deduction if the children are listed as her husband's dependents under a legal separation or divorce decree. This is true, even though the children live with her and she must pay for child care. Thus, she may wish to have the terms of her separation agreement changed or have the divorce decree amended so that at least one child can be declared as a dependent. One should be careful, though, as this may alter other tax considerations as well. The child care deduction is taken on line 32, schedule A. It is also reported on Form 2441, where you must make what is an involved month‐by‐month computation. The dependent or child‐care benefit is extended to the taxpayer's dependent who is physically or mentally disabled as, for example, a disabled husband, wife or parent. The full benefit applies if the income level is $18,000 or less. A married couple can qualify for the child‐care deduction. But there are two additional limitations. Both must be fulltime employes (more than 30 hours a week) and they must file a joint return. Last year, the Service ruled a working mother could not deduct her household expenses because her husband had been attending school and thus did not qualify as a fulltime employe. Just a few weeks ago, the Service ruled that a mother could not deduct as child care expenses, the cost of help for a maid hired to enable her to engage in charitable activities. In no case may payments made to a relative be deducted even though you might feel the relative is worth more than an outsider and you pay the relative accordingly. Home Office Expenses The recent trend of court decisions has been to allow employes to deduct home office expenses—even though the home office was not a requirement of the job. The court decisions have applied an “appropriate and helpful” test. This rule has been most helpful to school teachers working at home. (Just a few months egg, an I.R.S. agent won the right to deduct such expenses.) Basically, you are permitted to deduct a portion of your rent, electricity, heat, maid's wages, and depredation of desk and equipment. Casualty Losses The rules for deducting nonbusiness casualty losses including theft and storm damage are complicated. In general, you may not deduct the first $100 of any given loss. Many people know that hurricane damage is deductible, but few are aware that smog damage may also be deducted on occasion. The Government has ruled, a taxpayer's freshly painted home that had been enveloped by a polluting smog sustained the necessary “sudden” damage to qualify the taxpayer for a deduction. Other Deductions Legal fees in connection with a divorce or separation agreement may be deductible if the fee is broken down for advice in connection with the tax implications. Employment agency fees have been held deductible even though the taxpayer is unsuccessful in obtaining a job. Moonlighters take note: The cost of driving to your second job from job one is deductible. Odds and Ends Double check to see whether your tax might be reduced through income averaging. Generally, you are likely to save tax through this provision if you earned more money last year than you did on the average over the preceding four. The maximum tax on earned income may save taxes for high‐bracket taxpayers. Relatively few qualify for this. However, if you were married and filed a joint return reporting more than $52,000 in income, you may be a candidate for this provision. The single taxpayer earning $38,000 may also be eligible. If you are hopelessly confused and have waited until the last minute, you may apply for an automatic extension of time by filing Form 4868. However, you will have to pay a portion of the apparent tax with the filing of this form and you will be assessed interest on the balance until you pay it. Without increasing your tax or reducing any refund, the taxpayer may designate $1 of taxes ($2 on a joint return) for a special fund for the 1976 Presidential election. It does not matter if you did not previously make this designation on the 1972 return. Just check the box on the 1973 return. Of the returns filed to date, 13 per cent have checked the box. One last word. If you have any further questions, the Government will help. Call the toll‐free taxpayer assistance numbers indicated in the official instructions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Ghost of Malthus in South Asia,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/14/archives/the-ghost-of-malthus-in-south-asia.html,"UPPER MONTCLAIR, N. J. — The world must await with exceeding apprehension the first test case of what happens when the resources and economy of a vast segment of the world stop supporting a growing population even at subsistence level. The test case will surely be India and Bangladesh, and also will involve most other South Asian countries —Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives. The quality of life in this region has already begun to decline, with the fabric of society unraveling. And no man has been wise enough to think of a solution. All the historic accomplishments of South Asia cannot save it from being the first example of neo‐Malthusianism on a grand scale. Thomas Malthus began in 1798 to elaborate the idea that the population of any region is ultimately brought into line with its resources by either preventive (purposeful) checks or positive (catastrophic) checks, and that while food production is arithmetically incremental, population growth is geometric. He was proved wrong for a century and three‐quarters. But now his ghost is resurrected, for in South Asia there are no more frontiers; forceful incorporation of other lands would not allow for much population spillover and in any case is scarcely possible today; the green revolution, which provided a reprieve for the last decade, is ending; the existing population is too great to urbanize suddenly and provide itself with a consumer industrial economy, and at last there is recognition of the limitations of technology and resources. Four monumental Indian five‐year plans have produced significant industrial growth but not in proportion to population growth. In India, journalists report that a number of ministers consider 1973 the worst year since independence. Inflation is out of control. There are severe shortages of rice, wheat, millets, ptilses, cooking oils, sugar, tamarind, cement, fertilizers, plastics, vehicles, textiles, chemicals, oil products, lumber and firewood. These shortages are compounded by disruptions of electric power affecting agricultural and industrial production. The railroads, covering all India, have been halted by a series of strikes that began last August. A shortfall in fertilizers will severely hamper food production this year, just at a time when the so‐called miracle‐wheat strains of the green revolution are undergoing genetic deterioration. The shortages affect social conduct. There is unprecedented adulteration of foods by merchants, sometimes with toxic adulterants. Nobody can build a house without getting black‐market cement. Labor problems are Incessant, especially in cities such as Calcutta. And small farmers and field laborers face other problems. Their land is fragmented so that in many areas an average family must subsist on two or three acres. They say that there is less security than in past generations when each family stored food, and though villagers may appear garrulous and jovial they do have rising expectations —in diet, employment for their children, and material goods—that are scarcely met. Some of India's 21 states are doing relatively well. Punjab and Hariana are still basking in the glory of their golden wheat, whose production has doubled in a decade. Tamil Nadu is developing because of a higher level of urbanization, an intense bus network, and hundreds of thousands of agricultural pumps. Maharashtra and Gujarat benefit from a high entrepreneurial competence and the dynamism of Bombay, and also grow commercial crops. But the present slump has hit these states too. The two most densely populated states, West Bengal and Kerala, have had a long history of unstable governments, multiparty coalitions, and take‐overs by the central Government. In Kerala there is a collision between the 24 million people living along the narrow verdant coastal strip and the capacity of the land to support them. Most subsist on starchy tapioca, since the traditional rice, coconuts and fish are beyond their means. The whole Ganges plain, which was originally the womb of Indian civilization, is today, together with the Bengal plain, in the most critical situation because its people have adjusted to the rice‐cultivating life for millennia so perfectly that now they cannot change, though the land cannot support them, and the indices of modernization are lower than in most other parts of India. India's family‐planning effort, the most extensive in the world, has had only marginal effect. From 1951 to 1961 India's population growth was 21.6 per cent, but from 1961 to 1971 it rose to 24.7 per cent. Doubtless the growth rate has now peaked, since the birth rate has come down in the last few years from forty per thousand per year to 37.6. The one hopeful sign is that in urban areas, where a fifth of the Indians live, it has declined to 32 per thousand. Vasectomies have been popular chiefly among people who already have a sizable brood, and abortion was legalized only last year. ■ Pakistan has had a higher economic growth rate than India over the last two decades, since as a new nation she has had few industries and the Government has encouraged entrepreneurship. While Pakistan does have some cotton to export, her mineral, fuel and wood resources are pitifully scant. Now she, too, is beset, as India is, by shortages of cooking oils, wheat and other commodities. Pakistan's 1972 census showed a surprising 65 million. Family‐planning projects are mostly on paper, and abortion is not going to be legalized because the elite have to maintain a suitably Islamic public posture on anything that suggests promiscuity. Pakistan's population growth rate, according to estimates of officials based on the 1972 census, is 3.1 per cent a year—an intolerable level since the green revolution has peaked, and now the Government is forced to double defense expenditures to hold the country together. The population will double in less than 25 Bangladesh is in the worst condition. Two years after independence, the economy is in disarray and scarcities of every kind are acute. Production of jute, the only important export, is still far below capacity. The country must import almost all its needed chemicals, textiles, coal, cement, and most other manufactured products. Bangladesh has no mineral resources whatever since the soil is all alluvial. Her resources are the soil, water, and people's hands. But agricultural production is insufficient, and last year she had to import two million tons of foods plus most of the cotton needed for her 75 million people. Among the world's intermediate countries Bangladesh is the most densely populated, with 1,300 people per square mile, only 8 per cent of whom live in towns or cities—nearly the lowest level of urbanization in Asia. The population growth is roughly per cent a year, and demographic officials expect that it will decline by a modest two‐tenths of one per cent in the impending five‐year plan. At that rate one could calculate a density of 2,600 per square mile in 23 years. Now bands of youths, armed with guns left over from the 1971 war, are roaming the towns and countryside in Bangladesh, committing antisocial activities unprecedented for the sensitive Bengali people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once there was Emily Dickinson, spinster, recluse, making poetry out of hoarded drama; there was Edna St. Vincent Millay, head in the clouds, yearning for renascence; and there was Marianne Moore, sage duenna in a tricorner hat, working her sly alchemy with words. Repressed, romantic, fastidious together they merged into a portrait of the woman poet in America. Now all that has changed. In the past decade or more a whole new breed of women poets has emerged, intent on effacing that outworn image. In another age, poetry's reality was elusive, indeterminate, like women's lives, and so a certain kind of poetic expression came naturally to women. Yet only now when a concrete and more explicit style prevails are women publishing poetry in feverish profusion, Women's Lib has undoubteely played its part in making publishers aware of them—as a recent Times article pointed out. But even before the movement got started, poets like May Swenson, Denise Levertov, Daisy Aldan and Carolyn Kizer were articulating the new stance and drawing critical attention (regardless of their gender). Reading in three recently published anthologies of women poets, one begins naturally enough by examining the so‐called “feminine poetic consciousness,” but ends by rummaging for the poems that confront what is more important: Are women as women, using their authentic voices, mastering the art? Casting Off Drama “The young turn to poetry when the world becomes intolerable,” writes Anais Nin in a brief, diagnostic introduction to “Rising Tides.” “It is the creative drug... the creative healer.” And, indeed, colloquial and contemporary, the poems—read together—surface in a shower of words, dazzling in their directness, their sheer energy. No one is hoarding dramas any more, if anything they are exorcising them: “I'm tired/ of hand me downs/ shut me ups...I'm/gonna spread out / over America/ intrude/ my proud blackness/all/ over the place...” writes the gifted black poet Mari Evans. The new aggression, women are experiencing is directed as much toward themselves—those unwanted selves—as toward a deluded world. Adrienne Rich's seventh book is titled “Diving into a Wreck” (“wreck” standing for the myths of womanhood); Anne Sexton's “Transformations” undercuts fantasy with a demonic thrust at a common source of our innocence: the fairy tale. And Sylvia Plath's “Ariel” poems read like a bitter parody of Shelley—the imprisoned in her inanimate world, courting mortality. “Out of the ash/ I rise with my red hair/ and I eat men like air,” cries her Lady Lazarus in cynical defiance. The theatrical effect of the nihilistic Plath verse (in which the depth of bitterness never quite matches the circumstances to be gleaned from the poems themselves), is echoed in the work of other poets with less stunning impact: “They were talking of their integrity and existential ennui/ while the women ran out for six packs and had abortions/ in the kitchen and fed the children and were auctioned off” is Marge Piercy's flamboyant way of presenting the man‐woman relationship at its bleakest. The new candor can be brash and strident; it is unabashedly vulgar in its insistence on slang anatomical words. Yet its bawdiness can delight if it is alive and written with a true ear, as in Erica Jong's “Bitter Pills for Dark Ladies.” Uninhibited language in itself is actually not offensive (it can reveal the underside of the mind); what is offensive is the lapses into the banal: “I keep looking for a man who will satisfactorily replace you/ in my life” (addressed to Beethoven) is about as anti‐poetic as one can get. Poems of Existence Realists of the interior (their own), the younger poets especially, have absorbed the message of William Carlos Williams: they are thinking with their poems out of an immediate need. Though Sylvia Plath (their heroine) committed suicide and others have experienced psychotic states, they are essentially earthlings, committed to multifaceted life‐styles (as their biographies attest). Recipients of poetry awards and grants, they have acquired status. And this may be the cause of a new unease, a self‐consciousness. The intense awareness of self in poets like Miss Rich, Miss Sexton, Diane Wakoski and Magaret Atwood creates a paintul yearning, not for rebirth in the Millayesque sense, but initial birth, the knowledge that one finally exists. “Soon/,” writes Miss Rich, “practice may make me middling perfect, I'll/dare inhabit the world/trenchant in motion as an eel...” Miss Sexton's exulting “Celebration of My Uterus” is positively Whitmanesque! Wary of lovers, husbands, fathers (and other male antagonists), these women sleep like “guerrilla fighters with one eye open for attack.” In one Atwood poem, a “gentle husband” guards a paperhag that holds, along with an apple and a turnip, his wife's head, “the eyes closed.” These poets have come out of Freud but have left him behind. Their private guilts and anxieties are linked to larger evils like Vietnam and the lingering Nazi experience. Their “hallucinations”—a jumble of perceptions—derive from the nightmare of reality. If there is deadwood in these volumes(even from good poets), they are still a great bargain per page in terms of talent, energy and verbal power. Having had its “mountain moving day,” “the feminine poetic consciousness” is due for some relief. When it picks up the dreams and the alchemy again, it should play second fiddle to none.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RULE BY MAJORITY ASKED FOR MARKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/16/archives/rule-by-majority-asked-for-market-scheel-noting-paris-stance-at.html,"BONN, Feb. 15—West Germany's Foreign Minister, Walter Scheel, said today that France's conduct at the energy conference in Washington early this week was “hard to understand,” and he suggested that, in the future, decisions of the nine Common Market countries might better be made by majority rule rather than unanimously. Mr. Scheel commented in a German television interview tonight on the inability to get France to agree to all the points of the communiqué signed by the conference participants, including the eight other Common Market countries. The most important points not signed by the French provided for a future meeting of oil‐producing and consuming nations and for a “coordinating group” of senior officials to ack as a catalyst in carrying out energy programs. Of the reasons for the French conduct in Washington, the West German Foreign Minister said, “It was somehow the worry that the United States could gain too strong an influence on European policy.” France vs. the Rest Mr. Scheel, whose country presently holds the chairmanship of the Common Market Council, said: “There was no French‐German split. It was a conflict between France and the eight other members.” He conceded that “we were not able to achieve in all respects in Washington something that has not existed before — namely a European energy policy.” “And it still doesn't exist,” he added. Mr. Scheel also said that while the conflict of last week could be “healthy, in the future, perhaps we should take the few important decisions by majority vote,” rather than unanimously as is the practice now in the Common Market. Pessimism about the future course of the Common Market is widespread here at the moment. Some of the arguments by Chancellor Willy Brandt's closest foreign‐policy advisers for tighter political and economic cooperation with the United States have been strengthened by the events at the energy conference. Setback for Policial Unity Others who, like Mr. Scheel, would liked to have used West Germany's six‐month chairmanship of the Common Market Council to make progress toward European political unity have been profoundly discouraged. A conference of the nine Market Foreign Ministers that was to have been held here to discuss European‐American relations and to agree on an offer of aid and on closer cultural and industrial ties with the Arabs was put off at least until next month. Some officials here who were involved in planning for that meeting now doubt that it will be able to accomplish much when it is eventually held. And Mr. Brandt is known to believe that another European summit meeting will be required to put the Common Market back on the course to eventural monetary and political union that the heads of state set in Paris at the end of 1972.

Won't and will take yes for an answer,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/17/archives/wont-and-will-take-yes-for-an-answer-in-the-temperate-zone-mink.html,"One reads a book of poetry to find a shape of humanity, like or unlike oneself. Readers should find the first book here a terror, the second a mirror, the third a promise. Ai's “Cruelty” will be taken for kinky, black‐leather stuff; it is not. The poet has been called (by Anne Sexton) “All woman— all human”; she is hardly that. She is more like a bad dream of Woody Allen's, or the inside story of some Swinburnean Dolorosa, or the vagina dentata itself starting to talk. Woman, in Ai's embodiment, wants sex. She knows about death and can kill animals and people. She is hard as dirt. Her realities—very small ones—are so intolerable that we faihion female, myths to express our fear of her. She, however, lives the hard life far below our myths. And her man lives it with her. Here a country midwife speaks: I bend over the woman. This is the third time between abortions. . . . A scraggy, red child comes out of her into my hands like warehouse ice sliding down the chute. Here a menstruating woman whose husband wants her “this way,” in the bathtub: I am riding that invisible horse, the same one my mother rode. It's hungry, it has to be fed the last man couldn't, can you? Here a man: (From top) Kenneth O. Hanson, Eleanor Lerman, Charles Wright, Ai, Jill Hoffman, Judith Kroll. As always, I find you, beat you The corner of your mouth bleeds and your tongue slips out, slips in. You don't fight me, you never do. Murder, suicide, sexual violence, simple lust, whoredom, child‐beating occur with utmost flatness. As for true love: “I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half.” And lovewith‐pity: “come close between my thighs / and let ate laugh for you from my second mouth.” The speakers of these poems—most of whom are not the poet, and almost a third of whom are in fact men—are playing out the dramas of their lives in isolated small‐town and small‐farm settings, where their lives count for nothing more than that of a slaughtered goat, where desire is like the smell of fresh meat. Each is savage, each is victim. None blames another, none complains. Their voices form a chorus. The cruelty is theirs because it is nature's. Though she is just beginning, Ai has set herself in a league with Faulkner's novels, or with Ted Hughes's “Crow”; with those who will not take yes for an answer. Jill Hoffman's “Mink Coat” is really two books. One is a slim volume's worth of urbane lyrics, by a sensual woman, well‐acquainted with her own body, fond of clothing and ornament, fond of getting and giving love, fond of the scenes of New York City. She sees with mature intelligence: The door of the small church on the corner and the same‐day cleaner's neon heart are red. Misery from a distance resembles beauty. She can turn finely bitchy, is in a couple of mean poems about a rich shrink and a “fat Emperor of Lies” who wrote a book on Aesthetics, among his other charms: I liked him. The marvelous thing was how he masturbated with knives, thrusting them double‐edged into each trusting back. (I wouldn't mind seeing more in this vein.) Though her fantasy life inclines toward sadism, a general air of domestic tranquility reigns. She and her husband romp pleasantly in bed in a number of these poems—and one lyric, “Rendezvous,” about leaving the husband in bed at night, to nurse a child, is a little masterpiece: evocative, somewhat demonic, deeply pleasurable. After many centuries of Madonnas in the Western World, it is high time for some women to sing this topic from the inside. Hoffman's fluency makes all these poems easy to read. Then, however, appears the concluding portion of the volume, justly called “A Fiery Furnace,” and quite living up to its epigraph from Sir Philip Sidney's “Arcadia”: “O Lord (saide Musidorus) how sharp‐witted you are to hurt your selfe? No (answered he) but it is the hurt you speake of, which makes me so sharp witted.” These three sequences of epigrammatic poems center on passionate love and loss: Momentary blindness seeing you in another light, feeling suddenly As if I'd vomited, before the nausea Swells again, swallowing me up, Is all the grace I'm granted when I beg. from which, also, flows further love, further life. Each a gem of Renaissance‐tight language, all hits, no misses, they make most of what has come before look pale in comparison. This intensity is what I hope Hoffman will hang on to in her future work. On the contrary, “In the Temperate Zone,” by Judith Kroll, might have been called‐ “Out of the Hothouse,” or “Fleeing the Freezer.” For consider how torrid or frigid, how filled with screams and mutters, how insistently ecstatic or desperate, most of our poetry is—including the two books above, which I've just said I liked. What about that isthmus of a middle state, where mankind actually lives? What about health? At first bite, Kroll tastes like another cookie from the same New York cookie press as Hoffman, only funnier. She deals with various American nuisances, inchiding the war of the sexes (“Dick is the one with the weenie/ who gets to be doctor”), cowboys and Indians, guns and killing, Penn Central, Mr. Nixon, high school. Unpretentious and unromantic (“Me Jane./Me write poems”), she confides dreams and visions of all sorts. In one fantasy she tells a doctor that she is an ineffectual bee in a field of 6‐foot flowers and that be, for example, is becoming a puffy dandelion. Obligingly “opening his yellow mouth,” he becomes “a friendly flower” who allows her to blow him away. But cheek by jowl with this is a persuasive vision of her own death; and a little later a vision of the death of her father, as a blind cancer, a wobbling gyroscope, and finally a man moving away the knife under his coat, hot with baby blood, and the little girl, me, lying mortally wounded, knowing she will get up and die on for sixty years after that man in the coat: it was my father. Note the absolute acceptance of trauma here, and the perspective on it; and note above all the complete justice of her epithet for herself: “the little girl, me.” So it goes, in poem after poem. Laughing when possible, crying when necessary, tentative in the face of mystery: without trying, Kroll seems wiser than the rest of us, more whole, more likeable. A reward arrives. The close of “In the Temperate Zone” is a series of meditative poems connected with India. India is the land of Kroll's husband and in‐laws—and the poet's spiritual home. She has found it. The poems deepen, soften, grow rhythmic, grow vast as the landscapes they describe, and are “filled with invulnerable joy.” Villagers, here, follow their cows home. Grown women giggle over bangles and are shy with strangers. In this countryside, “things conspire/ to reassure you that you are nothing”; and it is reassuring and perfect and timeless as in a film of Satijat Ray. In the final poem, a sestina: I remember a high brown mountain: a pass cut through it, jagged holding in control the animals, trees, underbrush, and sky — nothing escaped, not even my sight; and the pass extinguished itself at a temple on top, without noticing it had used itself up, it had reached its object. Though the poet does not say she has had “mystical experiences,” she has had them and offers them to us simply and surely. Her work is sane, winning and healing. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Syracuse U. Professor's Sex‐Education Comic Books Aren't Funny to Everyone,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/18/archives/syracuse-u-professors-sexeducation-comic-books-arent-funny-to.html,"SYRACUSE—Some people think that Sol Gordon's comic books are outrageously funny. Others think they are just outrageous. Dr. Gordon, a 50‐year old psychologist, is professor of child and family studies at Syracuse University and director of the university's Institute for Family Research and Education. He also is the originator and author of a series of controversial comic books for adolescents that deal with subjects not usually treated lightly. Dr. Gordon's comic books, which are published by the institute, carry such titles as “Ten Heavy Facts About Sex”, “Protect Yourself From Becoming An Unwanted Parent”, “VD Claptrap” (featuring Capt. Veedee‐o and Ms. Wanda Lust), “Drug You?—A Survivor's Handbook” and, on the nonprovocative side, The Eater's Digest.” One‐Million Sold “You can't communicate with someone about subjects like sex and drugs if he's uptight,” Dr. Gordon said. “We use humor to reduce the anxiety of teen‐agers. Besides, comic books are the only things that a huge number of adolescents willingly read.” Since Dr. Gordon started bringing out the comic books two and a half years ago, about 1‐million copies have been sold—at 25 cents single copy but cheaper in quantity — to educational and youth organizations, planned parenthood groups, community agencies, schools, parents, and teen‐agers. The best‐seller (625,000 copies) and most controversial is “Ten Heavy Facts About Sex.” It had been banned from general distribution at the annual State Fair here. An appeal in behalf of the publication's distribution was filed last month in the State Court of Appeals by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Dr. Gordon said his comic books, which are illustrated by Roger Conant are geared to the “non‐reader” or unsophisticated teen‐ager. He got the idea for the publications, he added, after finding that most teen‐agers did not read the more conventional books on sex and drugs that were available. “There are about 200 books on sex education for teen‐agers,” he said in a recent interview on campus. “But they're read mainly by librarians. The average teenager would never read a book on sex—he'd be afraid he'd lose status if his friends found out.” “Ten Heavy Facts About Sex” deals in explicit language and cartoons with such matters as masturbation (“It will make you walk crooked,” an uninformed young lady tells her friend), homosexuality, oral and anal sex (“We think there is nothing wrong with any kind of sex if both partners are mature and it doesn't hurt anyone,” the text asserts), veneral disease, pornography, birth control and abortion. On the subject of pornography, the book declares, “Pornography is harmless. After a while it gets boring. If porno is your bag, you don't have much of an imagination of your own.” The book ends on a note that “Morality Is Good For You.” It also offers some parting advice. For “guys,” this includes: No sex unless you are ready for it” and “Machismo is when you're man enough to take care of the family you started.” Among the advice to girls is “Don't fall for lines like, ‘If you don't have sex with me we might as well stop seeing each other,’” and “No sex with anyone who doesn't really care about you. (Test this by finding out if he'll go out with you even if you won't have sex with him.)” Dr. Gordon feels, that “parents should be the sex edu cators of their children, but that society, in the context of the schools, churches, and community agencies, has a responsibility to young people whose parents are not educating them in this respect. Last summer, the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court ruled, in a 3 to 2 decision, that distribution of “Ten Heavy Facts About Sex” had been ??ustifiably halted at the State fair in 1971. The majority o??inion said that while no one conte??ed that the book was obscene, the publication “suggests that sodomy is acceptable and it surely condones and encourages homosexuality and bisexuality, if one is so inclined, while conceding that the majority of the people favor heterosexuality.” Dr. Gordon disagrees with this finding and said he will appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary. In the meantime, he is busy. Four new comic books on smoking, women's liberation, alcohol and the promotion of mental health are in planning at the institute. Their publication will depend, Dr. Gordon said, on whether the necessary financing can be obtained from foundations or other sources. Dr. Gordon has also finished a new book, his “eighth or ninth,” on “Sex and the Family: A Guide For Parents and Children,” to be published next fall. And he has just finished the 60th half‐hour program for a television series that made its debut last month in Canada. The title of the series, in which Dr. Gordon is host, is “This Program Is About Sex.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
View From a Parish,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/18/archives/view-from-a-parish.html,"London's Hyde Park turned out, for me, to be quite a disappointment. expected to hear a lively dialogue between speaker and listener on a whole spectrum of issues. Instead, I found only fruitless confrontation, closed minds on both sides—mountebanks versus hecklers. Has something like this breakdown in communications begun to occur between, New York's Roman Catholic hierarchy and laity, between those who hold the “official Catholic position” and those who are concerned for the well‐being of our whole society? Not that the church owes New York any apology for its role in this town. We've been around for a long time, and we've been involved. Witness all the schools, hospitals, social agencies, orphanages and immigrant services. We haven't run away from the inner city or the “changing neighborhood,” And we'll stay—not playing the same role, of course, but we'll be where the action is, and we're not afraid to get our hands dirty. Our community counts among its members many people on both sides of the major issues: the newly arrived immigrant as well as the immigration official; the happily married and the divorced; the innocent victim, the criminal and the leader of the crime syndicate; public‐school and privateschool principals, teachers, parents and students; the frightened middle class as well as the poor living on welfare; the racist and his victim; the woman having an abortion as well as her doctor. To represent so many different people honestly and to provide them with useful moral leadership is not easy. Can we any longer be satisfied with the kind of “soap‐box morality” that simply shouts prohibitions—no birth control, no abortion, no sex outside of marriage—but with no mention of human problems? Can we go on with our maneuvers to get political support for “official church positions” by such open threats to our fellow New Yorkers as “save our schools or we'll flood yours” and “Iegislate against abortion or be exposed as anti‐Catholic”? Have we even noticed that large numbers of our own people ignore the “official” teachings and refuse to lend political support to the “Catholic” side of current issues? Why do most Catholics practice birth control? Is it true that most of New York's abortion patients are Catholic? Haven't the human experiences of our people taught us to be flexible and to avoid making up burdens impossible to carry? I believe that today we can settle for nothing less than true moral leadership adapted to the real needs and circumstances of the people who look to our community for strength and direction. Would it not be a betrayal of many sincere people to expose them to more Albany demonstrations, press releases and bishops' letters repeating the so‐called “moral absolutes”? Can't we trust more in the basic goodness of people, in their fundamental life‐decision to do what is right, and in their good judgment to choose what, before God, seems right for them as they make the complex moral decisions required of each of us? Our approach to moral leadership must become more catholic, more universal. There are situations in society that demand not new laws but the dispassionate attention of whole communities. Has our society been focusing its attention sufficiently on its most fundamental moral issues: economic exploitation, inequality of opportunity, political” and military accountability, adequate evaluation of schools, wars and production of war machines instead of more beneficial products, personal irresponsibility in some life‐styles, a just immigration policy, use of wholesale abortions instead of finding effective means of birth control, racism, escapism through drugs, our worldwide responsibility to the poor? Isn't it true that every act of man (even killing) is sometimes good and sometimes bad? Isn't the moral value of our individual acts governed, by some fundamental choice we have made to orient our whole life either to take care of ourselves above all or to put ourselves at the service of others? Is it because we have failed to convince even our own people of our “official position” that we are seeking to legislate morality? Don't we see that making of laws is a power that can corrupt the whole society if used blindly? Don't we risk encouraging crime and graft by making unenforceable laws against gambling, prostitution, sex movies, pornography? Don't we risk favoring one group in our society over another by insisting on legislating the “Catholic point of view” on abortion and private schools? In general, are we trying to use legal force as a substitute for deep moral reflection on the common problems that our whole society is facing? Do we teach “moral absolutes” because we are afraid to put ourselves into the complete moral situation in which people here are finding themselves as they try to judge what is right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'74 Elections: G. O. P. Dilemma,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/21/archives/174-elections-g-0-p-dilemma-news-analysis.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 20—The premise of Democratic strategy in the upset victory Monday in the Congressional election in Grand Rapids, Mich.—and the shattering implication for Republicans everywhere—is that disapproval of the Nixon Administration is now the most powerful cur rent in American politics, even in “local” contests. As resolute a Pollyanna: as George Bush, chairman of the Republican National Committee, now sees a possibility for the first time that the Watergate scandals may damage Republican candidates in three or four special Congressional elections yet to come and in the November elections. But from the managers of the campaign that elected Richard F. VanderVeen, an oft‐defeated Democrat, to Vice President Ford's old House seat, the message sweeps far beyond Watergate. “It wasn't Watergate,” said John Marttila, a Boston‐based consultant whom Mr. VanderVeen credited with the victory. “It was RiChard Nixon, the person, and what Richard Nixon is doing to the country, whether it's Watergate, or the economy, or the energy crisis, or infla. tion, people are saying: Under this Administration, nothing gets done right.” For Mr. Marttila, the most important statistic in politics today—and the engine of Mr. VanderVeen's triumph—is the nearly 60 per cent “negative” figure on Mr. Nixon's job performance, a figure that turned up in Republican Grand Rapids and persistently in national opinion surveys. For Republicans, however, the anti‐Nixon bloc is only one side of a political vise. The other side is the hard core of Nixon supporters, roughly 25 per cent of the electorate nationwide, which also represents the financial and activist base for most Republican candidates. Even after studying the results from Grand Rapids, Republicans in Congress were holding to the orthodox doctrine that while it is precarious to be associated with President Nixon, it is suicidal to speak against him. To many Republicans, the dilemma of 1974 begins to look like a problem without a solution. On to Cincinnati Republican campaign professionals, who are packing up in Grand Rapids and moving now into Cincinnati for the next special Congressional election two weeks away, were speaking tentatively today of reviving an old cluster of campaign issues: busing, abortion and welfare. Much as Spiro T. Agnew as Vice President tried to distract voters from the economic problems of 1970 with his national campaign against Congressional “radic‐libs,” some Republicans would reach again for a “social issue” against Democrats. “It certainly beats talking about people sitting in lines to buy gasoline,” a senior Republican tactician remarked. But the same man admitted a degree of desperation about the move. He was not confident that a social issue, or anything else, will work even in the Cincinnati district, historically almost as strong a Republican bastion as Gerald R. Ford's old bailiwick in Grand Rapids. “Right now we're behind,” he said of the March 5 Cincinnati race, which will coincide with a possibly decisive primary for the seat of the late Represents; tive Charles M. Teague, Republican of California. In the combined field of six Democrats and one Republican in the California campaign, if anyone wins more than half of the primary vote, under state law, he will be elected to the House. Beyond searching for new issues, anxious Republicans were putting fresh stress today on the importance of organizational mechanics. Particularly in special elections where voter turnout is customarily low — it was under 40 per cent in the Michigan voting Monday — the efficiency of party cadres in identifying and getting out their votes can be crucial. Bewailing Republican overconfidence in Grand Rapids, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, admonished Cincinnati Republicans as if sheer organizational energy were the key to victory. “Look, we can't spell it out for you any more more clearly,” Mr. Michel said, “You've got to produce on Election Day with votes.” Symptom of Problem Yet the matter of organization despondency and low Republican turnouts — a devastating burden on Republican candidates in New Jersey, Philadelphia and elsewhere last year — seems to most party officials a symptom of their larger problem in the White House, not something that pep talks can cure. The puzzle for Republicans remains how to get around the disenchantment with Mr. Nixon without publicly turning their backs on their President. Ironically, the “Nixon problem” does not seem to exercise Mr. Nixon. According to Gerald L. Warren, the deputy White House press secretary, when the President met with Republican leaders this morning he mentioned neither Watergate, nor the Grand Rapids election, nor the fall campaigns for Congress. However, Representative John J. Rhodes of Arizona, the House Republican leader, said that the President had talked fleetingly of the “political climate” that caused the loss of the Michigan House seat. Mr. Rhodes said that the President had spoken in passing of his “disappointment at the outcome” of the special election, layoffs in the automobile industry and the energy crisis. Significantly, the party's distress about: Grand Rapids does not seem to build Republican I support for Presidential impeachment. Republican defeats in other special elections may prompt a few more calls for Mr. Nixon's resignation, but for most Republicans they would simply tighten the vise in which they already feel helplessly caught. I “A Republican can't be flatly anti‐Nixon and survive,” Representative William A. Steiger, a Wisconsin Republican, re marked today. Mr. Steiger has a special understanding of the point, having been first elected in 1966 in an upset against Democrat who was trying to disassociate himself from President Johnson. Johnson loyalists stayed home and Mr. Steiger, in winning, learned the lesson that no candidate can alienate his party militants and hope to get elected. “Republicans are in a bind, no doubt at all,” commented Senator Bill Brock of Tennessee, chairman of the Republican Campaign Committee in the Senate, “The potential benefit in speaking out against the President is better treatment in the press and possible gains among Democrats and independents. But there's a sizable risk of alienating the people who work the precincts, the bedrock of the party, who feel the President's been ill‐used and who figure you don't walk away from a fight.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Father Takes Custody of Children And Mother Thinks It Best,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/22/archives/father-takes-custody-of-childrenand-mother-thinks-it-best.html,"It began to happen too recently for there to be any statistics, according to Arnold J. Gibbs chairman of the American Bar Association's section on family law. “These women, not unlike men, believe they owe it to themselves to develop as persons, and they don't always want to wait for the nest to empty before they start on the developing.” “But I no longer bat an eye when get one of these cases and they're going to happen more frequently,” the Baton Rouge, La., lawyer said, referring to the increasing number of women all over the country who, when trying to cope with a broken marriage, are voluntarily handing over their children to the husbands. If Mr. Gibbs no longer bats an eye when this kind of custody occurs in the Deep South where, not so long ago, even a divorce was a disgrace, then can be taken for granted that lawyers in New York and its suburbs are getting such cases, too. For instance, Joan Goldberg of the Manhattan law firm of Kuntsler, Hyman & Goldberg, said she's never had a woman client who voluntarily gave custody until about two years ago. “Since then I've had at least four,” she noted. Catherine T. England, of England & England in Suffolk County, said she's had two such cases in the last couple of months; Janet Alter, of Kaiser & Alter in Westchester, said she'd had none three years ago but last year had four; Michael Atkins, of Taylor, Atkins & Ostrow in Nassau County, had none until two years ago, but in the last couple of years had four. Other lawyers in the city and suburbs report similar increases, with the suburbs having an edge. “There used to be such a stigma,” Mr. Gibbs explained. “It was a total defeat for a woman who gave up her children. Now, though, women's liberation has made people think about what ‘equal’ really means. A woman who removes herself from the role she was traditionally cast in is not judged as harshly as she used to be.” Dr. Paul Vahanian, an associate professor of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, who also does marital and family counseling, agrees that the growing numbers of women willing to give custody of their children “has to do partly with the whole liberation thrust.” “More women are becoming economically independent,” he said, “and, as they become concerned with what they want to do with their lives, they decide that raising children is not their number one priority. “These women, not unlike men, believe they owe it to themselves to develop as persons,” he went on, “and they don't always want to wait for the nest to empty before they start on the developing.” Emily Goodman, a Manhattan lawyer, put it this way: “Women have begun to realize that a man doesn't have to make a choice between a career and fatherhood; only a woman is expected to have to choose between having a career and being a mother. “I had one client,” she recalled, “who said she was tired of the husband's getting the stocks and bonds while the women got the kids.” Just how much censure a woman must endure if she tries to reverse this time‐honored situation is hard to estimate because lawyers and sociologists don't agree. Joan Goldberg, for instance, said she thinks “there is still community disapproval.” But Elaine Sheps, a Manhattan lawyer, said, “Some of the guilt syndromes have been removed;” Joel Albert, of Albert & Liebowitz in Bergen County, N. J., said he believes “the stigma is no longer there,” and Dr. Vahanian observed, “According to much of today's thinking there is nothing wrong with women who are willing to give custody of their children; the atmos phere now surrounding our lives provides more options than the traditional ones.” But the public's more liberal stance hasn't totally convinced mothers who have yielded custody of their children. Most of them are still apprehensive about “what people will say” and are reluctant to talk about what they have done, even with their lawyers. “They just want to put the whole thing out of their minds,” or “They seem to want to forget that it ever happened,” the lawyers say with surprise and even some bewilderment. From the lawyers it was learned that most of the women lfad given up their children because: (1) the wife had wanted to change her life‐style by resuming a career, going back to school or to work; (2) she had fallen in, love with another man and didn't want to be encumbered; (3) she was convinced she could not handle the children emotionally or take care of them financially; (4) she was a lesbian and would probably lose custody anyway; (5) she was bought off by a big settlement (this was the rarest of reasons). Some mothers did finally agree to talk, but only after they had been prom ised anonymity. From conversations could be seen that the degree of guilt felt varied substantially. Some of the women felt that other women envy them and several mentioned the possibility of trying to get the children back “someday.” (This is not necessarily an empty dream.) “No surrender of custody is truly permanent,” Mitchell Salem Fisher, a Manhattan lawyer, pointed out. “It can always be reopened.” One who is thinking of eventually reopening it is Cynthia. She told the other day of how she had married young, gone to live in a suburb, had a son and daughter and found the marriage almost unbearable from the beginning. “We had long talked of divorce,” she said, “but my husband always said he would never let me have one unless he could have custody of the children.” By the time her son was 12 and her daughter was 13 she was willing to give custody of them in exchange for her freedom and so her husband, a businessman, went to Santo Domingo for divorce. Cynthia, who had always been interested in the arts, came into Manhattan, took a loft and is managing to support herself. She is permitted to have the children every other weekend. “They were hurt In the beginning and it has been a traumatic experience for the three of us,” she said. “But they are happy in their suburban school, they're into a lot of extracurricular activities, and it would have been a shame to pull them away from there. They are in a stable surrounding — their father hired a housekeeper — and they seem to be getting adjusted. About a year ago, when it first happened, the boy talked out with anybody, friends, teachers, just anybody, his grief and bewilderment ...” After a moment Cynthia went on. “This was a drastic measure that took,” she conceded, “and I thought would be regarded as a terrible person, a black sheep, but no. Friends, other women, keep calling and wanting to have lunch and then they ask me if think they could do what I did; I think some of them envy me.” Jane, another mother who willingly gave custody, also lives with the hope that she will have her children again. “I have the feeling that when they grow up they will come to my place and hang out,” she said. Jane was 17 and her husband 21 when they married, and she was pregnant when she finished college. When their son was a year old they had a daughter who, when she was about 4, had to have open‐heart surgery. The marriage had been troubled from the beginning and when Jane found she was pregnant with a third child, just before the second was to have the heart operation, she considered an abortion. “The reason I didn't,” she said, “was that I thought if I lost my little girl another she had surgery, then I'd want another baby, so I went ahead and had the third one.” By the time the infant was three months old — the other children were then 4 and 5 — Jane and her husband separated. After the breakup Jane moved into another apartment, took the children with her and went on relief. She said her husband was unable at that time to help financially. After a two‐year separation they were divorced. “At first the welfare check was enough,” Jane recalled, “and I just stayed home, hibernating, looking after the children. I knew there were lots of things going on out there in the world, but there was I, living this dull, secluded existence. “So I went out and got a job as a volunteer and gradually I made new friends and soon there were lots of people coming and going at my place, with some of them sleeping over, and our quiet little household was getting outof hand.” Jane said the children's father was seeing them every weekend. “They had always loved him, and when he remarried and had two stepchildren, a boy of 13 and a girl of 5, my children became a part of that family on weekends. Then as I began to go out more and more I became more and more dependent upon my former husband and his new wife to take the children for longer periods.” Jane paused to think things over. “I knew I wasn't being the kind of mother I'd wanted to be,” she said, “and I started ‘getting it’ from everybody — welfare, neighbors, relatives. was already feeling cornered when learned that the child who'd had open heart surgery had an incurable bone disease.” She paused again. “I simply wasn't ready to sacrifice my life to that, so long as I had a choice,” she said. “So, one day when my husband and his new wife brought the children back from visit and said they'd been thinking things over and would like to have custody of them, I said ‘Yes.’ “I was the one to tell the children,” she continued, “and they didn't seem to mind, except the littlest one. It mixed him up some and he still cries when say goodby to him. But they are really happy and I don't feel that I gave up my children anymore than my husband did when we separated and I kept them. “When I do have a pang of guilt tell myself how lucky I was that he was willing to take custody; a lot of other women would give their right arm to have a similar opportunity.” Another pause, a longer one this time, “I don't know how all this is going to wind up,” she finally said, “but right now I'm satisfied.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guide GOING OUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/23/archives/going-out-guide.html,"LIB AND LET LIB The Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective consists of five women writers who present their plays on feminist themes in the Westbeth artists' housing center, on West Street, between Bethune and Bank Streets. They've recently set up their own permanent theater in one of Westbeth's large groundfloor galleries, and now, of course, they need help to pay the rent and put on their shows and so on. So tonight, from 9 to midnight, the collective is staging a benefit show and auction for itself in its new home, and anyone, regardless of sex, is invited in, at $5 a head. You'll hear music by Jennie and the Roseberries, a women's country ‐ and ‐ rock combo; see the Chammansky Sisters, a comedy trio, and you'll be able to look at an erotic feminist peep show created by Anita Steckel, the artist. You'll also be able to bid at auction for a handwritten poem by Muriel Rukeyser; a screen script by Eleanor Perry; a box of collages with a poem about abortion by Roslyn Drexler; drafts of poems by Erica Jong, a ring designed by Noma Copley, jewelry sculptor, and much more.

DELAY Joseph White (1833–1920) was an American composer who had to go to Europe to study and studied so well that he won a violin competition, gained a large reputation in Europe and became a head of the Paris Consistoire. He returned to his native land in 1875, performed in concerts, including one with the New York Philharmonic, and drew fine reviews. The problem that determined the course of White's life arose from prejudice: He was a black man, and black men did not easily enter classical music circles in this country. In 1867, his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra was performed for the first and only time. You can hear its American premiere tomorrow at 3 in Avery Fisher Hall, 63d Street and Broadway (TR 4–2424), when it is played by the Symphony of the New World, with Ruggiero Ricci as soloist. The manuscript of the work comes from a collection of compositions by black classical composers of the 19th century in Brooklyn College's Institute for Studies in Ameriean Music. The interracial orchestra is including it in its traditional February Black History Month concert, consisting only of music by black composers. You'll also hear the premiere of a new “Moorish Sonata for Orchestra” by Wade Marcus; William Grant Still's “Festive Overture”; Howard Swanson's First Symphony, and Tania Leon's “Tones for Piano and Orchestra.” Admission $4 to $7.

The composers usually bring along friends and perform a bit as they go. The first speaker is Loudon Wainwright 3d, the 25‐year‐old rock composer who has four albums under his name. On March 10, Al Carmines of Judson Memorial Church, a prolific composer, appears. April 14, you'll hear Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, lyricists from Nashville country and on May 5, Sammy Cahn does a reprise. Admission: $3.50; to all four, $14. ... The New York Choral Society is going to tackle Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, a work, they say, that is rarely heard because it is tough to sing.

News of the Screen,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/24/archives/news-of-the-screen-stone-buys-rights-to-irregulars.html,"Cheryl Crawford, a stalwart of the theater as a producer for more than 30 years and as a founding member of the Group Theater in the early nineteenthirties, will now make her debut, as a movie producer with a film based on the career of the late Tallulah Bankhead. She has joined with Joe Calcagno, an Off Broadway producer, to acquire rights to “Tallulah,” the star's 1952 autobiography published by. Harper and Brothers, and other source materials from Eugenia Rawls, an old friend of the actress and “owner of the properties,” Miss Crawford reports. Miss Rawls will also be the associate producer of the film. Terrence. Rattigan, the playwright‐screenwriter, who also was a friend of Miss Bankhead, is interested in writing the script, Miss Crawford said. “We've been discussing it for several months and he's due in from Bermuda soon, when we expect to elaborate our plans for the script.” Miss Crawford, who had planned to break into movie production three years ago with an adaptation of the Mary Webb novel “Precious Bane,” which, she said, “never did get off the ground,” added that she was convinced that “Tallulah is as terribly interesting as the subject of a film as she was as a talented, dynamic person. worked with her and got to know her as a really rare, fascinating creature.” It was too early to consider a director or cast for the movie, she said. For the record, it should be noted that Filmtree Productions, a local company, is also planning a feature titled “Tallulah” based on “Tallulah, Darling of the Gods,” the book by Kieran Tunney. That film will concentrate on the relationship between the author and the actress. Cates Will Direct Ghetto Musical Gilbert Cates, the director of “Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams,” which garnered a couple of Oscar nominations, and who is also completing the television version of Arthur Miller's play “After the Fall,” appears to be just as active as Mr. Stone. He's been signed to direct the screen adaptation of the 1971 Off Broadway musical about ghetto life, “The Me Nobody Knows,” which will be produced by Edgar M. Bronfman Jr. Shane Stevens, the novelist, is making the adaptation. “It's his first script—and while we haven't cast it,” Mr. Cates said, “we hope to start shooting it in July, entirely in Harlem.” “I also plan to film his 1971 novel; Way Uptown in Another World about a young black man's rough experiences from Mississippi to the East Village here,” Mr. Cates added. Also on his docket is “After a Long Time Lonely,” an original script by Peter Nelson and Sandra Scoppetone about a Lesbian love affair. “I'm negotiating the deal now,” he said. “Once it's completed, I'll make it for my own Jamel Productions.” Stone Buys Rights To “Irregulars”  List Peter Stone as a writer who doesn't intend to rest on his laurels, such as an Oscar for “Father Goose,” a Tony for the Broadway musical “1776” and an Emmy for a 1968 “Defenders” script on abortion. Mr. Stone, who did the screenplay for “The Taking of Pelham 1–2– 3,” the feature about a $1‐million hijacking of a subway train which is now being shot here, reveals he's already involved in three other movie projects. He has just acquired rights, he said, to “The Leavenworth Irregulars,” a novel by William D. Blankenship, due from Bobbs‐Merrill next month, dealing with a plot to steal a $600,000 Army payroll by three Army men who had served time in Leavenworth Penitentiary after being court‐martialed in Vietnam. Palladium Productions, which with Palomar Productions is filming “Pelham,” will be associated with him in producing “Irregulars” for United Artists. Mr. Stone plans to start that script as soon as he puts the finishing touches on “The Grand Defiance,” the 1972 novel by Bernard Frizell about the World War II escape of a top French general from his Nazi captors, Fox and Palladium will film this adventure, which is still to be cast, starting, probably in September, on the Continent. He's also at work on an original script, “The Ornament,” which he describes as “an ironical racial comedy about a young guy who poses as being partly black.” There's also a stage musical titled “Subject To Change,” in the works, because said Mr. Stone, laughing, “I like to be active.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Democrats Given Edge in Ohio House Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/28/archives/democrats-given-edge-in-ohio-house-race-gop-anxiety.html,"CINCINNATI, Feb. 27—Only three times in this century—in 1912, 1936 and 1964—have the conservative voters of Ohio's First Congressional District sent a Democrat to Congress, Next Tuesday, in the View of local politicians, there Is a good chance they will do so again. The outcome of the special election here is of intense interest to both national parties, which view it as another index of the effects of Watergate, after Democratic victories in Johnstown, Pa., and Grand Rapids, Mich. If the Democrats win here, it could signal a Democratic sweep in November and increased pressure on President Nixon to resign. “If we blow this one,” said an official at the Republican National Committee in Washington, “I expect to see something approaching panic on Capitol Hill the next day.” The Republicans said that Ohio's Democratic Governor, John J. Gilligan, who carried the same district in 1964, “would send Phantom jets and napalm in there if it would help.” G.O.P. Anxiety In fact, the Republicans have sent in a platoon of technical advisers, headed by Edward Maye, chief of the national committee's political division. Their complacency in the Grand Rapids race has been replaced by anxiety here. On the Democratic side, labor is continuing its all‐out effort to take seats away from the Republicans. In addition to providing help with phone banks and mailings, the unions have provided money—$15,050 from 15 labor groups, including the hotel and restaurant workers and the machinists. The candidates have sewed together for years on the Cincinnati City Council, and both are former Mayors. But they are dissimilar in most respects. Willis D. Gradison Jr., the Republican, is slight, aristocratic, a stockbroker with intimate ties to Cincinnati's First Family, the Tafts. (His father was the late Senator Robert A. Taft's campaign manager.) Thomas Luken, the Democrat, is bulky, middle class and blunt. Mr. Gradison, walking through this riverfront city and its suburbs four or five hours a day, insists again and again that he is his own man, not Richard Nixon's, and that Mr. Luken would be obliged to vote the labor party line. On Watergate, the 45‐year‐old Republican candidate, who is a moderate on most issues, has carefully separated himself from Mr. Nixon. The President, Mr. Gradison said in an interview this week, “has been too secretive and too legalistic.” He added: “He, should give the courts the key to the White House. The courts are not going to give state secrets to our enemies.” This weekend, Elliot L. Richardson, who resigned as Attorney. General last October rather than comply with President Nixon's order to dismiss Archibald Cox, then the special Watergate prosecutor, will campaign for Mr. Gradison. Mr. Richardson worked with Mr. Gradison in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Although perhaps not designed as such, the Richardson visit will constitute another symbol of Mr. Gradison's independence. Mr. Luken has not emphasized Watergate as much as the upset victor in the Michigan race on Feb. 18, Richard F. VenderVeen. Against the advice of some of his aides, he is talking more about inflation, unemployment and energy. “Watergate isn't the issue, Mr. Luken said. “It's only a part of Nixon's inability to deal with the problems of the country. People aren't afraid of Watergate, they're afraid of gas shortages and prices.” Nonetheless, Mr. Luken has tried without much success to needle Mr. Gradison into a conflict over impeachment. Neither man has said how he would vote on the question, but. Mr. Luken is willing to say that it would not be necessary to demonstrate criminal conduct for him to vote to impeach. In the final 10 days of the campaign, abortion has become ?? major issue, perhaps as important as the situation in Washington. Mr. Luken signed a statement of support for an antiabortion constitutional amendment and Mr. Gradison, although personally opposed to abortion, refused to do so. Moreover, Mr. Gradison accused Right to Life, the antiabortion group that solicited the candidates' views, of using what he called “police‐state” tactics to try to force him to support its position. The organization, is now flooding the heavily German‐Catholic district with pamphlets discussing the issue. Mr. Gradison, who is Jewish, said that he was “worried absolutely sick” about Roman Catholic voters reactions. Both campaigns have been reinforced, and somewhat professionalized, in the last 10 days. Mark Shields, who managed Mr. Gilligan's successful race for the governorship in 1970, moved into the Luken effort. And several associates of Senator Robert Taft Jr. have assumed central although concealed roles in the Gradison drive. Much will depend on who votes. Although the district went for former Representative William J. Keating, who resigned to become president of The Cincinnati Enquirer, by 70.3 per cent in 1972, the Democrats have a slight margin in registration — and, this year, a much stronger candidate than before. Apathy hurt the Republicans in Grand Rapids, and it seemed likely to do so here until the Grand Rapids results focused attention on this contest. Mr. Gradison has been startled recently to find friendly voters on his walks remarking on the outcome of the Michigan election. “Grand Rapids got the Republicans stirred up,” Mr. Luken said, “and they're not likely to sit on their hands.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/28/archives/pittsburgh-mayor-in-senate-bid-notes-on-people.html,"Mayor Peter Flaherty of Pittsburgh, a popular party maverick, said yesterday he would be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat now held by Richard S. Schwelker, a Republican. Mr. Flaherty said he would run as an independent, and was not interested in his party's endorsement. He was elected Mayor in 1968 without party backing, and by last year his stature had risen so sharply that he was endorsed for re‐election by all three parties on the ballot—Democratic, Republican, and Constitutional. Mr. Flaherty's chief opposition for the Democratic nomination was expected to come from Herbert S. Denenberg, another maverick, who is state Insurance Commissioner. The party primary will be held May 21. • Sidelights: Queen though she may be, Elizabeth II of Britain will not be able to vote in the election being held today to choose the man who will run her Government. Unlike the lowest of her subjects, the Queen doesn't have the right to vote, and neither has any other member of the royal family. She and her husband, Prince Philip, will receive the results of today's vote in Canberra, where she is scheduled today to open the Australian Parliament. Within hours after her arrival there yesterday, she approved the appointment of Sir John Robert Kerr as GovernorGeneral of Australia. • Umberto Agnelli, the 39‐year‐old chief executive officer of the Fiat automotive empire, disclosed that a few weeks ago he was divorced from his first wife, Antonella Piaggio, and subsequently secretely married Princess Allegra Caracciolo. The bride is a cousin of Princess Marella Caracciolo Agnelli, the wife of the bridegroom's brother, Giovanni Agnelli, the 52‐year‐old Fiat president and international sportsman. • John Prinz, principal dancer with the American Ballet Theater, has suffered that most dreaded of all injuries for the ballet dancer, a torn Achilles tendon. The injury occurred Feb. 19 during rehearsals in Los Angeles, while Mr. Prinz was preparing the “Bluebird Pas de Deux” for the company's new production of “The Sleeping Beauty,” Act. III. He underwent surgery in which, his physicians believe, the severed tendon was successfully reconnected. However, Mr. Prinz now faces a long and intensive program of physical therapy to enable him to regain use of his left foot and leg. • A stern lecture on the protection of the integrity of the mother tongue was delivered in Paris by Maurice Druon, France's Minister of Cultural Affairs. Scolding French scientists for publishing, or reporting their findings, in English, Mr. Druon said the practice increases “threats” to the French language. What he fears most, he said, is not “franglais,” a mixture of “français” and “anglais,” but something more formidably insidious and Anglo‐Saxon, which he dubbed “angloricain.” That would be an amalgam of “anglais” and “américain.” • A priest in the ancient Church of St. Sabina, on the Aventine, one of Rome's seven hills, made the sign of the cross in ashes on the forehead of Pope Paul VI yesterday, saying “Remember that thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return.” The Ash Wednesday ceremony marked the beginning of Lent, the Roman Catholic Church's 40‐day period of penitence before Easter. Earlier in the day, the Pontiff restated the Church's rejection of abortion when he addressed a group of scientists, including seven Nobel Prize‐winners, from the United States and European coun tries. The Church, he said, upholds man's “inalienable right to live from the first beginning of his existence—a right that no human being can ever dispose of.” • James E.

New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/01/archives/new-jersey-briefs-5-indicted-in-alleged-bank-fraud-blue-cross-plans.html,"Four New York businessmen and a former bank executive were indicted yesterday in Newark on charges conspiring to defraud the Madison State Bank of $240,000 in 1969 through a series of loans to New York City leasing companies. Named by a Federal grand jury in the seven‐count indictment were Joseph Orlando, 40 years old, of Floral Park, Queens, former assistant vice president and principal loan officer of the Middlesex County Bank; Seymour Kaplan, 45, of Freeport, L. I.; Theodore Demagistris, 48, of Yonkers; Benjamin Cohen, 55, of Great Neck, L. I. and Edward Dicicco, of Staten Island According to the indictment, the defendants got the loans between February and June, 1969, by covering up “the adverse financial condition” of the companies. Mr. Orlando assertedly approved bank payments of checks drawn on the companies' accounts when he knew the corporations “were not financially sound” and had “insufficient funds” to cover the checks. Of the $240,000 involved, $20,000 was allegedly lent to Mr. Kaplan and another $20,000 to Mr Demagistris. Blue Cross Plans Refund The board of trustees of Blue Cross of New Jersey announced in Newark a decision to refund a portion of accumulated reserve funds to subscribers. The refund would be distributed among subscribers as a one‐time credit to be applied against premium payments, a spokesman said He said the amount and the mechanics of the refund had not yet been determined At its meeting here, the board elected three new public trustees to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of three business leaders. The new members are John R. Kolesar, director of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues at Princeton; Mrs R. Ricki Stochai, president of the Consumers League of New Jersey, and John J. Magovern Jr., retired president of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company. State Abortion Hearings Scheduled Hearings on whether a woman may obtain an abortion after the 13th week of pregnancy—a procedure some doctors consider risky—will be held on April 30 The State Health Department announced in Trenton that the hearings had been scheduled for late April, after guidelines laid down by New Jersey will have been made public, about April 4. It is legal now for a woman to obtain an abortion before she is 13 weeks' pregnant. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruling last year, which gave her this right, also said that the state might impose health and saety regulations on abortions after 13 weeks. New Jersey is considering applications from seven clinics in the state to perform the procedures prior 13 weeks of pregnancy. None is yet licensed. Bus Line and Union Reach Accord Negotiators for Transport of New Jersey, the state's largest private bus company, and the New Jersey Council of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said they had reached tentative agreement on a two‐year contract scheduled go into effect next Monday. The bus company owns 2,000 buses in New Jersey, and the contract would apply to some 3,400 employes.

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/02/archives/letters-to-the-editor-gasoline-of-prices-and-profits-and-odds-and.html,"To the Editor: The Administration's economic justification for raising gas prices was to discourage people from buying gas. This argument coincides with basic Keynesian economic thought, i.e., higher prices lead to low demand. However, when one realizes that gas supply is limited and fully demanded (all “available” gas is being sold), the argument becomes fallacious. The selling price is no longer an indicator of how much gas is sold. I ask, then: How can we justify the present price of gas and the present profits of gas companies? The answer is clearly that it is another rip‐off. urge a gasoline price rollback. ROBERT ORNSTEIN Lynnwood, Wash., Feb. 15, 1974 • To the Editor: We haven't done badly. True, the new mathematics has been swamped by the arithmetic of oil—domestic, imported, old or new. But we have shown outstanding competence with clock arithmetic and superb manipulation of odd and even numbers. I speculate to what extent Governor Wilson's chances for election have been increased (multiplied) by his enhanced image as a strong man resulting from his decree that zero is even and the prime number 31 is both odd and even. In fact, we have done well to remain on our frozen and immovable feet in spite of the punishing blows right to the curriculum. Consider how one of the topics beloved of math teachers, the mixture problem (alligation), is distorted by the oil on the new math. What should be the selling price of mixture of nine barrels of oil selling for $5.25 a barrel and one barrel of oil selling at $10.50 a barrel? Answer: Anything you can get. Millions of algebra books are outmoded. Burn them and bring the price of oil down. Looking ahead, and this is not strictly forbidden by M. Jobert, we must plan for the arithmetic of the day when an enlarged population will permit only one‐third to go to the pumps each day. How many gas jockeys can sell gas and divide 6387‐XD by 3? Sorry, sir, but you are not a multiple of three. JOSEPH STARR New York, Feb. 15, 1974 To the Editor: A week or ten days ago your paper contained a full‐page ad by Texaco. The bold print stated that Texaco earned $1.3 billion in 1973 and invested $1.6 billion to help fill energy needs. Since that time I have watched for some refutation of this hoax—either editorial, Op‐Ed or letter to the editor. I have seen none. To attempt to equate earnings with the amount reinvested in the business is sheer nonsense. The operating statement of an oil company contains an element of expense called Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion. This is a non‐cash expense in arriving at earnings and must be reinvested in assets simply to keep the company from diminishing. Actually, more than this amount must be reinvested to cover inflation and to permit growth. In many companies the depreciation expense far exceeds earnings; in no company is there a direct relationship between earnings and reinvestment, as implied by Texaco. The father involved text of the ad did not clarify the matter, nor was an operating statement included. If the public is to be assaulted with this kind of propaganda from our energy companies, some sort of refutation group should be organized. We have troubles enough without this additional travesty. JOHN H. HAYES Dalton, Pa., Feb. 10, 1974 • To the Editor: “I know what you're thinki;g about,” said Tweedledum, “but it isn't so, nohow.” “Contrariwise,” continued Tweedledee, “if It was so, it might be; and ifs it were so, it would be; but as it isn't it ain't. That's logic.” How Lewis Carroll would have loved the crazy logic of the odds‐even automobile‐cum‐gasoline situation. But let's be serious. What is wrong with an honest‐togoodness rationing system on the plan of the food rationing in Britain during the war? Allocate to each license holder a certain amount of gas per week (or per month) and issue hint; card to that effect. Then, most important, let him register with the gars station of his choice, meaning that hp would be unable to purchase gas elsewhere. Each gas station, knowing how many customers it had, would apply for that amount of gas. I know what's coming up: What about long distances? If the distance contemplated is so long that it exceeds the little sum worked out in the he then the motorist must resign himself to public transportation. If he does not wish to use his car at all, there is nothing against his giving (or selling) his ration to someone else. Then maybe we would avoid: And so the autos hurried up, All eager for the treat: Their paintwork cleaned, their windshields washed, Their tires all plump and neat—And this was odd, because, you know, Twas evens had the beat. ROSAMOND REINHARDT New York, Feb. 19, 1971 Two Against One To the Editor: As far as I can see, there are two arguments against impeachment. The first is that Americans have enough sense to appreciate Nixon's dilemma: He couldn't admit knowing who was involved in the break‐in before November 1972 because he might have lost the election, and he couldn't do it afterward because that would acknowledge his guilt. The second argument is that Ithpeachment might just prove to be a very easy thing to do, and professional politicans don't want it lurking around as a standard way of expressing disapproval. These two arguments are strong because they stem from honest American pragmatism and have only a very weak political argument against them, rectitude. So nobody in Congress will be besmirched if nothing happens. DOUGLAS COULTER Chocorua, N. H., Feb. 17, 1974 Anti‐Abortionists' Right To the Editor: Brother Robert F. Willett, C.S.C., in his Feb. 1 letter to the editor questioned the good faith of the antiabortion (pro‐life) demonstrators in Washington, and he concluded that “insofar as they are not concerned about the totality of life, they lose credibility.” He based this on his observation that he did not recall seeing much of this “stratum of society” in the antiwar protests and in protests against capital punishment. I was not one of the demonstrators, but I do support their right to protest on this issue. It was therefore generous of Brother Willett to invite members of the prolife stratum of society into his moral inner sanctum. Obviously, he can know very little of the background of the pro‐life demonstrators who visited Washington. Thus, it is difficult to understand how he can conclude that these demonstrators did not also protest the war and do not oppose capital punishment, areas which he sanctimoniously implies to be his private domain. Why the attack on those who demonstrated against abortion? Was it wrong for them to do so? Is the right to protest against abortion conditioned on the necessity to include other protest issues, much like a “tie‐in” sale? If not, how and why does Brother Willett judge the moral actions of these people, the majority, at least, of whom must be unknown to him? Furthermore, to refer to them as a of is in itself demeaning. ROBERT BARRY Larchmont, N. Y., Feb. 21, 1974 Voice of America: Lowered for Detente To the Editor: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn isn't getting any help from the Voice of America, and it is more than a shame. The Voice broadcasts to the Soviet Union around the clock, in every major Soviet language, from Russian to Latvian. But it has not broadcast more than a few excerpts of “The Gulag Archipelago.” Solzhenitsyn's latest book is receiving wide circulation in the West. But as he himself points out, the book is intended for the Soviet people. Since it will never be published there, the Voice of America can play a vital part in informing the Soviet people of past repression and, in doing so, the present state of repression. But censorship is not unique to Moscow. It is happening at the Voice of America as well. It is iiot, as Senator Henry Jackson recently suggested, the fault of the Voice per se. The decision not to broadcast “The Gulag Archipelago” was made by James Keogh, director of U.S.I.A., of which the voice is pare. Whether the censorship order originated with President Nixon or Secretary of State Kissinger hardly matters It is in direct line with the U.S. policy of détente—don't rock the boat. Some serious thought should go to this policy as it weighs against Individual rights. What ideological borders should the United States recognize? Short of physical intervention should America stop efforts to promote individual liberty and freedom of expression? I think not. Is a citizen of the Soviet Union less entitled to liberty than a citizen of the United States? Détente, of course, has seen its benefits, most important the movement toward curbing arms, but détente should not mark an end to U.S. efforts to promote individual liberty. One casualty so far has been the Voice of America in its failure to broadcast “Gulag.” Will this man die an unknown here? GEORGE Z. ROBERTS Arlington, Va., Feb. 12, 1974 How the Norwegians Hunt Their Seals To the Editor: The recent advertising campaign urging the public to send messages to protest against the seal hunt carried on annually by Canadians and Norwegians along the east coast of Canada has resulted in a large number of cables and letters being addressed to the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington. Most of the letters indicate that the public has been given a very distorted impression of the scope of the hunt and of hunting methods employed, and the embassy would like to present some factual information in the matter. The embassy strongly refutes the allegations in the advertisements that inhumane methods are being used dating the seal hunt. The seals are killed as quickly and as humanely as it is possible to kill any animal. Observers from the International Society for the Protection of Animals have followed the hunt on board Norwegian sealing vessels, and their reports state that Norwegian hunting methods must be considered humane. In 1966, the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, of which the United States is a member, established a special seal panel, with Canada, Denmark and Norway as members. From scientific evidence provided by a special advisory group, the I.C.N.A,F. seal panel de cides upon management measures for each year in order to insure that the stock is properly maintained. The panel also coordinates research efforts. The result of the analysis of the stock of various types of seals forms the basis for the establishment of quotas, which are divided equally between Norway and Canada. The hunting season is limited to a few weeks each year. The first Norwegian sealing aft, curtailing the hunting season in the Greenland Sea, was passed as early as 1876. Current regulations, which are revised every year, are laid down in accordance with the Sealing Act of 1951. They now include a permit system, quotas and restricted hunting seasons in all areas, total protection of vulnerable or depleted species of stocks, an inspection and control scheme and detailed instructions regarding hunting methods and weapons. A national sealing council evalu ates hunting statistics and results of biological research and advises the Government on the management of the seal stocks. This year, on the basis of recommendations from the council, Norwegian authorities have advised the Norwegian participants to delay the opening of the hunting season so as to avoid catch of whitecoats. Norwegian regulations are enforced through control by Government inspectors of hunting equipment and weapons when the ships leave port. inspection on board ships and on the ice during the hunting season and control of the catch when the ships discharge at the end of the season. In addition, new crew members receive instruction by veterinary surgeons in killing methods before the ships leave their home port each year. Norway's laws for the protection of animals were among the first and are among the most comprehensive in the world. The Norwegian people, with their long tradition of animal protection, would certainly not tolerate this industry if they believed that the seals were subject to suffering and cruelty.

STATE TOLD TO GIVE ABORTION RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/02/archives/state-told-to-give-abortion-rules-special-to-the-new-york-times.html,"TRENTON, March 1 — After Iseveral days of bureaucratic delay, State Attorney General William F. Hyland today ordered the State Department of Health to make public proposed regu lations that would govern abortions performed in New Jersey after the 12th week of pregnancy. The rules were approved on Tuesday by the State Health Care Administration Board and will be subject to a public heart ing on April 30 before they can be officially promulgated. Immediately after the proposed rules were approved, at least one member of the board i suggested that they be made public immediately. However, Health Department officials refused, contending that there was a “remote” chance that the rules might be revised before they were published in the State Register, which is a legal prerequisite to their being promulgated afterward at a public hearing. At no time was there any dispute over the regulations themselves, since all they stipulate is that essential medical services and safeguards be required in the performing of any abortion. Moreover, the rulings are the same ones that will apply to abortions performed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy as long as they take place in a medical facility licensed by the state. Under existing regulations, hospitals are the only medical facilities now licensed for such operations, although the state is considering applications from seven outpatient clinics to perform abortions. Year Since Court Ruling As for the dispute involving the publication of the proposed new rules, Mr. Hyland contended that under existing “right to know” laws, the department of health was bound to publish them immediately. The dispute was regarded as particularly sensitive for the department because it ha gained a reputation among some of its critics for attempting to keep some of its policyand decision‐making processes somewhat secretive. In the year since the United States Supreme Court's ruling prohibiting any state from interefering with abortions in the first 12 weeks, about half of New Jersey's hospitals have performed tens of thousands of abortions at a cost of about $375 each, according to a health department official. In addition, a much smaller number of abortions are being performed at private physicians offices at a charge of about $150 or less. Thus far, efforts to establish clinics in New Jersey that are approved by the state and that can perform low‐cost abortions, many of them for the poor, have been stalled by the state's failure to license them. The proposed regulations would require clinics to have access to a hospital not less than 10 minutes away in case of an emergency, and to detain patients for three to six hours after the operation. Traffic Cut for Road Work TRENTON, March 1 (AP) The Department of Transportation today announced traffic curtailments on two roads for construction work. It said that. for one week beginning Monday traffic on Route 79 in Freehold would be confined to one lane for construction on the Route 33 overpass. It said traffic on the U.S. Route 46 bridge over the Hackensack River between Little Ferry and Ridgefield Park would be restricted to two lanes until June for redecking work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boycott Is Sought Over Abortion Drug,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/06/archives/boycott-is-sought-over-abortion-drug.html,"BOSTON, March 5 — The medical staff of Boston's largest Roman Catholic hospital, St. Elizabeth's, has recommended that the hospital should boycott Upjohn Company products when possible because of the company's production of a drug that is used to induce abortions. The drug, Prostaglandin F2 Alpha, is a hormone that is injected directly into the amniotic sac, which contains the embryo, to induce abortion during the middle three months of pregnancy. The Federal Drug Administration approved its use last fall. A spokesman for St. Elizabeth's Hospital said that its board of directors would act on the request by the medical staff at its next meeting in mid‐March. The hospital has 450 beds and a medical staff of about 400. The boycott request, in the form of a resolution, was adopted without dissent at regular meeting of the staff. Hospital officials described. Upjohn as “a major supplier” for St. Elizabeth's but declined to disclose what portion of its drugs has been purchased from the company or how large the dollar amount has been. A spokesman for the Upjohn Company, at its headquarters in Kalamazoo, Mich., stressed that the company which is the sole American producer and distributor of the drug, took no stand on its use to induce abortion. He added, however, that clinical studies indicated that the drug was safer than other procedures previously used during the middle three months of pregnancy. The Upjohn spokesman said that the drug had been used in Britain for more than a year, not only to induce abortion, but also to induce delivery after nine months of pregnancy. He said that the drug was also being studied for possible use in controlling asthma, ulcers and regulating blood pressure. In this country, he said, the drug is now being distributed to a limited number of institutions, mainly university medical institutions where it was previously used in research studies. He said that Upjohn was not “actively promoting or advertising” the drug. The resolution by St. Elizabeth's medical staff alleged that Upjohn, “over the moral protests of many doctors and thousands of citizens, is now producing and releasing Prostaglandin F2 Alpha for the destruction of unborn human life.” It asked the hospital “to neither order nor dispense Upjohn products were a generically equivalent preparation is available, as agreed to by the chief pharmacist and the pharmacy committee of the medical staff.” Officials at the Catholic,Hospital Association in St. Louis and at the United States Catholic Conference in Washington said that they knew of no other hospital staff that had taken such an action against Upjohn. There are about 800 Catholic hospitals in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/06/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"WEDNESDAY, MARCH 6, 1974 The Major Events of the Day International The official board studying the pay of Britain's striking coal miners has proposed that they get raises of about 35 per cent, more than twice the offer that caused the dispute. Sources who have seen the Pay Board report disclosed its findings as Prime Minister Wilson announced his new Labor Cabinet and moved to end the three‐week strike. The proposals raised hopes that the strike would soon be over. [1:1.] Secretary of State Kissinger's chief spokesman complained that the nine‐nation Common Market had failed to consult the United States in advance of its offer Monday of long‐term economic and technical cooperation to the Arab countries. The State Department spokesman, George S. Vest, said that consequently “the United States reserves the right to take such similar action if it becomes appropriate.” [1:2.] The scheduled meeting of Arab oil ministers in Libya Sunday brings prospects for a relaxation of Arab oil restrictions, including the embargo against the United States, according to Arab diplomatic sources. But there were signs of continuing doubts among some Arab governments over a complete abandonment of the “oil weapon” until more progress is made on Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories. [1:2–3.] Premier Golda Meir of Israel announced that she would complete the formation of a new coalition Cabinet today and that it would include Moshe Dayan as Defense Minister. She also announced that Shimon Peres, the Minister of Communications, would join the Cabinet. Both men changed their minds about joining the coalition after a special Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. [1:1.] Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, confronted by continued unrest and increasing demands for sweeping change, announced that he had agreed to a constitutional convention to create a new system of elected democratic government. This is expected to lead to the end of the absolute monarchy that had ruled for many centuries. [1:2–3.] National The House Judiciary Committee directed its lawyers to obtain a sealed grand jury report on President Nixon's possible role in the Watergate cover‐up and to determine by tomorrow if the White House would provide evidence for use in an impeachment inquiry. Implicit in both decisions was a threat to use the committee's broad subpoena powers against both the White House and the courts, if necessary, to obtain evidence relevant to the investigation of the President's conduct in office. [1:8.] White House lawyers are preparing to make a two‐pronged defense against the implication in last Friday's grand jury indictments of White House and Nixon campaign aides that President Nixon may not have opposed hush money payments to the Watergate defendants. [1:7.] The Government started to get to the core of its case against John N. Mitchell and Maurice H. Stans, two former Nixon Cabinet members, with the first testimony linking Mr. Mitchell to Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier. [1:6.] Thomas A. Luken, a Democrat and a former Mayor of Cincinnati, eked out a narrow victory in a special election in Ohio's First Congressional district—an election in which Watergate played a role. He defeated Willis D. Gradison Jr., the Republican nominee, who is also a former Mayor of Cincinnati. It was the third Republican district won by Democrats this year in other Congressional elections. The district had gone Democratic only three times in this century. [1:5–6.] Metropolitan The Federal Transportation Secretary, Claude S. Brinegar, said in Washington that he was “flatly opposed” to a House‐Senate bill on urban mass transit and had urged President Nixon to veto the legislation, which was the in a parliamentary quagmire in the House. He said the legislation, which would provide New York City with $150‐million, “is heavily weighted to a handful of big cities with large and expensive rail‐transit systems.” Dr. William J. Ronan, chairman of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said if the legislation is killed, “the 35‐cent fare will go to 60 cents, no question about it.” [1:4.] Sol Hurok, one of the world's foremost impresarios, died of a heart attack. He became ill on the way to a meeting with David Rockefeller, head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and was taken to Beekman Downtown Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was 85 years old.

Democrat Wins in Ohio; 3d House Loss for G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/06/archives/democrat-wins-in-ohio-3d-house-loss-for-gop-democrat-wins-house.html,"CINCINNATI, March 5 Thomas A. Luken, a 48‐year‐old Democrat, eked out a narrow victory tonight in a special election in Ohio's First Congressional District—an election in which Watergate played role. It was the third straight formerly Republican district captured by the Democrats this year, and Mr. Luken's defeat of Willis D. Gradison Jr., the Republican nominee, appeared likely to create severe apprehension among Republican incumbents who must campaign for re‐election this November. The outcome here could also increase the pressure on President Nixon to resign from members of his own party. With all 478 precincts reporting, the unofficial tally was as follows: Luken ............ 55,171 Gradison ............ 51,057 A Democratic official had described the district, which had gone Democratic only three times in this century, as, “damned tough turf for us.” The previous incumbent, Representative William K. Keating, who resigned to become president of The Cincinnati Enquirer, won in the Nixon landslide of 1972 with 70.3 per cent of the vote. It was not immediately clear how large a part Watergate played in the defeat of the 45‐ year‐old Mr. Gradison, who, like Mr. Luken, is a former Mayor of Cincinnati. But the vote among independents appeared to be lighter than that among hard‐core Republicans and Democrats, suggesting to local politicians that many independents who normally vote Republican had stayed at home because of the played in the defeat of the 45‐year‐old Mr. Gradison, who, like Mr. Luken, is a former Mayor of Cincinnati. But the vote among independents appeared to be lighter than that among hard‐core Republicans and Democrats, suggesting to local politicians that many independents who normally vote Republican had stayed at home because of the Watergate scandals. A dispute over abortion apvarently hurt Mr. Gradison in blue‐collar Roman Catholic precincts in such suburbs as Norwood and Reading. Mr. Gradison, who trailed from the beginning of the tabulations, said that Mr. Luken's margin of victory “did not indicate a particularly clear mandate.” He expects to oppose Mr. Luken again in November for a full term. Sidney Weil Jr., the Hamilton County Democratic cochairman, said that Watergate took on importance in the late stages of the campaign, but that the economy—“wages being frozen, prices going up”—counted more. Democrats had taken over Republican seats in two earlier special elections this year, winning in Johnstown, Pa., on Feb. 5, and in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Feb. 18, in a contest for the seat formerly held by Vice President Ford. Even before the indictment last Friday of seven of President Nixon's close associate's, Watergate had exerted a subtle pressure on thecampaign here. Mr. Gradison, a Harvardeducated moderate with close ties to Cincinnati's prestigious Taft family, described himself as “my own man” and attacked Mr. Nixon for excessive secrecy on Watergate. His campaign slumped when he refused to support an anti abortion constitutional amend. ment, thereby prompting the Right to Life organization mail out 57,000 anti‐Gradison brochures. But he moved the counter‐offensive in the closing hours of the campaign, stressing busing and so‐called social issues. A team of political operatives from Washington, headed by Edward Maye, chief of the political department of the Republican National Committee, stiffened the Gradison effort in the final week. In addidon, close associates of Senator Robert Taft Jr. took over key advisory roles. Mr. Gradison brought in a series of outside speakers, including Senator James L. Buckley of New York to help on the abortion issue, and former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson to help on Watergate. Mr. Richardson resigned last year rather than obey thd President's order to dismiss Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor. Mr. Luken had help as well. Senator Edmund. S. Muskie of Maine was here this weekend, and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations sent him three experts. That prompted Mr. Gradison to run a television commercial charging that “big labor political bosses from around the country are spending a lot of money here to get workers to vote the way they want them to.” The Democrat resisted suggestions that he turn the election into a referendum on Watergate, in emulation of the strategy of Richard F.

Both sides made massive getout‐the‐vote efforts, the Republicans running a 48‐telephone operation, and the Luken forces 69 telephones. The Democrats had 1,200 workers in the field on Election Day. California Republican Leads VENTURA, Calif., March 5 (AP)—A California Republican, bucking the tide of Democratic. Congressional victories elsewhere, took a strong lead in today's special election for the vacant 13th District seat. State Senator Robert J. Legomarsino was leading nearly to 1 over his nearest Democratic rival and held more than half the total votes against seven Democratic opponents. Mr. Lagomarsino, 47 years old, could win the seat of the late Representative Charles M. Teague, a Republican, by taking 50 per cent of the votes in the field of eight candidates. He is the only Republican contender. If Mr. Lagomarsino gets less than 50 per cent of the total rote, he would face the top vote‐gettting, Democrat in a runoff election. With 314 of 480 precincts reporting, Mr. Lagomarsino had 30,846 votes to 11,568 for James Loebl, a Democrat. All seven Democrats combined had 27,234 votes.

"G.O.P. Loses House Seat In Ohio, Leads on Coast",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/06/archives/gop-loses-house-seat-in-ohio-leads-on-coast-democrat-wins-house.html,"CINCINNATI, March 5—Thomas A. Luken, a 48‐year‐old Democrat, eked out a narrow victory tonight in a special election in Ohio's First Congressional District—an election in which Watergate played a role. It was the third straight formerly Republican district captured by the Democrats this year, and Mr. Luken's defeat of Willis D. Gradison Jr., the Republican nominee, appeared likely to create severe apprehension among Republican incumbents who must campaign for re‐election this November. [In California, State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino, a Republican, led seven Democrats in the race for the 13th Congressional District seat. With nearly two‐thirds of the vote counted, Mr. Lagomarsino had 30,846 votes to 27,234 for all the Democrats. If he maintained a clear majority, Mr. Lagomarsino would be elected without a runoff.] The outcome here could also increase the pressure on President Nixon to resign from members of his own party. With all 478 precincts reporting, the unofficial tally was as follows:  A Democratic official had described the district, which had gone Democratic only three times in this century, as “damned tough turf for us.” The previous incumbent, Representative William J. Keating, who resigned to become president of The Cincinnati Enquirer, won in the Nixon landslide of 1972 with 70.3 per cent of the vote. It was not immediately clear how large a part Watergate played in the defeat of the 45‐year‐old Mr. Gradison, who, like Mr. Luken, is a former Mayor of Cincinnati. But the vote among independents appeared to be lighter than that among hard‐core Republicans and Democrats, suggesting to local politicians that many independents who normally vote Republican had stayed at home because of the Watergate scandals. A dispute over abortion apparently hurt Mr. Gradison in blue‐collar Roman Catholic precincts in such suburbs as Norwood and Reading. Mr. Gradison, who trailed from the beginning of the tabulations, said that Mr. Luken's margin of victory “did not indicate a particularly clear mandate.” He expects to oppose Mr. Luken again in November for a full term. Sidney Weil Jr., the Hamilton County Democratic cochairman, said that Watergate took on importance in the late stages of the campaign, but that the economy—“wages being frozen, prices going up”—counted more. Democrats had taken over Republican seats in two earlier special elections this year, winning in Johnstown, Pa., on Feb. 5, and in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Feb. 18, in a contest for the seat formerly held by Vice President Ford. Even before the indictment last Friday of seven of President Nixon's close associate's, Watergate had exerted a subtle pressure on the campaign here. Mr. Gradison, a Harvardeducated moderate with close ties to Cincinnati's prestigious Taft family, described himself as “my own man” and attacked Mr. Nixon for excessive secrecy on Watergate. His campaign slumped when he refused to support an anti abortion constitutional amendment, thereby prompting the Right to Life organization to mail out 57,000 anti‐Gradison brochures. But he moved to the counter‐offensive in the closing hours of the campaign, stressing busing and so‐called social issues. A team of political operatives from Washington, headed by Edward Maye, chief of the political department of the Republican National Committee, stiffened the Gradison effort in the final week. In addition, close associates of Senator Robert Taft Jr. took over key advisory roles. Mr. Gradison brought in a series of outside speakers, including Senator James L. Buckley of New York to help on the abortion issue, and former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson to help on Watergate. Mr. Richardson resigned last year rather than obey the President's order to dismiss Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor. Mr. Luken had help as well. Senator Edmund. S.

Ohio's Storm Warning,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/07/archives/ohios-storm-warning.html,"The result of the special election in Ohio's First Congressional District may not be quite so ominous for the Republican party as last month's Democratic triumph Michigan, but it doesn't miss by much. A district that has gone Republican all but three times in this century —and those in years of nationwide Democratic landslides—had to be moved strongly to elect Democrat Thomas A. Luken over his Republican rival. There were campaign issues other than Watergate, such as the right to abortion, but they were for the most part either secondary or an extension of a disillusionment with President Nixon that began with Watergate and was deepened by high prices and scarce gasoline. Mr. Luken was wary about focusing on impeachment at least until the final stages of the campaign, but apparently he did not have to. A survey conducted by The Cincinnati Enquirer showed that the “Nixon issue” was paramount with the voters. Vice President Ford himself went into the district to plead with his fellowRepublicans to “turn the tide and stop this stampede.” But in spite of his earnest though confused metaphor, the regular party vote fell off and much of the independent vote went to Mr. Luken.

ABORTION DEBATED BY SENATE PANEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/07/archives/abortion-debated-by-senate-panel-buckley-and-mrs-abzug-differ-on.html,"WASHINGTON. March 6—Advocates and opponents abortion clashed today at hearing on constirtutional amendments that would over turn last year's Supreme Court decision legalizing such opera. tons. Politicians have been shying away from the issue for years, but Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, paid he had called the two days of hearings because “there are probably more strong feelings and deep convictions on this issue than any other since I've been chairman.” “I don't particularly relish this role,” he told spectators in the packed hearing room. He said it was like “walking, through a minefield.” Congressmen on both sides of the issue opened the debate with strongly worded statements, Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative ‐ Republican of New York, author of one amendment intended to protect the !Relit a fetus, said, “There is no more important issue before the Senate and the nation.” “It is an ironic and recurring aspect of the abortion debate that the proponents of permissive abortion make rape and other hardship cases the major focal point of controversy, thereby diverting attention from the wholesale killing which is the ultimate consequence of the reforms they seek,” said Mr. Buckley. Mrs. Abzug Testifies Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, cited estimates that “all throughout the period when anti‐abortion laws were on the books, about one million American women were having abortions each year. Illegal abortions were so common and profitable they were said to be the third largest source of criminal revenue.” She added: “They will continue to be performed whether the Constitution is amended or not. This is a fact that no amount of moral wishing can overcome.” If the fetus was considered a person, Mrs. Abzug said, “our entire system of laws would become a chaotic mess.” “The Census would have to be retaken and all laws and practices that relate in any way to size of population would be changed. The ‘one man, one vote’ principle would have to be changed, for example. The pregnant woman would count for two, but vote for one.” Representative John M. Zwach, Republican of Minnesota, contended that conception began with the fertilization of the egg. When Mr. Bayh asked Mr. Zwach if life began with the fertilization or when the fertilized egg was implanted in the uterus five to eight days later, Mr. Zwach was perplexed. Instead of answering the question, he said there is a “sickness of Americans. They have to have intercourse.” He added that “virtue is self‐discipline.” Four Roman Catholic cardinals will testify tomorrow. The committee promised have testimony from legal and medical sources on the constitutional issue later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary and Index THURSDAY, MARCH 7, 1974",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/07/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"Britain's new Labor Government and leaders of the striking coal miners agreed on a wage settlement that gives the strikers virtually everything they had demanded. The workers are expected to return to their jobs early next week and Prime Minister Wilson will move to end the three‐day work week that has crippled most of British industry for more than two months. [1:4.] International  The French reacted sharplyito new American criticism of their policies and those of their European partners. French diplomatic sources challenged the State Department's assertion that the Common Market had failed to consult the United States before making a broad offer of cooperation with Arab countries. And Government‐inspired press comment indicated that a war of words has broken out. [1:1.] High Administration officials said the Government has begun to re‐examine its policy toward France in light of what it regards as French attempts to separate the European Common Market from the United States. Though Secretary of State Kissinger reportedly wants to avoid a confrontation that would force Europe to choose between the United States and France, he is apparently anticipating developments that would require a sharp anti‐French response. [1:2.] National President Nixon denied he had ever approved hush money or clemency for the Watergate defendants. In a televised news conference he conceded that a recording of a White House conversation at which the topics were discussed could be subject to different interpretations. But he insisted he had opposed both hush money and clemency, and he expressed confidence that any “fairminded person” would agree with his interpretation. “I know what I said,” the President declared, “I know what I meant, know what I did.” 11:8; Text, P. 32.1 President Nixon has agreed to give the House impeachment inquiry all the documents and tape recordings he turned over to the Watergate prosecutor, according to Mr. Nixon's lawyer, who said that the President was also willing to submit to written questions from the Judiciary Committee and to grant a White House interview to a few members. While çelcoming the offer of Presidential cooperation, committee members cautioned that the offer was not enough to satisfy the committe's needs for information, including documents that had not been seet to the prosecutor.

[1:1–3.1 A Government witness at the MitchellStans trial testified yesterday that he had been told that Maurice H. Stans had asked Robert L. Vesco to make his $200,000 contribution to President Nixon's re‐election campaign in cash. The testimony of the witness, Harry L. Sears, appeared to contradict testimony that Mr. Stans made to a Federal jury in 1973. [1:5.1 The Senate sidestepped the politically sensitive issue of Congressional pay increases in an election year by killing all proposed raises for Congress, the judiciary and toplevel Federal officials. By rejecting the President's entire 22.5 per cent three‐year package of pay increases, the Senate effectively killed any raises for Congress and other highlevel officials for the immediate future. [1:7.1 Metropolitan Efforts to save the city's 35‐cent transit fare were virtually doomed when the House Rules Committee effectively killed a HouseSenate conference bill that would have provided operating funds for urban mass‐transit systems.

4 CARDINALS URGE U.S. ABORTION BAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/08/archives/4-cardinals-urge-us-abortion-ban-but-they-refuse-to-endorse.html,"WASHINGTON, March 7 —Four Roman Catholic cardinals testified before a Senate subcommittee today that the Constitution should be amended to prohibit abortion. The prelates also refused to endorse a Constitutional amendment that would overturn last year's Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion because contains a provision that would permit abortion in a medical emergency when the life of the mother is threatened. The author of the proposed amendment is Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, who is a leading spokesman for anti‐abortion forces. Senator Marlow W. Cook, Republican of Kentucky, who is a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, asked the cardinals if they agreed with the section of Mr. Buckley's bill that says, “This article shall not apply in an emergency when a reasonable medical certainty exists that the continuation of the pregnancy will cause the death of the mother.” The cardinals looked at each other and hesitated. “It's acceptable,” ventured Huniberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston, if prohibiting “the direct taking of life is what you have in mind.” “Your Eminences,” said Senator Cook, “you're getting as bad as members of Congress.” The Senator then rephrased his question to ask directly whether they agreed with the proposed amendments. John Cardinal Cody of Chicago responded, saying that as Senator Buckley's bill “stands now, I don't think it could be justified on moral grounds. Cardinal Medeiros explained the Catholic Church's position saving, “The prohibition against the direct and intentional taking of innocent human life should be universal and without exception.” John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia added, “the victim of rape survives. The victim of abortion does riot.” The Cardinals said that the question of medical exceptions to any antiabortion amendment should be directed to medical experts. Timothy Cardinal Manning of Los Angeles concurred with his colleagues. “Every week, since the Supreme Court's decisions of Jan. 22, 1973, there have been as many deaths from abortion as there were deaths at Nagasaki as a result of the atomic bomb” said Cardinal Krol who testified with his colleagues for three hours before the subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing room was packed with a crowd of more than 200 persons. Cardinal Krol anticipated accusations that the Catholic Church is attempting to im pose its morality on the country. “The right to life is not an invention of the Catholic Church or any other church. It is a basic human right which. must undergird any civilized society,” he said. “We speak as American citizens who are free to express our view,” Cardinal Krol said. But later under questioning by Senator Hiram L. Fong, Republican of Hawaii, Cardinal Kroll said that the four cardinals “constitute the offical voice of the Church,” which has nearly 50 million parishioners in the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary and Index FRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1974",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/08/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"The Major Events of the Day International A day after settling the coal miners' strike, Britain's new Labor party Government announced that the three‐day work week would end at midnight tonight. The move came amid indications that other unions were beginning to press for new contracts in view of the 35 per cent wage increase granted the miners. Speculation that the Wilson Government would be unable to hold the inflationary line against union demands led to a weakening of the pound and a further decline of stock prices. [1:1.] Diplomats in Brussels are predicting that the change in the British Government may spell further stagnation for the already troubled European Common Market. The diplomats expect Prime Minister Wilson to carry out his campaign pledge to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the Common Market. [4:4–6.] Secretary of State Kissinger said he would recommend a Presidential veto of the trade bill if the Senate upheld the House version, which ties trade credits and improved tariffs for the Soviet Union to the removal of Moscow's barriers to emigration. [1:4.] East and Wert Germany took a decisive step toward normal relations by agreeing to establish permanent diplomatic missions in each other's capitals. The accord was reached after East Germany made a major concession by agreeing to let Bonn represent West Berlin. [3:5–7.] An unprecedented general strike in Ethiopia put increasing pressure on the new Government to produce, or at least promise, prompt economic and social reform. The strike by the Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions representing 80,000 to 100,000 workers was taken as an indication that Emperor Haile Selassie's agreement to adopt a new constitution with a more democratic government was being received coolly by many Ethiopians. [3:7–8.] National John D. Ehrlichman and Charles W. Colson were indicted for their alleged part in the 1971 break‐in at the office of Dr. Lewis J. Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's former psychiatrist. It was the second time within a week that the two high Nixon aides had been indicted on Federal charges. The latest indictment, which also named G. Gordon Liddy and three members of the Cuban community in Miami, charges the defendants with conspiring to violate Dr. Fielding's civil rights. [1:8; Text, P. 14.] In an apparent effort to limit the scope of the House impeachment inquiry, President Nixon has refused to give the Judiciary Committee any documents or tape recordings not related to the Watergate cover‐up, the committee disclosed. Though criticizing the President's decision, committee members agreed to wait until later this month before deciding whether to issue a formal subpoena. [1:6–7.] A Government witness testified at the Mitchell‐Stans trial that within hours after Robert L. Vesco made a $200,000 cash contribution to President Nixon's re‐election campaign, John N. Mitchell picked up the telephone and set up an appointment that very afternoon between Mr. Vesco's lawyer and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was investigating Mr. Vesco's financial operations. The witness, Harry L. Sears, said Mr. Vesco had been trying for nearly a year to arrange such an appointment, but did not succeed until Mr. Sears and another Vesco associate delivered $200,000 to Maurice H. Stans, the campaign finance chairman. [1:6–7.] In a sign that inflation may be abating, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose only about a third as much last month as they had in January. [1:5.] Metropolitan Eight‐year‐old John Calzadilla, the object of a search by the Suffolk County police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation since he was kidnapped from his Dix Hills, L.I., home Wednesday afternoon, was reported to have been found safe early today at a New Jersey motel after his father paid an undisclosed sum as ransom. It was believed to be the first, child abduction in a Long Island community in 18 Years. [1:2–3.] The Nixon Administration announced March gasoline allocations that will give New York and New Jersey less gasoline on a dairy basis than they, received in February, even though the nation's inventories have risen to the highest level in almost two years. The governors of the two stales expressed disappointment in the allocations, which would supply the nation with an average of 90 per cent of the adjusted March, 1972 consumption.

Abortion Hearings,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/09/archives/abortion-hearings.html,"The hearings on abortion, conducted this week before a Senate subcommittee, were held in an appropriate forum for this controversial issue. The airing of conflicting views in such a setting is a legitimate and desirable function of the democratic process. But nothing that was said by the anti‐abortion forces demolished the humane and constitutionally sound view, upheld more than a year ago by the Supreme Court, that abortion should be considered a private matter between a woman and her physician. A constitutional ban on abortion, the goal of the “night to life” protagonists, would actually not prevent abortions; it would simply mean that medically safe abortions would be the exclusive privilege of the rich. For the poor the way would once again be pointed to murderous back‐alley abortion mills. Furthermore, a liberal and medically sound legal policy does not mean that anyone can be compelled to resort to abortion, or to approve of it. But by the same token, no one should be prevented from exercising that right because of the religious scruples of others. The responsibility of the members of Congress, as well as the members of state legislatures, is to represent the real interests of their constituents and the constitutional rights of all the people—without surrender to organized pressure groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ohio Voter Poll Hints G.O.P. Has Lost Independents,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/10/archives/ohio-voter-poll-hints-gop-has-lost-independents-a-coalition.html,"WASHINGTON, March 9—A poll taken immediately after the voting last Tuesday in the special Congressional election in Ohio strongly suggests that Watergate has cost the Republicans the support of the bulk of independent voters. It also indicates that a substantial number of Democrats who voted for President Nixon in 1972, making his landslide victory possible, have returned to their traditional voting patterns. The polling was done for the Democratic National Committee by Peter D. Hart, a respected poll‐taker of the new generation, in the First District of Ohio. Mr. Hart's interviewers talked to 353 voters as they emerged from the voting places, asking them how they had cast their ballots and why. Mr. Hart's findings applied only to the contest in that district, in which Thomas A. Luken, a Democrat, upset Willis D. Gradison Jr., a Republican, but they appear to have national implications. If Republicans, who make up only 25 per cent of the national electorate, cannot attract most of the independents and some Democrats, they cannot win national contests and can win local contests in only a few areas. According to the Hart survey, Mr. Luken got 90 per cent of the Democratic votes and Mr. Gradison, 89 per cent of the Republican. But among independents, who usually vote 2‐to‐1 Republican in the Cincinnati area, there was a major swing. Mr. Luken got 57 per cent. More than a quarter of those who said they voted for Mr. Nixon in 1972 said they voted for Mr. Luken this time. Those data reinforce the pattern that can be seen on a precinct‐by‐precinct basis. In the blue‐collar suburbs of Norwood, St. Bernard and Deer Park, where Democratic candidates in the last five years have been suffering with only about a third of the vote, Mr. Luken got 60 per cent or more. A Coalition Restored “The old coalition came back together,” said Mark Shields, a Washington political consultant who worked for Mr. Luken. “We won among Democrats and independents, blacks, the young, union members, Catholics. It's the Roosevelt pattern.” Abortion, a subject on which Mr. Gradison and Mr. Luken disagreed, did not catch on as an issue, being volunteered as a decisive factor by fewer than 2 per cent of the voters polled. The three most important issues, the voters told Mr. Hart's interviewers, were inflation, energy and Watergate, in that order. In the crucial independent bloc, 50 per cent mentioned inflation, 47 per cent energy and 41 per cent Watergate. And the voters clearly held Mr. Nixon personally responsible for the problems. Only per cent rated his performance as excellent, 21 per cent found it good, 26 per cent found it fair and 41 per cent found it poor. Protest Against Nixon The performance of the Nixon Administration had an effect on the voting decisions of 41 per cent of those polled, and 45 per cent of those who supported Mr. Luken said that their votes had constituted an anti‐Nixon protest. In part, this stemmed from voters' feelings about Mr. Nixon's personal honesty, the poll takers found. Only one‐third of those surveyed described Mr. Nixon as always or usually honest; the rest said he was sometimes or rarely honest. Among independents, 82 per cent said the President was sometimes or rarely honest. Mr. Nixon's “inability to adequately respond to the challenges of inflation and the energy crisis,” Mr. Hart concluded, created the climate in which a Luken victory in a strongly Republican district was possible. “A deep and abiding sense of mistrust in the President” clinched the Democrat's triumph, he added. Despite statements by national Republican officials that the Ohio result was no cause for alarm, party leaders in Cincinnati said privately that Mr. Nixon had cost them the election.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Death Penalty Restoration Is Voted by Senate, 54.33",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/14/archives/death-penalty-restoration-is-voted-by-senate-5433-special-to-the.html,"WASHINGTON, March 13—The Senate approved tonight legislation designed to meet the Supreme Court's objections to the death penalty and to reinstate it as punishment for a group of serious Federal crimes. The vote was 54 to 33. The measure now goes to the House, where similar sentiment favoring the use of capital punishment as a weapon against crime exists. The bill has the support of President Nixon and the Department of Justice. Under the bill approved by the Senate, the death penalty may be imposed for treason, espionage and ft cedes of crimes such as kidnapping, hijacking, escape from custody and the blowing up of government buildings when these actions result in a death. Also classed as capital offenses by the legislation are murders committed “in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,” murder for hire and the killing of the President, Vice President, Presidentelect, heads of foreign governments and foreign diplomats, Justices of the Supreme Court and Federal law enforcement and corrections officers. But no defendant would be executed if he was under 18 years old, if his capacity to appreciate that his conduct was wrong was significantiy impaired,” if he was ‘'under un usual and substantial duress, if his participation in tilt crime was “relatively minor” of if he could not have reasonabl3 foreseen that his actions woule “create a grave risk of causing death.” Final action came after more than eight hours of debate over a series of amendments, bug with almost no discuision of the basic issue of life or dead. fot convicted criminals. It appeared that most of the members had made up their mind, long ago and were not interested in further discussion. Only Senator Harold E Hughes, Democrat of Iowa made a final futile plea to hi, colleagues not to take “a step into the past” by re‐establish ing the death penalty. He said “Man cannot make the world a better place to live by returning brutality for brutality.” A few moments earlier the Senate assured final passage of the capital punishment meas. ure by rejecting, 53 to 35, motion to send it back to committee. The bipartisan measure was drafted after the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, in 1972 that the death penalty was unconstitutional, in part because was applied in an irregular and unpredictable fashion in different jurisdictions. All nine members of the high court wrote separate opinions in that case, which complicated considerably the task of understanding the reasons of the majority and of trying to meet the basic constitutional objections to the death penalty. Before the final vote today, the Senate thwarted two at. tempts by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to add gun control provisions to the capital punishment measure. On a motion by Senator John L., McClellan, Democrat of Arkansas, who was sponsor of the death penalty bill along witt Senator Roman L. Hruska, Re publican of Nebraska, the Sen ate voted to table the first gun control proposal. It would have prohibited the sale of cheer handguns not suitable for lam enforcement, military or sport ing use and set up a registration system for all handgun; and licensing for their owners The vote to kill the amendment was 68 to 21. Then a less ambitious Ken. nedy amendment, one that would have barred the manufacture of small handguns known as “Saturday Night Specials,” was also tabled, 58 to 31. Earlier, the Senate defeated, 47 to 41, an amendment that would have made the imposition of the death penalty optional after any conviction for the capital crimes listed in the Hruska‐McClellan bill. Senator Floyd K. Haskell, Democrat of Colorado, sponsor of the proposal, argued that giving the courts “a small element of discretion can prevent terrible injustices” when special circumstances indicated the death penalty was not warranted in a given case. But Senator McClellan main. tained that only legislation imposing a mandatory death penalty under clearly defined circumstances would meet the standards for constitutionality set by the Supreme Court. If the ‘punishment is made optional, Mr. McClellan dedared, “what one judge would impose a death sentence for, another wouldn't,” and such irregularity would invite the high court to invalidate the entire statute. Since the Supreme Court's decision 22 states have reimposed the death penalty for specified crimes, according to the Council of State Governments. They are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho. Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. The issue will also be on the ballot in Colorado next November. In today's proceedings, the Senate approved, 49 to 43, an amendment by Senator Kennedy that would tend to limit the number of executions by requiring a narrow interpretation of Federal capital crimes and a broad interpretation of what amount to defenses against them. The amendment would require a court or jury passing sentence on a convicted defend ant to conclude “beyond a reasonable doubt” that he came within the definition of crimes punishable by death. At the same time all mitigating factors, any one of which would prevent execution, would have to be “liberally construed.” In debate on the measure, the Senate took the following actions: ¶Adopted unanimously an amendment by Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, to bar the execution of pregnant women. Its sponsor said the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion had raised doubts as to whether unborn children enjoyed any legal protection. ¶Defeated, 81 to 10, a proposal by Senator Hughes to require that all executions authorized by the bill be public and well‐advertised as a deterrent to crime. Senator Hughes said that his amendment had been “intended to be repulsive —execution itself is repulsive.” ¶Approved, 49 to 40, an amendment by Senator Kenne dy that would make the death penalty optional rather than mandatory for a convicted aircraft hijacker it he released his hostages on the basis of an agreement with the Attorney General or his delegate. Both Kennedy amendments were opposed by Senators McClellan and Hruska as unduly weakening the bill. Mr. McClellan declared, “We're going pretty overboard toward accommodating the worst criminals we can find in this country.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/17/archives/if-shylock-were-not-jewish-television.html,"LAST night, the American Broadcasting Company presented “The Merchant of Venice” as directed by Jonathan Miller for the National Theater Company of Britain. The play's period was shifted from Elizabethan times to the eighteen‐eighties. Shylock was played by Laurence Olivier, and the cast also included Joan Plowright, Jeremy Brett, Michael Jayston and Anthony Nicholls. The performances were exceptionally good, and the production or “conception” was consistently interesting, though it finally must be judged a failure. Today, however, instead of prattling on about the virtues and flaws of this particular production, it might be of more afterthe‐fact value to touch on a problem inherent in any production of “The Merchant of Venice”—the devices of a Jewish villain and anti‐Semitic myths. Both can, of course, be ignored or ingeniously rationalized. Even the eminent Shakespearean scholar George Lyman Kittredge was not above evasive sophistry on the subject. In a preface to the play, he wrote: “'The Merchant of Venice’ is no anti‐Semitic document; Shakespeare was not attacking the Jewish people when he gave Shylock the ‘villain's role. If so, he was attacking the Moors in ‘Titus Andronicus,’ the Spaniards in ‘Much Ado,’ the Italians in ‘Cymbeline,’ the Viennese in ‘Measure for Measure,’ the Danes in ‘Hamlet, the Britons in ‘King Lear.’ the Scots in ‘Macbeth’ and the English. True, it would be ridiculous to argue that Shakespeare consciously set out to create an “anti‐Semitic document.” It is possible, even probable, that Shakespeare never even had direct contact with a Jew. But it can hardly be denied that the play’ contains anti‐Semitic elements, drawn either from popular myth or established dramatic genres. And those elements are offensive to sensitive audiences, Jewish and non‐Jewish. There are further complications. This is not an ordinary play by an ordinary writer. It is a fine, richly textured play by perhaps the greatest of all dramatists. In fact, the character of Shylock provides convincing proof of Shakespeare's genius, of his ability to transcend genre with Immense humanity and understanding. Until his final defeat, Shylock is a quite capable adversary for his Christian “persecutors,” and he is given numerous opportunities to broaden his side of the picture, most notably in the famous “Hath not a Jew eyes” passage. This is no caricature, some thing out of Marlowe's “The Jew of Malta.” So the problem continues. Recently one prominent Jewish group, casting a wide net for signs of a contemporary resurgence in anti‐Semitism, included the scheduled showing of this production of “The Merchant of Venice.” Evidently the group would have preferred cancellation. The attitude is understandable but the argument, I believe, must be rejected. The alternative is, under any other name, censorship. This is not to maintain that censorship is never to be invoked. No reasonable person would argue, for instance, that the propaganda of Hitler's Germany or the bile of the Ku Klux Klan should get prime‐time national television, But then no reasonable person should argue that something should be kept off prime‐time national television simply because it offends a particular person—even if it's the President of the United States—or group. Examples are endless. Some Catholics found the abortion episodes of “Maude” objectionable. Some black groups would like to see the Stepin Fetchit‐type routines excised from certain movies of the past. Some homosexual groups want to impose a ban on all past material that they feel deals in mincing and distorted caricatures. It is all understandable but; again, must be rejected. Those Catholics must concede that others, perhaps majority, have 110 objection to abortion. Those blacks would accomplish nothing by erasing vestiges of the past, however lamentable. Those hoanosexuals are doing little or nothing for the present by turning attitudes of the past into nonhistory. And the list goes on. With “The Merchant of Venice,” there is another possible solution, one attempted by last night's production. That is to make Shylock as sympathetic as possible. In a foreword to the program, Lord Olivier described the play as a “harsh portrayal of prejudice and revenge.” Acknowledging the arguments hovering about the Play, he said ‘he took them too seriously “to either sentimentalize or caricature” his portrayal of Shylock. The result was persuasive up to point. Shylock's revenge was securely tied to the loss of his daughter Jessica. In defeat, Shylock was allowed an offstage cry, of piercing agony. But, in the end, it didn't work, for, of course, this is not a “harsh portrayal of prejudice.” It is a portrayal that incorporates a prejudice peculiar to its time and, at several points, it manages to brilliantly transcend that prejudice. Jessica remains an ungrateful daughter, even when allowed to close the play with the Hebrew kaddish ‘being chanted in the distance. “The Merchant of Venice” remains a problem. It also remains a play of unquestionable stature. If Shylock were not Jewish, there would be no problem. The solution’ is not censorship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Olga,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/17/archives/olga.html,"The Memoirs of Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent. Illustrated. 266 pp. New York: Walker & Co. $9.95. The real‐life adventures of Olga La Marquise de St. Innocent, who died two years ago at the age of 77, make some of the escapades in all those racy Jacqueline Susann‐liarold Robbins novels seem about its exciting as watercress. Perhaps that is all for the best, because it is to the fans of the Susann:. Robbins genre that this outrageous “quick read” autobiography should appeal the most. The daughter of a Russian baron, Olga fled her country during the Russian Revolution, acquired four husbands and a string of lovers (of both sexes) along the way, cultivated the ‐rich and the famous, and was almost’ always surrounded by an exotic, attention‐getting animal or two. Wherever Olga went, a panther or a puma, an ocelot or a boa constrictor Was sure to go. In her autobiography, Olga, as they say in some publishing circles, confesses all — more, PerhaPs, than we ever wanted to know. Apparently of the school that thinks nothing is really shocking any more after the likes of Chicago 1968, My Lai and Watergate, she takes us to outrageous pre‐Revolution parties in. a homosexual salon in Leningrad (then St. Petersburg), to Chinese opium dens where she puffs with the best of them, to the ‐botched, illegal abortion of a London friend who later betrays Olga. “I always went where I was not supposed to go and did what I was not supposed to do,” Olga writes near the beginning of her book, and then. proceeds to make her case. As a willful and spoiled child, Olga developed what her psychiatrist, Dr. Alfred Adler, later called a “Tsarina complex,” a passion to dominate. Whenever she did not get her way as a child, she vomited or else sat in a corner and talked to nobody. Her tactics always worked. At home at the age of 18, Olga married a man she did not love, a young Russian naval officer attached to the royal family. She refused to sleep with him, pleading shyness; and she remained a virgin until she was raped by the man who was later to become her second husband, Peter Serck, a crude Norwegian millionaire. Judy Elemesrud is a reporter for The Times. In one of the more interesting parts of the book, Olga tells about, meeting Gregory Rasputin at a gathering of women “from the top drawer of Russian society.” Not long after, she saw him lying dead on a table at a friend's factory after he had been pulled out of the icy Neva River. His body was full of bullet and saber wounds, put there by five influential Russian men, including a Prince and a Grand Duke, who didn't like. Rasputin's strange and binding influence on Empress Alexandra. Olga fled Russia with Serck via the Trans‐Siberian Railway, taking with her a vast jewel collection hidden in a belt. She lived it up in Shanghai, Macao, San Francisco and Hollywood before the Sercks settled in Bermingham, England. There Olga discovers, not much to her dismay, that “divans have always been my undoing.” And so, Divorce No. 2. Her third husband was a sensitive Austrian youth 14 years her’ junior, Leo Eigner, who years later became chief of Nazi propaganda during the occupation of Paris. Olga loved Leo, but when she realized he would never be able to afford the baubles and the lifestyle she Preferred, she decided to divorce him and marry Woodland Kehler, a wealthy, Socially Registered American author. The Kablers live happily ever after for 40 years, even though Olga at flint continues her usual merry round of affairs. But as she grows older and her three face‐lifts can't restore her to her one‐time splendor, both Olga—and the book —begin to bog down. The highlights of Olga's later years include Platonic encounters with such people. as Nehru, Albert Schweitzer, the Dalai Lama and Salvador Dali. She attends the wedding of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly in Monte Carlo. Her love for animals finally causes hei to give up her beloved fur coats and become a vegetarian. Oh, yes, Olga's title. She got it after she came to the rescue of. a financially destitute old friend, La Marquise d'Armaille, who was about to be thrown out of her Paris hotel, The Kahlers took her to their home on the Avenue Henri Martin, and she repaid them by adopting them and bestowing on them her family titles, the Marquis and Marquise de St. Innocent. If this book has any value other than its humor, it is in taking the reader behind the scenes in aristocratic Russia, both before and during the Revolution, and in informing us once again how the wry rich live and play, rarely questioning their self‐indulgences and their squandetings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/18/archives/letters-to-the-editor-if-we-gave-gold-for-oil.html,"To the Editor: Much has been said in recent months about the “immense burden” on the balance of payments of Western countries created by the quadrupling of oil prices. Yet to the extent that the producing countries are willing to accumulate Western currencies (especially dollars), that burden can be alleviated or removed in a noninflationary manner by gradually disposing of official gold reserves on the private market. It is the coincidental occurrence of two events that makes this possible. The adoption of flexible exchange rates by the industrial nations eliminates the necessity of maintaining official gold reserves. And second, the price of gold on the private market rose to four and one‐half times its official value precisely during the fourfold increase in oil prices. Thus the U.S. gold stock, officially valued at $11billion, is worth nearly $50 billion on the private market. Assuming that this market is rather thin, it cannot absorb massive quantities of gold at a given moment of time, without the price tumbling. For that reason, it would be easier if France and some other countries preferred to hang on to the cherished yellow metal and leave this field of operations open to the United States. In that event the U.S. gold stock should suffice to subsidize oil imports to this country over a ten‐year period to the Mile of $5 billion per year. By the end of that period, we should be on the way to self‐sufficiency in energy production. However, any combination of concerted Western actions is possible, should Europe be interested. The unloading of gold on the private market can be distributed among the participating countries in preassigned proportions, depending on their oil imports and gold reserves. Such action has ample precedence in operation of the London Gold Pool, except that in the present case we are talking strictly of selling gold. To the extent that the Persian Gulf sheiks are interested in accumulating their wealth in gold, the yellow metal will find its way indirectly to their hands and will relieve the world of the need to find adequate investment outlets for the accumuFinally, the proposal would yield another important benefit: With official gold stocks completely unloaded, it would rid the international currency system of the cross of gold. MORDECHAI E. KREININ Professor of Economics Michigan State University East Lansing, Mich., March 4, 1974 The Deplorable Amusement’ To the Editor: The brutal beatings of deer in the Central Park Zoo Is shocking but comes as no surprise to anyone who has ever visited the facility. This concrete jungle is a metaphor for our city: a publicly supported debasement of life. By restricting animals to small, cramped and often dirty quarters, it serves as a deplorable amusement, not as a needed educational institution. Visitors do not learn of the balance of nature or the conservation of animals but rather the inhumanity of man to animals. Change does not come easily in city so fettered by tradition, but might be time to consider devoting all our financial and professional resources for zoos to the Bronx Zoo, one of the nation's finest. That investment would assure that future ‘generations of children, and adults, could see animals in a reasonably natural habitat, safe from predatory humans. Searchlights and alarm systems are not the answer; they only disguise the problem: our attitude toward animals. RICHARD M. BARSAM New York, March 13; 1974 War Resister To the Editor: Having spent five years in exile in Sweden after going AWOL from the U. S. Army Security Agency in protest against our Government's military intervention in Vietnam, I have long had a keen interest and involvement in the issue of amnesty. I surrendered publicly to Federal agents in New York City last Christmas in the hopes of bringing greater attention to that issue and am presently being held in the Fort Dix Stockade to go before a general court‐martial on March 18. This week the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary begins its hearings on amnesty in Washington. A wide range of amnesty advocates and opponents will be called on to present their views regarding proposed amnesty legislation. This will include spokesmen for the American Civil Liberties Union, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Catholic Conference of Bishops, the Defense Department, the Selective Service Administration, etc. While holding strong views on the question of amnesty, none of these spokesmen will be affected’ directly by the proposed amnesty legislation being considered by In response to many letters and petitions sent to the subcommittee on my behalf, I was invited to testify at the amnesty hearings. to serve as spokesman for the thousands of Vietnam‐era war resisters whose lives will be directly affected by the legislation under consideration. In a letter to Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, U. S. Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, the subcommittee's chairman, pointed out that I could be considered as being “uniquely qualified to represent the views of American exiles towards this legislation” and asked Mr. Schlesinger to make the arrangements necessary for me to appear at the hearings in Washington. The Defense Department has so far refused to comply with the subcommittee's request, giving the lame and self‐serving excuse that it would not be in my best interest to testify in Washington prior to my court‐martial, as I might incriminate myself by doing so. While the right to remain silent to avoid self‐incrimination is one of our most important legal rights, it is one that can only be invoked by the defendant himself. The Defense Department does not have the prerogative of invoking that right for me, against my own expressed desire. I see this as hypocritical distortion of my legitimate right to remain silent, being used to infringe upon my even more basic right of freedom of speech. Is this the sinister converse of the present Administration's doctrine of “executive privilege”? LEWIS SIMON Fort Dix, March 7, 1974 Palestine Refugee Relief To the Editor: Reports on the financial crisis of the U.N. relief program for the Palestinian refugees throw a significant light on the depth of compassion of variobs governments for the fate of these unfortunate people. The United States, by far the most generous contributor, has pledged $25 million. Japan has suddenly discovered its humane conscience and pledged $5 million, while Europe is expected to come up with considerably more than last year's $7 million, all of which should help to keep Arab oil flowing in all directions. The total contribution of the “Arab nation,” including the Maghreb, the Mideast, Saudi Arabia and the other fabulously wealthy oil kingdoms, amounted to a measly $2.25 million in ‘73, a clear indication of their concern for their Arab refugee “brothers.” It is noteworthy that the great champions of peace, progress and proletarian solidarity such as the U.S.S.R., the Chinese People's Republic and all of Eastern Europe kept their assistance to exactly zero dollars. ALFRED GOLDSMITH Pearl River, N. Y., March 4, 1974 Necessary Death Penalty To the Editor: In a recent editorial concerning capital punishment you said that capital punishment is too final a penalty. I do not agree. Although it seems that capital punishment does not work as a deterrent, I feel it is necessary for crimes such as murder in the first degree and kidnapping. It would prevent the person from ever repeating the crime, and it would provide the family of the victim with the feeling that some type of justice is being done. DOREEN A. C. BOTTINI Scotch Plains, N. J., March 8, 1974 Energy and Environment To the Editor: In your recent editorial on the relationship between the energy crisis and the environment, you imply strongly that because E.P.A. Is asking why power plants using high‐sulfur coal should not install flue‐gas desulfurization systems, this represents a technically and economically feasible solution. A large number of companies, Including some of the “blue chips” of American industry, have been hard at work for years trying to develop satisfactory flue‐gas desulfurization system. Different systems have been installed on a pilot plant basis by several U.S. utilities. According to a recent study by the Battelle Institute, so far none of these systems has performed satisfactorily. Assuming that one or the other of these systems can be perfected within a few years, several things are clear. The equipment is highly complex, and many years would elapse before Indus try could supply the numerous power plants which burn high‐sulfur coal with such equipment. The capital and operating costs of such a system woad be horrendously high and would result in quantum jumps in our power bills, which are already rising steeply for several other reasons. Moreover, such a system most likely would utilize a lime or other slurry, creating enormous solid waste disposal problems. Many millions are being expended by several major concerns to develop an economically and technically feasible method of converting coal into cleaner fuels. It seems to be the consensus of the experts that this approach holds far greater promise than stack gas desulfurization. While emission standards appear to be an article of faith with E.P.A., the real concern is not the concentration of S03 at the top of the stack, but at ground level where humans and animals dwell. If power plants which burn high‐sulfur coal were required to have stacks with a height of 1,000 feet or more, gases would be dispersed over a large area, and concentrations at ground level would not endanger health in most locations, except possibly during periods of unusually adverse climatic conditions. Each plant relying on dispersion would have to monitor air quality continually and curtail operations immediately when SO2 concentrations exceed safe limits. The Tennessee Valley Authority, after years of intensive study, strongly supports this approach which can be implemented within a relatively short time, with presently available technology, at modest cost, and without solid problems. PETER H. KASKELL Vice President Legal Affairs, Olin Corporation Stamford, Conn., March 7, 1974 The Pro‐Life Presumption To the Editor: Your March 9 editorial “Abortion Hearings” spoke of “the humane and constitutionally sound view, upheld more than a year ago by the Supreme Court, that abortion should be considered a private matter between a woman and her physician.” The decisive and “compelling” question however is whether or not a distinct although not yet separate human life is being destroyed. the primary purpose of the state is to protect “the constitutional rights of all the people” (editorial). A presumption must be made in favor of human life until the contrary is proven. (Rev.) JOHN MCCONNELL, S. J. Buffalo, March 9, 1974 Impeachable Offenses To the Editor: President Nixon's attorneys argue that the only impeachable offenses by a President are treason, bribery, and criminal conduct. In their Analysis of the Constitutional Standards for Impeachment that they released on Feb. 28 they claim that the debates at the Constitutional Convention on Sept. 8, 1787, “clearly indicate purely criminal meaning for ‘other high crimes and misdemeanors.’ The debates indicate no such thing. The President's attorneys base their judgment on the fact that on Sept. 8 the Convention rejected “maladministration” as a basis for impeachment. substituting for it “high crimes and misdemeanors.” They neglect to mention that it was the same man, George Mason of Virginia, who proposed first the one and then the other ground for impeachment. Impressed by James Madison's and Gouverneur Morris's objections to maladministration as an impeachable offense, Mason substituted the phrase ‘”high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States.” No delegate to the Convention disagreed with Mason's contention that the grounds for impeachment had to be extended beyond treason and bribery in order to protect the nation against “great and offenses.” Maladministration, like high crimes and misdemeanors against the state, were regarded, both, as means of guarding against such offenses. On Sept. 8 the great and dangerous offenses that were singled out by the Constitutional Convention were Presidential “attempts to subvert the Constitution.” If the debate of Sept. 8, 1787, establishes anything, it is that the Founding Fathers regarded impeachment of the President as a defense not against “criminal conduct” as defined by Mr. Nixon's attorneys but against broad political crimes not covered in the criminal code.

"Alan Guttmacher, Pioneer In Family Planning, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/19/archives/alan-guttmacher-pioneer-in-family-planning-dies-planned.html,"Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, a pioneer and international leader in family planning, died yesterday of leukemia at the Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived at 1185 Park Avenue. Since 1962, Dr. Guttmacher had been president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Previously, while actively advocating freedom of choice in the bearing of children, he practiced as a gynecologist and obstetrician. Widely regarded as the elder statesman of the birth‐control movement, Dr. Guttmacher advocated not only unrestricted’ access to contraceptive information, but also liberal abortion regulations. “What Dr. Guttmacher sought,” a colleague said yesterday, “was to assure women the right to plan their whole lives, including when and if to bear children.” Apart from his medical practice and his duties as chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai, which he relinquished in 1962, Dr. Guttmacher spent the bulk of his time as a birth‐control lecturer and as an expert witness before legislative bodies. His approach to birth control was often earthy. “When you give the kids the keys to your car,” he once told a Los Angeles group, “be sure to give them contraceptives, too.” Constantly on the Go To many people Dr. Guttmacher seemed to be an evangelist. He traveled constantly, speaking pungently to any audience that could be assembled. He carried contraceptives for distribution in Africa. He helped raise and deliver money for birth‐control clinics in Pakistan. His vigor and his zeal astounded his friends while they confounded his opponents and critics, who included the Roman Catholic clergy and number of physicians and social planners. Dr.'Guttmacher also had his critics in the birth‐control movement, who contended that he liked to travel and to hear the sound of his own voice: “Alan is the third most egotistical man I ever met, colleague said a couple of years ago, adding: “But I don't mean this disparagingly. He just enjoys being Alan Guttmacher—and he's good at it.” To most of his associates, however, Dr. Guttmacher was, in the words of one who worked closely with him for many years, “incandescent — a man with flavor, sensitivity and conviction.” In the birth‐control movement Dr. Guttmacher was firmly on the side of voluntarism as opposed to some demographers who urged coercive methods to halt population growth. In Middle of Change “Alan. came into the movement when it was a medical concern focused on the individual and family,” according to Dr. Christopher Tietze of the Population Council. “But the emphasis is shifting to a demographic concern for survival.” Although Dr. Guttmacher was aware of the new trend, he believed compulsory birth control morally indefensible as well as impractical. “Just who is going to round up 200 million Latin‐American men and sterilize them?” he once asked. He contended that a woman should have as many children as she wants, but not more than she could provide for Freedoin to choose was his basic approach. An accessible and friendly man, he rarely stood on ceremony. Visitors were soon on first‐name basis with him. And his enthusiasm was such that those he met casually were often drawn into some aspect of his cause. Dr. Guttmacher was an erect and agile person, who played tennis until a few years ago and who loved to walk at brisk clip. He had little use for executive trappings or for eating fancy lunches. A cup of bouillon and a bowl of cottage cheese, eaten at his desk, was his usual fare; his guests were obliged to subsist on a delicatessen sandwich. Had Framed Cushing Letter His office was filled with family photographs or paintings that suggested to many visitors that Dr. Guttmacher's forebears had not practiced birth control. There was also a ceramic figure of an Indonesian fertility goodess with nine babies clinging to it On the wall, too, was a framed letter from the late Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston that said: “Don't worry about my attitude toward the cause in which you are interested. In due time I will make a statement that is in harmony with the teachings of the faith I profess.” The statement was considered liberal and an important factor in the repeal of restrictive birth‐control laws in Massachusetts. Alan Frank Guttmacher was born in Baltimore on May 19, 1898, the son of Rabbi Adolf Guttmacher and the former Laura Guggenheimer. He attended the Johns Hopkins University and later its School of Medicine, from which he took his degree in 1923. After residency in obstetrics and gynecology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and at Mount Sinai, he returned to Baltimore tol practice and teach. His professional standing was formidable. He was professor of obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, chief in obstetrics at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, special lecturer in maternal and child health at Harvard; and, from 1952 to 1962, director of Mount Sinai's department of obstetrics and gynecology. In the early years of Dr. Guttmacher's practice and advocacy of birth control he was often mistaken for his identical twin, Dr. Manfred Guttmacher, a psychiatrist and also a birthcontrol proponent, who died in 1967. Patients frequently went to the wrong office by mistake, and there were occasions, when for fun, the brothers answered to each other's names. Alan Guttmacher's interest in birth control began in the early nineteen‐thirties in Baltimore. The beliefs he developed then were little changed throughout his life — that it is a basic human right for every woman to choose whether she wants children; and that abortion should be a question for phyicians. to decide, not law en He also adopted the view that the poor should have the same access to birth‐control information as the wealthy. His strong and public advocacy of these attitudes won him the friendship of H. L. Mencken, the Baltimore sage, and the furious resentment of much of the city's medical and social establishment. When Dr. Guttmacher moved to New York. in 1952 and began to achieve national and international prominence, he was generally regarded as the successor to Margaret Sanger, the pioneer birth‐control crusader in the United ‘States. Backed Lippes Loop As an advocate, he took stands that a number of his physician colleagues thought unwise. For example, he supported use of the Lippes Loop, a contraceptive intrauterine de. vice that is still widely used here and in many underdeveloped countries. “The thing you've got to realize is that the Loop was once discredited,” Dr. Tietze said. “But it was obvious that the pill was getting nowhere in the poor countries—you have to know how to count to use it, and the majority of village women in the Far East can't do this; something else had to be tried and Alan decided the I.U.D.'s ought to have another chance.” These devices have their limitations, according to specialists, but they are better than no birth‐control devices in many instances. Dr. Guttmacher also tended to play down and put in perspective the side effects of birth‐control pills, despite evidence in some instances that such pills can lead especially to problems of blood clotting in women. More cautious physicians felt that Dr. Guttmacher had not emphasized sufficiently the dangers of the pills. Among Dr. Guttmacher's books, three were usually singled out as most influential—“Birth Control and Love,” “Understanding Sex” and “Pregnancy, Birth and Family Planning.” These were books for laymen. Dr. Guttmacher leaves his wife, the former Leonore Lidding; three daughters, Mrs. Ann Loeb, Mrs. Susan Green and Mrs. Sally Holtzman; and two grandchildren. There will be a private funeral. A memorial service will be held later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOWER OUT AS RACING CHIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/21/archives/mower-out-as-racing-chief.html,"ALBANY, March 20—Governor Wilson today announced the resignation of Emil (Bus) Mosbacher Jr., the $75,000‐ayear chairman of the state's new gambling superagency. Mr. Mosbacher's appointment has been the subject of politicians’ envy since it was made by former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller six months ago. The Governor released an exchange of felicitous letters with Mr. Mosbacher, the yachtsman and former protocol chief for the State Department, saying that his staying only six months as chairman of the state's Racing and Wagering Board had been the agreement from the start of his appointment. However, Mr. Wilson, who is more conservative in approach than his predecessor, has privately indicated his distaste for the new superagency and for its expensive layers of commissioners and bureaucrats. He referred to it recently as “an abortion,” one of his strongest terms of denouncement, and indicated that he might like to dismantle it. At a news conference in Buffalo after the announcement, Mr, Wilson said: “Conceptually, I just don't like superagencies. When you have two people responsible for something, nobody, is responsible.° May Change Board The Governor said he had no choice but to administer the new law, although he said he might recommend changes after it had been in effect for a while. The law set up the three‐member board to supercede an array of commissions that ran the state's racing, offtrack betting and lottery activities, without closing out these coMmissions. Mr. Wilson is expected to seek some toning down of the salary and power of the agency, which some critics have termed one of the final extravagances of the Rockefeller administration. The minority of legislators who opposed the wageringboard law last year denounced it as the blueprint for the ultimate creation of thousands of patronage jobs on the state and local level. The board was set up as a result of a study commission's finding that some agency had to end the competition between offtrack and ontrack betting. Some politicians feel the board will be an easy symbol for Democrats to cite as a patronage issue this year. The size of the salary only one of the country's Governors, Mrs. Wilson, is paid more, $85,000—and Mr. Mosbacher's relative lack of expertise with gambling and racing had made the job controversial from the start. Mr. Rockefeller had said that the job's scope of heading hierarchy of all of the state's legal‐gambling and racing officials, justified the salary In his view, Mr Mosbacher had the administrative experience and sportsman's image to make him the ideal choice However many, work a day politicians resented the awarding of such plums to someone outside the patronage system And in recent months some state officials had privately questioned Mr Mosbacher's administrative ability. Their attitude was summarized in their roars of laughter and demands for an encore of a song lampooning Mr. Mos bacher last weekend at the annual dinner of the Legislative Correspondents Assocation. The number, to the tune of the “Matchmaker” song from “Fiddler on the Roof,” was delivered by a race‐track lobbyist. It began: “Mosbacher, Mosbacher, let me explainThough you are rich and quite urbane‐yet as to horses, asses and such‐you really don't know too much.” Mr. Wilson's office said there had been a standing agreement that Mr. Mosbacher would be leaving at this time. Other sources recalled that Mr. Mosbacher had, indeed, indicated that he preferred a limited term, but they said the resignaion seemed sudden. Governor Wilson praised the chairman for his “pioneering, precedent‐setting effort.” Mr. Mosbacher said he took pride in gathering the staff for “a superb‐quality operation.” Pari‐Mutuel Aide Named Even as the Governor appeared to be scaling down the top of the conglomerate of commissions, his office announced the filling of one of the less visible Commissioner posts.

Sarafan Appointed Racing Board Head,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/22/archives/sarafan-appointed-racing-board-head.html,"ALBANY, March 21 Governor Wilson moved quickly today to still the controversy over the State Racing and Wagering Board by appointing Bertram D. Sarafan, a veteran government official, as the new chairman and by cutting the job's salary by almost 30 per cent, to $55,000 a year. The appointment of Mr. Sarafan, former chairman of the State Liquor Authority and a respected troubleshooter for the Republican administration’ for yearS, came only a day after Mr. Wilson announced the resignation of Emil (Bus) Mosbather Jr., the yachtsman and protocol specialist, from the socalled “gambling czar” post. His salary of $75,000, his inexperience in the gambling and racing field, and his neophyte political status had left Mr. Mosbacher the target of envy and complaints about patronage plums. The two actions amounted to something of a reversal by Mr. Wilson, or at least a de‐emphasis, of the high priority ac‐1 corded to the Racing and Wagering Board last year by former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, Mr. Wilson's predecessor and Republican patron. Mr. Wilson will be running for election to a full term as Governor.his year, and he has made no secret about his distress over the gambling “superagency,” terming it in one recent candid moment as “an abortion” that diffused responsibility and created additional salaries. The three‐member Racing end Wagering Board was set up at Mr. Rockefeller's request last year, following a commission study into the growing friction and loss of revenue resulting from the competition between the race tracks and, offtrack betting. The board, which has the, job of setting policy and adjust‐’ ing differences among the legalized gambling and racing factions, took the powers and, functions previously exercised, by a dozen state agencies: the Racing Commission, the Harness Racing Commission, the Quarter Horse Racing Commission, the Off‐Track Parimutuel Betting Commission, the Lottery Commission and the Commissioner of Finance. Commissions Retained The existing commissions were retained as advisory bodies to the new board, with commissioner salaries in the $35,000‐range and expenses provided—a subject of criticism when the law was created, and a possible state campaign issue this year. The Governor received Mr. Mosbacher's resignation with an announcement of “great regret.” Actually, his aides perceived the situation as one of great potential embarrassment, for Mr. Wilson is pursuing conservative. fiscal image and seeking to solidify party ranks. The lowered salary and the choice of Mr. Sarafan, a 60‐year‐old lawyer who served as racing board chairman during an earlier controversy, will help toward both goals, Wilson supnorters hone. Mr. Sarafan's earlier tenured was something of a holding action by Mr. Rockefeller last summer as he sought to have Mr. Mosbacher installed as chairman, and ‘officials, reportedly including Mr. Mosbacher, balked at first. Those early problems were unhitched by Mr. Rockefeller, who had a reputation for getting what he wanted.

Carey Sees No Chance of Early Abortion Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/22/archives/carey-sees-no-chance-of-early-abortion-change-sees-return-to-fold.html,"WATERTOWN, N. Y., March 21 — Representative Hugh L. Carey, a Democratic gubernatorial contender and a prominent Catholic layman, predicted today that a proposed Federal constitutional amendment banning almost all abortions would not be approved by Congress in the near future. “Until the climate of opinion changes in this country, it's a vain attempt,” Mr. Carey said of the amendment proposed by a fellow New Yorker, Senator James L. Buckley, the Conservative‐Republican. Mr. Carey, in an interview aboard an airplane en route to this city from Syracuse, said that if he were Governor he could do nothing to reinstate the state law that banned most abortions. The law was repealed two years ago. He noted that a Supreme Court decision barred states from categorizing abortions during the first three months after conception as criminal offenses. “The Supreme Court ruling left no room for flexibility, no latitude,” said the Brooklyn Democrat. However, he pledged that he were elected Governor abortions would decrease every year because he would institute a “positive state program” — such as clinics, counseling and adoptive services — “to make sure that a woman has free choice.” He added that “today she is encouraged to have the abortion.” He observed, as an example, that there was “a major demand for babies for adoption. Sees Return to Fold Mr. Carey's views were particularly significant because of his strong identification with Catholicism and his bid for the support of once‐Democratic Catholic voters who have defected to the Republican ticket in recent state elections. Mr. Carey contends that he can bring these voters back to the Democratic line. Mr. Carey, a leader in the campaign for Federal and state aid to private and parochial schools, also gave his views on that politically sensitive sub ject. He expressed doubt about the constitutionality of a tax credit proposal advanced this week by a Democratic competitor, Howard J. Samuels. Mr. Samuels proposed that parents of children in private schools be permitted to earmark tax credits for tuition. “The Supreme Court said explicitly that any credit is in in effect a cash stipend,” Mr. Carey said. In obvious reference to Mr. Samuels, the Brooklyn Democrat added: “Let's not kid the public, particularly those who are trying to educate their children in private schools.” He said that in his opinion some form of Federal aid was the only program that might survive a constitutional test. And he added that he was currently trying to devise such an aid program. Mr. Carey wound up a threeday, eight‐city upstate swing here yesterday in six inches of snow, which forced him to cancel stops at Plattsburg and Massena. It was apparent during the tour that Congressional colleagues of Mr. Carey, who is considered a leader of the New York delegation, could help his candidacy. In Buffalo and Syracuse, where there are incumbent Democratic Congressmen, Mr. Carey was being helped by their supporters. The 54‐year‐old Representative also offered his views on the following issues in the interview less than a week before he formally announces his candidacy: He favors the election of judges, even those to the Court of Appeals. The state has no choice but to pay for lawyers for the Attica prisoners about to go on trial. He also said he would not build any more State University units, but would enter into contracts with private colleges with vacant seats to provide low‐cost education such as that at the State University. He said that free tuition at the City University should be maintained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MINNESOTA ACTS TO CUT ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/22/archives/minnesota-acts-to-cut-abortions-law-bars-most-operations-in-2d-half.html,"MINNEAPOLIS, March 21—Despite medical opposition and questions about its legality, Gov. Wendell R. Anderson signed today a bill that prohibits most abortions in Min neiota during the second half of pregnancy. Final enactment came moments after Attorney General Warren Spannaus had told the Governor in an informal opinion that the new law “may not be constitutional.” The measure, passed by overwhelming margins in the House and Senate, permits abortions after a fetus??s four and a half months old only to preserve the life or health of the mother. Opinion Qualified Although the constitutionality of the statute is in question, its provisions are compared to some of those being considered elsewhere. Last May, Rhode Island's law banning abortions except to save the mother's life was declared unconstitutional. Similar’ legislation in other states, such as Arkansas, has not been challenged. In his opinion, the Attorney General cited a United States Supreme Court decision, announced Jan. 22, 1973, which held that the state does not acquire the “compelling interest” that is required for prohibition of abortions until the fetus is “viable,” or potentially able to survive outside the womb. “Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks,” the Court said. The Attorney General qualified’ his opinion, however, by saying that the Court's, attempt to fix the point of viability “was not necessary to its decision,” and therefore was not binding on lower courts, The Supreme Court's decision struck down a Texas law, similar to one in Minnesota, that broadly prohibited all abortions except those required to save the life of the mother. A five‐state study reported recently by Planned Parenthood (Federation of America found that only 2.4 per cent of the abortions took place after the 20th week of pregnancy, The study, which included analysis of thousands of cases, also determined that almost 74 per cent of the abortions were performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The new law would make it a felony for any physician to perform an abortion past the 20‐week pregnancy point, unless it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. It also requires the physician to attempt to deliver a live fetus, a provision that critics have said will forbid some types of abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Life with a wealthy, sadistic, murderous lunatic",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/24/archives/it-gave-everybody-something-to-do-by-louise-thoresen-with-e-m.html,"Louise Thoresen writes about 10 years of courtship, marriage, child‐rearing and deterioration with a wealthy, sadistic, murderous lunatic. William Thoresen was never really the misunderstood kid he played so often; after age 13 everybody in his life seemed to know he was as mean as this memoir, devoid of any redeeming social or psychological insights. Largely self‐justifying, pseudo‐remorseful, his widow (and executioner) remains just as insensifive to who he and she were together and what was going on between them from day to day as she must have been during all their years together. “Despite everything rotten he'd been responsible for in my life,” she writes here, “I loved him deeply.” Intimidated by William's accounts of an unhappy childhood and manipulated by the prospects of a million‐dollar family inheritance, as well as William's never‐ending quarrel with his Kenilworth, Ill., parents, she accepted every new humiliation. Louise became a practiced petty thief, allowed herself to be set up for police arrests, provided alibis and shelter for William, and participated in his childish rampages against the family's property and respectability. Eventually she was a coconspirator in a nationwide illegal, arms purchasing tear during which over 70 tons of munitions were accumulated in the Thoresens’ San Francisco mansion. One morning, about three‐and‐a‐half years ago, in their cluttered Fresno ranch house, Louise was afraid for her life. William wanted to kill her. She reached for his pistol and shot and killed him. She was tried and acquitted of murder, and, when released, dictated this book to the author of “The Dirty Dozen.” Married couples almost always deserve each other, but William Thoresen was unusually angry, a loner, hostile and destructive — and rather open about it, too. Never mind that before he was 21 he had gone through a number of boarding schools and mental institutions, that he never learned a trade or acquired an education, that he regularly smashed up cars, terrorized young women and fought with authority. William apparently married Louise to escape commitment by his family to a state mental institution. Later, William became increasingly nomadic, a remittance man and a parasite. Moving back and forth from Chicago to Phoenix to Tucson (with frequent sorties to Los Angeles and San Francisco). William got his kicks from drugs and setting off explosives; he turned to LSD and other women. He stole more than a half a million dollars worth of securities in a duffle bag from his parents’ cellar vault because, he claimed, it was his legacy and he had been cheated out of at least another half‐million. To compensate for this, William conned his younger brother into writing a will making him his sole heir for at least another million. While alleged to be abroad, he wrote a contract for his brother's murder with a semiprofessional chum; eventually he murdered that chum, too. Though Louise was forced to participate in almost all of these schemes without really knowing what was going on, she devotedly hung in there. After all, she says, she had a son, and it may also be true that a million and a half bucks is a lot of money to a kid from a workingclass Chicago family. In fact, it was only after William had depleted his varibus legacies and was strung out on drugs and a number of felony charges, had slipped Louise LSD and forced her to undergo rape and a miserable abortion, and had also threatened to murder her for being unfaithful to him, that she finally left him to file for divorce. But she was easily cajoled back, she claims, because he needed her. William did. This time he beat her with his fists, stabbed her with knives, razor‐hacked her, forced her to compose her own suicide notes to her family and friends, and then urged on her an overdose of Seconal. Came the night, after a whole week of such torture, when he confessed all his murders, as well as that he was trying to get her, too; also that he was hoping for a reconciliation with his family so that they would take care of him again. Louise woke up in the morning ready to kill somebody. I guess she really was in touch, at last, with how scared to death she of William. It's hard to stay with the persistent viciousness, squalor and cruelty of this account Stripped of its headline‐story appeal, on the periphery of the Haight‐Ashbury scene of the sixties, it's a not‐too‐distinguished memoir of a couple of rather gloomy, angry, depressed, not very bright kids, putting each other on with words like love and devotion until “death do us part.” But, ‘as told in a lot of flattened‐out “as told to” language by this dreary woman, it leaves one wondering if words like anger and rage and manipulation are really satisfactory explanations for what transpired between William",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/25/archives/new-jersey-briefs-5-held-captive-as-home-is-looted-strict-abortion.html,"Three masked gunmen held five persons captive in South Orange, N. J., home Saturday night while they ransacked the house and made off with two fur coats, jewelry, $1,200 in cash and an automobile. The three entered the home of William Koeppel at White Oak Drive, tied up Mr. Koeppel's 80‐year‐old mother, Mrs. Frances Koeppel, then waited for Mr. and Mrs. Koeppel and another couple, Mr. and Mrs. Alvin Lerner, to return from a dinner date. The four were also bound hand and foot with neckties as the gunmen helped themselves to the loot and then escaped in Mr. Lerner's car. The captives freed themselves after about an hour, and the car was later found abandoned in a nearby restaurant parking lot. Strict Abortion Rules Are Urged The Right to Life Committee, meeting in convention New Brunswick, decided to try to persuade New Jersey to make it difficult to obtain abortions. The committee said an attempt would be made to reach every household in the state by mail to explain its views on abortion. The chairman of the committee, Dr. Joseph Warganz of Boonton, said that despite the United States Supreme Court ruling that states could not prohibit an abortion, “the state is under no obligation to make it easy.” “As a state we need not take a position to make very easy. The state could take the other view, out of moral sense,” he declared.

MORE IN U.S. RELY ON STERILIZATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/25/archives/more-in-us-rely-on-sterilization-about-1-in-6-us-families-in-main.html,"WASHINGTON, March 24—At least one American couple in six in the main child‐bearing years—age 20 to 39—has had a sterilization operation, and some family planning experts believe the trend is continuing upward. Specialists say sterilization has apparently become the first choice among couples over the age of 30 with contraceptive pills running second, as a mean of birth control. It is unclear how greatly, if at all, liberalized abortion laws have changed that pattern within the last few years. Statistics on the trend toward sterilization in recent years were brought to public attention a week ago here by United States District Judg Gerhard A. Gesell's decision ordering the Government to stop paying for sterilization operations on persons who were either mentally incompetent or too young to give informed voluntary consent. He ordered the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to redraft its regulations for all such operations on welfare patients on the ground that existing regulations do not sufficiently protect them against coercion. “Few realize that over 16 per cent of the married couples in this country between the ages of 20 and 39 have had a sterilization operation,” Judge Gesell said, in discussing the broad social background of the issue. He also said current estimates put at 100,000 to 150000 the yearly number of sterilizations performed on lowincome persons under federally funded programs. 1970 Fertility Study The Federal regulations on obtaining informed and voluntary consent, barred by Judge Gesell, had been drafted specifically to insure that no welfare patient was coerced into accepting sterilization. Judge Gesell ruled that the regulations were not adequate to insure this and needed to be redrafted to make the safeguards more certain. On sterilization practices in general in the United States, the best available evidence comes from the federally funded 1970 National Fertility Study, sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This showed a marked rise in voluntary sterilization operations between 1965 and 1970. It was this study that showed, for 1970, the figure of 16.5 per cent of all married couples between the ages of 20 and 39 having undergone sterilization in one or the other partner. A.spokesman for Planned Parenthood ‐World Population said it appeared that the trend had continued upward, although far more ‘slowly than during the last half of the decade of the nineteen‐sixties. The Association for Voluntary Sterilization, which has sponsored regional surveys, estimates that the number of voluntary sterilizations among women has continued to rise steadily during the last four years, but that sterilization of men reached a peak in 1971 and has declined somewhat since then. A spokesman for the association, agreeing with other experts, said no really reliable national figures were available for the post‐1970 years. Most sterilization operations are performed on adults, with only between 2,000 and 3,000 a year being done on persons under 21 and fewer than 300 on persons under 18, according to the best Federal estimates, No Accurate Data Dr. Louis M. Hellman, H.E.W.'s Deputy Assistant Secretary for population affairs, said that there were no comprehensive and accurate statistics on sterilization in the United States. He said estimates of the total done under Federal funding were based largely on extrapolations from a few Government programs from which figures are available. One study done last year by the department's Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, analyzed some of the available statistics. It covered 910 persons under the age of 21 who had sterilization operations in 1972 under Federal programs. The report said nearly 95 per cent of these sterilization patients were women and that 12 —all girls—had been sterilized before their 15th birthdays. The study was started after a Federal suit was filed last June in Montgomery, Ala., charging that two black girls, aged 12 and 14, had been sterilized under a federally funded program without full knowledge of what was being done to them. Analyzing the welfare status of the 910 persons it covered the study report said that the sterilization rate for black welfare recipients under age 21 was significantly greater than for whites on welfare and that regardless of race, welfare recipients under 21 had a higher sterilization rate than nonwelfare recipients. The report said the true ex planation of the differences could not be determined from the existing data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Summary of Supreme Court Actions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/26/archives/a-summary-of-supreme-court-actions-the-supreme-court-took-the.html,"WASHINGTON, March 25 —The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION Declined to review a decision declaring unconstitutional a New Jersey antiabortion law on which the decision of unconstitutionality was made in 1972 before the Supreme Court invalidated many similar statutes (No. 73‐838, Kugler v. Young Women's Christian Association). COMMERCE Agreed to review a decision upholding the right of a Mississippi cotton farmer to refuse to honor a contract with a Tennessee buyer who did not have a certificate of authority to do business in the state.

Court Voids Law Barring Contemptuous Use of Flag,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/26/archives/court-voids-law-barring-contemptuous-use-of-flag-supervision-of.html,"WASHINGTON, March 25—The Supreme Court, on a vote of 6 to 3, struck down as unconstitutionally vague today a Massachusetts law that made it, a crime to treat the United States flag “contemptuously.” In the process, the court wiped out a six‐month jail sentence imposed on Valarie Goguen, who had been arrested in Leominster for wearing a 4by‐6‐inch flag sewn on the seat, of his blue jeans. The Court majority, in an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., said: “In a time of widely varying attitudes and tastes for displaying Something as ubiquitous as the United States flag or representations of it, it could hardly be the purpose of the Massachusetts legislature to make criminal every informal use of the flag.” Justice Byron R. White agreed with the outcome but based his decision, in a concurring opinion, on a belief that the statute imposed unconstitutional restrictions on freedom of expression. Dissenting were Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William H, Rehnquist. Other Similar Cases ‘the decision may indicate how ‐the high court will vote on a half‐dozen other flag desecration cases pending before it. The include challenges to convictions for burning the flag, imposing other symbols on it and otherwise indicating disrespect. Justice Powell wrote that the 70‐year‐old Massachusetts law did not set out any standards to give potential violators notice of what would constitute an offense or provide any guidelines for law enforcement officers. “Because display of the flag Is so common and takes so many forms, changing from one generation to another and often difficult to distinguish in principle, a legislature should define with some care the flag behavior it tends to outlaw,” Mr. Powell said. But Justice White, rejecting the argument that the law was too vague, quoted the Massachusetts authorities as arguing that “Goguen may have meant to show that he believed that America was a fit place only to sit on, or the proximity to that part of his anatomy might have had more vulgar connotations.” The Rehnquist dissent closed with a summons to renewed reverence for the flag, invoking as witnesses Charles Wilson Peale, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Greenleaf Whittier, John Philip Sousa, Francis Scott Key and George M. Cohan. Justice Rehnquist concluded that Massachusetts had properly prohibited Mr. Goguen “from impairing the physical integrity of a unique national symbol which has been given content by generations of his and our forebears, a symbol of which he had purchased a copy.” SUPERVISION OF WELFARE The high court also handed down two decisions dealing with state administration of federally fnuded welfare programs and the authority of Federal courts to oversee the process. In a New York State case, the Justices voted 6 to 3 that Federal District Court had properly invalidated a state regulation permitting recoupment of payments from welfare recipients who had received money to pay lent but had not used it for that purpose. In an Illinois decision, the Court ruled 5 to 4 that state welfare officials must comply with Federal timetables for processing grants but that a Federal court could not force the state to pay retroactive benefits for the period during which slow state action prevented their payment. JERSEY ABORTION CURB The Justices also refused to review a 1972 decision that New Jersey's anti‐abortion law was unconstitutional. Last year the Supreme Court took similar action with respect to all state abortion laws, but New Jersey officials insisted on appealing the earlier decision on the grounds that the Federal courts did not have jurisdiction over the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Papal Aide Speaks to Jewish Council,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/27/archives/papal-aide-speaks-to-jewish-council-remarks-welcomed.html,"“The Most Rev. Jean Jadot, tte representative of Pope Paul VI in this country, declared last night that dialogue between Christians and Jews has entered a “new stage” marked by “sober and serious” consideration of interfaith problems. His speech represents the first time that someone in his position has given a formal address to a major American Jewish organization. In remarks at a dinner meeting of the Synagogue Council of America at the Marriott's Essex House, Bishop Jadot took issue with churchmen who assert that the dialogue has begun to slow down. Remarks Welcomed “On the contrary,” he declared, “it is very much alive and well. Let us rededicate ourselves to the determination to keep it so, and ask God's blessing on our resolve and our endeavors.” Bishop Jadot is the apostolic delegate, or representative of the Pope to. the Roman Catholic Church in this country. The Synagogue Council is an umbrella group of congregational and rabbinic bodies of the Reform, Conservative and some Orthodox groups in the United States, The occassion was a testimonial dinner in honor of Philip Greene, a longtime supporter of the council, upon his retirement as a vice president of the Bankers Trust Company. Bishop Jadot's remarks were welcomed as encouraging by council leaders because of widespread belief in Christian and Jewish circles that contact between representatives of the two faiths have been falling off. Last year the Rev. Cornelius Rijk, a Dutch priest who had been head of the Vatican office for relations with Jews, resigned his post. He was known to have been disappointed at the failure of his superiors to release a proposed set of guidelines for CatholicJewish relations. In this country differing views on abortion and prayer in public schools have also been factor in dampening official contacts between the two groups. In his address Bishop Jadot acknowledged that “it has been widely conceded that the ecumenical movement and the Jew ish‐Christian dialogue as well has slowed down since their inception a few years ago.” He asserted. however, that “after any initial impulse, too long held back, some degree of leveling off, indeed, even of retrenchment, is normal.” “Such apparent regression should not alarm us,” he continued,” but rather assure us that anew state of more sober and serious facing up of problems has begun.” Among these problems, he said, is anti‐Semitism. “The struggle against anti‐Semitism, need I tell, you, ‘is not over,” he stated. “It merits our constant vigilance, and it should retain a first priority on our common agenda.” Since assuming his post in July, Bishop Jadot, a former university and military chaplain in Belgium, has achieved a reputation for being far more open than any of his immediate predecessors. He was recently host at a dinner for the executive board of the National Federation of Priests’ Councils, a group that has frequently criticized policies of Pope Paul and the American hierarchy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why Shylock Should Not Be Censored,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/31/archives/why-shylock-should-not-be-censored-tv.html,"PROTESTS by Jewish organizations over the recent presentation of “The Merchant of Venice” by the American Broadcasting Company once again raise the old questions: Is Shakespeare's portrayal of Shylock a “negative stereotype of the Jew” and thus an incitement to anti‐Semitism? And if so, should it be kept off the air? The answer, it seems to me, ought to be “no” an both counts. Entirely apart from censorship which, one would hope, no reputable religious and ethnic groups would want to invoke, particularly against the works of great dramatists, the issue ought to be decided on the grounds of rational analysis rather than the reflex reaction of programed emotions. It may serve to establish my credentials of sensitivity to the evil of anti‐Semitism to recall that I found myself affronted by the motion picture version of “Portnoy's Complaint” and, to an only slightly lesser degree, the vulgar distortions of Jewishness in “The Heartbreak Kid.” I would not suppress either of these films, but cannot help but admit that would cringe at the thought of watching them as part of a coast‐to‐coast audience. could hear in my mind's ear the noxious mutterings of the nation's Archie Bunkers in front of millions of home screens. My antennae picked up no such mutterings as I watched Laurence Olivier as Shylock in England's National Theater production. But this gets ahead of an orderly defense to be conducted on two counts—the play, first, and the audience, second. The perennial protests against “The Merchant of Venice” perpetuate a simplistic, semiliterate stereotype—that of an anti‐Semitic villain at the center of an antiSemitic play. Millions who have never seen “The Merchant of Venice” have picked up a smattering of “the plot” from the recurring controversy or high‐school synopses and have fixed in their minds a sneering story about an evil, money‐grabbing Jew. Shylock is thus eternally condemned to be nothing but a bigot's caricature. The protesters reinforce that image. They frustrate an intelligent examination of Shakespeare's words and intent. By contrast, Olivier's portrayal invites such an examination. Seeing his Shylock was to question and reject the stereotypes. Liberated from the stereotyped image of the character, a modern viewer might discover a Shylock who, though vengeful, had much to be vengeful about. The genteel Antonio, paragon of Christian virtue, had spat upon the Jew before he needed his money. The Jew‐baiting Gratiano called Shylock an “inexecrable dog.” Shylock moreover, though engaged in what was in Elizabethan society considered the disreputable business of money‐lending, is in truth. no more materialistic than the hedonistic Beautiful People of Belmont, the Gentile pleasure palace. He wants the comfort of his riches mainly to build a moat of God‐fearing separation around a home that is to him a haven from a hostile and frivolous Christian world. Shylock might well represent the Jewish work ethic, with that touch of misanthropy that so often afflicts any work ethic proponents In a spendthrift environment. Shakespeare most likely knew no Jews. At the time he was writing “The Merchant of Venice,” however, the Elizabethan world was shocked or titillated by an alleged plot against the Queen—probably a frame‐up —by a Spaniard of Jewish descent, one Roderigo Lopez, a medical adviser to Elizabeth. For largely anti‐Spanish reasons, anti‐Jewish feelings ran high. Given the tenor of the time, with its mixture of ignorant prejudices and political intrigue, it is remarkable that Shakespeare was able to create, not an anti‐Semitic stereotype, but a complex Shylock—a man of dignity who, though driven to demented cruelty, lived by the law and remained, even in the face of total ruin, the strictest of strict constructionists of the law. “Is it the law?” is all he brings himself to ask when Portia twists the law with what anti‐Christian bigots might call Gentile sophistry. Is it by accident or design that Shakespeare allows the Duke, as representative of Elizabethan propriety, to philosophize about Christian mercy (“Thou shalt see the difference of our spirits”) minutes before he sanctions Shylock's unmerciful destruction? Why, was Portia, the playgirl of the Elizabethan World, given that line of the ultimate hypocrisy — “The quality of mercy is not strain'd/It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven""—as a prelude to utterly wiping out Shylock? Could Shakespeare have put in Shylock's mouth that classic assault against discrimination, “Hath not a Jew eyes...,” if he wanted merely to create a hateful stereotype? Olivier's intelligence answered those questions. No anti‐Semite in his right mind would use Olivier's Shylock to shore up the case of bigotry. It can, of course, be argued that the Nazis turned Shylock into a weapon in their anti‐Semitic arsenal; but then they used Franklin D. Roosevelt—in the same fashion, proving that you don't have to be Jewish to serve the anti‐Semite's purpose. The only legitimate objection to the Olivier production is of historical, rather than ideological, nature. Transposing “The Merchant of Venice” ‘from Elizabethan to Edwardian days—as Olivier did—makes a hash of the central theme. While the production quite authentically caught the sense of the clubby, social anti‐Semitism of that era, it overlooked that money‐lending had by then become a respectable enterprise and by no means a Jewish monopoly, and Jewish financiers were not'only the mainstay of the English monarchy but personal friends of the ‐What of the second count in the charge‐against the broadcast? The Jewish Broadcasting and Film Committee of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council held that, because the program would reach millions of viewers, many of whom “have no knowledge of history and the meaning of the play,” it might kindle an anti‐Semitic response. In actual fact, of course, such intelligent programs unfortunately do not reach the untutored mass audience. The Nielsen ratings showed that in New York and Los Angeles —not exactly the capitaleof the silent majority. — Shakespeare lost out by a large margin to a line‐up of situation comedies, the Carol Burnett show, old movies and re‐runs. The fact that such viewers outnumber the more selective audience is, of course, neither a startling revelation nor an excuse to ignore the quality end of the consumer spectrum. The American Broadcasting Company deserves applause for its occasional service to the elite sector. The danger is that recurrent attacks by watchdog organizations’ for a variety of religious and ethnic groups on such select programing—which by its very nature tends to be more controversial—is likely to persuade network executives to stick to noncontroversial mindlessness that is both profitable and safe If censorship is not the answer, as this newspaper's television critic, John J. O'Connor, as well as the Jewish Broadcasting and Film Committee have properly insisted, what is the best course? Surely not, as the committee suggested, a kind of gentlemen's agreement on the part of the network executives to keep off the air such controversial productions as “The Merchant of Venice""—and presumably such issues as abortion, Mafia‐related crime, and other questions that might offend some part of the audience. A more sensible solution would be an introductory and/or postscript analysis of the play's history, the playwright's intent and the characters’ meaning in the context of their time. Laurence Olivier's brief efforts in that direction were hardly adequate and not terribly enlightening — not nearly as sharp or sophisticated as Alistair Cooke's recent explanation of Edwardian anti‐Semitism following a segment of “Upstairs, Downstairs,” the current Masterpiece Theater presentation on Channel 13. As long as literate commentary can be used effectively on television to defuse political controversy, there is no reason why it cannot also serve to prevent controversial theater from being driven off the screen, whether by outright or politely covert censorship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drunk on a doctor, treated by drink",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/31/archives/drunk-on-a-doctor-treated-by-drink-by-sarah-ferguson-196-pp-new.html,"What do we deny ourselves by not wrecking our lives? Could I wreck mine if I wanted to? Could I want to? I heard a heroin addict, a Vietnam veteran, tell about his 8‐year‐old prostitute in Saigon. They used to make love in a crib. The relationship as he saw it was beautiful and curious, and in his account there was an awed and precise attention one could not dismiss. God knows what tender damage the child sustained, and with what willingness and pleasure. But in his own meditative, driven way he was interesting quite apart from his official status as a sick man, a problem for therapy. That man had found what he may not quite have known he was looking for. The heroin came later when he got back to the States. Maybe he's been cured. Maybe he was “undersocialized,” as the books say, and maybe he has learned to depend upon a group for a sense of his own value; learned to depend on a place, or himself, or another person, or on work. Distinctions among degrees and kinds of dependency can seem less and less clear. I look at one of the two books on my table and think that while anyone can become dependent upon a psychiatrist, it's another thing to be so totally, obsessively, filially, projectively and sexually in love with the doctor that there are no other relationships that matter. And I look at the other book — somehow appropriately a huge bulk of several hundred galley pages —and think that any fool can see the difference between a homeless hobodrunk's miserable life in and out of institutions and, say, that of a harddrinking 840,000 ‐a ‐year commuter going home to his country club. Yet questions of comparative health, as of chance and choice, become ambiguous. Also, while one would not dispute the need to try to cure hard‐drug addiction, or alcoholism, or an irresistible lust for children, one may wish to see dependency in other ways as well. One thing is certain. It helps if the victim can write. The experience may then find intensities clearer than life. Indeed, some such accounts may move beyond official issues of diagnosis and cure into an existence one might call esthetic. Sarah Ferguson and “Frank Moore” could hardly be more different in their lives. Her sensitive, self‐conscious prose in “A Guard Within” seems almost too appropriate to the external facts of her identity—the Klinik in Zurich, the house in Scotland, the flat in London, and for the brief time they had together, her psychiatrist, to whom she gave the Corot, Casals and Thibaud recording of Schubert's Trio in B flat major and to whom (with an epigraph from Rilke) she addresses this desperate love diary as if to draw her doctor back from his grave. In another world of New England and upper New York State jails, state hospitals, saloons, bus‐stops, railroad sidings, bitter windy highways not to be found in Whitman, and dark doorways where you can flop until the town cop hauls you in—is “Frank Moore.” His long, repetitive life is the substance of a long, cumbersome but profound book, “Escape From Custody,” by his friend and correspondent, Dr. Robert Straus. Both the woman and the man were dependent on doctors and hospitals. And if the title of each book refers to an achievement of freedom, each freedom seems often to have been an escape only into a deeper life within the original dependency. That this should be so in “A Guard Within” is not surprising. Often the woman's absorption in the older man finds the form of its veering cadences and images of despair and devotion and exhibitionistic possessiveness in the very form of the writing. Thus the sickness of need comes to be entangled in the skill with which Sarah Ferguson evokes it. Her presence presses upon the reader. There is the authoritarian father, abortion, divorce, the adopted child for whom she tries vainly to make room in herself. And there is a sense of precious time passing like the objects her acute eye passes in the doctor's flat (the palm tree in a blue and white pot, the piano, the fair hair twined in the gold back of an enamel frame she gave him containing a miniature of her mother who died when Sarah was 3). They talk of the prospect of his death; he visits her; the relation at some points seems almost to have been an end in itself for him too. He is the “you” of the book, but like certain emotional effects whose actual causes the author falls to make clear, he remains somehow unembodied. If he had known his death was so near, would he have let her give up everything to him? She says he risked this intimacy because he had to, but we have to guess the truth from what she thinks she means and from what she seems to halfhope. Like a good novelist, she prepares us so honestly yet quietly for the death that when it comes it is unexpectedly upsetting. The healthy, happy homeopath with whom she is staying near her doctor's country house at the time of his sudden death says, “No person should depend on another. It is against the law of God and nature.” Others see the event as, for her, an extreme example of “broken transference.” Her book, however, makes good on its main idea, and if she herself is as lost as Paul Morel at the end of “Sons and Lovers,” the experience emerges as an overwhelming discovery in itself, to be overwhelmingly felt. And this may be better than any understand Moving from “A Guard Within” to “Escape From Custody” is a little like moving from Virginia Woolf to Theodore Dreiser. And in many of Frank Moore's letters, with their jargon and their tired metaphors, I was reminded ironically of words Virginia Woolf quotes one of her friends as saying about another: “when [she] lets her style get on top of her, one thinks only of that; when she uses clichés, one thinks what she means.” Frank Moore called himself prolix, and he was right. But the posthumous freedom of speech Dr. Straus has given this remarkable derelict reveals a life. Straus's own main theme is not so much Frank Moore's 38 years of alcoholism as what the drinking was associated with, a gradually established pattern of living in institutions where one's needs are provided for by others. The drinking is a parallel escape, but Straus argues that in most homeless alcoholic men of this category the institutional syndrome precedes the drinking. Often the drinking is a means of getting put away again. When the institution (and passivity, and trouble coping with others) gets too much, these men arrange to be released and go right back on the booze. This is all interesting enough, as are Straus's comments, for example, on the strategies of skid‐row drinking or the differences between “total institutions” (prisons, jails, hospitals) and institutional “settings” like. Army, Navy, Merchant Marine, lumber camp and shelter programs, to name those that Frank Moore had experience of. But primarily in this book Straus has given Frank Moore They met in 1945 at the Salvation Army Men's Service Center in New Haven. Frank was the 13th man Straus interviewed. In the course of quoting articles on alcoholism and Schopenhauer on pleasure and pain, Frank said, “I've read everything—thought about it all.” Pedantic, gran diose, resourceful, humble, resentful, fundamentally friendly, largely selftaught, evasive on certain events of the past (a dishonorable discharge, a stretch in Alcatraz), argumentative and, in the 322 letters included in the book, pathetically well‐informed on many topics—Frank Moore is an American ordeal, primary material. Ken Kesey in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” did better with the mental hospital—particularly the parasitic manipulation of inmates by the staff who are dependency cases themselves. Still, through this immense, often drab document Frank Moore's account of the waste in these places, the boredom, the lack of encouragement, has a sober continuity as real as a Fred Wiseman film or Berenice Abbott photograph of oldlaw tenements in Manhattan. Unless we watch the dates of the letters we may forget that Frank disappears from Straus's record for weeks and months at a time. The gaps are as much a part of the implacable process of his later life as are the itemized benders, bed tickets, meal tickets, “descriptions of existing conditions,” the prolegomena for various “Moore Utopias,” the endless glimpses of rooming‐house windows that don't open, the fugitive can of soup in the station house, the roll of toilet paper and stub of pencil. “If a person were to write of his accomplishments during a lifetime, it could be written on a cigarette paper. If he were to write of his opinions, prejudices, & the vagaries of his mind, the world could not supply a single individual with sufficient paper.” Fancy. phrases lugubrious as the identifications with Hamlet, Jaques, Napoleon and others mingle with painful generalization and the most plain details of the American life around Frank Moore. Through it all—a beginning he could never escape —is the terrible tale of his childhood. His father a suicide two weeks after Frank was born. His mother's departure the next year. Her later return and the lifelong hostility‐between them. The stern grandfather who brought Frank up to be successful. The school kids who kidded him because of his father's suicide. Frank's early departure for the Navy — not so much an initiative as a defiant separation inspired by lack of support. But no account of causes can evoke the fullness of Frank Moore's later life salvaged in a real sense by the man Bob Straus, who had little luck in changing Frank. That life resists summary. And like his identification documents apparently lost when Frank had to move—including the proof he particularly prized that a medical’ school had accepted his body —his life was not lost. Not even while he lived it. Nor afterward, for those who may read this book and, from a safe distance, reflect blankly upon the fact that their American luck has been better. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A jury Watcher Advises Mitchell's Defense on the Reactions of Panel Members,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/01/archives/a-jury-watcher-advises-mitchells-defense-on-the-reactions-of-panel.html,"For the first six weeks of the conspiracy trial of former Attorney General John N. Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice. H. Stens, a man has been sitting in the spectator section of the courtroom, peering at 12 persons he has never met but whom he helped to select as jurors. He occasionally takes notes—a gesture by one juror, a grimace by another, a smile, a yawn. During recesses and lunch breaks he goes over his observations with the man who hired him, Peter Fleming Jr., Mr. Mitchell's attorney. The silent observer is Marty Herbst, who is neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist nor a social scientist. Formally, he describes himself as a research and media analyst. Informally, he says he is “an ad man.” As a jury watcher, Mr. Herbst's role is to interpret how the nine men and three women jurors react to witnesses and prosecution and defense attorneys. “I watch to see if they're alert, restless, bored, responsive,” he said. “Are they for me or ogainst me? Sometimes my suggestions are used. I will tell Fleming they were paying attention when he said this, this and this, but not when he said that, that and that.” For Technical Data Mr. Herbst, 45 years old, was hired by Mr. Fleming last summer to provide technical data in support of a change of venue motion. Defense attorneys had argued that “massive pretrial publicity” made it impossible to find a fair and impartial jury in New York. In a telephone survey last summer Mr. Herbst determined that an overwhelming number of persons interviewed in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester County—the area from which the Jurors would be called — thought Mr. Mitchell was guilty. “We broke this reaction down in terms of age, income, education, ethnic characteristics, religion,” Mr. Herbst said. “Later in a second survey we asked them attitudinal questions: Where did they stand on the issue of women's lib, the grain deal, abortion, the Nixon policies. “Much of life is selling,” said Mr. Herbst, who has a master's degree in statistics and marketing research. “As a matter of fact, it's all selling. We like to sell to our peers. The same applies to a lawyer. He might prefer a jury that is high income, well educated, a group of professionals, but such jury could be detrimental to his client.” Mr. Fleming and Mr. Herbst weed that a jury of Mr. Mitchell's peers “would not Identify with Mr. Mitchell.”, The larger issue, Mr. Herbst said in an interview, “was whether they were anti‐or pro‐establishment.” “Limousine liberals were to be avoided,” he said. “We wanted people who were home established, to the right, more concerned with inflation than Watergate. We looked for jurors who did not read The New York Times but who did read The Daily News.” A profile was then drawn up of people least likely to see Mr. Mitchell as gullty. “We setup a weighted point system from 0 to 6, plus or minus either way, purely arbitrary,” Mr. Herbst said. “A college graduate was minus 6, a Catholic was plus 4, a Jew was minus 5, a clerical worker earning between $8,000 and $10,000 yearly was plus 4.” By Media Habits He said that sometimes people eager to serve on a jury would disguise their attitudes. Mr. Herbst's task was to devise a method for Mr. Fleming to analyze a juror's actual feelings. And that device, he says, is television. “What we tried to do,” he said, “was reveal what jurors think through their media habits,” somewhat in the way that advertising agencles determine how to package a political candidate for a particular viewing audience. It was, he said, a whole “new packaging process.” He said the publicity surrounding the trial enabled the attorneys to explore the television viewing habits of prospective jurors. The jury questioning process was held in the judge's chambers and a transcript of the proceedings was ordered sealed by the Judge. As an example of their thinkbig, Mr. Herbst said: “The ideal personality for our purposes is John Wayne, He's; authoritative, strong, the preserver of property rights, a rightwinger. A viewer would identify a with John Mitchell. In other words, John Mitchell's mask is translated to John Wayne.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/03/archives/rebellion-in-an-orphanage-books-ofthe-times.html,"DADDY PIG. By Mel Arright. 218 pages. BobbsMerrill. $7.50. Hal Dabney is one of the 10 million people in America who are looking for a way to salvage their marriages. He is a successful real estate operator, but his job brings him only money, so he turns to his wife and tries to find in their fearful symmetry some idea or ideal to live for or by. He's one of these men who suffer, from a yearning so general that they will die still wondering what it is. As he puts it, he wants to believe in something—but all the somethings he has tried so far have failed. Eventually—one is tempted to say, inevitably—he arrives at the idea of parenthood. That way, at least, he can postpone his problem one generation. When his wife doesn't conceive and the doctor tells him that his sperm specimen shows a lack of “motility,” he becomes obsessed with the idea of paternity, as if it were the only possible form of creativity. He remembers the three girls who, in his bachelorhood, named him as the source of their positive rabbit tests. Two of them he doubted, and they had abortions anyway, but the third.... The third was a black girl, a one‐night stand that he has always felt guilty about. She had refused his offer to pay and disappeared. He has to find her. More Symptom Than Character Even if you can believe this much, you've still got quite away to go. “Daddy Pig” is a regular glutton for the symbolic slops of contemporary politics. But Mr. Arrighi's writing has a certain charm and his novel can be read in a mood of literary probation, much as you can listen to music while you do something else. There is it enough going on to keep you occupied, and Hal has an echo in almost everybody. In fact, that may be part of his trouble. He is more convincing as a social symptom than as a character. Naturally, he tracks down Janine, the black girl, and her 7‐year‐old son Patrice, who is unmistakably his. He is inspired to embark on a career of radical shabby. Janine lives in a “tribal” group, the Zanj, which is amateurishly patterned after an African society. Like some of the more extreme advocates of “a return to roots,” the Zanj do not see the incongruity of trying to reconstitute a pastoral society in one of the world's largest and most technophilic cities. It's all the same to Dabney, though: he just wants to find the fruit of his loins and lose himself. Whites can only exist as slaves among the Zanj and he accepts the role with love and gratitude. He has his son, his guilt and his penance—what more could any man ask? He is as happy as a cockroach. He casts off all his worldly concerns and practices Zen in the art of floor scrubbing. His expensive flabbiness falls away and he is honed down to muscle and moral fiber. His counterculture or underground experiences are not all idyllic, however, and Mr. Arrighi has a few mildly wry and witty things to say about white “revolutionaries.” Black is beautiful and white is paranoid. The “savage” is truly noble and every other underground movement is, to borrow a lovely phrase from Harold Clurman, like “a rebellion in an orphanage.” They have no history, no parent symbol, to build on, these poor whites. Their revolution is as puerile as a child who refuses toilet training. They live on a starvation diet of myths—not cosmic myths of dark gods and supernatural powers, but of intellectual barricade builders like Emma Goldman and Kropotkin. Some of this part of “Daddy Pig” is sad; some is funny and telling. Dabney is the only slave of the Zanj, and as such he is very important. He is the one white person on whom they can practice absolute condescension. With all this, they are kinder to him than his white brothers who speak with forked tongue. In the beginning, all Dabney wanted was “a nice, well‐behaved revolution, a tasteful revolution, with no one really getting hurt and everyone feeling better afterward.”, Now he sees the naiveté of such a notion: you've got to destroy everything and reinvent yourself, rise from your own ashes. You can't even salvage your suede jacket or your favorite book of poetry. Naked came I, etc. Hero as Literary Device But Mr. Arrighi, in an act of transcendence that has almost passed out of fashion, sees beyond his hero. Dabney is not an alter ego, but, of all things, a literary device. He has been used by the author for his own selfish purposes—an indignity that runs the risk of alienating a considerable number of readers. The Zanj are not all that they seem. Paternity is not an unmixed blessing. There are wheels within wheels, no matter how primitive the society or basic the beliefs. The scales fall from Dabney's eyes, not without a crash of melodrama. That new literary genre, the dropout manual, or how to make yourself over with a few simple tools, has not prepared him for the particular contingencies he faces. He discovers that, for him, it's root, pig or die. It is not altogether clear what Mr. Arrighi is insinuating in “Daddy Pig,” but perhaps the substance could be summed up something like this: he, or his hero, is ambivalent toward all the current vogues in activism or inactivism, regardless of the race, creed or color of their advocates. And this may be the contemporary equivalent of the classical catharsis we have been taught to expect from art. Instead of opening the floodgates of our feelings, the novelist today may have to settle for Simply orchestrating our tensions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Archbishop Boland to Retire; Newark Newark Post Going to Gerety,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/03/archives/archbishop-boland-to-retire-newark-post-going-to-gerety.html,"The Most Rev. Thomas A. Boland, Archbishop of Newark, is retiring after 21 years as head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, it was announced yesterday. His successor will be the Most Rev. Peter L. Gerety, Bishop of the Diocese of Portland, which includes all of the State of Maine. Archbishop Boland, who is 78 years old, is three years past the age that Pope Paul has set as a retirement guideline for bishops. Officials of the archdiocese said it had been notified by the United States Catholic Conference in Washington that the Pope had accepted Archbishop Boland's retirement but that no date had been set for the succession. Gerety 17 Years Younger Bishop Gerety, who is 61, will be ministering to a Roman Catholic population six and one‐half times that of the Portland Diocese, whose 270,000 Catholics include 180,000 French‐speaking Canadians. He has headed the diocese since September, 1969. The 540‐square‐mile archdiocese, made up of Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Union Counties, has a population of three million, including 1.7 million Catholics, of whom 16,000 are black. The archbishop‐designate is considered a liberal theologian is and an advocate of the rights of blacks. He also has been leading spokesman in the farm workers' disputes in California. A native of Shelton, Conn., he studied at St. Thomas Seminary at Bloomfield, Conn., and at St. Sulpice Seminary, near Paris. He was ordained in Notre Dame Cathedral there in 1939, and then returned to serve as an assistant pastor in New Haven. In 1969, Bishop Gerety led unsuccessful Catholic opposition to a state bill in Maine legalizing abortions in certain circumstances. During the same year, he, called on Maine food retailers to stop selling California grapes in support of the farm workers' dispute with growers. Last year he was one of 14 New England bishops who signed a statement backing boycott of California‐grown lettruce in a similar dispute. He defended the rights of conscientious objectors to refuse service in Vietnam and appealed to the Maine Congressional delegation to seek modification of the Selective Service Act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
French Name Poher Interim President,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/04/archives/french-name-poher-interim-president-poher-is-given-rule-as-france.html,"PARIS, April 3—Alain Poher, centrist president of the Senate, was officially proclaimed the Acting President of France today in an atmosphere of grave uncertainty and political confusion. The death of President Georges Pompidou last night produced a virtually universal mood of shock despite national concern over a long and debilitating illness that had forced him to relinquish many duties in his final months. His death, and doubts about a successor, raised economic fears and started a rush into gold. [Page 61.] Mr. Poher will preside over a Cabinet meeting soon after funeral ceremonies for Mr. Pompidou in Paris tomorrow and a simple, private burial near the late President's country home in suburban Orvilliers. A larger, more public memorial service is scheduled for Saturday at Notre Dame Cathedral. Administration officials in Washington said that President Nixon expected to attend. The French Cabinet will promptly fix a date for the presidential elections, which will take place no earlier than April 28 and no later than May 5. Both dates fall on Sunday, the customary day for elections in France. The Constitution stipulates that new elections must be held 20 days at the earliest and 35 days at the latest after the presidency falls vacant. Post to Senate Chief Under the French Constitution, the President of the Senate becomes Acting President when that office is vacant. There is no office of Vice President. Leaders of France's political parties held secret meetings all day to discuss possible presidential candidates. But no choices have been announced. Known to have presidential ambitions are a former Premier, Jacques Chaban‐Delmas, Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the National Assembly President, Edgar Faure, and the Socialist party chief, François Mitterrand. Other possible candidates mentioned include Mr. Poher, the centrist leader, Jean‐Jacques Servan‐Schreiber, Premier Pierre Messmer, and Foreign Minister Michel Jobert. The current political confusion results from the great number of aspirants. When President de Gaulle resigned in April, 1969, Mr. Pompidou, then Premier, had already announced he was running for President and was by far the strongest personality in the field. Parties Show Discretion But today almost every French party reacted with discretion and an effort was made to silence partisan views — at least for now. There was a virtually unanimous disposition to pay tribute to the physical and moral courage of Mr. Pompidou. Mr. Jobert spoke of the “brutal” death of Mr. Pompidou. France‐Soir carried a huge banner headline saying: “Until the End of His Strength—Courage and a Sense of Duty.” Mr. Pompidou, who was 62 years old, canceled almost all his official appointments last week and then went to his country home, La Maison Blanche, at Orvilliers for the weekend. Close friends described his final days as a “nightmare.” The President was quoted as having told his wife: “Claude, I did not think it was possible to suffer so.” No official medical bulletin has yet been Issued from the Elysée Palace stating the cause of death. However, unofficial reports had circulated for months that the President was suffering from multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow that medical dictionaries say is invariably fatal. The average survival time is 18 months to three years. Agriculture Minister Raymond Marcellin said last night, “The last time I saw Georges Pompidou he bowed his head and told me, what I am doing is hard, very hard. Mr. Pompidou's wishes for his funeral and burial were contained in a note written by hand in August, 1972, and were given to the chief of staff of the Elysée Palace, Edouard Balladur. Mr. Balladur made it public this morning. It said: “I wish to be buried at Orvilliers. Naturally, I want neither flowers nor wreaths, nor an elaborate funerary monument. A simple slab of stone, with my name and the dates of my birth and my death. “A mass will be said in Paris at [the Church of] St. Louis en l'Ile, with Gregorian chants. The body of Mr. Pompidou will be borne to the lovely 18th‐century church on the Isle St. Louis only one block from his apartment at 26 Quai de Bethune. The church is in the center of the island in the Seine. A footbridge connects it with the Ile de la Cité and the Cathedral of Notre Dame. President Pompidou was attached to the Church of St.Louis en l'Ile not only because of its beauty and its nearness to his apartment. His two grandsons were baptized there. A cherished friend of the family, Canon Marcel Barbotin, will celebrate the funeral mass, which is scheduled to last 45 minutes. Only the family, Government officials and close aides of the President will attend. Then the cortege will proceed to the pleasant village of Orvilliers, 31 miles west of the outskirts of Paris, where Mr. Pompidou bought his house 22 years ago and spent many weekends. He purchased a billiard table and often invited the local stone mason to play with him. The burial will take place in a green and flowering cemetery at Orvilliers, surrounded by mossy stone wall. Mr. Pompidou's father is also buried there, his remains transported some years ago from the President's birthplace at Montboudif in mountainous central France. The curate, Jean Menez will conduct the last rites. The ceremony will be brief and simple, with only members of Mr. Pompidou's immediate family present. No one else, neither civil, religious and military authorities nor any of the 200 inhabitants of the village will be admitted. The Notre Dame service on Saturday will be attended by members of the French Government, the Parliament and foreign delegations. Among the foreigners will be Prime Minister Wilson of Britain and the Duke of Edinburgh; Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany; Premier Takeo Tanaka of Japan; Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan. The Soviet Union will send either Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin or President Nikolai V. Podgorny. Saturday will be a national day of mourning, with schools, offices, theaters, movie houses and concert halls closed. According to custom, all flags will be at half‐staff throughout France until the end of the month. While the nation waits for elections, some vital legislation will be stalled, including high school reform, liberalization of the abortion law, increases in advance payments of taxes and a plan for a constitutional change reducing the presidential tenure to five years from the present seven. The French Government must publish lists of candidates at least 15 days before voting begins. To get on the, list a potential candidate must have the backing of 100 members of Parliament and other elected and appointed officials. The candidates are sent to the Constitutional Council, which must check to see that they are proper. Each candidate must deposit $2,000, which he forfeits if he does not get at least 5 per cent of the votes. The presidential campaign will begin as soon as the list is published and will end the Friday before the voting. A committee of high public officials makes sure that each candidate receives the same public exposure. Each is entitled to two hours on television and two hours on radio. The same amount of time would be allotted for the runoff to be held two weeks after the first round of voting if no candidate has won a majority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HARASSMENT IS LAID TO ABORTION FOES,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/04/archives/harassment-is-laid-to-abortion-foes.html,"OMAHA, Neb. April 3 (UPI) —Some persons who opposed use of the University of Nebraska's Medical Center as an abortion clinic have subjected faculty members and their faniilles to “Intolerable harassment,” an official said yesterday. Dr. Robert Messer, chairman of the Department of Obstetries and Gynecology, also testified in United States District Court that he and a member of the Board of Regents were “on the hook” regarding the university's abortion policy. Dr. Messer appeared in support of two of his eight staff members, Drs. William Orrand Marvin Dietrich, operators of a private Omaha abortion clinic. Dr. Orr and Dr. Dietrich initiated the case, contending that the university's board of regents was restricting their civil rights to teach and practice medicine by refusing, to grant them permanent parttime status so they could perform abortions outside the medical school. Dr. Messer said that because, of, his views on abortion, he and his family as well as Dr. Orr and Dr. Dietrich and their families had been “subjected to intolerable harassment” by those who oppose abortion. He said someone had tossed a rock through a window of his home and that his family had received late night telephone calls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Newark's New Archbishop Includes Suburbs in Plans,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/04/archives/newarks-new-archbishop-includes-suburbs-in-plans-womens-role.html,"NEWARK, April 3—The newly designated Archbishop of Newark, the Most Rev. Peter L. Gerety, kept a hectic schedule today as he started an overnight visit to one of the most heavily urbanized Roman Catholic archdioceses in America, whose 1.7 million people will soon be under his spiritual guidance. Bishop Gerety, who is 61 years old, spent most of the day in private conferences with other church administrators in the comfortable Newark Chancery offices at 33 Mulberry Street. He kept up his crowded appointment schedule tonight in the rectory of Sacred Heart Cathedral. A long‐time church administrator, Bishop Gerety appeared in an interview to be an affable and articulate speaker but one who chose his words carefully. An Over‐All View He stressed during discussions of his new job that he viewed his assignment as one that “will deal not only with the City of Newark itself, but also emphasize programs in the suburbs and rural areas of the archdiocese, too.” The new Archbishop, who is moving to New Jersey from his post as Bishop of the Diocese of Portland, which encompasses all of the state of Maine, succeeds the Most Rev. Thomas A. Boland, who is retiring at the age of 78 after 21 years as Archbishop of Newark. Bishop Gerety said today, he viewed his first task as one that will be to “stop, look, listen and learn about the totality of the archdiocese problems.” “I hesitate to make any firm predictions about what I'll be doing in the job. Many people describe my new job as working merely in Newark,” he said, “but the church must work for the fellow in the suburbs as well as the parishes in the city.” While Bishop Gerety couched his responses to questions with caution, particularly in discussing the changing role of the church and his own views on social issues, one long‐time observer of Catholic activities in the state said he viewed Bishop Gerety as a “progressive church leader, not necessarily a liberal, but one who can both accept and implement change in the church.” Women's Role Studied When asked whether he thought that women should be ordained as priests, Bishop Gerety responded by saying, “I favor the involvement of women in church ministries and believe they should serve in as many capacities as are acceptable within the faith traditions of the church.” When pressed on whether he would advocate the ordinate of women, he responded, “the church is taking a good hard look at the issue, and it is one that is not yet resolved.” Bishop Gerety's new post encompasses Hudson, Essex, Union, and Bergen Counties. It ineludes some, of New Jersey's largest cities, including Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth, and Hackensack. It has a population of nearly three million people. Prior to starting his assignment in, Portland eight years ago, Bishop Gerety, who was born in Shelton, Conn., spent nearly 23 years in the predominantly black parish of St. tin de Porres in New Haven, Conn. He was pastor there from 1956 to 1966. He also has worked actively with the National Office of Black Catholics and spoke out in the late nineteen sixties against what he termed “the Immorality of America's involvement in the Vietnam War.” He has led opposition legislation legalizing abortion in Maine, and has backed farmworkers' boycotts against nonunion lettuce and grape sales. Well‐Read and Urbane In conversation, the new Archbishop gives a visitor every indication of being the type well‐read and urbane church official made famous in the books and stories of J. S. Powers. Bishop Gerety studied theology “all in French” at seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris, and was ordained in the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 1939. Partly because of his studies in France, he said, he has acquired an appreciation of French cooking. When not tending to his duties, Bishop Gerety said, spends as much free time as possible on his own 24‐foot sailboat. He said he favored Long Island Sound for his cruises. He said his other principal hobby was reading, perticularly the theological and ecclesiastical journals, and books on American history and the period of the English Reformation. However, he interjected, “I certainly don't pose as a scholar.” Bishop Gerety said he was well aware “of the vast changes taking place in the Catholic Church, and I am delighted with their basic direction.” He again addressed his own views on the topic of change cautiously by saying “some view the changes of the church as too fast, some see them as too slow. I welcome the changes in the light of their relationship to the sacramental and liturgical life of the total church.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saturday will be a national day of mourning, with schools, offices, theaters, movie houses and concert halls closed. According to custom, all flags will be at half‐staff throughout France until the end of the month. While the nation waits for elections, some vital legislation will be stalled, including high school reform, liberalization of the abortion law, increases in advance payments of taxes and a plan for a constitutional change reducing the presidential tenure to five years from the present seven. The French Government must publish lists of candidates at least 15 days before voting begins. To get on the list a potential candidate must have the backing of 100 members of Parliament and other elected and appointed officials. The candidates are sent to the Constitutional Council, which must check to see that they are proper. Each candidate must deposit $2,000, which he forfeits if he does not get at least 5 per cent of the votes. The presidential campaign, will begin as soon as the list is published and will end the Friday before the voting. A committee of high public officials makes sure that each candidate receives the same public exposure. Each is entitled to two hours on television and two hours on radio. The same amount of time would be allotted for the runoff to be held two weeks after the first round of voting if no candidate has won a majority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Feminist Movement in Italy: Change May Come, but Slowly",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/07/archives/feminist-movement-in-italy-change-may-come-but-slowly-motherhood-a.html,"They gave you a dollar, it became a weapon That helped you discover a vocation To be blushing bride and mother, To be servant to a master. ROME Furl Sonnino's weapon is her guitar, her crusade is feminism and her baftlefield is Italy. Fufi is 25 years old and salesclerk in a Rome boutique, but recently she toured the big oil‐refinery towns and the shepherds hamlets of Sardinia, singing her songs extolling feminism and playing the guitar. Feminist folk, songs are something new in Sardinia, but then almost everything about the Italian feminist movement is also new. Everything except the problams it's facing. Italy is still the land where mother reigns supreme and change, if it comes, will be slow. A recent survey indicated that motherhood re. the dream of most Italian tan women. Natalia Aspesi, a feminist author, acknowledged the point recently, calling the Italian mother “a national monument.” Motherhood ‘a Mission’ In a survey commissioned by the Shell Oil Company here, Doxa, Italy's bestknown public opinion research organization, interviewed 4,500 women, including 525 university graduates, as part of a study on “The Woman Today in Italy.” The survey found 52 per cent of the women regarded motherhood as “a mission” in life and 39 per cent more. considered it, while not a woman's sole aim, “one of her fundamental joba.” Only 6 per cent demurred, calling motherhood, as the study expressed it, “a muchembroidered myth to keep women inside in the family orbit and subjugate them to domestic jobs.” Nor did the women questioned appreciate meddling with their role. Only 16 per cent said a husband ought “regularly to help a wife;” 18 per cent just: as firmly insisted a husband should never lend a helping hand. Italy's feminists didn't begin a serious effort to change views until about four years ago, when the. Movimento per la Liberazione della Donna (M.L.D.), or women's liberation movement, was created in Rome. Nearly half the group's charter members were men and the organization shied from anything that smacked of being anti‐male. As a result, it wasn't long before dissenting groups spun away from the M.L.D.; then there were splinters off the splinters. The rivalry persists today. One Rome feminist group, refusing to participate in demonstration for legalized abortion, explained: “We'll organize a demonstration of our own, and it will be better.” A serious problem is that most Italian women have little Organizational experience, or how a group, the media or even an ordinary business meeting functions. Their shortcomings became painfully obvious last December at an abortion demon stration in front of Parliament: the placards were lost, the reporters assigned to cover the demonstration couldn't find lt and members of Parliament were never aware they were being, picketed. Complicating matters for the feminists is the massive presence of the Unions Donne Italiane (U.D.I.),. founded 30 years ago. The women's union has 240,090 members and is a Communist flanking organization that includes some independent groups. For almost the whole of the Italian postwar years, U.D.I. has absorbed the bulk of the Italian women's protests against society and is noticeably less radical in its demands than the feminists. Even so, the Italian feminist movement has started to gain momentum. Italy now boasts 56 feminist organizations; in Rome alone, there are about 20 consciousnesi‐, raising groups, including two in English. Show Militancy The first feminist complex was created last winter in Rome and houses a book shop, an underground theater and offices of “Effe,” a feminist monthly with a cir culation of 35,000 copies. In addition, books by Italian feminists have become best‐sellers, a feminist drama has been playing to packed houses and debates on feminist issues take place before standing‐room‐only crowds. During the winter, Italian feminists showed their mili tancy in increasing ways. They picketed Valentino, collected thousands of signatures on pro‐abortion petitions, took over market squares to stage feminist skits and plastered about 1,000 protest stickers over advertising they considered guilty of “treating women as objects.” But for all the determination of the feminists to have women break out of their traditional role as “la mamma,” there is one imposing obstacle. Even if an Italian woman could find a stand‐in and leave home to take a job, Italy's tangled problem of chronic unemployment makes finding a decent job unlikely. In fact, the female work force in Italy has been shrinking steadily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION POLL FINDS PUBLIC EVENLY SPLIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/08/archives/abortion-poll-finds-public-evenly-split.html,"The issue of permitting a woman to obtain an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy still evenly divides the American public a year after the United States Supreme Court decided the matter, according to a Gallup Poll survey released yesterday. The survey indicated that 47 per cent of the American people favored the court's ruling, and 44 per cent opposed it. A similar poll in December, 1972, just before the Jan. 22 ruling, showed 46 per cent of those surveyed in favor and 45 per cent opposed. The survey results that were released yesterday were based on interviews with 1,582 adults 18 years old and older in more than 300 localities between March 8 and March 11 and between March 15 and March 18, This was the question asked: “The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a woman may go to a doctor to end pregnancy at any time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose this ruling?”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Screen: ‘Our Time’,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/11/archives/the-screen-our-time-formula-comedy-is-at-the-sutton-the-cast.html,"“Our Time,” which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, is, a pre‐pill romantic drama designed, perversely, for the prepubescent set. It combines the worst features of two kinds of ancient Broadway formula comedy with a gothic lack of sensi?? all its own. The time is 1955 and the place, most of the time, is Penfield Academy, a fancy Massachusetts boarding school for girls, including the elegantly boned Abby Reed (Pamela sue Martin) and her roommate, the plain, sensitive Muffy Pratt (Betsy Slade). Abby and Muffy are the literary descendants of Judy and Fuffy, the heroines of Sally Benson's New Yorker stories, which were later turned into a Broadway show by Chodorov and Fields. Abby and Muffy are what used to be called imps, meaning they do things on the order of talking during chapel. There is a difference, but, if you think about it, the difference is essentially one of degree, not kind. Abby and Muffy are experiencing the sort of lusts that used to keep the curtain up for three acts in plays by F. Hugh Herbert, whose characters were generally older and married. In the jargon of Old Broadway, Abby and Muffy want to “do it.” Abby does do it, quite successfully, with her friend Michael. Then poor Muffy tries just once, and most unhappily, winds up instantaneously pregnant. Although Peter Hyams, the director, is barely 30 years old, he has staged the film as if he had committed to memory all of the dumbest mannerisms of the pre‐World War II Broadway theater. Characters talk to each other's backs. Nobody leaves the set without attempting some boff exit line or gesture. Some of these mannerisms may actually be in the screenplay bylatie C. Stanton. I have no idea. The program states, however, that Miss Stanton, 26, is the author of 42 one‐act plays and three three‐act plays, “none of them produced.” ?? It is difficult to believe that Mr. Hyams was alto the director of the recent “Busting,” one of the better, more intelligent cop movies. Perhaps teen‐age rich girls are not characters with whom he has much, sympathy or understanding. It may be significant that the film's one episode that has any life features a muddle‐headed young med‐school student who, for contradictory reasons (money and sympathy), performs Muffy's abortion. As played by Robert Walden, there's a hint of a character here. The abortion is a genuinely moving sequence in a film that is otherwise full of sentimental affectations, like the fussy camerawork and the orangy color, which, I suppose, is meant to evoke times past. Twenty years ago, the film says weepily, the wages of doing it was death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boston Indicts Doctors in Fetus Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/13/archives/boston-indicts-doctors-in-fetus-cases-baston-indicts-5-doctors-in.html,"BOSTON, April 12—A leading Boston doctor has been indicted for manslaughter in the death of a fetus in connection with a legal abortion, and four other doctors have been accused of violating a 19thcentury law against graverobbing for using tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The indictments, which spread dismay and indignation in Boston's huge medical research establishment today, were handed up yesterday by a Suffolk County grand jury. If upheld in court, medical specialists say, they would cripple much crucial medical research and force doctors to attempt to keep many aborted fetuses alive by artificial means. Indicted for manslaughter was Dr. Kenneth Edelin, chief resident for obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital. He was accused of causing the death of a 24‐weekold fetus, called a “viable baby boy” by the prosecutor, after it was removed during a therapeutic abortion performed at the mother's request last October. The four others, named in separate charges, were Drs. Leon D. Sabath, Leonard Berman, David Charles and Agneta Philipson, all currently or formerly with Boston City Hospital. They were accused not of causing any deaths but of violating an obscure seldomused Massachusetts law forbidding the carrying away of human bodies or remains for the purpose of dissection. They were involved in 1971 and 1972 in a federally supported experiment to determine which of two antibiotics taken by pregnant women worked better in stopping bacterial infections in the unborn fetus. The indictments were characterized by many in the outiraged medical community here today as essentially political, Brought in response to heavy pressure from antiabortion forces, which are politically potent in heavily Roman Catholic Massachusetts. The charges were brought by the Office of District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne, who is up for re‐election this year. The prosecution of the doctors, who were suspended without prejudice from the hospital was seen by, many as an end run to get around last year's Supreme Court ruling, which rendered the abortion laws of Massachusetts and many other states invalid. The issue has been a particularly emotional one here. The charges raises many murky medical and legal questions about the point at which life begins, about the rights of the mother versus the responsibility of the state to protect potential life and the needs of medical research, much of which depends on the availability of fetal tissue. In an interview, Assistant District Attorney Newman A. Flanagan said that the abortion performed by Dr. Edelin was perfectly legal under the Supreme Court ruling but the question at issue was what happened to the fetus, which was removed surgically by hysterotomy, a technique similar to Caesarean section. “All I can tell you is that viable fetus was killed by the doctor,” he said. He would not say how the fetus was killed. Full Legal Standing Mr. Flanagan was saying, in effect, that the 24‐week‐old fetus had the full legal standing of a human being. In its ruling, citing medical opinion, the Supreme Court held that state's right to protect unborn life began only at the point at which the fetus is viable outside the mother's womb, which it said is “usually placed at about seven months [28 weeks], but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.” Dr. Arthur Hertig, a leading authority on human embryology, said today that in all his years at Boston's Lying‐In Hospital, he had never seen a premature infant survive at less than 28 weeks. Dr. Edelin's indictment was an outgrowth of a separate inquiry into the actions of the four other doctors. They had used what is by now a common medical technique of performing tests on fetuses to be discarded after, regular abortions. When results of their work were published, last June in the New England Journal of Media cine, a public uproar ensued, leading to yesterday's indictments. The experiment was undertaken to study alternatives to penicillin, to which many pregnant women are allergic, in the prevention of such intrauterine infections as congenital syphilis. Two antibiotics, called erythromycin and clindamycin, were widely used as substitutes but there was some doubt about whether enough of the drug passed through the placenta to the fetus to do any good. To find out, 33 pregnant women who were about to undergo therapeutic abortions and who gave their written consent were given doses of the drugs. After the abortions, the dead fetuses were analyzed for drug content. The team found that both drugs crossed the placental barrier but that clindamycin did it “more readily.” Such fetal experiments have played a crucial role in the history of medical science. The development of the vaccine against polio was made possible by growing the polio virus in tissue cultured from aborted fetuses. The virus could not be grown in adult tissue. Dr. Thomas H. Weller and Dr. John F. Enders of Harvard won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1954 for this work, which would now be considered illegal under the district attorney's interpretation of the grave‐robbing laws. Research Halted Already a number of researchers are said to have temporarily halted fetal research. Also, a bill before the Massachusetts legislature would make it illegal to use fetal material for research. Aborted fetuses are normally sent to the pathology department of a hospital for disposal. In this state, a death certificate is issued, if requesed by the family, for fetuses older than 20 weeks. Some of the material is often given over to researchers because fetal cells grow well in the test tube and are free of the extraneous viruses present in older tissue. The possible loss of such material caused dismay in many laboratories. “This is ridiculous” said one prominent reresearcher, “I am not breaking the law. I can see this shutting down all sorts of work vital to society.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/13/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"SATURDAY, APRIL 13, 1974 International Secretary of State Kissinger virtually ruled out another comprehensive agreement on limiting strategic arms with the Soviet Union this year, but said “a more limited” accord curbing some offensive arms might be signed during President Nixon's expected visit to Moscow in June. He told newsmen after a meeting at the White House with the President and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko that the strategic‐arms talks were so “complicated” that it was possible that not even the “limited” accord could be achieved by the time Mr. Nixon ends his visit to the Soviet Union. [1:5.] Israeli forces raided several villages in southern Lebanon and blew up houses that were said to belong to Arab guerrilla sympathizers, the Israeli command announced in Tel Aviv. It said that the raid had been made in retaliation for the Arab terrorist attack Thursday on the Israeli town of Qiryat Shemona. [1:1.] The residents of Qiryat Shemona poured out their grief and anger in an emotional and violent funeral for 16 of the victims of the attack. [1:4.] After considering the matter for more than 20 years, the United Nations finally came up with a definition of “aggression.” A ripple of properly subdued excitement ran through the meeting chamber where the Committee on the Definition of Aggression agreed on a hazy three‐page definition of the concept, which has been a diplomatic issue since the Versailles peace conference of 1919. [1:4.] National The United Steelworkers of America accepted—more than three months before their old wage contract expires—a new three‐year agreement providing substantial increases in pay, cost‐of‐living allowances, pensions and other benefits. The agreement will increase hourly wages by 60.9 cents over the three‐year period, with the first raise going into effect on May 1, and it includes a cost‐of‐living adjustment. It affects 386,000 workers. [1:8.] The California franchise tax board, which recently ruled that President and Mrs. Nixon were not California residents for state income tax purposes, nonetheless levied an assessment of $4,302 for 1969 and 1970 on that part of their income earned in California. The assessment included a prorated portion of the President's salary based on the time he was at his San Clemente estate on various “working vacations.” [1:6–7.] In Morgantown, West Va., a small college town on the northern rim of Appalachia, the Federal Government has invested more than $57‐million to build a showcase rapid transit system and is now studying how to blow it up. What was meant to become a centerpiece of Nixon Administration efforts to provide a renaissance in urban transportation has become a costly and embarrassing white elephant. [1:8.] Dr. Kenneth Edelin, chief resident for obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital, was indicted for manslaughter in the death of a fetus in connection with a legal abortion and four other physicians were accused of violating a 19th‐century graverobbing law for using tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The indictments caused dismay and indignation in Boston's huge medical research establishment. [1:2–4.] Arthur Krock, one of the great figures of American journalism, died at his home in Washington last night. He was 86 years old. He had been a Washington correspondent for 60 years and in 34 years association with The New York Times he had been a reporter, chief of the Washington bureau, and columnist. He had been in poor health for nearly six months, and death was attributed to natural causes. [1:5–7.] Metropolitan Democratic legislative leaders in Trenton said that Governor Byrne had told them that Governor Wilson had reneged on an agreement to support bistate legislative initiatives to repeal a bond covenant that prevents the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from transportation projects that could lose money. [1:1–2.] Unemployment in both New York City and the state was significantly higher than it was nationally in the first two months of the year, according to a new method of computing unemployment rates that provides such comparisons for the first time. [1:3.] Mayor Beame obtained a Federal commitment in Washington for a minimum of $10‐million for the city's Model Cities Program. The money will be used to preserve the jobs of nearly 3,900 Model Cities workers in Harlem, the South Bronx and the Bedford‐Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn.

Rich Parents of Poor Students An attitude of Independence among many young people is creating an unexpected problem for college financial‐aid officers: Should they give help to students from well‐to‐do families when the students insist they are self‐supporting and just as much in need of money as students from poor families? Traditionally, parents have had the primary responsibility for their children's college education, and students have been considered candidates for financial aid only to the extent that their parents were unable to pay the full cost of their education. A growing number of students are arguing, on the ground that they have broken away from their families, that they should be considered, for college aid regardless of their parents' income. Many oite the 26th Amendment, which gave the vote to 18‐year‐olds, and legis lation in 40 states giving young people majority at 18. For the colleges, the problem is both financial and moral. There simply is not enough money to go around, and many officials feel is wrong for students with affluent parents to get money that might otherwise go to students from poorer backgrounds. Vote Supports Homosexuals When the board of trustees of the American Psychiatric Association voted last December to drop “homosexuality per se” from the association's manual of psychiatric disorders, some A.P.A. members objected and called for a vote by the membership. That vote is now in, and it upholds the trustees. The referendum results were 5,854 for the change, 3,810 against, and 367 abstentions. About half the members did not vote. The new position defines homosexuality as a “sexual orientation disturbance” only in those persons seriously troubled by their homosexuality.

The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/14/archives/the-world-in-summary.html,"The large matters— inflation, work stoppages, trade deficits, energy shortages — were supposed to command Harold Wilson's attention after he reclaimed power in Britain six weeks ago. If he fell, one of those issues was certain to be the cause. Instead, he is deep in a controversy‐cum‐crisis that involves 90 acres of derelict land, the buyers and sellers of which are members of the family of his private secretary. There is nothing in the transactions to suggest that they are illegal, and Mr, Wilson has said there is no evidence to suggest that they were even improper. But a broadside of criticism has embarrassed Mr. Wilson because during the campaign his Labor party attacked “property speculators” and “tax havens.” Critic's now ask if he is condoning actions he found objectionable in others. Oddly, the critics are mostly In the press. The Opposition Conservative party has for the most part kept quiet. How the controversy will affect the future of Mr. Wilson's government remains to be seen. He had planned to call elections some time this year—experts thought as early as June —to strengthen Labor's position in Parliament. But now the elections are likely to be put back, particularly in view of sniping about the transaction from members of Mr. Wilson's own party. At issue is a real‐estate deal involving 90 acres at Ince‐in‐Makerfield in Lancashire. Thirty of the acreas were bought seven years ago by Anthony Field, a Wilson golfing companion and the brother of Mrs. Marcia Williams, the Prime Minister's private secretary. Last year the 30 acres were sold at a substantial profit. The other 60 acres, purchased after 1967, are also up for sale. A newspaper account says that profits involved in all the sales amount to $1.9‐million. Mr. Field cites a net profit of $265,000. A Watergate‐ish element has crept in with the discovery that a letter written on House of Commons stationery and signed with a forged “Harold Wilson” had been received by an insurance broker in connection with the sale of the 30 acres. But the letter, which said in part,” “I feel sure that you are quite capable of carrying our Ince‐in‐Makerfield deal through with efficiency and discretion,” no longer exists. It has been destroyed. Broker Ronald Milhench said he burned it after receiving anonymous telephone calls threatening the lives of his children. The forgery represented the only apparently illegal act in the transaction. Scotland Yard is looking into the entire matter. Ireland's Armagh Isn't Safe, Either The ancient Irish capital of Armagh last week became the focus of the Irish Republican Army's philosophy of violence. A firebomb attack demolished most of the old city's shopping district. No one was killed but several persons were injured. Later, the Provisional wing of the I.R.A. launched bomb attacks, burned hijacked buses and trucks and instigated short but violent riots in Belfast. The result was the worst confusion in Northern Ireland in months. British observers believed that the timing of the latest outbreaks was prompted by the belief shared by I.R.A. leaders that “concessions” can be wrung from Britain's new Labor Government. According to that theory, the bombings are a test of the Government's nerve. The official response to the bombings was quickly delivered by Merlyn Rees, the Secretary for Northern Ireland. “I am not prepared to give in to men of violence,” he told the House of Commons. He accused the I.R.A. of trying to “bomb their way to the conference table” but promised stiff measures to combat the terrorists. A Pact on the Subcontinent, But No Panacea Atter five days of tough negotiations, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have signed an agreement calling for repatriation of 195 Pakistani prisoners held In Bangladesh since the 1971 war. The way was thus opened for normal diplomatic and trade relations, and now the three countries can concentrate on internal problems they have in surplus. Bangladesh's price for releasing the prisoners—who had been scheduled to face trials for murder, rape and other war crimes—was an official apology from Pakistan for her army's violent conduct during the war. Bangladesh got the apology. The return of the prisoners was nevertheless seen as a triumph for Pakistan's President Zulfikar All Bhutto, who had insisted that the proposed trials would not take place. But significant problems remain. One is the fate of the Bihari minority in Bangladesh, most of whom have been herded in refugee camps since they sided with the Pakistanis during the war. Pakistan has said she will accept many of them but not the entire 600,000 to 900,000 believed to be involved. Pakistan still has not recovered fully from the shock of losing the war. Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries on earth, exists on the edge of political anarchy. The police and army have been unable to control the situation, and the ruling Awami League has established its own vigilailtes. But the most militant of these, the Rakkhi Bahini, have clashed violently with political rivals. Only the personality of the Prime Minister, Sheik Mujibur Ralunan—himself reported in fragile health—has held the country together. And India, where the governing Congress party has been buffeted by regional rioting over corruption and food shortages, needs a huge infusion of foreign aid. A 13‐nation aid consortium met in Paris last week to discuss a World Bank report which reportedly called for $12‐billion in aid to India during the next five Years. No decisions were published and a new conference will be held, with India present, in June. The Third World Puts Its Case Third World representatives have come to the United Nations, and their forceful spokesman, Algerian President Houari Boumediene, declared: “The raw‐material producing countries insist on being masters in their own houses.” Geopolitics dominated much of the oratory last week. China's Deputy Premier Teng Hsiao‐ping asserted that the United States and the Soviet Union were equally exploiters of undeveloped countries. The Russians, he said, were “merchants of death” who peddled outmoded weapons in return for raw materials. The American reply will not be delivered until this week, but Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko dismissed the Chinese attack as “slanderous.” He said that détente between Washington and Moscow and the increased trade it has fostered would also bring economic benefits to undeveloped countries. The Algerian President, In addressing the special General Assembly session on raw materials, urged producing countries to form cartels to defend prices of such commodities as bauxite, copper and tin. He cited the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as a successful model, but he played down the rising cost of oil. Soaring costs of food and fertilizer were more important, he said. Wheat, for instance, he said, doubled in price from July, 1972, to July, 1973 and then doubled again by the end of 1973. He also had a new proposal: He called on the Assembly to establish, a new assistance program for the least‐developed countries, perhaps to be managed by the World Bank. Gaullism's Unruly Heirs Are Lining Up The political heirs of Gaullism are still maneuvering, but the French electorate's choice in the election May 5 to pick a successor to Georges Pompidou appears to have narrowed to three major candidates: Former Premier Jacques Chaban‐Delmas, the front‐running Gaullist; Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the Independent Republican party but allied with the Gaullists on many issues, and Françói Mitterrand, leader of the Socialists but also backed by the Communists. Mr. Chaban‐Delmas has the support of such Gaullist barons as former Premier Michel Debra and polls showed him the most popular candidate. But there was discontent in some sections of the party about his loyalty to the de Gaulle‐Pompidou political legacy. The party's situation has been further complicated by the decision of Jean Royer, a political independent but the political idol of a significant segment of small businessmen and shopkeepers who usually vote Gaullist, to seek the presidency. The Gaullists' chief problem is to achieve unity in the face of what promises to be a strong race by Mr. Mitterrand. It is he who has most frequently urged action on the issues that a poll says are troubling Frenchmen: the plight of the aged and the poor, employment, rising prices, civil liberties, education, the energy crisis, European unity and contraception and abortion. The maneuvering for the Gailllists' favor had begun even before President Pompidou was buried. But that fact did not prevent French Government officials from criticizing President Nixon's own campaign‐like behavior during his visit to Paris for a memorial service last weekend. Mr. Nixon several times plunged through police lines to chat with curbside crowds, and he conferred ostentatiously with several world leaders. Le Monde called it a “Nixon festival” and a letter circulated by a high official said the President had shamelessly “substituted a publicity campaign for the mourning of an entire nation.” Whitlam Calls A Midway Vote Blocked by opposition control of the Senate from getting his proposed legislation through Parliament, Australia's Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam has called a national election just half‐way through his three‐year term. It will be held May 18. Labor has a majority in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate power rests with the conservative Liberal‐Country party coalition that governed for two decades before Labor came to power in December, 1972. The Laborites have been unable to enact proposals for universal health insurance, to combat trade monopolies and to reduce industrial disputes. Their farm and mining policies have caused serious setbacks in recent state elections—the most recent in Western Australia two weeks ago—but because the aging opposition coalition faces internal dissension, Mr. Wititlam's federal chances are brighter, although one poll two weeks ago predicted victory for the Liberals. A Gloomy Kissinger The world has grown accustomed to the flying diplomatic coups of Henry Kissinger. But the Secretary of State conceded last week that the pace of success is likely to slow in the months ahead. In public and private sessions with Congressmen and reporters he made these points: “A permanent agreement this year.” with the Soviet Union on strategic arms limitations is doubtful. “Progress” was made on the nuclear arms issues during Mr. Kissinger's Moscow visit last month, but the Soviet position remains unacceptable to the Administration. Washington's relations with Europe are likely to remain difficult at least until France gets a new President in May. An Argentine Kidnapping Goes Wrong Argentina's machine‐gun politics, which inspire about three kidnappings a week, claimed another American victim last week, but his abductors quickly released him, near death. Alfred Laun, the head of the United States Information Service in Córdoda, Argentina's second largest city, was abducted from his home after a bloody brawl in which he fought the kidnappers. The guerrillas also took powerful radio receiver and transmitter and they said that the 36‐year‐old American had engaged in “counterrevolutionary activities In Vietnam, Santo Domingo, Brazil and Bolivia” and had acted as a liaison man “in the fascist military coup against our brother people in Chile.” American Embassy officials denied the guerrillas' suggestion that Mr. Laun worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. They said he had never worked in Brazil or Bolivia. Mr. Laun's kidnappers, members of the People's Revolutionary Army, are the most powerful guerrilla group in Argentina. Last July they kidnapped the manager of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. subsidiary and released him after receiving $3‐million in ransom. But they have not released a third American, Victor Samuelson, manager of an Exxon oil refinery, although the company paid a $14.2‐million ransom last month.

Obscure Buckley Vaults Into Political Maelstrom,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/18/archives/obscure-buckley-vaults-into-political-maelstrom-obscure-buckley.html,"WASHINGTON, April 17 — William F. Buckley Jr., the columnist, was in Nairobi when he received a telegram from his brother, Senator James L. Buckley, informing him that on the following morning, the Senator would urge President Nixon to resign. The telegram was signed “Saint Sebastian,” a refer ence to the third‐century Christian martyr who smiled as the archers bent their bows. The call or resignation wa a stunning statement that shook the Capitol and lifted Senator Buckley, a 51‐year‐old Conservative Republican from the réla tiv obscurity of a back‐bench squariey into the forefront politically But despite the heavy criticism that the statement provoked among many Republicans and conservatrves — criticism that many observers believe has seriously weakened his political base — there are some observer who contend that the junior. Senator from New York has hardly become a political Saint Sebastian. • They believe that the Senator's call for the President's resignation served to restore interest in Mr. Buckley and renewed respect for his “independent, nonpolitical stance” — an important resource for a politician, they say, in the Watergate period. “Dumb, dumb, dumb,” was the telegrathed reaction of one New York State Republican county leader who, like the Senator, had been a stanch supporter of the President. That was on March 19, the day of the Buckley statement. But last week the same leader called to invite Mr. Buckley to be the guest of honor at the county organizations annual dinner in what a Buckley aide calls one of the fastest reversals on record. Nobody who knows the Senator, believes that his proposal was dictated by anything but conscience, but politicians have continued trying to sift the political fallout. The Senator himself, in a characteristic gesture, announced that his mail and telegrams ran 3 to 1 against him. Still he has responded with fresh calls for Mr. Nixon's resignation. There is nothing about James L. Buckley to suggest the leader of a political crusade. With his crew cut, erect bearing and J. Press suit, he resembles an Air Force general in mufti. He Is a man of great gentleness, unfailingly courteous and considerate. Indeed, friends and foes alike call him a “non politician.” The friends find this a virtue and his foes a fault, and it is this side of Mr. Buckley that came to the for in his proposal that President‐Nixon resign. “I'm bound to say that, over‐all, the reaction [to his statement] was negative,” said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia, an independent con servative and Mr. Buckley's closest friend in Washington. “As of now I would say that it certainly has not helped him.” Politicises in New York generally agree with this assessment. Richard Aurello, the former deputy mayor in the Lindsay administration, said that “a fundamental principle in politics is not to destroy your own base. Buckley destroyed his own base.” Among politicians who do not know. Senator Buckley personally, Mr Aurelio said, “there's a view that the reason he did this was to improve his, visibility in the state. No one knows anything about what he's done. There's no awareness of him and Small‐job approval.” Among conservatives who know Mr. Buckley, a different view, as might be ex pected, is evident. J. Daniel Mahoney, the New York Conservative party chairman, feels, that although most Conservatives disagree With Mr. Buckley's proposal, they respect his independent, nonpolitical stance. ‘A Great Asset’ And F. Clifton White, theConservative political consul tant who helped obtain a Presidential nomination in 1964 for Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, and‐ who managed Senator: Bucklers 1970. campaign, agrees that today, “being a nonpolitician is the greatest asset a man can have. People are desperate for leadership and integrity.” One reaction to the Buckley statement about President Nixon has been to focus fresh attention on the Senator's voting record. “When the votes are taken, I can hardly believe, I'm listening to a Senator from New York,” said a Republican colleague who sits a few rows in front of Mr. Buckley in the Senate chainber. On March 28, for example, when both the Senate and the House approved the minimum wage bill, Senator Buckley was the only man among the six Senators and 60 House members from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to cast a vote against the legislation. He said that the measure would deprive young people of job opportunities. Similarly, despite the pleas and visitations of two Republican Governors of New York —Nelson A. Rockefeller and Malcolm Wilson: two Democratic Mayors of New York City—John V. Lindsay and Abraham Dr Beanie, and delegations of legislative help save the 35‐cents transit fare, Mr. Buckley voted against mass transit operating subsidies. He is opposed to all subsidies, in fact, and believes the funds would be better used if they remained in the taxpayer's pockets. Assails ‘Women's’ Bills The Senator's opposition to pork‐barrel legislation led him to oppose 44 “specialinterest” projects, totaling $109‐million, including $14‐million for New York harbor and additional funds for beach erosion on Long Island. He also voted against increased Social Security benefits and vocational rehabilitation for the handicapped, citing the need for fiscal integrity. Mr. Buckley is equally consistent on so‐called women's issues. He was one of eight Senators to oppose the equalrights amendment because “it's not needed to do away with economic discriminatien and would impose a number of absurdities.” He opposed Federal funds for day care because young children need their mothers at home and be introduced a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortions except when the mother's life is in danger. The political philosophy, behind these actions, he says in a voice that is a sort of Patrician nasality, is that “government intervention usually makes things a little worse than they were and a lot more costly.” “Jim Buckley is a Catholic Calvinist,” said a liberal Republican Senator. “He finds it difficult to shade his views or do anything but hew to a given line. The trap for him is his rigidity. He feels that if he should deviate, it would shake him up, and he couldn't rely on himself.” The Senator's brother William said that “I'm not sure that you don't have to be more politically shrewd than he is in order to survive, or that you shouldn't be. We reject the concept of a philosopher‐king. People who are truly useful play the, world as it Is. I don't think he's very, good at it.” Nonetheless, the Senator will prevail, his brother said, because in addition to his integrity and an extraordinarily fine mind, he's fanatically good natured.” Mr. Buckley lingered on the word “fanatically”, rolling it around his tongue. A Lindsay Encounter? The Buckleys are, in fact, counting on that gentle good nature to help re‐elect James L. Buckley in 1976. “In 1976, sure he'll get reelected, if he does what he's supposed to do,” said F. Clif ton White.. “He has to be honest and be a good Senator. Who's going to run against him? John Lindsay?” As of now, John Lindsay and James Buckley, farmer classmates at Yale, are each other's favorite opponents for 1976. Mr. White thinks that time is on the Conservatives' side. He paints to last month's Roper Poll, which said that 42 per cent of the electorate nationwide consider themselves conservatives, as opposed to 24 per cent who said they were liberals. Also cited in New York City, was the Yankelovich poll, which, showed that 33 per cent of those interviewed considered themselves conservatives; 31 per cent moderate, and only 27 per cent liberal. A Decisive Meeting Meanwhile, invitations to address Republican fund‐raising events continue to pour in, amid speculation of a Buckley Vice Presidential candidacy in 1976. The Senator has settled into his $125,000 house in northwest Washington, where he lives with his wife Ann and two of his six children. The Buckleys also maintain an apartment at 60 Sutton Place South. It was Mr. White who played a major role in Mr. Buckley's decision to run for the Senate in 1970. Mr. Buckley already had campaigned for the. Senate in 1968 as “jury duty” and what the Senator called “A learning experience.” The 1968 campaign was regarded, from its inception, as a futile race: In 1970, Mr. Buckley recalled, there was nothing further to learn from another campaign. The Buckleys made their decision at a family gathering at Great Elm, their 36‐acre estate in Sharon, Conn. Mr. White produced the results of a poll, taken in a Rochester precinct, which he said showed that a Conservative could get elected. Patricia L. Buckley, managing editor of The National Review, who attended the Sharon conference, recalled that she did not want her brother to make the race. “I was opposed to it,” she said. “I was afraid he'd be hurt. I was afraid people would say mean things to him and he wouldn't have the shell to protect himself.” James Buckley's earlier experience in politics was in 1965, when he was manager of his brother William's celebrated campaign for Mayor of New York. From the first, the two brothers were victims of mistaken identity. Shortly after Senator Buckley took office, he received a letter from a constituent who complained: “Sir, now that my nausea has subsided after accidentally observing your appearance on ‘Laugh In,’ last evening, I, as one of your constituents and former admirers, am constrained to comment. Your silly grin as the inane and vulgar questions were asked and your equally inane replies were less than worthy of a Senator of the United States.” “Sir,” Senator Buckley replied, “I have forwarded your letter to my brother the columnist, William F. Buckley Jr. It was he; not I, who appeared on ‘Laugh In.’ I can't help but be curious as to why you consented to watch a program of which you so strongly disapprove.” It remained for his brother, however, to have the last word. “Sir,” William wrote. “It is typical of my brother to attempt to deceive his constituents. It was, of course, he, not I, who appeared on ‘Laugh In’ just as you suspected. On the other hand, you need not worry about it. His greatest deception is as yet undiscovered. It was I, not he, who was elected to the Senate. So you see, you have nothing to worry about. You are represented by al responsible, truthful man.” Which Buckley is really the Senator? James Buckley's voting record provides no clue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/19/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-other-news.html,"President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt announced that Egypt would end more than 18 years of exclusive reliance on Soviet arms and seek arms from other sources. Mr. Sadat said he made the decision because the Soviet Union had not acted on Egyptian arms requests during the last six months. Though he did not name alternative suppliers, Arab diplomats indicated Egypt would seek arms from Arab oil nations. [1:8.] The Major Events of the Day International As Syrian and Israeli ground forces continued the battle for control of Mount Hermon, both sides sent jets into action. Saying it was the first time Syria had used aircraft since the October war, military spokesmen in Damascus said Syrian planes had inflicted heavy losses on Israeli positions and that one Israeli plane had been set afire by antiaircraft fire—a claim disputed by Israeli spokesmen in Tel Aviv. [1:8.] Four Latin‐American countries proposed that Cuba be invited to a hemisphere foreign ministers' meeting next March. The United States offered no objection, but asked for a poll of other participating countries before a decision is made. The stance suggested that the United States was relaxing its 13‐year policy of isolating Cuba from hemisphere affairs, but a high State Department official insisted there had been no change in United States policy. [1:6.7.] National The nation suffered the largest quarterly decline in production since the recession year of 1958—and the steepest rate of inflation since 1951—during the first quarter of this year, the Commerce Department reported. The output of goods and services declined at an annual rate of 5.8 per cent, while prices rose at the rate of 10,8 per cent during the quarter. [1:1] A subpoena commanding President Nixon to give the Watergate prosecutor tape recordings and other records relating to 64 White House conversations was served on the White House shortly after it had been approved by Federal Judge John J. Sirica at the request of Leon Jaworski, the special prosecutor, The White House would say only that “counsel is considering” the subpoena, which was accepted for the President by his lawyer, James D. St. Clair, and is returnable on May 2. [1:6–7.] The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee ruled out any compromise with the White House over the committee's subpoena of same 42 White House tapes. Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. said it would be unacceptable for President Nixon's lawyers to decide unilaterally‐which portions of the material were relevant to the committee's impeachment inquiry. [14:4–5.] President Nixon named Virginia Y. Trotter, a vice chancellor of the University of Nebraska, as Assistant Secretary for Education in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It is the first time a woman has been named to the Government's highest education post, and her appointment, which is subject to Senate confirmation, is expected to meet wide approval within the education community. [18:3–4.] Hundreds of black men were stopped, searched and questioned on the streets of San Francisco as the police stepped up their search for one or more black men who have killed 12 white persons in a series of apparently random attacks over the last five months. The police action, begun after the latest killing on Wednesday, drew immediate protests from civil liberties groups. [1:2–3.] Metropolitan Dr. William J. Ronan was elected chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the agency announced its dedication to improving mass transportation. His appointment is to become effective the day after he resigns as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

ARE REINSTATED,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/19/archives/3-bostondoctor-are-reinstated-work-on-fetuses-defended-by-the-board.html,"BOSTON, April 18 — In an apparent reaction to mounting outrage within the medical community, the Boston Board of Health and Hospitals reinstated today three doctors who were suspended last week from Boston City Hospital after they were indicted for their work on legally, aborted human fetuses. In a statement released late this afternoon, the board said that none of the accused owsicians had done anything inconsistent with accepted standards of medical practice and Supreme Court guidelines on abortion. The case, which has attracted national attention and already curtailed research on fe tal tissue, has been widely viewed as a political effort to skirt last year's Supreme Court decision invalidating the abortion laws of most states. No Violations In restoring the hospital's chief resident for obstetrics and gynecology, Dr. Kenneth Edelin, who was charged with manslaughter in connection with legal abortion, the hospital board said it “found nothing in the records to indicatethat he did anything ??corisistent with his duties as the chief resident in obstetrics, or with established hospital policies, applicable Supreme Court rulings and accepted medidal practice.” The board further stated that it found nothing illegal in the case of the two other physicians, Drs. Leon D. Sabath and Leonard D. Berman, accused under an 1814 grave robbing law for performing experiments on dead fetuses. “No experiments were performed on any living tissue, nor was any harm done to any living organism,” the board said. Two other doctors, Agneta Philipson and David Charles, were also indicted in the fetal research, but had previously left the employ of the hospital. Dr. Edelin was arraigned yesterday and is free on bail; the other four are scheduled to appear Monday. Automatic Suspension When the indictments were returned last week by a Suffolk County grand jury, the doctors were automatically suspended without pay and without prejudice from their jobs at the municipally run hospital. The indictments and the suspensions incensed much of Boston's huge medical establishment because it was felt that the doctors were being made scapegoats by Massachusetts's politically potent anti‐abortion forces. In a statement today the hospital board said that unlike previous cases in which miployes had been accused criminal acts, these charges related directly to medical procedures at the hospital and that it could therefore draw its own conclusions. Concurring in the decision to restore the doctors was William P. Morrisey, a banker who is a hospital board member and a leading Roman Catholic layman. However, Mr. Morrisey appended a stateof his own affirming his belief in the “right to life” of the fetus and urging that the “serious” charges against the doctors be investigated fully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Curbs on Fetal Research Impede Fight on Disease,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/20/archives/curbs-on-fetal-research-impede-fight-on-disease.html,"Restrictions on fetal research that have been instituted in the last few weeks are sei iously impeding doctors in several medical centers in the United States in their efforts to develop potential cures and preventions for a wide variety of diseases. These curbs are now affecting research on cancer, birth defects, aging, the common cold and other major health problems, according to interviews with leading medical investigators. Last week, a Boston obstetrician was indicted for manslaughter in the death of a fetus in connection with a legal abortion. Four other doctors in Massachusetts were accused of ?? a 19th‐century law against grave‐robbing after they used tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. In addition, anti‐abortion forces and people who feel it is unethical to, use products of human conception for research have picketed institutions around the country where fetal tissues are used in the laboratory. At least one city, Cleveland, has passed an ordinance prohibiting research on, or medical use of, products of aborted human conception. As a result of that ban, Dr. Fred Robbins, dean of CaseWestern Reserve Medical School there, said: “We are in serious danger of losing a major grant that is built around developing diagnostic tests for early diagnosis of a variety of birth defects.” Dr. Robbins added: “You have to be a brave fellow to do fetal research these days.” In California, a law passed last year that bans scientific experiments on live fetuses has hindered such research at Stanford Medical School, a spokesman for the Palo Alto institution said. The National Institutes of Health is sponsoring a registry to obtain data on a prenatal diagnostic test called amniocentesis. The purpose is to assess the safety and accuracy of these tests from studies at nine centers throughout the United States. However, Dr. Duane Alexander of the National Institutes of Health said that in the wake of the Boston indictments, officials of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore had prohibited their doctors from obtaming samples of fetal cells, which would otherwise have been discarded, as material for scientific controls for tests used in treating mothers and newborns. Neil Chayet, the lawyer for the doctors indicted in Boston, said “the chilling effect” of that case had caused two groups of investigators in Massachusetts to stop three human fetal research projects. “These doctors are nervous about publicly revealing what research they are not doing anymore,” Mr. Chayet said. “They fear they, too, may be implicated,” he added. At Harvard, a spokesman said that officials had imposed a “no comment” status pending disposition of the case against the doctors. Concern resulting from debate over the ethics of fetal research has reportedly led to curtailment of some grants to researchers using fetal tissue. Further, researchers here, in Boston, Philadelphia and Cleveland said the growing public debate over fetal research had hampered some of their projects. Over the last several decades, fetal research has resulted in successful preventions of cripplers such as polio and German measles (rubella). And successful treatments of newborns as well as adults have resulted since World War II from research dependent on fetal tissues obtained from natural miscarriages and legal abortions. But the investigators said that such therapies had become so routine that the public took them for granted and overlooked the fact that they had been developed from fetal research. Some researchers criticized their own professional organizations and National Institutes of Health officials for not having prepared a list of such gains in defense of the opposition of fetal research. The crux of the debate over such research is: What use can be made of fetal tissue when scientists obtain “informed consent” from the mother? Researchers consider it ethically wrong to deny proper use of that tissue when it can potentially benefit mankind and when it would otherwise be wasted. Some people oppose its use under any circumstance, even with the permission of the parents. The Rev. Warren Schaller, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee in. Washington, said that the organization, a leader among anti‐abortion forces, opposed experimentation on fetuses because the fetuses cannot give informed consent. However, he said that the group had not taken an official position on the question of how researchers could do the studies that require fetal tissue if curbs against such investigations were imposed nationally. Dr. John F. Enders the Harvard Nobel laureate, whose research involving fetal tissue led to the development of the polio vaccine, said: “I feel it would be a big setback for the progress of medicine if use of fetal tissues were stopped.” Others pointed out the relevance of fetal research to the conquest of cancer program that has presidential and Congressional backing. Doctors are mystified why growth is so effectively controlled in the rapidly dividing cells of a fetus and child while similar biologic principles lead to uncontrolled growth of cancers and the apparent breakdown in immunologic defenses in malignant disease. Barriers against the use of fetal tissue “certainly would impede progress” in cancer research,” Dr. Enders said. Vaccines and treatment of premature babies were among the most dramatic examples cited of life‐saving therapies that probably could not have been developed without use of fetal tissue. Many doses of licensed vaccines now prescribed by doctors are prepared from fetal cells obtained from just one fetus, aborted in Sweden in 1962. Other examples include blood tests that physicians use to help diagnose some cancers and liver diseases. Laboratory technicians rely on fetal cells to detect viruses in protecting the public's health against outbreaks of many common viral infections. Yet the researchers said they had been falsely accused of planning abortions for, scientifis investigations and that some political forces have purposely confused, the separate tissues of proper controls on fetal research and legalized abortions. Now researchers are trying to develop vaccines against diseases that cannot be prevented or to improve existing ones like the rabies vaccine, They are trying to discover treatments for genetic diseases like sicklecell anemia and forms of cerebrat palsy. Also, to prevent further thalidomide tragedies, they are seeking to determine which drugs that are considered safe for adults might damage a growing fetus or newborn child. That was cited as one reason why the Boston doctors did the studies that led to their indictments. With tragadies like thalidomide in mind. Dr. Richard Crout, who directs the Bureau of Drugs at the Food and Drug Administration, said “Almost every major drug dister has occurred i nchildren, often in newborns.” Only after hundreds of newborns were permanently blinded did doctors learn that doses of oxygen that were safe for adults were deleterious to newborns. As a result, Dr. Crout said the agency was encouraging more, rather than ?? testing of drugs in chi?? to determine the safest most effective dose of medication. Such data are considered critical because doctors in recent years have discovered that the physiology of the newborn and children up to about age two years differs significantly from that of the adult. Accordingly, pediatricians often cannot prescribe drugs the way their colleagues do for adult patients. Dr. Charles A. Alford of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, who is president of the Society of Pediatric Research, said “We could accidentally kill fetuses trying to use adult doses because fetuses do not handle the drug the same way the mother does.” Human fetuses are needed for research, in part, because only some of the critical information can be derived from animal studies. Dr. Victor A. McKusick of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, one of the world's leading geneticists, said that fetal tissue was essential to understand many discorders because cells from adults “just don't have the same biological characteristics as fetal cells.” Dr. McKusick went on: “Development involves switching off certain genes and switching on other genes. Throughout development, different sets of genes operate at particular times, like an orchestra where certain instruments are silent during some stages and playing only during others.” Largely as a result of environmental factors, humans have different types of protein in their red blood cells as fetuses and as adults. The switchover, which comes about the time of birth, is a natural event that many doctors wish to study as a model for other proteins that change when a baby enters the world. Dr. McKusick said: “Many of the genetically determined malformations, for example, may be ‐defects in protein that are around during embryonic development and then are switched off later on because they no longer have a purpose. One would never know about those except by studying fetal tissue. Therefore the root cause of many genetic defects could not be discovered unless one had access to the stage at which the action ocnamely live fetal tissue.” Other doctors are growing fetal cells in test tubes in the laboratory as a model for studying human aging. Dr. Leonard Hayflick of Stanford Medical School has found that there is a finite‐life span of normal human cells that varies with age. Fetal cells double for about 50 cycles before dying whereas those taken from a 10 years old child, for example will die out after 30 or so cycles. Thyroid disease is an area in which fetal research is credited with dividends in safer therapy, In 1948, Dr. Earl Chapman of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and his colleagues gave small doses of radioactive iodine just before a group of women with heart disease had therapeutic abortions. From studies on the fetuses, these doctors determined that women with thyroid disease could be treated medically during the first four months of pregnancy without harming the fetus, The endocrinologic study also led to important knowledge of thyroid physiology. If the fetus has an abnormal thyroid, the baby can become a cretin. The controversy over fetal research comes at a time when efforts of obstetricians and pediatricians have significantly lowered the nation's infant mortality rates, which had come under public criticism for so long. Better therapies to treat disorders in premature babies is credited in part for these lowered rates. “A premature baby, in effect, is [physiologically] a fetus,” Dr. Alford, the Alabama pediatrician said. He added: “We are right on the edge of going into an era when we can treat the fetus itself.” In Cleveland, where an ordinance prohibits use of “the products of human conception” for medical purposes, Dr. Robbins, a Nobel laureate and president of the American Pediatric Society, said: “The most important thing in the debate is the infringement curbs offer to human rights by imposing one group of standards on us all. I don't care for it. If there were more women in Congress, I don't think you'd have quite this problem.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Falling Birth Rate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/our-falling-birth-rate.html,"WASHINGTON, April 20—The birth rate in the United States, according to the Government's National Center for Health Statistics, has now dropped to its lowest point in history, and judging by the bare facts all around us, this is not because sex has gone out of style. The Government, which somehow keeps track of these things, tells us, with all the emotion of the multiplication tables, that “the national fertility rate,” whatever that means, dropped in 1973 to 1.9 children per family (Have you ever tried to raise ninetenths of a little boy?), and that there were 3,141,000 births or thereabouts last year, the lowest number since 1945. Also, the officials tell us that if the trend of more sex and fewer babies goes on like this, the population of the United States will “level off” to “zero growth” sometime in “the first half of the 21st century.” On the whole, this is good news. Already we are producing more people than we can understand or govern, and our mental growth obviously leveled off long ago. Our bodies are running ahead of our minds, and while our record is better than that of most nations, we cannot quite find enough money, jobs, schools, houses or transportation to keep up with the fertility of our people. So apparently the people have decided to adjust themselves to the Government, which is a switch, All the other Government tables are going up —prices, unemployment; interest rates, crime, even rape (which is odd, considering the availability of sex), but the population index is going down. The interesting thing about this, of course, is not the statistics but the philosophy, not whether this is a good or bad thing but why? Never has any society advertised and glorified sex, as much as America and shot so many blanks. George Gallup suggests some of the reasons for the decline in the birth rate, “including the cost of living, particularly the cost of education, widespread use of contraceptives, concern over crowded conditions and overpopulation, more liberal abortion laws, and changing values and lifestyles as reflected by woman's liberation.” He could probably have added to his list: the uncertainty of life in America today; the decline in respect for the authority of the family and the church; the doubt whether the young want to repeat the hard work and the experience of their parents; the widespread acceptance of divorce; the easy satisfaction of sex and entertainment; in short, the increasing freedom and mobility of the young and their hesitation to commit themselves to anyone or anything for life. “Live it up, and throw it out.” Mr. Gallup, when he looked into all WASHINGTON this, confirmed the obvious. Producing and raising five or six kids was a bit of a tussle, and eight or aim, even on the old farm, was unthinkable. Two children, he found, were about right, but only one was a problem both for the parents and the child. All responsibility for the old folks and no help from the other kids. What Gallup's poll did not deal with is the increasing number of couples, married and unmarried, who want no children at all. My favorite family reporter, Russell Baker, has just been out at the University of Colorado, running away from Watergate and tossing around life with the undergraduates. ■ He found, if I heard him right, that the topic of sex, married or otherwise, was old stuff. The young pretended that it was an appetite that could be satisfied as naturally as eating or breathing, which is a lie, but anyway they were much more interested and concerned about the larger problem of commitment to a life of raising children. “Do you take this child for better or for worse, til death do you part?” That is a harder question, even in these days of disbelief, than “do you take this man?” You cannot divorce your own child but you can avoid the problem. You can do what you like, free at last to have and to hold until something better turns up. No promises either way. “Who gives this woman? Who takes this pill?” The trend toward smaller families and even toward planned spinsterhood has some obvious advantages for society as a whole. It eases the nightmare of doubling the population every forty years and makes the problem of planning and governing life a lot easier. And yet there may be a paradox in the current trend. For the young seem to be longing for something to believe in these days, and the family is probably the last refuge they have. On the one hand, the argument is made that this is a rotten and dangerous world, full of wars, crooks, crime and dope, so why subject one more soul to its brutality? On the other hand, if it is true, as charged, that the preachers are not to be believed, the politicians not to be trusted, and society as a whole is a jumble of lies and tricks, then the family with all its struggles is still about the best bet available. Maybe even better than being liberated into loneliness. One day the Government statisticians may expand their efforts—measure not only the G.N.P. and the population but also the growth of happiness. Meanwhile the latest figures are reassuring. If we can't handle the people we've got, why double the trouble?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boston vs the Doctors: Strange Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/boston-vs-the-doctors-strange-case-ideas-trends.html,"BOSTON—In 1814, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed a law to deter the then common practice of robbing graves to supply medical schools with cadavers for research. Medical schools no longer lack cadavers, but the statute has stayed on the books, hard by other legal fossils such as a law against the exhibition of mutilated horses. Now Boston's Suffolk County District Attorney has unearthed the grave‐robbing law and dusted it off for new service. It is being used during an election year to mount a bizarre but serious rearguard action against abortion and the use of tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research in a town where the tension between a world‐famous medical establishment and a politically powerful Roman Catholic majority has never been very far from the surface. When last year's United States Supreme Court's historic abortion decision invalidated Massachusetts' anti‐abortion law, as it did those of all but four states, that tension crystalized into an angry frustration. Nine days ago, the frustration was converted into criminal indictments. Under charges brought by the office of District, Attorney Garrett H. Byrne, who is up for re‐election this year, a county grand jury indicted four research physicians for illegally dissecting legally aborted fetuses. The grave‐robbing statute was interpreted to apply to Drs. Leon D. Sabath, Leonard D. Berman, David Charles and Ageneta Philipson for a Boston City Hospital experiment designed to determine which of two antibiotics better prevent infections in the unborn. The jury charged another Boston City physician, Dr. Kenneth Edelln, with a more serious crime, manslaughter, for allegedly, causing the death of a 24‐week‐old fetus removed during a legal abortion. The medical community was outraged That respected doctors should be accused of felonies for using standard medical techniques was called political vindictiveness, and that 19th‐century laws were dragged out to press the charges was labeled obtuse. Nevertheless, even the indictments' critics say that they point to real issues, ones that crowd the widening no‐man's land where the law, medicine, science, ethics and theology converge. Where does life begin? What is the doctor's duty to the fetus he aborts? Does a fetus have rights? If yes, how are they to be balanced against the rights of the mother, and the legitimate needs of medical research? Questions like these are being debated across the country: But it is not surprising that they should have erupted first in Boston, in this fashion and with such force. In Boston's 43 square miles there are over 80 hospitals, including such prestigious research and teaching hospitals as Massachusetts General, Beth Israel and. Peter Bent Brigham, and three major medical schools: Tufts, Boston University and Harvard. Much of their research has depended on the availability of fetal tissue, while what goes on behind the laboratory doors has been a source of growing concern to the city's stanch anti‐abortion forces. The Catholic Archdiocese of Boston estimates that half of the residents of Massachusetts and 75 per cent of those living in Greater Boston are at least nominally Catholic. Against this backdrop, sparks began to fly in June when an article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine describing how Boston City Hospital doctors had given antibiotics to .33 consenting women who were about to undergo therapeutic abortions. The fetuses, which were from 10 to 22 weeks old, were then dissected and ex amined: The report, published a year after the federally supported experiment ended, was denounced in the City Council. Ultimately District Attorney Byrne's politically responsive office began to call hospital staff members before a grand jury. Meanwhile the prosecutors learned two other fetuses had been aborted by hysterotomy. This method, similar to a Caesarian section, is often used to terminate late pregnancies, and sometimes the fetus emerges with some potential for life outside the womb. The normal human pregnancy is 39, weeks, or nine months, but premature infants as young as 24 weeks have occasionally, though rarely, been known to survive. Dr. Edelin was charged with killing a 24‐weekold “baby boy” that the prosecutor claimed was “viable.” The liberal community here believes doctors are being made political scapegoats. They maintain that complex issues such as these. should be handled by explicit legislation, not by criminal charges. Further, doctors argue that through fetal research millions of lives have probably been saved. They cite vaccines against polio and German measles, and maintain that continued fetal research is essential in other viral diseases. The conservative abortion foe, on the other hand, argues that the very intention of abortion is against God's law. So any research performed on the expelled fetus, except after natural miscarriage, is held immoral. Battle Lines Unclear But the battle lines are not so clearly drawn. Many academics here feel medicine has been too casual about human life and experimentation on humans, even though most agree that the indictments do not confront this question directly. Prof. Arthur J. Dyck, professor of Population Ethics at the Harvard School of Public Health, for example, contends that It is the ethical responsibility of the doctor to act as an advocate for the fetus when a woman comes in for an abortion. Prof. William J. Curran, a leading Harvard authority on legal medicine, feels the High Court's 1,973 decision cleared up neither the question of when life begins nor “the question of what is the obligation of the doctor to the fetus.” While the law may not be clear, the Boston grand jury has taken a specific interpretation of it. Implicit in both indictments is the assumption, not unpredictable in a city with a huge Irish Catholic population, that fetuses are humane beings, with the rights of citizens. The grand jury charges exacerbated an emotional and political issue that is not likely to die down soon. Last week, the Boston Board of Health and Hospitals reinstated the doctors suspended at the time of the indictments, on the ground that none had done anything inconsistent with accepted medical practice, or with the Supreme Court decision. Meanwhile, before the state House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is a bill that would forbid all fetal research in the state. It is expected to be reported out by next Wednesday. In Boston, and in other states, doctors are proceeding with caution. The Boston indictments, legal action threatened elsewhere and the new Federal guidelines for human experimentation are said to have curtailed much fetal research already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ideas & Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/ideas-trends-medicine-law-and-mineralogy.html,"The National Zoological Park is going to do what can only be described as the right thing for those species of zoo animals that just won't breed in captivity: It is going to set up a special farm with plenty of room and the conditions that zoos can't provide. None too soon, either. Some city zoos lack sufficient space for large animal groupings, where satisfactory reproduction occurs more readily. As a result, many mammal exhibits have only one sex, and to maintain exhibits zoos have kept importing captured wild animals. But even that joyless expedient has become difficult as natural habitats disappear and the remaining wild animals are protected by law. “Unless we breed them in captivity,” says Dr. Theodore Reed, director of the National Zoological Park, “zoos won't have them.” The federally funded farm at Front Royal, Va., operated under the aegis of the Smithsonian Institution, will be divided into 35‐acre sites, with consideration given to the romantic idiosyncrasies of the various species. The Pere David deer, for example, breeds best when it can interrelate in normal social units with a balance of age and sex. Conversely, cheetahs won't reproduce if there is continued mixing and must have room to roam when not breeding. Other animals, such as antelopes, require the excitement of ritual fighting over a mate to stimulate their interest in sex. Animals for the farm will come initially from the Washington zoo, and later from other zoos. The first to take up residence in coming weeks. will be the Pere David deer and the scimitar‐horned oryx. A New Idea In Discounts: Cash The tide of credit cards that has flooded the retail economy may be about to ebb. Customers who prefer to pay cash rather than use a credit card may be able to do so at lower prices at many stores in the future. In exchange for the dropping of an antitrust suit against the company, American Express, a leader in the credit field, has agreed to allow merchants who honor its cards to offer discounts to customers who pay cash. Consumers Union had charged in the suit that, despite the hidden costs in credit card use, American Express contracts forced merchants to charge the same prices to both cash and credit customers. At issue was the assessment, averaging 5 per cent of a bill, levied on merchants by the major credit card companies for processing. Because merchants must set prices to cover the processing cost, the assessment, in effect, penalizes cash customers. The American Express settlement allows a merchant, if he chooses, to pass along to a cash customer some or all of the amount the credit card company would have charged for a credit sale. By offering discounts for cash sales, the merchant could reasonably expect to increase his business. Industry sources expect other credit card concerns to adopt the system agreed to by American Express. The result could be a reversal of a major trend of the last decade. There are about 500 million credit cards in use today, the majority of them issued by retail chains and oil companies, which do not impose the 5 per cent charge. Birth Rates Are Lower Than Ever Birth and fertility rate in the United States are ?? lower than they have ever been, continuing a trend that could have a strong impact on the country's wealth and health. Many reasons are given for the declining rates. Women are getting married later (38 per cent in the 20–24 age group were single in 1973, compared to 28 per cent in 1960) and divorced more. They're practicing birth control with the pill, abortion (about 700,000 legal operations in 1973) and sterilization (an estimated 350,000 women and 500,000 men last year).. And theproportion of married women taking jobs is increasing (19 million, or 40.3 per cent of the total, in 1973). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the 1973 birth rate was 15.0 births for every 1,000 persons, a 4 per cent decrease from the previous year. The fertility rate, which is the average number of children born to a family, dropped to 1.9 from 2.03 in 1972. The fertility rate is substantially below the 2.1 average necessary for the population simply to replace itself, or reach zero population growth. With population growth slowed and economic growth expected to continue, each person in the future will, theoretically at least, have access to more goods and services than he would if birth rates continued to go up. Fewer people also would mean less pressure on housing, food supplies, hospitals and other factors that contribute to the public's welfare. If the current trend continues, the United States. would reach zero population growth some time in the first half of the 21st century, but experts stress that fertility rates are volatile and could quickly rise again. Because so many young women born in the post‐World War II baby boom are still coming into their child‐bearing years, a population “bomb” lies latent in society, waiting only for changed attitudes to set it off. Ocean Lava May Be Rich In Ores A research team has found fresh evidence on the Atlantic Ocean's floor that lava eruptions nifty be responsible for many of the world's ore deposits. The finds are another step in efforts to understand how ores are concentrated and thus make more effective the search for raw materials. Participants in the TransAtlantic Geotraverse study have reported signs of new eruptions within the deep rift valley that bisects the Atlantic. The discovery was made between Cape Hatteras in North America and Cap Blanc in northwest Africa. From the theory that the sea floor spreads through motions not fully understood, it is believed that Cape Hatteras and Cap Blanc once adjoined. The motions that pulled the regions apart, according to the theory, create the rift valley where lava eruptions constantly produce new sea floor. Many scientists believe that water circulating through the material that rises to fill the central rifts leaches out of it a variety of metallic compounds that are carried into cracks of the rock and solidified into veins of ore. When such deposits are lifted from the sea, either as islands or where sea‐floor spreading thrusts them against a continent, they become accessible for exploitation. The findings, reported at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union, showed that iron content within particles near the valley floor was 20 times normal, and deposits of manganese hydroxide were dredged from the rift's side. The manganese deposits lacked other ores typical of nodules that form on the sea floor, and so are thought to have erupted from hydrothermal “springs” in the rift wall. Sex, Upstate The issue was contraceptives, and one state legislator said, “I find it difficult to imagine how in 1974, with everything else that is going on, this bill could excite anyone.” But the vigor of the debate, and the outcome, clearly showed that attitudes toward sexual matters still differ widely. In Albany, the Assembly killed a bill that would have allowed contraceptives to be displayed on pharmacy shelves. Proponents argued that the present law, which requires that contraceptives be kept out of sight, deters shy or inexperienced people from buying contraceptives but not their need for them. Opponents contended that open displays would lead to greater promiscuity among the young. After the vote, the bill's sponsor, Mrs. Constance E. Cook, said, “I'm surprised they allow people to sell beds In this state.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Baby‐sitting by government, business and the lady next door",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/babysitting-by-government-business-and-the-lady-next-door-281-pp.html,"The movement for Universal day care bears a certain similarity to the battle for legal abortion. For one thing the warriors are the same—young women freed by the pill from unplanned motherhood are demanding newer and costlier freedoms. In the case of abortion, they want for the poor what rich women already have, an outright guarantee that no one need continue a pregnancy she is unwilling or unable to handle. Day care is at once a Simpler and a more complex issue; the rich already have it but so do the poor, as we shall see. The movement wants us to accept the reality of day care and then, at vast make the best of it. I mean that in a quite literal sense. Day care for millions of preschool children is here to stay, expanding into franchised “Kentucky Fried Chicken” chains on the one hand, exotic and diverse communal arrangements of the counter‐culture on the other, and everything from baby‐sitting by the neighbor, the union or the industrial employer in between. The Federal Government wishes to use day care as a club to force welfare mothers to earn their keep—those who are enrolled in work‐training programs get priority in Federally funded child‐care centers. And all the while middle‐class women in increasing numbers are pouring into the work force out of choice simply because the wide world has grown more attractive and available to them. This is the reality we must accept., there are four and a half million American working women with children under 6 and they are cared for or another. “The Day Care Book” is somewhat easier to assess because Vicki Breithart wastes little time in debate; she already knows the ideal solution. It is Federally funded day care, managed cooperatively by the families involved and available to everyone. Because at least three major bills are currently up before Congress, all, calling for considerable Federal funding for preschool facilities, child care will be big business, and big business, accordingly, is tooling up. We are given a quick tour through its offer Joan Dash, author of “A Life of One's Own: Three Gifted Women and the Men They Married,” is writing a biography of Henrietta Szold. ings: we see glassy‐eyed children before a television set in a for‐profit center in Manhattan. We see franchised centers where state and Federal guidelines are blatantly ignored because they are incompatible with making money. A nightmare visit to the Universal Education Corporation shows how anxious parents can be fleeced by hard‐headed executives eager to sell not only toys and hobby supplies but food, life insurance, even travel agency services. Breitbart and her associates who contributed topical essays, in their eagerness to lead us toward collective child care, have not been entirely objective in their survey of alternatives—singly‐not every neighbor's baby‐sitting is negligent and passive, not every industrial employer's facility is cold and paternalistic. No matter; “The Day Care Book” is unashamedly a do‐it‐yourself guide to the setting up, and running of a childcare collective and as such it is both practical and inspirational. The chapter titled “How to Start Your Own Child Care Center” is almost worth the price of the book. Here is a step‐by‐step system for locating like‐minded parents, for determining the age limits at your center, for finding space and meeting city and state regulations—or not meeting them: “The last way to get space is to TAKE IT. With enough community support, groups have occupied unused—or used—buildings and storefronts.” The final thirtyodd pages consist of fact‐packed charts and checklists. “Who's Minding the Children?” is more diffuse, more thoughtful, directed not at parents eager for solutions now but at teachers, students, social workers. Margaret Steinfels gives us a detailed history of day care in America from its early origins in nursery schools, set up by educated middle‐class ladies to help the children of immigrant mothers learn hygienic habits and table manners. The professionalization of social work, the Depression and World War II removed day care from the province of ladies to that of government, especially Federal Government, which turned day care on and off at will. By 1971 some $301 million of Federal funds were matched by state and local governments contributing $145 million. President Nixon vetoed the Comprehensive Child Development Act (Mondale‐Brademas) in December of 1971—a piece of social legislation, according to Stein fels; designed to be as basic and popular as Social Security or veterans' benefits. The veto rested on Nixon's belief that the Child Development Act “would commit the vast moral authority of the national Government to the side of communal approaches to child‐rearing over against the family‐centered approach.” But Steinfels is not content merely to mourn the veto; she has questions to ask, questions that must disturb all but the most passionate advocates of universal child‐care: “Will day care promote the professionalization of child rearing? If the past is any due, the authority. of the ‘amateur’ parent seems to decline In proportion as the role of the professional child‐worker grows. If the professional's authority is continually enhanced by research and studies in child development, what future has parental authority or influence? As quality day care services become available, these early learning theories and child development patterns will more and more become the basis for child‐rearing techniques. ... Will the elaboration of an esoteric body of knowledge about children set new standards about how children should be raised—standards that can only be met in day care centers? The coercive aspects of expertise can be more compelling than those of the law.” “This book was not conceived with the hopes of arriving at a neat or comprehensive set of recommendations,” she concludes; therefore it is hardly surprising that we should finish it with more questions than answers. No single solution to the problem of day care is offered; but rather a demand for its “normalization,” the awareness that it is no longer the answer to the needs of problem children and problem families but a normal response to the changing needs of changing families. The family—every family—is undergoing a process of change. We must look to the improvement of almost all existing facilities, even the neighborhood sitter, and we must simultaneously learn to think of day care as “only one of many possible changes which could encourage the emergence of new child‐rearing patterns, new roles for women, and genuine family “Who's Minding the Children?” deserves to be read for the questions it raises, for its eclecticism, for its refusal to simplify. I must add that Steinfels, like Breitbart, sees a special virtue in the support a truly child‐centered day care facility can give to family life: “It is safe to say that day care centers do not for the most part see themselves as anything like a substitute for family, but more like a place where things that used to happen in large families with many siblings happen again.” A spirited answer to the Nixon veto.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUT IN BIRTH RATE URGED FOR JAPAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/cut-in-birth-rateurged-for-japan-inexpensive-abortions.html,"TOKYO, April 20 — A Japanese Government advisory council has recommended that Japan, which already has one of the world's lowest population growth rates, cut that growth rate even further, possibly to zero. The Population Problems Council, a group of prominent citizens advising the Ministry of Health and Welfare, proposed that the Government undertake population control measures intended to have the Japanese people reproduce themselves—and no more. The council said in a report this week that the Government should deepen the understanding of politicians and Government officials about the need for population control. It further recommended that Japan increase her efforts to help other nations in Asia, especially the developing countries, to solve their population problems. The report was prepared as part of Japan's contribution to the United Nations World Population Year and is scheduled to be presented at a confertrice in Rumania in August. Its basic theme is that Japan must control her own population better if she is to help others. Sixth Largest Population Japan today has the world's Sixth largest population, after China, India; the Soviet Union, the United States and Indonesia. She has about half as many people as the United States, but they live in an area only as big as the state of California. The Population Council, headed by Seburo Okita, a well‐known economist, said that without new measures Japan's present population of about 108 million would reach 131.8 million by the year 2000 and 140 million by 2025. The report said that Japan's death rate has nearly stabilized so that the future size of Japan's population will depend on control of fertility. Japanese life expectancy for males, born today is slightly over 70 years and for females 75 years. If Japan's birth fate were reduced to what is called the “replacement” or stabilization level, the population would still continue to grow to about 130 million in the year 2010 as a result of the excess of births over deaths, but it would then level off and possibly begin to drop, the report said. There is also a simmering controversy here over the size of Japan's population and methods of birth control. The governing Liberal‐Democratic party introduced a bill into Parliament last year that, if adopted, would have tightened Japan's liberal abortion law. Inexpensive Abortions That law, approved during the dark days of economic pros. tration in 1949, shortly after World War II, permits a woman to have an inexpensive abortion for almost any reason. The proposed bill would have forbidden women to have abortions solely for economic reasons. The governing party, which did not push the bill in the face of concerted opposition from women and family‐planning advocates, argued that the adverse economic conditions had passed and therefore the liberal policy was no longer necessary. The party, which is allied with big, business here, may have also been influenced by what is considered here to be an increasing shortage of labor and an imbalance in the make‐up of the population. More workers may have been considered necessary to continue Japan's vigorous economic expansion and support an increasing number of elderly people. Advocates of population control argue that the high population density here — more than 80 per cent of Japan's area is mountainous and about half the total population is crowded into about 5 per cent of the land area — along with pollution and other urban ills, has seriously jeopardized the quality of Japanese life. Nation Reliant on Imports Recently, the Japanese, severely affected by the energy crisis, have become extremely sensitive to their nation's vulnerability to shortages of raw materials and food, much of which must be imported. The report, noting the global concerns about resources and the environment, said that “population problems here in Japan will not be separated from problems in other parts of the world.” Last year, for the third year in a row, the number of births was slightly over two million, while deaths were below one million. That pushed Japan's population growth rate up to 1.3 per cent, above the roughly 1 per cent rate of the nineteenfifties and sixties. Those are the children of the men and women born during the “baby boom” of the postwar years. There has been a noticeable decline in the number of abortions and an increase in contraceptive birth control, statistics indicate. However, the birth control pill is illegal except under strict medical supervision because Japanese authorities consider it medically unsafe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes: Bumper Crop Of Bumper Stickers,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/archives/notes-bumper-crop-of-bumper-stickers-shangrila.html,"VISIT $an Clemente (You Paid For It!)” proclaims one. “Jail To The Chief,” says another. And then there are the old standbys like “Nixon for Ex‐President” and “Impeachment With Honor,” on the one hand, and “Get Off Nixon's Back” and “Protect Our President From Liberals and Traitors,” on the other. The foregoing are not, as one might suppose, headlines from the extremist press. They are merely examples of this spring's bumper crop of bumper stickers, a Crop now greeting the American mo torist on his return to the highways as the gasoline shortage abates. For some of the creators of these Occasionally flippant, sometimes com mercial, often idealistic messages, the gasoline shortage was a blessing in dis guise. For example, it gave some of the political activists in the field time to Catch up with and perhaps surpass the pop‐Evangelist who created the omni‐ Present bumper sticker “Honk If You Love Jesus.” Their version, pegged to Nikon and Watergate, is “Honk If You Think He's Guilty!” The current bumper‐sticker boom be g'in, about five years ago. (The Ferm Publishing Company of Elkhart, Ind., grosses $250,000 a year on bumper stickers with religious overtones alone.) In addition to the religious‐type mes sages, there has been a great increase In the number of political stickers being turned out by “underground” producers who form a kind of 20th‐century cottage industry across the country. There has also been a rise in stickers espousing militant causes, among them the women's lib movement. “Thanks, Mom, For Not Having an Abortion” is now countered by “Abortion: Woman's Right.” Other popular women's lib bumper stickers turned out by one of the leading producers, Check ers Enterprises (P.O. Box 942, St. Louis, M. 63188), include “Trust God. She Provides” and “Women's Lib: The Oppressed Majority.” Checkers—a somewhat typical “under ground” activist bumper‐sticker firm, named sardonically after the celebrated cocker spaniel owned by President Nixon while he served as Vice President, does most of its business through classified ads in such publications as New York Magazine, the New Republic, Ms., Ram parts and The Rolling Stone. The major ity of the stickers are priced at two for $1, six for $2 or as many as 2,000 for about $200. Checkers said most of its stickers are sold in New Jersey, with Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and California following in that order. Whether you're for or against bumper stickers— no matter what the subject— your chances of having one affixed to your car with or without your consent, are increasing, says Larry Recht of Reflective Advertising, Inc., also of St. Louis, one of the half‐dozen printing concerns in the country that specialize in bumper stickers. “If you go to an amusement center nowadays,” Recht said, “you're bound to wind up with a bumper sticker on your car, whether you like it or not. Amuse ment centers and resorts were the big, forerunners with promotional slogans like ‘Visit the Stygian Caves’ or some such. They used to wire them onto the bumpers, but now’ with the new vinyl adhesive stickers that go on easily and lift off without leaving a trace, it seems that just about everybody has something to say and they're saying It on bumper stickers.” A Staple Campaign slogans are still a staple in the industry, Recht said. He recently printed 50,000 stickers for Senator Thomas F. Eagleton for use in his Mis souri re‐election campaign. An order for 100,000 stickers was placed by a rock group, who distributed them at concerts. Sports stickers like “Let's Go Mets” are big across the country, with commercial advertisements such as those plugging local radio stations—“Listen to KWIZ,” for example—making up a good share of the business. “Driving down the highway today, you can find stickers that touch on prac tically all aspects of life in America and reflect nearly all extremes of political thought,” Recht said. “They range from Bibla bumper stickers through the all‐time anti‐Nixon bestseller, “Don't Blame Me, I Voted for McGovern,” to the hardhat classic, “America: Love It or Leave It.” A spokesman for the National Safety Council said that his organization had no record of any legal action having been taken against the sale of bumper stickers on the ground that they were disconcerting to drivers. But at any rate it is not entirely inconceivable that a motorist might spin out of control while trying to fathom the subtleties of the red, white and blue gem that reads simply: “These Colors Don't Run.” STEAMBOAT ROUND THE BEND The age of Elegance will return to the Mississippi next year with the debut of a multi‐million‐dollar paddlewheel steamboat to rival the magnificent “floating palaces” that plied the river before the turn of the century. And enthusiasm for the new vessel is already limning so high that more than a thous and reservations have been made for her first cruises, the summer of 1975. The $15.5‐million vessel, being built by Jeffboat, inc., for the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, will be a sister ship to the venerable Delta Queen, which has been carrying excursionists up and down the Mississippi for almost half a century and is still going strong. The new paddle wheeler taking shape at Jeffersonville, Ind., will feature facilities undreamed of 100 years ago when steamboats were in their heyday. She will be equipped with radar, air‐conditioning, automatic eleva tors, a top‐deck swimming pool, saunas, television, four restaurants, a cinema scope theater—and even a steam calli ope (powered by steam turbine). The new vessel will have overnight accommoda tions for 400 passengers, compared to 192 on the present Delta Queen, and her fares will be slightly higher, ranging from $120 to $200 for a two‐day week end cruise and from $485 to $800 for an eight‐day voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans. A nationwide contest is currently being conducted by the Delta Queen company to name the new steam boat, and entries can be sent to the firm's home port office, 322 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202. The prize, or prizes have not yet been deter‐', mined. The old Delta Queen will con tinue her annual cruises on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers‐this summer and will in service even after the arrival of the new paddiewheeler in May, 1975. SHANGRI‐LA Legendary Shangri‐la, the setting for James Hilton's novel “Lost Horizon,” in which the characters never grew old, has a real‐life counterpart in the state of Hunza in Pakistan, or so Pakistan Inter national Airlines would have us believe. Waterlust Travel, Inc., of Los Angeles, in conjunction with P.I.A., has organized a series of three‐week tours to Hunza, which is situated where the borders of Pakistan, China and the Soviet Union meet, and the all‐inclusive price from New York is $2,758. The tours will leave on May 18, June 15, Aug. 10 and Sept. 7. The people of Hunza have the reputa tion of being the healthiest in the world, P.I.A. says, and many of them live to be 100 and more. In addition, Hunza has no police force, no crime, no army, no unemployment and no taxes, according to P.I.A. The people traditionally eat dried grains, fruits and vegetables and drink the pure water of the Batura Glacier. Vatican officials have forbidden tour‐ ist guides to give lectures inside the Sistine Chapel so that visitors can en joy the beauty of Michelangelo's cele brated frescoes in the “serene atmo sphere” they deserve. But in tune with the times, the officials have added a new sound of their own—piped‐in music. In the future guides will have to brief their tour groups in the hallways before entering the chapel. NEW MOBIL GUIDES The 1974 edition of the Mobil Travel Guide has just been published, and only 31 of the 21,000 hotels, motels, resorts and restaurants listed have received the guide's coveted five‐star rating. Among these were six restaurants: the Maison ette in Cincinnati, Ernie's and the Man darin; in San Francisco; LA Grenouille and Lutece in New York City and Le Mime of the Four Seasons in Fort Lauderdale. Tile 12 five‐star hotels are the Arizona Inn, Tucson; Carlyle and Pierre, New York; Beverly Wilshire, Beverly Hills; Broadmoor, Colorado Springs, Col.; Cae sar's Palace, Las Vegas; Century Plaza, Los Angeles; Clift and Fairmont Hotel and Towers, San Francisco; Fairmont, Dallas; Madison, Washington; and the Westgate Plaza, San Diego. The 11 five‐star resorts are: the Arizona Biltmore, Phoenix; the Boca Raton Hotel and Club, Boca Raton, Fla.; the Cloister; Sea Island, Ga.; the Doral Country Club, Miami; Marriott's Camel back Inn, Scottsdale, Ariz.; Mountain Shadows, Scottsdale; the Breakers, Palm Beach; the Greenbrier, White Sul phur Springs, W. Va.; the Homestead, Hot Springs, Va.; Tides Inn, Irvington, Va. and the Wigwam, Litchfield Park, Ariz. The two five‐star motels are both in Oregon—the Salishan Lodge in Lincoln City and the Village Green in Cottage Grove. As in years past, the 1974 Mobil Guide consists of seven regional volumes, each selling for $2.95. The books are published by Rand McNally for the Mobil Oil Cor poration. THE LAST RESORT The travel and resort industry might be in for an unexpected windfall if proposal by a Nevada weekly newspaper publisher becomes an annual affair. He suggested that the entire nation take a one‐week vacation to protest the fuel situation and the general state of the Government. In coming up with the idea, Cal Sunderland, who puts out The Hum boldt (Nev.) Sun in Winnemucca, may well be the first man in history to use the vacation as a form of proteit, and he has been deluged with mail from peo ple across the country who have read of his proposal in newspapers or heard about it over radio and television. Sunderland kicked off his campaign in The Sun with a signed column that said, “For all we know, this newspaper may be the first independent voice raised in favor of a nationwide show down between John Q. Citizen‐Taxpayer and a dangerously demented Federal, Government. If so, were happy. We stand in the company and tradition of the most honest men God ever raised up—the patriots of the American Revo lution.” Sunderland's vacation week began last Monday and will end at midnight to night. He will go back to his typewriter tomorrow, secure in the knowledge that his protest received nationwide atten tion, regardless of how effective or iteffective it might prove to be in the end. BACK TO HORSEPOWER One way to travel without using gasoline is by horse‐drawn covered wagon. Wagons West of Afton, Wyo., is offering five different programs and wide range of departure dates, start ing with a five‐day trip through the Red Rock country of Utah tomorrow. The price is $175 for adults and $150 for children under 14. Other trips take in portions of Wyoming from the prai ries to the Rockies and the Tetons and vary in length from three to five days, with prices running from $120 to $190 for adults and $80 to $130 for children. The wagons operated by Wag ons West are replicas of the Conestoga wagods used by the pioneers. They are pulled by teams of horses or mules and driven by local ranchers. Trip partici pants sleep on foam mattresses either in the wagons or in tents and are of fered a chance to ride horseback on oc casion. Information is available from L. Outfitter, 83110.

[1:8.] Egypt decided to cease relying on the Soviet Union for all her modern arms because Moscow had used the supply of weapons and ammunition as an “instrument of policy leverage,” seeking to influence Egyptian actions. The Soviet policy was unacceptable, President Anwar el‐Sadat said in an interview at his home in Cairo. [1:6–7.] Senator Edward M. Kennedy tried out American‐style public opinion polling on an audience at Moscow State University and drew some hostility when he asked for a show of hands on whether the Soviet Union should be spending more or less on defense.

Bonn Parliament. Is Due to Act On Bills to Legalize Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/22/archives/bonn-parliament-is-due-to-act-on-bills-to-legalize-abortion.html,"BONN, April 20—A three‐year debate about whether to legalize abortion in West Germany is expected to come to an end next week, when Parliament will decide on one of four bills that are strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church. Julius. Cardinal Döpfner of Munich, speaking for the Conference of German Bishops, came to Bonn this week to denounce the reform bills at a special news conference. On Easter day, as he was delivering a sermon on the subject in Munich cathederal, a tape‐recorded attack on him and the church began automatically in a confessional booth and Interrupted the service. The night before, vandals sprayed the doors and walls of the cathedral and three other Munich churches with slogans—“Whether to have children is for us to decide, not doctors” and “Paragraph 218 has to go!” Paragraph 218, which was put in the German penal code in 1871, provides for imprisonment of up to five years for abortion. An intensive women's rights movement to repeal Paragraph 218 began in 1971, after similar initiatives In France. In West Germany, a woman or a doctor involved in an abortion risks the full legal penalty. Still, it is estimated that up to 500,000 illegal abortions are performed in the country every year. The three other reforms before Parliament would allow abortions in exceptional cases —all requiring approval by doctors or a panel of experts. Some kind of change is considered almost certain. Parliament already decided, before the Easter recess, that state health‐insurance plans would pay for abortion fees if abortion is legalized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Governor Wilson, Negotiating Quietly in the Wings, Determines Tempo for Legislature",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/24/archives/governor-wilson-negotiating-quitely-in-the-wings-by-francis-x.html,"ALBANY, April 23—Governor Wilson is orchestrating the Legislature's finale, and thus far there has been the sound of silence. Accordingly, the legislators seem to be tapping their feet more out of nervousness than rhythm. “I've been here 27 years and by far this is the dullest session yet,” said Senator Joseph Zaretzki, leader of the Democratic minority. “With hard work, we can snatch mediocrity from the jaws of disaster,” a Republican said nervously on the outlook of running this year on the strength of the session thus far. Most of the major issues have been withheld from debate during the last four months in anticipation of the final blitz of compromise. At the same time, the Governor has maintained public silence on his approaches to many of them—his last fullscale Capitol news conference was six weeks ago. He also has not practiced the “armtwisting” techniques of his predecessor, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who told the legislators, however much they comptained, that they were needed, at least. A Waiting Game Instead, Mr. Wilson, who was a legislator for 20 years before joining the Rockefeller ticket, is practicing the quiet waiting game of negotiating in private with his two fellow Republicans, Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea and Senate Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson. Legislators say that there were so few issues on the table in the first place that this process has been scaled down from the days of Governor Rockefeller, who could juggle the offtrack‐betting and cable‐television bills even as he pushed for the life imprisonment of narcotic offenders. Participants in this year's private discussions tell of a Governor chain‐smoking his way through long meetings and savoring the minutiae of the issues right down to details normally left to the “boiler‐ plate” lawyers, assistant counsel who flesh out a bill once the basic idea is set. Since Mr. Wilson never promised to be the major presence in the Legislature that Mr. Rockefeller was, his supporters credit him with consistency. However, the legislators' complaint about the former Governor seemed more that he was cavalier and disrespectful toward them, not that they resented leadership. In a similar way, the Assembly session is run by the Speaker, and in his absence he designates other Republicans. But actually the debate is controlled by a quick‐thinking prompter, William Morrell, a specialist in parliamentary rules trusted by the Speaker. Mr. Morrell tells the Acting Speaker how to cut off minority challenges and everecisely what to say, sentence by sentence. The other day, when the prompter's role became a bit too apparent—he could be heard standing at the side of the Acting Speaker and instructing him to tell a Democrat, “You're out of order”—a legislator finally found it necessary to complain about how obvious the scenario had become. The quality that makes legislators nervous about the Governor was demonstrated recently during one of his many banquet appearances when he could be seen at the head table gesturing and talking at length with a local V.I.P. A friend cornered the local official later for the meat of the conversation. “He was telling me the virtue of smoking Doral low‐nicotine cigarettes,” the official replied. “Is that what he does all day?” The answer to that question is “no,” his aides assure inquirers, but they concede there is none of the sense of regal motion that Mr. Rockefeller created in his daily schedule. Four years ago, during the last gubernatorial year session, the Legislature's record included such items as revenue sharing for the cities, abortion reform and the introduction of offtrack betting. This year there are no such dramatic “ventures,” to use the Governor's word. But there is enough to run on successfully, his partisans feel. To the previously approved measures such as transit aid, welfare and worker benefit increases, an extra business tax incentive and mortgage escrow interest, will be added to the final items that have been withheld until the final days of the session. These final items will certainly include a New York City fiscal package and a school aid increase, and possibly an attempt at tax cutting. But two of the remaining issues — reform of the threadbare political campaign laws and of the city's vacancy decontrol law — are volatile enough to undo the session if they are handled incorrectly, in the view of some legislators. The latest word from the Governor on these two issues was silence. Some legislators say he has “floated” a possible rent‐control proposal involving a mediation process through a legislatorsponsor, but officially he has no bill yet. On election reform, he offered a bill differing significantly in enforcement powers from the version approved by the Assembly and thus far he has not responded to critics nor indicated how he might try to seek compromise. Nothing has happened to this issue yet in the private leadership discussions, either, according to knowledgable sources. Beyond these issues, legislators, including some Republicans, wonder how they can approach the voters without having done something substantial on such issues as correction and court reform, the environment and new housing. But others feel the really significant issues this year—inflation and Watergate—are beyond their control. So, they ask, what's the harm of going home in the next week or so? And does anybody but the people who have to sit through the legislative session, which convened Jan. 9, really care about how dull it may be? Whatever the answers to those two questions, the Legis Mature formally set adjourn ment for Friday afternoon which means, probably, a west or so beyond that. Intended a a bugle call, the adjourment resolution punctuates the mood in the gray‐stoned Capital more like Snoopy's sigh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High Court Avoids Ruling On Quota for Law School,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/24/archives/high-court-avoids-ruling-on-quota-for-law-school-special-to-the-new.html,"WASHINGTON, April 23 —The Supreme Court, dividing 5 to 4, refused today to decide whether professional schools can constitutionally give preference in admissions to members of racial minorities at the expense of white applicants. At stake, but never reached by the Justices, was the broader issue of “reverse discrimination,” whether giving, special treatment in education and employment to blacks unfairly deprives whites of their right to be judged on their own merits. The narrow Court majority maintained in an unsigned opinion that there was no longer a live controversy requiring a decision because Marco DeFunis Jr., the student who originally brought the action to win admission to law school, will graduate from that school in June no matter what the Court might do. This ruling, sharply attacked by the minority as “sidestepping,” left completely unresolved one of the most controversial and emotional issues to come before the Court since the abortion cases. Colleges and universities throughout the country must now wait for another case to be filed and work its way up through the court system—this one took nearly three years—before learning whether “affirmative action” programs to admit blacks with lower academic and test records are legal. Voting to refuse to consider the case were the four men named to the Court by President Nixon: Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist—plus Associate Justice Potter Stewart, an Eisenhower appointee. Charging that avoidance of the issue “clearly disserves the public interest” were the four dissenting Justices, all Demo crats when they came to till Court: Associate Justices Wit ham O. Douglas, William Brennan Jr., Byron R. Whit and Thurgood Marshall. In a long separate dissent Justice Douglas said he believed the admission practices at issue were unconstitutiona because they were based or race. He maintained that preferences for students from deprived backgrounds were valid if they were granted without respect to race. The case turned aside by the Court (No. 73–235, DeFunis v. Odegard) had aroused widespread interest because of its potential effect on the legality of various quota systems currently used to help promote employment of blacks and other minorities as well as their access to higher education. Some legal authorities favoring discretionary admissions policies had urged the Court to postpone a ruling on the issue until a more sharply defined case came before the Justices. The Court action was brought by Mr. DeFunis after he was refused admission to the University of Washington Law School in 1971, on the grounds that three dozen successful, applicants who were members of racial minorities had combined academic and aptitude ratings lower than his. The trial court agreed with Mr. DeFunis's contention that this admissions system violated his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. He was then admitted and remained enrolled after the Washington Supreme Court reversed the decision because Justice Douglas issued a stay pending final Supreme Court resolution of the case. The law school maintained that it was not bound by the strict arithmetic of test scores and grades in deciding admissions and that a positive kind of quota benefiting a minority rather than restricting it was not unconstitutional. Predictably, the Court's refusal to act satisfied almost no one. Mr. DeFunis declined to comment. The law school said no decision was preferable to a decision against its admissions policy. Organizations like the American Jewish Congress, which backed Mr. DeFunis, said they were disappointed. The dispute split the liberal community into two angry and contentious segments, one arguing that each individual must be judged on his own merits and the other that longstanding racial discrimination demands some form of cornpensatory help for blacks and other minorities. The division was particularly sharp among Jewish groups. Several of them joined the case on Mr. DeFunis's side, maintaining that quota systems that in the past deprived Jews of professional educations were equally objectionable when applied to help other different minorities. Other Jewish organizations, however, including the National Conncil of Jewish Women and the Union of American Hebrew Cokregations, defended the law school admissions policy on the general thesis that positive quotas designed to help the underprivileged were different from negative quotas designed to discriminate against them. “All parties agree,” the Supreme Court majority declared, “that DeFunis is now entitled to complete Ms legal studies at the University of Washington and to receive his degree from that institution. “A determination by this Court of the legal issues tendered by the parties is no longer necessary to compel that result and would not serve to prevent it,” the majority concluded. The five Justices who refused to decide the case suggested that the responsibility was not theirs because if Mr. DeFunis had filed a class action on behalf of all law students denied admission, the controversy would have remained alive after his admission to the final quarter. The majority alo conceded that they were probably only postponing a decision on the merits of a similar case. “If the admissions procedures of the law school remain unchanged,” they observed, “there is no reason to suppose that a subsequent case attacking those procedures will not come with relative speed to this Court, now that the Supreme Court of Washington has spoken.” The majority apparently assumed that the state Supreme Court would need less time on a second occasion to sustain, the law school against another student denied admission. Writing for the minority, Justice Brennan said that Mr. Defunis's objections to the school's admission policy would become “real, not fanciful” it he were forced to drop out by “illness, economic necessity,, even academic failure” before graduating and had to reapply lin the fall. Mr. Brennan said he could “find no justification for the Court's straining to rid itself of this dispute. While we must be vigilant to require that litigants maintain a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy ... there is no want of an adversary contest in this case.” The dissenters noted the broad range of national interest attracted by the DeFunis case, which promoted the filing of 26 friend‐of‐the‐court briefs by interested and affected groups, and predicted that today's ruling was nothing more than a postponement. “Few constitutional questions in recent history have stirred as much debate, and they will not disappear,” Mr. Brennan said. “They must inevitably return to the Federal courts and ultimately again to this court.” In a relatively unusual move, none of the five Justices in the majority took credit for the authorship of the seven‐page opinion. Ordinarily, many unsigned or “per curiam” opinions are only issued in relatively routine cases when the Court is unanimous or there is, perhaps, a lone dissenter. In his separate dissent, Justice Douglas proposed that a new trial be held to consider, among other questions, whether the present national law school aptitude test should not be given to members of racial minorities because it measures “the dimensions and orienta tion of the organization man.” Mr. Douglas suggested that preferential treatment should be given to a promising law school applicant who was “a poor Appalachian white or a second‐generation Chinese in San Francisco” just as readily as to other would‐be lawyers with limited backgrounds. Under the University of Washington system, special consideration was restricted to black, Chicano, American Indian or Filipino applicants. In other decisions announced today, the Court ruled as follows: WELFARE ELIGIBILITY A Colorado law that required welfare recipients to deduct a uniform $30‐a‐month work expense allowance from any income to determine continued welfare eligibility, rather than their actual expenses, was (unanimously invalidated. (No. 72–1513, Shea v. Vialpando.) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING The court held, 5 to 4, that the National Labor Relation Board could not require employers to bargain collectively with any group of managerial employes, even though their jobs did not involve them in labor relations conflicts of interest. (No. 72–1598, National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Aerospace Company.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Woman Odds‐On Favorite For Connecticut Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/24/archives/woman-oddson-favorite-for-connecticut-governor-woman-oddson.html,"STORRS, Conn. — Politics is played quietly in the Land of Steady Habits. Without the trombones, as it were. Thus the news hasn't traveled very far that Connecticut is likely this year to become the first state to elect as governor a woman who is a successful politician in her own right rather than the wife or widow of one. The woman is Representative Ella Grasso, who has held public office without interruption for the last 20 years, the last four of them as a member of Congress from the Sixth District in the western part of the state. Polls commissioned by both parties and The Hartford Times all show her as the heavy fevorite to win the nomination for governor at the Democratic party convention in July. A Seasoned Pro The accepted wisdom among political observers here is that in this year of Watergate her expected nomination should bp tantamount to easy election in a state in which the Republicans have elected only one governor in the last 20 years. The exception is the incumbent, Thomas Meskill, who is retiring after one term. In any case, Mrs. Grasso doesn't think her sex will be a factor in the voting. “The judgment will be made of me as an individual, on the basic of what I have accomplished in my career in public life and on the basis of what I'll be saying to the voters,” she told a visitor here the other day. On this point there is general agreement. “Ella is a seasoned politician who only incidentally happens to be a woman and an Italo‐American,” said a respected analyst of the state's politics. Neither attribute hurts, however. ItaloAmericans are the largest ethnic group in the state, making up at least a third of the population. Their power is increasing at the expense of the Irish‐Americans, although they have not yet elected a‐govern or. The contest for the Democratic nomina tiog reflects this rivalry. Mrs. Grasso's strongest rival being Attorney General Robert D. Killian. Women, make up slightly more than half of Connecticut's electorate and are unusually active in politics. Unlike some women candidates who try to redress what they see as years of discrimination in politics by starting at the top, Mrs. Grasso has stifled the criticism of chauvinistic males by working her way up through, the ranks. Her interest piqued by her work with the League of Women Voters, Mrs. Grasso became a protegé of John Bailey, who has been the state party chairman since 1946. She was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1954. After serving for four yeirs she was elected as Secretary of State, a post that has been generally reserved for a woman for the last 35 years. Mrs. Grasso held it for three four‐year terms, running ahead of the ticket by increasingly large margins. Since one of the office's responsibilities is the supervision of elections in the state's 169 townships, it gave her the opportunity to become well acquainted with local officials, a source of great strength now. In 1970 Mrs. Grasso was elected to Congress, replacing Mr. Meskill, by a couple of thousand votes. Two years later, while President Nixon was sweeping the district by 38,000 votes out of 233,000 cast, she defeated by Republican challenger by 47,500 votes. Image of Virtue So it's quite clear that Connecticut loves Ella Grasso. The reason, it is generally agreed, has less to do with the issues than it has to do with the image of virtue that she projects and. her mastery of the personal, low‐key style of campaigning. She gave a good example of her skill last Friday at a luncheon meeting of the Mansfield Township Democratic Committeethe University of Conner nut here. First of all, she arrived from her home in Windsor Locks, near Hartford, not in a cavalcade of automobiles, but wedged into the front seat of a Toyota, with her husband at the wheel. Unlike in New York, there were no bullhorns, disturbing the bucolic tranquility of the campus. Mrs. Grasso merely walked into the Faculty Club, stood around chatting with anyone who came up to say hello and then went into lunch at a long table in a corner of the dining room. Mrs. Grasso manages to be self‐possessed without seeming arrogant. Italian warmth blends with Yankee briskness. She is an attractive woman whose photographs seldom do her justice. Her face is strongly modeled. Her brown eyes are deep set. Her nose is prominent, and her smile is rather toothy. She wears her brown hair cut short. Her half‐glasses nestle in it except when she is reading. Straight‐backed, 5 feet 6 inches tall and full‐figured, she fights to keep her weight at 135 pounds despite an unappeasable appetite for risotto, polenta and tortellini. In the Connecticut manner her campaigning clothing is unobtrusive, suggesting garden clubs. This day she was wearing a black velvet jacket, a white turtleneck sweater, gray slacks and buck walking shoes. Her only jewelry was her plain gold wedding band and a thin gold necklace. “Oh, I love clothes,” she said in reply to a question, “but I never get a chance to go shopping.” Mrs, Grasso gives the impression of not taking herself with total seriousness at all times, Her voice took on a bantering tone when she said, “That blue suit I was wearing the other night in Fairfield was a Halston. Didn't you notice?” Mrs. Grasso, who will celebrate her 55th birthday on May 10, is the daughter of immigrants from the Piedmont—proud, frugal, hardworking. “My father worked in a paper mill and my mother worked in a cotton mill,” she said. “Then he opened a bakery shop. He sold it while was in college, worked in a bakery for a while and then became a partner in a machine shop with my husband. He died in 1971 at the age of 84. It was a great shock to me. I thought he was going to live forever. My mother died the next year at the age of 81.” Mrs. Grasso was an only child and she had a mother who was ambitious for her. Thus at a time when comparatively few Italo‐Americans of either sex were receiving higher education, Mrs. Grasso was sent to the Chaffee School, a private secondary school. There she won a scholarship to Mount Holyoke College. She was graduated magna cum laude and went on to earn a master's degree in economics. “Half the girls in my class at Chaffee are working in my campaign,” she said, adding with a characteristic touch of the self‐effacing, “of course, there were only 16 in the class.” A Clese‐Knit Family Mrs. Grasso and her husband, Dr. Thomas Grasso, a slender, quiet man who retired last July as school principal in East Hartford, lived on Olive Street in Windsor Locks, where she was born, until last year, when they moved into a new Dutch colonial house on two acres of land overlooking a state fish hatchery on the outskirts of the town. Their children, Susanne, an art teacher, and James, a college student, live there with them. “What do you think,” she said. “We're an Italian family. The children live at home.” Dr. Grasso recalled that he had met his wife when he was working as a lifeguard at Old Lyme, where both families had cottages. “I thought he was the most wonderful man,” Mrs. Grassp said, her voice trilling, as it sometimes does, with League of Women Voters' enthusiasm. “He was so handsome and he wrote the most beautiful poetry. I began chasing “him and I finally caught him.” No real issues have developed between Mrs. Grasso and her rivals for the nomination, Mr. Killian, Frank Zullo, a former mayor of Norwalk, and Homer D. Babbidge, a former president of the University of Connecticut, and she is on reasonably good terms with all of them. The Democrats will be running against Mr. Meskill's personality as well as his record. He is seen as almost Nixonesque in his reclusiveness. They believe his failure to intervene for four months while bus strikes throttled public transportation in Hartford and other cities is very much held against him. For another thing, there is a general feeling among the Democrats that the Governor carried things too far in refusing to spend funds that had been appropriated by the Legislature for social services, although his efforts to whittle down a $244‐million deficit that he inherited was generally applauded. Moderate Liberal Mrs. Grasso is generally regarded as a moderate liberal, in the mainstream of the state's essentialy consensus politics. Her votes in Congress have received an 80 per cent rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. Organized labor strongly supports her. As co‐chairman of the resolutions committee at the Democratic national convention in 1968 she pushed through a minority report opposing continued involvement in Vietnam. She then left the convention before the voting, over the objections of Mr. Bailey, to express her disapproval of the actions of the Chicago police. With the gubernatorial nomination close to a certainty, Mrs. Grasso and her chief strategists, Herman Wolf, a public relations man who is closely associated with Senator Ribicoff, and Jim O'Neill, a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, have evolved a strategy of saying as little as possible on the issue and relying on her popularity to carry her to victory. The positions that she does take pose no threats, being closely aligned to what is clearly perceived as the will of the voters. She opposes, clear and loud, the imposition of a state income tax. It has been a subject of debate for the last 25 years. Even the lukewarm advocacy of it by Representative Emilio Daddario, the Democratic candidate for governor in 1970, is thought to have been an important factor in his upset defeat. Mr. Meskill then proceeded to damage himself seriously by getting the tax enacted in 1971. Cries of outrage by the voters forced its repeal within three months. The pre‐eminently sensitive issue in Connecticut is abortion, despite the United States Supreme Court decision permitting the procedure. At almost every meeting she attends Mrs. Grasso, who is a Roman Catholic, is asked to affirm her support of a proposed national prohibition law that is already before Congress. This she does with gusto. “In my view a fetus is a life that deserves the protection of society,” she told the meeting of Democratic town committees at Fairfield to tumultuous applause. After her speech, which aside from abortion was cloaked in generalities, Mrs. Grasso got down to the real business of the evening. She mingled with the 150 or so committee members, shaking hands, squeezing forearms, establishing eye contact, laughing at jokes that weren't very funny, remembering names and events of a year or a decade before, and asking quietly for help in her campaign. Then she and her husband left and the meeting voted unanimously to endorse her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High Court Avoids Riding On Quota for Law School,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/24/archives/high-court-avoids-riding-on-quota-for-law-school.html,"WASHINGTON, April 23—The Supreme Court, dividing 5 to 4, refused today to decide whether professional schools can constitutionally give preference in admissions to members of racial minorities at the expense of white applicants. At stake, but never reached by the Justices, was the broader issue of “reverse discrimination,” whether giving special treatment in education and employment to blacks unfairly deprives whites of their right to be judged on their own merits. The narrow Court majority maintained in an unsigned opinion that there was no longer a live controversy requiring a decision because Marco DeFunis Jr., the student who originally brought the action to win admission to law school, will graduate from that school in June no matter what the Court might do. This ruling, sharply attacked by the minority as “sidestepping,” left completely unresolved one of the most controversial and emotional issues to come before the Court since the abortion cases. Colleges and universities throughout the country must now wait for another case to be filed and work its way up through the court system—this one took nearly three years—before learning whether “affirmative action” programs to admit blacks with lower academic and test records are legal. Voting to refuse to consider the case were the four men named to the Court by President Nixon: Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist—plus Associate Justice Potter Stewart, an Eisenhower appointee. Charging that avoidance of the issue “clearly disserves the public interest” were the four dissenting Justices, all Demo crats when they came to the Court: Associate Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan Jr., Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall. In a long separate dissent Justice Douglas said he believed the admission practice at issue were unconstitutional because they were based on race. He maintained that preferences for students from deprived backgrounds were valid if they were granted without respect to race. The case turned aside by the Court (No. 73–235, DeFunis v. Odegard) had aroused widespread interest because of its potential effect on the legality of various quota systems currently used to help promote employment of blacks and other minorities as well as their access to higher education. Some legal authorities favoring discretionary admissions policies had urged the Court to postpone a ruling on the issue until a more sharply defined case came before the Justices. The Court action was brought by Mr. DeFunis after he was refused admission to the University of Washington Law School in 1971, on the grounds that three dozen successful applicants who were members of racial minorities had combined academic and aptitude ratings lower than his. The trial court agreed with Mr. DeFunis's contention that this admissions system violated his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. He was then admitted and remained enrolled after the Washington Supreme Court reversed the decision because Justice Douglas issued a stay pending final Supreme Court resolution of the case. The law school maintained that it was not bound by the strict arithmetic of test scores and grades in deciding admissions and that a positive kind of quota benefiting a minority rather than restricting it was not unconstitutional. Predictably, the Court's refusal to act satisfied almost no one. Mr. DeFunis declined to comment. The law school said no decision was preferable to a decision against its admissions policy. Organizations like the American Jewish Congress, which backed Mr. DeFunis, said they were disappointed. The dispute split the liberal community into two angry and contentious segments, one arguing that each individual must be judged on his own merits‐and the other that longstanding racial discrimination demands some form of compensatory help for blacks and other minorities. The division was particularly sharp among Jewish groups. Several of them joined the case on Mr. DeFunis's side, maintaining that quota systems that in the past deprived Jews of professional educations were equally objectionable when applied to help other different minorities. Other Jewish organizations, however, including the National Council of Jewish Women and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, defended the law school admissions policy on the general thesis that positive quotas designed to help the underprivileged were different from negative quotas designed to discriminate against them. “All parties agree,” the Supreme Court majority declared, “that DeFunis is now entitled to complete Ms legal studies at the University of Washington and to receive his degree from that institution. “A determination by this Court of the legal issues tendered by the parties is no longer necessary to compel that result and would not serve to prevent it,” the majority concluded. The five Justices who refused to decide the case suggested that the responsibility was not theirs because if Mr. DeFunis had filed a class action on behalf of all law students denied admission, the controversy would have remained alive after his admission to the final quarter. The majority alo conceded that they were probably only postponing a decision on the merits of a similar case. “If the admissions procedures of the law school remain unchanged,” they observed, “there is no reason to suppose that a subsequent case attacking those procedures will not come with relative speed to this Court, now that the Supreme Court of Washington has spoken.” The majority apparently assumed that the state Supreme Court would need less time on a second occasion to sustain the law school against another student denied admission. Writing for the minority, Justice Brennan said that Mr. Defunis's objections to the school's admission policy would become “real, not fanciful” if he were forced to drop out by “illness, economic necessity, even academic failure” before graduating and had to reapply in the fall. Mr. Brennan said he could “find no justification for the Court's straining to rid itself of this dispute. While we must be vigilant to require that litigants maintain a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy ... there is no want of an adversary contest in this case.” The dissenters noted the broad range of national interest attracted by the DeFunis case, which promoted the filing of 26 friend‐of‐the‐court briefs by interested and affected groups, and predicted that today's ruling was nothing more than a postponement. “Few constitutional questions in recent history have stirred as much debate, and they will not disappear,” Mr. Brennan said. “They must inevitably relurn to the Federal courts and ultimately again to this court.” In a relatively unusual move, none of the five Justices in the majority took credit for the authorship of the seven‐page opinion. Ordinarily, many unsigned or “per curiam” opinions are only issued in relatively routine cases when the Court is unanimous or there is, perhaps, a lone dissenter. In his separate dissent, Justice Douglas proposed that a new trial be held to consider, among other questions, whether the present national law school aptitude test should not be given to members of racial minorities because it measures “the dimensions and orienta tion of the organization man.” Mr. Douglas suggested that preferential treatment should be given to a promising law school applicant who was “a poor Appalachian white or second‐generation Chinese in San Francisco” just as readily as to other would‐be lawyers with limited backgrounds. Under the University of Washington system, special consideration was restricted to black, Chicano, American Indian or Filipino applicants. In other decisions announced today, the Court ruled as follows: A Colorado law that required welfare recipients to deduct uniform $30‐a‐month work expense allowance from any income to determine continued welfare eligibility, rather than their actual expenses, was unanimously invalidated. (No. 72‐1513, Shea v. Vialpando.) The court held, 5 to 4, that the National Labor Relation Board could not require employers to bargain collectively with any group of managerial employes, even though their jobs did not involve them in labor relations conflicts of interest. (No. 72‐1598, National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Aerospace Company.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Woman Odds‐On Favorite For Connecticut Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/24/archives/woman-oddson-favorite-for-connecticut-governor-special-to-the-new.html,"STORRS, Conn. — Politics is played quietly in the Land of Steady Habits. Without the trombones, as it were. Thus the news hasn't traveled very far that Connecticut is likely this year to become the first state to elect as governor a woman who is a successful politician in her own right rather than the wife or widow of one. The woman is Representative Ella Grasso, who has held public office without interruption for the last 20 years, the last four of them as a member of Congress from the Sixth District in the western part of the state. Polls commissioned by both parties and The Hartford Times all show her as the heavy favorite to win the nomination for governor at the Democratic party convention in July. A Seasoned Pro The accepted wisdom among political observers here is that in this year of Watergate her expected nomination should be tantamount to easy election in a state in which the Republicans have elected only one governor in the last 20 years. He the incumbent, Thomas J. Meskill, who is retirng after one term; In any case, Mrs. Grasso doesn't think her sex will be a factor in the voting. “The judgment will be made of me as an individual, on the basis of what I have accomplished in my career in public life and on the basis of what I'll be saying to the voters,” she told a visitor here the other day. On this point there is general agreement. “Ella is a seasoned politician who only incidentally happens to be a woman arid an Italo‐American,” said a respected analyst of the state's politics. Neither attribute hurts, however. ItaloAmericans are the largest ethnic group in the state, making up at least a third of the population. Their power is increasing at the expense of the Irish‐Americans, although they have not yet elected a governor. The contest for the Democratic nomination reflects this rivalry, Mrs. Grasso's strongest rival being Attorney General Robert D. Killian. Women, make up slightly more than half of Connecticut's electorate‐and are unusually active in politics. Unlike some women, candidates who try to redress what they see as years of discrimination in politics by starting at the top, Mrs. Grasso has stifled the criticism of chauvinistic males by working her way up through the ranks. Her interest piqued by her work with the League of Women Voters, Mrs. Grasso became a protege of John Bailey, who has been the state party chairman since 1946. She was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1954. After serving for four years she was elected as Secretary of State, a post that has been generally reserved for a woman for the last 35 years. Mrs. Grasso held it for three, four‐year, terms, running ahead of the ticket by increasingly large margins. Since one of the office's responsibilities is the supervision of elections in the state's 169 townships, it gave her the opportunity to become well acquainted with local officials, a source of great strength now. In 1970 Mrs. Grasso was elected to Congress, replacing Mr. Meskill, by a couple of thousand votes.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/27/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"Gen. Antonio de Spinola, who assumed the leadership of Portugal after Thursday's swift military coup, said that a provisional governeminent of civilians headed by a military man would be formed in three weeks. He promised general elections in one year. [1:1.] Units of Ethiopia's Fourth Division in Addis Ababa and police commandos staged mutinies in Addis Ababa, military sources said. The situation in the capital was extremely confused during what appeared to be separate mutinies. [1:2.] A gang of armed art thieves directed by a young woman raided the mansion of Sir Alfred Belt, a gold‐mining millionaire, in Blessington, near Dublin, tied up everyone in the house and stole masterpieces valued by the police at $19.2‐million. Works by Goya, Reubens and Vermeer were among the stolent paintings. Dublin art sources said it was believed to be the biggest single art robbery ever. [1:2–3.] President Nixon will reportedly seek public support next week for a decision to give the House Judiciary Committee transcripts rather than the tape recording of Watergaterelated conversations subpoenaed for the impeachment inquiry. Dean Burch, counselor to the President, told a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Washington that Mr. Nixon would turn over “a massive” body of evidence” to the committee. [1:8.] What has been called “the Dona. Nixon memorandum” throughout the 45‐day Mitchell‐Stans trial was the first official document the jury asked to review in its first full day of deliberations. Robert L. Vesco, who apparently wrote the memorandum, threatens President Nixon with disclosure of the secret $200,000 cash contribution he had made to the President's re‐election campaign unless a Federal investigation of Mr. Vesco's business affairs “is stopped promptly.” [1:4–7.] Profits reported by major oil companies for the first quarter of 1974 have shown increases averaging nearly 80 per cent from a year ago, but some analysts estimate that they may be much higher. A number of oil companies indicated that they had set aside certain amounts of profits to cover first‐quarter costs that might be incurred later this year, such as tax increases and higher retroactive costs of crude oil. [1:6.] The General Motors Corporation announced that its earnings in the first quarter of 1974 declined by 85 per cent from the 1973 first quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 1974 was $120‐million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $817‐million, or $2.84 a share a year ago. It was the lowest first‐quarter figure since 1948. [1:5.] The prime rate for commercial bank loans —one of the basic interest rates in the nation's economy—moved to new high ground as the Franklin National Bank went to 11 per cent from 10½ per cent, and several California banks went to 1034 per cent. The prime rate and the galaxy of other shortterm rates such as Treasury bills, commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit also have risen rapidly. [1:8.] The Federal Aviation Administration ordered an emergency “in‐depth” inspection of the world flight operations of Pan American World Airways following the crash on Monday of a Pan American Boeing 707 jet on Bali. It was the fourth crash of a Pan American 707 in the last nine months. [1:1.] The State Senate has voted to double the current budget for the State Council on the Arts, and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea said that he favored an even larger increase. The Senate approved a measure restoring $11.5‐million that had been cut from the proposed $30.5‐million budget for the council, which assists local cultural groups throughout the state. Mr. Duryea raised that figure by $3.6‐million more. [1:3–4.] Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has called on all six directors of the Shubert Foundation—including Irving Goldman, the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs—to disqualify themselves from any significant decision‐making during his office's investigation of alleged financial irregularities or face legal action for their removal. [16:1.] Governor Byrne of New Jersey and Mrs. Ann Klein, the state's Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies, took what they said was a first step in closing the Trenton State Prison soon after an eruption of violence in which five guards and three inmates were injured.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/27/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"Gen. António de Spinola, who assumed the leadership of Portugal after Thursday's swift military coup, said that a provisional governernment of civilians headed by a military man would be formed in three weeks. He promised general elections in one year. [1:1.] International Units of Ethiopia's Fourth Division in Addis Ababa and police commandos staged mutinies in Addis Ababa, military sources said. The situation in the capital was extremely confused during what appeared to be separate mutinies, [1:2.] A gang of armed art thieves directed by a young woman raided the mansion of Sir Alfred Beit, a gold‐mining millionaire, in Blessington, near Dublin, tied up everyone in the house and stole masterpieces valued by the police at $20.4‐million. Works by Goya, Reubens and Vermeer were among the stolen paintings. Dublin art sources said it was believed to be the biggest single art robbery ever. [1:7–8.] National President Nixon will reportedly seek public support next week for a decision to give the House Judiciary Committee transcripts rather than the tape recording of Watergaterelated conversations subpoenaed for the impeachment inquiry. Dean Burch, counselor to the President, told a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Washington that Mr. Nixon would turn over “a massive” body of evidence” to the committee. [1:8.] What has been called “the Don Nixon memorandum” throughout the 45‐day Mitchell‐Stans trial was the first official document the jury asked to review in its first full day of deliberations. Robert L. Vesco, who apparently wrote the memorandum, threatens President Nixon with disclosure of the secret $200,000 cash contribution he had made to the President's re‐election campaign unless a Federal investigation of Mr. Vesco's business affairs “is stopped promptly.” [12:3.4.] Profits reported by major oil companies for the first quarter of 1974 have shown increases averaging nearly 80 per cent from a year ago, but some analysts estimate that they may be much higher, A number of oil companies indicated that they had set aside certain amounts of profits to cover first‐quarter costs that might be incurred later this year, such as tax increases and higher retroactive costs of crude oil. [1:6.] The General Motors Corporation announced that its earnings in the first quarter of 1974 declined by 85 per cent from the 1973 first quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 1974 was $120‐million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $817‐million, or $2.84 a share a year ago. It was the lowest first‐quarter figure since 1948. [1:5.] The prime rate for commercial bank loans —one of the basic interest rates in the nation's economy—moved to new high ground as the Franklin National Bank went to 11 per cent from 10½ per cent, and several California banks went to 10¾ per cent. The prime rate and the galaxy of other shortterm rates such as Treasury bills, commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit also have risen rapidly. [1:2–3.] The Federal Aviation Administration ordered an emergency “in‐depth” inspection of the world flight operations of Pan American World Airways following the crash on Monday of a Pan American Boeing 707 jet on Bali. It was the fourth crash of a Pan American 707 in the last nine months. [1:1.] Metropolitan The State Senate has voted to double the current budget for the State Council on the Arts, and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea said that he favored an even larger increase. The Senate approved a measure restoring $11.5‐million that had been cut from the proposed $30.5‐million budget for the council, which assists local cultural groups throughout the state. Mr. Duryea raised that figure by $3.6‐million more. [1:3–4.] Attorney General Louis J.

Abortion Law Eased By a Narrow Vote In West Germany,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/27/archives/abortionlaweased-by-a-narrow-vote-in-west-germany-special-to-the.html,"BERLIN, April 26 —After long debate the lower house of the West German Parliament voted today in Bonn to legalize abortions in the first three months of a pregnancy. Chancellor Willy Brandt, who voted for the bill, called it “a reform to remove intolerable social injustices dating from the last centuries.” Under the law, abortions will be free, with social security institutions undertaking to cover all medical costs. The controversial bill, which split Mr. Brandt's Social Democrat‐Liberal cabinet, got only 247 votes; 233 members of Parliament voted against the bill, while nine members abstained. The close vote encouraged the Opposition Christian Democrats to announce they would put the bill to a new test in the upper house where they are in the majority. The upper house can merely delay enactment of the new law. It cannot overrule today's decision. Much of the 18‐hour parliamentary debate was carried live on West German television. Julius Cardinal Döpfner of Munich the head of the Conference of Roman Catholic Bishops in Germany, said that the church remained adamantly opposed to any reform of the present laws, which ban all abortions but those performed for strictly medical reasons. About 44 per cent of West Germans are Roman Catholics. Speakers for the bill said an estimated 200,000 secret operations were performed in Germany each year, many in rural, Roman Catholic areas. East Germany legalized abortions under a similar bill two years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clinic Sees Drop in Drug Use,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/clinic-sees-drop-in-drug-use-younger-girls-abort.html,"RIDGEWOOD—Three years ago, the odds would have been good that the youth casually sprawled on a waiting room couch at the Raymond E. Banta Valley Center was a heroin addict undergoing detoxification, and was at the clinic for his daily dose of methadone. Today, he is far more likely to be a soft‐drug abuser, or is awaiting testing or treatment for venereal disease. Or, he even may be one of an emerging number of teen‐age alcoholics. Three years ago, the same, odds could have been true for the pretty girl in stylishly threadbare jeans; today, the chances are that she is at the center for one of the same reasons as the boy. Or, she is there for a pregnancy test. “In such a short time; the whole picture has changed,” said Barbara Caiola, supervisor of the clinic, which Valley Hospital opened in late 1970 to combat an alarming increase in harddrug use in northwest Bergen County. A Different Lifestyle “Compared to 1971 and 1972, the pattern we're seeing now reflects a different adolescent lifestyle,” Mrs. Caiola declared. “We're seeing a dramatic drop in harddrug use, but a lot more soft drugs and alcohol abuse, a steady increase in venereal disease, three times as many teen‐age pregnancies and younger children coming in —even down to 12‐year‐olds.” From a peak of 540 harddrug addicts who underwent detoxification at the center in 1971, the figure dropped to 72 last year. Said Dr. Alfred Amendolara, a co‐director of the clinic: “Part of the shift from heroin is because it's almost dried up around here, and most of the youngsters now are afraid of it. But we still have a serious drug problem. It's a switch from one addiction to another. “There's a big increase in the use of soft drugs because the kids think they're more manageable. The worst danger is that they're using them in combination and often with alcohol, which can be deadly. “Sometimes, I get very depressed about it. These are kids who seem to have everything, but still they're out looking for more and more kicks.” Hand in hated with the burgeoning use of drugs, according to Dr. Amendolara, is a “definite pattern of drug abusers contracting venereal disease and the girls becoming pregnant. They're usually the same type of youngsters. They seek each other out, and often it leads to a sort of ‘share the wealth’ group sex. If one gets ‘V.D.,’ we'll get a horde from the same group.” Compared to a 1971 total of 86 youngsters tested for venereal disease, last year's figure soared to 477. The rise, the clinic believes, was owing in part to its intensive education program and free, confidential treatment. About a fifth of the tests were positive, with some of the children as young as 14. “We not only give medical treatment,” said Mrs. Caiola, “but also counseling on the psychological and physical dangers.” One problem that apparently has gone largely unnoticed in Bergen County is the sharply rising number of pregnancies among unmarried girls. The center recorded an increase from 109 in 1971 to 294 in 1973, in spite of easily available contraceptives. The center only tests for pregnancy and refers the girls elsewhere for medical care. However, Mrs. Caiola noted that “we discuss all alternatives with them—whether to keep the baby, put it up for adoption or have an abortion. We encourage the girls to tell their families, but some simply can't, so we have to try to be substitute parents.” Younger Girls Abort Most of the girls coming to the clinic are 16 to 19, although some have been as young as 14. Some elect to have their babies, Mrs. Caiola reported, but the younger ones usually choose abortion, “which they can get over a weekend.” Under the state's so‐called “emancipated minor” law, a girl as young as 11 can have the operation within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy without first obtaining parental consent. Dr. Russell Layden, head of social services for the Bergen County Board of Education, said that his department was planning a full‐time education program for pregnant girls; in the past, they have been forced to drop out of regular school and tutored at home. The program would be similar to one in Paterson, which provides schooling and medical supervision. The Raymond E. Banta Valley Center is named for its late head and principal founder. It provides treatment and counseling to young people from 12 communities in the area, and this year expects about 1,800 patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Readers Have Their Say on Shylock,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/the-readers-have-their-say-on-shylock-begs-the-question.html,"TO THE EDITOR: FRED M. HECHINGER defends the recent ABCTV presentation of “The Merchant of Venice” (“Why Shylock Should Not Be Censored,” March 31). He claims that, unlike the Jewish agencies which protested the broadcast, he decided the issue “on the grounds of rational analysis rather than the reflex reaction of programed emotions.” To the contrary, on the very grounds of rational analysis, and holding momentarily in abeyance the question of whose programed emotions are turned on, Shakespeare's Shylock should be censored. Any rational analysis would have to begin with the incontrovertible evidence that the Euro‐American mind has been programed for anti‐Semitism for the past 2,000 years by virtue of religious tradition, culture and education. Viewed in this perspective, and it is the only authentic perspective, Mr. Hechinger's attempt to equate anti‐Semitism with controversial issues such as abortion or Mafia‐related crime is sophomoric. Between 1939 and 1945, when the gothic cathedrals toppled all over Europe with little resistance to the Nazi storm, most Europeans joined Germany in a wild Walpurgis Night wherein every grotesque fantasy could, with legal impunity, be acted out against the Jewish people. Does any art form which supports these collective, historic fantasies gain the right of access to a TV screen? And whether the program reaches Mr. Hechinger's sophisticated or untutored mass audience is historically irrelevant. Doctors, lawyers and academicians were part of Hitler's extermination squads. Mr. Hechinger's essay failed to come to grips with the unique nature of anti‐Semitism. He failed to understand that the difference between controversies about antiSemitism and Mafia‐related crime or abortion is a differential in light years. Censorship is a social cost which can be denied to any group or to any issue at minimum risk—with one exception. For the Jewish' people, the risk is maximum. Is there any danger in showing a character like Shylock on television? ‘For the Jewish people,’ writes one viewer, ‘the risk is maximum’ LEO BLOND Bayside, N. Y. “CARICATURE” To THE EDITOR: Apparently Fred M. Hechinger did not view the same “Merchant of Venice” that appeared on my TV screen. I agree only with his admission that “transposing [the play] from Elizabethan to Edwardian days makes a hash of the central theme.” The anachronisms, in fact, made the play seem senseless. But, reviewers like Mr. Hechinger were too much awed by Laurence Olivier's reputation to point out what was quite obvious, namely, that Olivier's portrayal was a melodramatic caricature totally false to Shakespeare's remarkable conception. The oft‐quoted “Hath not a Jew eyes?” speech was not only vilely cut but also stripped of its poetry and humanity. With the assistance of the cameraman, who managed to magnify the actor's grimaces and mannerisms, Shylock was projected as a kind of monster consistently beside himself with rage, with barely a shred of dignity. If a classic presented on TV needs the lengthy exegesis, before or after, that Mr, Hechinger calls for, there is something sadly wrong with the production. Comparing various criticisms of this anti ‐ Semitic presentation to censorship of current‐issues discussion do TV is to. muddy the waters. Network executives fnake at least some pretense of examining more than one aspect of a current controversial question. Olivter's production made no contribution whatever to study of or popular understanding of anti‐Semitism. MILLICENT SCHUKER Boca Raton, Fla. “NOT A GOOD PLAY” To THE EDITOR: If “The Merchant of Venice” should not be done, it is only because it is not a very good play, and certain. ly nowhere near as good as what we know Shakespeare was capable of a few years later. It is badly dated, and Fred M. Hechinger is as mistaken as the production was in trying to treat it as if it were not. I think Shakespeare is a great enough writer to stand up to fair criticism instead of the blind reverence to which he is usually subjected. Mr. Hechinger's criticism seems to attempt to defend Shakespeare at all costs, even to the point of insisting that a had play is a good one. But then, even bad plays deserve to be allowed to be produced. I agree with the spirit of Mr. Hechinger's ar ticle, if not the letter: Censorship is always a bad means, no matter how noble the ends. ARTHUR MAISEL Bayside, N. Y. “COMPLEX STEREOTYPE” To THE EDITOR: Erring just as earlier critics of “The Merchant of Venice” have erred, John J. O'Connor and Fred M. Hechinger have been hoisted by the same petard. Shakespeare's Shylock, nearing his 400th birthday, continues to resist rehabilitation; and the play remains anti‐Semitic. Mr. O'Connor's misgivings about its being an insoluble problem at least cut closer to the bone than Mr. Hechinger's admiration for the Bard's ability “to create not an anti‐Semitic stereotype but a complex Shylock.” More truly, Shakespeare wrote a more. complex anti‐Semitic Once and for all, Bardophiles must face two irreducible facts: “The Merchant of Venice” is not a superior play; and its villain has been misconceived, misplayed and generally twisted out of shape by well‐meaning, if self‐serving, actors from the days of Edmund Kean and Sir Henry Irving to Sir Laurence Olivier. Steadfastly, “The Merchant of Venice” refuses to be anything but a 16th‐pentury comedy, replete with contemporary mores and attitudes, It is bluntly anti‐Semitic and just as frankly anti‐Negro. Black liberation has not yet caught up with Portia's rejection of the Prince of Morocco, whom she sends packing with the quip, “Gentle riddance, Let all of his complexion choose me so.” It's naive, perhaps, to suggest that “The Merchant of Venice” be played only to audiences with unburdened consciences. Then again, bias is not singular to Shakespeare's day. Concern about infecting “the untutored mass audience” could be devoted equally to the “Passion Play” and “Jesus Christ Superstar.” The “masses” are being instructed weekly by Archie Bunker and “Sanford and Son.” Performed as outright comedy and not pussyfooted as sanctimonious guilt‐ridden drama, “The Merchant of Venice” likewise might act as a homeopathic prescription, a toxin‐anti‐toxin for the rabies of bigotry. BARRY HYAMS New York City “BEGS THE QUESTION” To THE EDITOR: I read with interest Fred M. Hechinger's scholarly treatise on “The Merchant of Venice,” but I would like to take issue with him on one vital point. He has suggested that an analysis accompany the play's presentation to explain the playwright's and the characters meaning in the context of their time—this to forestall an anti‐Semitic reaction by the audience.• I submit this begs the question. If the'play is truly antiSemitic, such an apologia would do little to mitigate its religious and ethnic bigotry. We cannot expect the majority of the audience to place themselves in an Elizabethan theater and judge the play from that “point in time.” Our reactions are geared to the world in which we live today, and a remark like “dog of a Jew” is not mitigated by historical perspective. So far, those organizations concerned over the spreading of bigotry no doubt would agree with the. But here is where we part company, for a play may contain antiSemitism and still not be anti‐Semitic. For example, one would never label “The Diary of Anne Frank” or “I Am a Camera” as anti‐Sem .itic. To be truly classified as anti‐Semitic, I contend a play must engender an antiSemitic reaction on the part of the vast majority„ of the audience. I think most of today's high school students, along with most of the others in the audience viewing the play for the first time, would find Shylock's motives for revenge even stronger than they must have appeared to Elizabethan audiences, for most Americans today have little empathy for bigots and name‐callers. Their sympathy goes out to the one who is harassed—the underdog. Is, then, “The Merchant of Venice” anti‐Semitic? Full of anti‐Semitism — yes. AntiSemitic—no. One senseless, repulsive act on the part of the Jewish Defense League can engender more anti‐Semitism than a thousand showings of the play. DWIGHT WEIST Member of National Board of Screen Actors. Guild New York City SHYLOCK AS MARTIAN? To THE EDITOR: Each work of art creates its own world and values. It must be seen on its own terms and also within the artist's entire oeuvre. But sometimes other concerns blind us. It is unfortunate that our justifiably great sensitivity to anti‐Semitism — less than 30 years after the Nazi atrocities and in the midst of the current Arab‐Israeli conflicts—thus often prevents us from approaching “The Merchant of Venice” at all objectively, either in performance or in literary interpretation. Although it would be absurd, Shylock could really be played as a Turk or a Martian without seriously altering the play's most basic concerns of love, risk, money, or mercy. When we approach the play, then, we must appreciate that aspect of Shakespeare's genius: his plots are generally a vehicle for, a means toward higher themes. “The Merchant of Venice” should never be censored, of course. But neither should it be altered almost apologetically, twisted unrecognizably out of shape, as in the Olivier production. WALTER M. FRISCH Gainesville, Fla. “A MYTHIC FIGURE” To THE EDITOR: I agree with Fred M. Hechinger that a reasonable solution to the dilemma of whether or not to broadcast a work like “The Merchant of Venice” is to include, as intropluction or postscript, an analysis of the playwright's intent and related matters. Unfortunately, this can serve no useful purpose if the playwright's intent is misread as completely as Mr. Hechinger misreads it. What Mr. Hechinger never comes to grips with is the fact that Shakespeare is a Christian who takes his Christianity seriously. If one cannot reach an adequate understanding of other plays of Shakespeare, such as “Hamlet,” without recognizing the centrality of Christian categories to their dominant themes, why should one treat “The Merchant of Venice,” in which the confrontation between Christian and Jew is stage‐center, as though it were a social and psychological study torn loose from any theological framework? Once we are aware of the Christian basis of the play, two things become clear: (1) Shylock has no relation to real, Jews, but is a mythic figure, like the Satan of Milton's “Paradise Lost,” which has been developed into a complex personality by a writer of genius; (2) Shakespeare's sympathy is no more with Shylock than Milton's is with Satan. It is trivial to ask whether Shakespeare is anti‐Semitic in contrasting Christian and Jew in this way. What is more important is that he presents us with a distorted view of Jews and Judaism, derived not from objective observation but from the doctrines of a hostile religion. The opposition between justice and mercy on which Shakespeare dwells may be central to Christianity, but it is alien to Jewish tradition, in which the word which is usually translated as “justice” also means “charity,” and the word for “commandment” implies “act of mercy” as Is it too much to ask that any analysis of “The Merchant of Venice” be honest both toward Shakespeare and toward Judaism?

New U.S. History Textbooks Putting Stress On Minorities Contribution to Building Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/new-us-history-textbooks-putting-stress-on-minorities-contribution.html,"“Look, son I understand why you're inpatient. I was, too, at your age. But you have to remember what things were like then when was a boy in order to see how much better they are now.” “Here you go again about how bad it was back then.” “Now, wait a minute. Hear me out. Because of all those sit‐ins and freedom rides and protest marches your mother and I can go into Southern dime stores and sit—you hear, sit—at a lunch counter.” This imaginary debate between a black father and his son is the way a new textbook called “Premise of America” by Larry Cuban and Philip Roden begins a chapter on the civil rights movement. It illustrates the dramatic change in the way blacks are being portrayed in some textbooks throughout the nation and the new emphasis on the contributions of racial and ethnic groups to American history. An Imaginary Interview In another section a worker from Lithuania, whose job it was to sweep up the blood all day in the Chicago stockyards of 1904, gives a first‐hand account of what it was like there. A reporter conducts an imaginary interview with Alexander H. Stephens, Vice President of the Confederate States, a friend of Abraham Lincoln's and a Senator from Georgia on the causes of the Civil War. To give a sense of life in the pities, the sheet music of the tiopular hit “Downtown” is reproduced. And the pages are filled with graphics, often hardhitting, such as, one showing Japanese residents of Hiroshima waiting for medical help shortly after the explosion of the atomic bomb. For someone who was graduated from high school as recently as five years ago, some of the new textbooks bear little resemblance to the books of the past, in which American history usually began with Christopher Columbus and then focused on the colonies and the movement West. Then in 1966,‐ the Michigan State Legislature passed a law directing the state's Department of Education to help school districts select textbooks that took a fresh look at the impact of racial and ethnic group on American history. Progress Found The law also called for surveys of the most widely used textbooks and four surveys made so far have sharply affected the nation's textbook publishing industry. The first survey, in 1968, found that no book treated minority groups adequately. A survey in 1971 found prog ress but concluded that minorities were either largely neglected or treated as appendages and not as an integral part of the narrative. In 1972, a survey rated 31 per cent of the books as good or very good, but there were still serious drawbacks in the best of them. Some still portrayed American history mostly in terms of hardy pioneers building an ever more prosperous nation through science, technology and hard work The fourth report, in 1974, concluded that half of the 18 reviewed books were excellent Nat Turner, a stave preacher. or good and another 20 per cent fair. Most books now include event largely avoided 10 years ago, such as the internment of Japanese‐Americans in camps during World War II and the slave rebellion in 1831 led by Nat Turner, a slave preacher. The women's movement is included in many, and some books discuss such previous tabooed issues as abortion and birth control. The most concerted pressure on textbook publishers is coming from the women's movement. In discussing the “Impact of Our Past: A History of the United States” by Bernard A. Weisberger, one reviewer in the 1974 study wrote that the author “presents women in a range of ways.” “Not only will the student read of the garment workers and pacifists,” the reviewer wrote, “but he/she will see a photograph of Frances Perkins, Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, shaking hands with some steel workers.” Other Groups Speak Up Other groups, such as Chicanos and Puerto Ricans, are beginning to ask school authorities and publishers for more adequate treatment. Elizabeth Connor, supervisor of social studies in the Detroit school system, summed up in an interview the treatment of immigrant groups in most books as follows: “They pass through Ellis Island. They settle in the city and have a hard time and that's about it.” Ethnic groups, she said, are now asking: “Who manned the steel mills? Who worked the mines? Who cut the forests?” There has been a vast im provement in the portrayal of blacks, she said, and their agitation has subsided. But recently there has been a counterreaction. Small groups of parents, particularly in suburban districts, are contending that some of the newer texts have gone too far—emphasizing the problems of the United States and playing down the accomplishments. Parents in the Warren district, a large, white, mostly blue collar suburb of Detroit, succeeded last May in having the school board withdraw “Promise of America.” The Ordinary People The book, broken down into five volumes, presents American history in terms of broad themes, such as the growth of the city Rather than the standard narrative, where famous men are the prime movers, the emphasis is on the everyday life of ordinary people in the cities and on the farms. There are numerous excerpts from contemporary accounts. A chapter on “Getting Along in the City” includes excerpts from a novel about Chicago Jews in the nineteen‐twenties and a short story by James T. Farrell describing life on Chicago's South Side in 1919. In the Farrell story, Tony Rabuski, a Polish boy, is described as follows: “He talked about the ‘niggers.’ He felt as good as he guessed these other kids did when he talked about the ‘niggers’ and they could be beat up.” To Mrs. Carolyn Gietzen, one of the 27 parents who agitated to have the board remove the book, such passages were damaging to white children and degrading to blacks. “Education is getting a positive self‐image about oneself,” she said in an interview at a school board meeting last Wednesday night. “No child, white or black, will get a positive image by reading about stabbings, war, the problems.” “For me,” she continued, “our history is still made up of heroes and heroines, but when you look at these books, there are no heroes and heroines.” So far, the opposition of parents such as those in Warren has not blunted the trend toward revision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion: Stormy Debate Due,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/abortion-stormy-debate-due-demonstration-is-likely.html,"TRENTON—In what promises to be a stormy session, the Department of Health will hold a public hearing here Tuesday on proposed regulations embracing the licensing and operation of abortion clinics throughout the state. Although the exact number of abortions performed in New Jersey is not known, a Health Department spokesman estimated that tens of thousands of fetuses have been aborted in the state's hospitals since the United States Supreme Court ruled in January, 1973, that no state could interfere with abortions in the first three months of pregnancy. Nevertheless, the licensing of clinics throughout New Jersey would make abortion facilities more readily available and the operation less expensive. Hospital abortions on an out‐patient basis now cost approximately $375; routine clinic abortions are expected to cost $125. The hearings are required as an essential step before the Health Department can issue a license.. Entered as ‘Out Patient’ Under the proposed regulations, a woman no more than 12 weeks' pregnant could have an abortion performed in a clinic as an “out patient,” meaning that she would be detained for three to six hours after the operation so as to guard against any complications that might arise. Also, two days must elapse between the time of initial examination and the abortion itself. This is to allow for test results and to permit “firm decision by the patient” regarding abortion. A clinic also would have to be situated within 10 minutes of a hospital. This is to guard against any emergencies that might occur. Termination of pregnancies beyond the 12th week would have to be performed on an “in patient” basis only. Pregnancy terminations between the 13th and 15th weeks are discouraged because of possible dangerous complications. According to the regulations, all such operations must be performed by a physician after consultation with specialists in the field. Terminations of pregnancy in the last 12 weeks are prohibited, except to save the life of the mother or the fetus. Demonstration Is Likely The New Jersey Obstetrics and Gynecologic Society has issued a sharp rebuttal to the Health Department's proposed regulation permitting “second trimester” abortions in a facility other than a hospital. According to the society, “unforeseeable major complications” have frequently occurred at a late stage. A society representative is scheduled to testify at the hearing on Tuesday, at which time several Right to Life groups are expected to demonstrate in opposition to the regulations. Right to. Life organizations oppose all abortions except those to save the mother's life. About half of New Jersey's hospitals are now performing abortions, according to Health Department officials, but the state has been accused by pro‐abortion groups of stalling on making hospitals offer such services. A suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union seeks to compel hospitals to perform elective abortions on the ground that a woman has the constitutional right to one. Arguments in the case will be heard soon in Superior Court in Cumberland County. It is apparent that, under existing circumstances, any woman desiring an abortion would be well advised to “shop around.” For example, Dr. Robert M. Livingston, an Englewood obstetrician who has been challenging the legality of the state's abortion laws for more than two years, has been operating a clinic in which about 150 abortions are performed each week, all in defiance of the present state statutes. The abortions cost about $100, Dr. Livingston reported, adding that about 25 per cent of his patients are teenagers. Dr. Livingston also has been invited to testify at Tuesday's hearing. He is opposed to several of the department's proposed regulations, including the two‐day wait for patients and what he described as “elaborate construction standards” that will put a $500,000 price tag on the abortion facilities to be built. That, he said, would be likely to increase the estimated $125 fee that the doctors are planning to charge. A number of applications for abortion clinics already has been received by the Health Department. They have come from Jersey City, Rahway, Cedar Grove, Englewood and Atlantic City.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Duryea‐Wilson Vote‐Reform Debate Is Unlikely,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/29/archives/duryeawilson-votereform-debate-is-unlikely-albany-notes.html,"ALBANY — Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea has been telling associates that there is “no way” that he can accept a compromise on campaign reform that includes Governor Wilson's proposal to give the enforcement powers to the Secretary of State. The State Constitution requires election machinery to be, bipartisan, Mr. Duryea has been saying, and therefore he insists that his own proposal for a bipartisan state election commission independent of the Governor is more acceptable. Albany Notes However, the possibility of hard public bickering between the two Republican rivals seems unlikely because the Governor said last week that he was not “frozen” on the details of his bill, and Mr. Duryea has said privately that except for a few crucial areas the two measures are similar. Another of those areas is spending limitations, and while both bills would set maximum amounts that could be spent on campaigns, Mr. Duryea's would limit the rich candidate to spending no more than $100,000 from his own pocket, while the Governor would let the affluent politician spend personal resources all the way to the maximum—$4.5‐million for statewide candidate. The danger of abuse, the Governor says, lies not so much in the rich candidate as in a rich donor bankrolling a candidate and wielding great influence as a result. Mr. Wilson, who ran with former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller in campaigns financed by the Rockefeller fortune, said the rich man's advantage was secondary to the influence question. He asks: “How can the [rich] candidate measure his own influence on himself by how much he contributes to his campaign?” • Contrary to the assertions of Mayor Beame and the Democratic minority leadership of the Legislature, various influential Republicans say the one‐cent‐a‐dollar increase in the city's sales tax is not a foregone conclusion this year to help close the city's budget gap. “Listen, I remember when we had our own [state] budget‐cutting up here and there were loads of firings,” one Republican said. “He hasn't reached that stage.” City Democrats are skittish over Governor Wilson's reported demand for sizable Democratic backing of a budget solution because city Republican legislators are likely to be let off the hook by their leaders and vote against a tax rise. So there is nothing certain yet, one Democratic leader said with a grin about Wilson's sales tax.” • With adjournment near, it is time to watch what some critics call “snooker” or “sleeper” bills. Among those being tracked by long‐time observers of the Legislature is one released anonymously by the Assembly Rules Committee that would increase the courtroom postponements permitted legislators who are lawyers. Now a lawyer‐legislator can get a 10‐day court postponement when his civil cases come up during the legislative session or up to 10 days after. The bill that was released would enlarge this to 30day postponements up to a month after the session, and would include criminal cases as well as civil. More important, it would also extend the privilege for the first time to the many lawyers who work for legislators, some of whom helped write the bill. • The Legislature often savors at length such inconsequential events as the introduction of a beauty queen in the gallery. In stark contrast, the scene in the Senate one day last week was grimly quiet as the leadership swiftly cleared the path toward adjournment by ordering dozens of bills “recommitted”—struck from the debating agenda for the year without ceremony. This is painful to the bills’ sponsors, but not a whimper was heard. • For some groups, the quiet death of a bill can be exhilarating. Thus the Empire State Chamber of Commerce greeted as “happy news” the little‐noted rejection by the Senate Agriculture and Consumer Committee of a bill, sponsored by Senator Bernard C. Smith, Republican of Northport, L. I., to control and ultimately ban nonreturnable beverage containers. • Republicans often speak reverently, in debate, of the powerful Chamber of Commerce business lobby, the same way Democrats pause respectfully over the memos from “Big Labor.” But recently the Republicans in the Assembly stared at a colleague, William R. Sears, Republican‐Conservative of Woodgate, as if he were Patrick Henry, for he openly sassed the Chamber of Commerce and the Legislature's “games.” An upstater was trying to force the retreat of Mr. Sears’ bill related to employe payrolls by repeatedly reminding him of the business chamber's memo of opposition. “Yeah, well, they said something to the effect that anyone who would sponsor such a bill ought to have his head examined,” Mr. Sears said. “But that probably makes it a very good bill.” “Attaboy!” one Republican shouted joyously. But the episode ended on a note of indignation, as Mr. Sears was accused gravely of “disrespect” toward the business chamber by Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican‐Conservative of Glens Falls. • Constance E. Cook, a member of the Assembly from Ithaca, would like to get the Republican nomination for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Howard W. Robison. Mrs. Cook is highly respected by her colleagues on both sides of the aisle for her work as education chair man and for the calm bipartisan leadership that she offered on abortion reform. She arrived here 12 years ago, when “chauvinism” was thought to be a sin strictly of nations, and as a liberation spokesman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HECKLERS DELAY ABORTION HEARING,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/01/archives/hecklers-delay-abortion-hearing-special-to-the-new-york-times.html,"TRENTON, April 30—A public hearing on abortion regulations proposed by the State Department of Health was abruptly suspended this afternoon when foes of abortion defied the presiding officer's order to stop “harassing” a speaker for the New Jersey chapter of the National ‘Organization for Women. The antiabortionists, many of them wearing buttons identifying themselves as members of the “Right to Life” organization, repeatedly interrupted Alice Cohan, of the state branch of NOW, with loud, rhythmic handclapping. After a protest by the NOW representative, E. Powers Minscher, a lawyer acting as the hearing officer for the Health Department, observed that the “applause” was not a sign of approval but was intended as “harassment,” and he directed that it cease. When it continued, he ordered the meeting recessed for five minutes. Shouts Into Microphone During the recess, a short, gray‐haired woman grabbed unintelligibly into it until it was disconnected. Then she proceeded up the aisle of the State Museum auditorium shoutng bout “Hitler coming to this country” and exterminating Catholics, Protestants, Jews and blacks. She took a seat next to a representative of the New Jersey Catholic Conference, but refused to identify herself, saying only that she was for “human life.” Although sparsely attended, the hearing fulfilled the expectation of a clash between the vocal partisan groups in one of the most controversial social and political issues before the state. Court cases are pending on the rights of hospitals to refuse to perform abortions and the State Legislature has before it a bill that would bar requiring persons or healthcare facilities to perform or assist in an abortion against their will. The purpose of today's hearing was to consider regulations prepared by the State Health Department “to provide public health standards of care for the performance of abortions, with proper regard for the health, safety and well‐being of the patient.’ ‘Morally Opposed’ to Abortion. Dr. William J. Dougherty, acting State Commissioner of Health, said in his brief opening remarks that he was “morally opposed” to abortion but that in accordance with last year's United States Supreme Court decision, the state “had no choice” but to provide and regulate facilities for the performance of lekl abortions. Among the speakers was Dr. Robert Livingston, an Englewood obstetrician who has been challenging the legality of the state's abortion laws for more than two years, and who has performed hundreds of abortions in defiance of the statutes. He criticized some of the restrictions in the proposed regulations particularly one requiring that a potential patient be required to wait two days between the time she is tested for a pregnancy and the date the abortion can be performed. Dr. Livingston described the time restriction as “a bone thrown to the antiabortionists,” and said it was “most harmful” to poor women who were limited by large families or their jobs in the number of times they could visit an abortion facility. And generally he called the regulations governing abortions in both the first and second 12‐week periods, or trimesters, “far too stringent” by current accepted practice in the abortion field. Other aspects of the rules, he said, “are clearly unconstitutional” and invite lawsuits because they violate the Supreme Court's “historic and magnificent” ruling on abortion. In opposition, Edward J. Leadem, executive director of the New Jersey Catholic Conference, said that “we do not for one moment agree with the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court's ruling of Jan. 22, 1973.” In this ruling, the Supreme Court said that any prohibition of abortion early in pregnancy was an unconstitutional invasion of a woman's privacy. In a discussion of the proposed regulations, Mr. Leadem urged that “the right to refuse to perform, or assist in the termination of pregnancy procedure be made a specific rule and be extended to include institutions” as well as individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A spokesman for Aquinas College said, “It is a tragedy and with deep regret that the Bishop took this stand, but he felt obliged to do‐so. Some of the people at the college who advocated the honorary degree for her civil rights achievements did not know of her militant and deep involvement in the proabortion controversy.” Mrs. Chisholm is scheduled to receive the degree May 11.

Two novels,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/05/archives/two-novels-the-halfsisters.html,"“In ‐ the Springtime of the Year” is a book like a handmade quilt It is traditional, well‐gtitched, moves slowly towards completion, and is intended, at least partially, as a comfort against the cold. It speaks of home truths, of rituals, of long‐established ways of life and of a sense of sharing. Like a quilt, too, it is somewhat abstract, somewhat geometrical concerned less with departures from the norm than with “the pattern of things,” a phraie which recurs with variations throughout the book. Unlike quilts, however, it is of a genus currently unfashionable; one way of saying this is that it is written in a romantic mode,’ in which absolute goodness is both possible and meanrngful, rather than in the prevelant 20th‐century ironic mode, in which it is not. In the Springtime Of the Year The book is set in rural England, and it is unclear whether or not the time is contemporary: certainly there are no television sets or even newspapers in evidence, and nothing from the outside world enters the small closed community where the young heroine lives in her working‐class country cottage. She is suffering from the effects of her husband's sudden death, and the book chronicles with great feeling and accuracy her progress through the stages of grief. The strongest POrtions of the book are her solitary experiences, which range from numbness through distracted midnight visits to the husband's grave through total despair, and also through intervals, strange and suffused with light, ilike a Vaughan poem in which the physical world seems transfigured and radiant, full of invisible promise, or the dead husband is sensed in the next room or standing behind her. In a way the book is a ghost story in which the ghost never quite appears. The pass ages describing her emotional states are intertwined with seasonal tableaux, beautiful and somehow remote as the pictures in a medieval Book of Hours., At these times the writing has a Chaucerian freshness which is currently a rare achievement. These are the book's best moments. Margaret Atwood's most recent books are “Surfacing” and “Power Politics.” Its weakest are undoubtedly the conversations. The characters are by nature laconic and inarticulate, and when they have to speak (it is a pity they must) they are made to do so in a language reminiscent of 19th‐century melodrama'or of the radio plays of a bygone eta, with many rhetorical questions and significant pauses marked by triple dots. Of the last century too are the assumptions—it's a world in which crises of faith (and it seems to be an emorphouS Anglicanism) are major events—and the characterizations: saintly dead Ben, missed by all, Jo the preternaturally wise child, Dora the two‐dimensional nasty mother, Ratheman the bereaVed curate, shaking his fist at God. Also dated is the resolution, which has something to do with the heroine's coming out of her own isolation and grief by Helping Others In Trouble. One of these is prideful.” sister‐in‐law Alice, who has become pregnant, and it is indicative of the, slightly removed tone of the book that the reader is taken aback by this; there is nothing to prepare us to via‐utilize the act that must have caused it. It is not a book in which people pick their noses, and bodies are fully present only when dead, like Little Nell's. “What coeld I do?” asks Alice of her plight, and visions of birth‐control and abortion dance through nobody's head. The parents do the right thing and kick her out. The heroine does the right thing and takes, her in. Ben's death is seen as somehow “right” “The% was winter, there would be spring.” Life will go Still, despite, lapses into simplemindedness, “In the Springtime of the Year” justifies itself by the intensity of those things it does well: mnments of genuine feeling, moments of vision. It is less a novel than the portrait of an emotion, and as this it Is poignant and convincing. The Half‐Sisters By Cynthia Propper Seton. 213 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. $6.95. This is a snazzy, delightful novel, jaunty as a roadster and with something of its period flavor. It starts off in 1937 when its two 11‐year‐old heroines, energetic girls both, are spending August together as usual. They are related by marriage but not by blood—Erica's father has married Billie's mother—and are complementary rather than identical, Erica being plain, good and sensible, Billie stunning, bad and impulsive. They Lose sight of each other when their only shared relative, the weak‐spined father, drowns in an absurd boating accident, missed by none. Their story is picked up again in 1946 and again in the 20‐year lapse having ben imposed by self‐punishing Erica, who has had a brief affair with the man Billie has married. By Part Three they both know much more than they did in Part One, including the facts that they have married men they do not love and that their own relationship is in fan odd way‐ the most important in either life. Listening to Cynthia. Propper Seton recount their ups and downs their betrayals, dishonesties, loyalties and illuminations is like listening to a witty, well‐traveled, sophisticated and slightly eccentric rich aunt gossiping and passing judgments upon her acquaintances,. a fascinating passtime when the aunt has the flair, style and pithiness of the author. ‘ Also you learn things. She reminds me a little of Mary Poppins—no nonsense, please—and also of Lord Chesterfield, as she delivers verbal fillips to her Characters'. egos with 18th century elegance and precision, then injects them with helpful epigrams. ‘The setting, too, has its eleganceS:‐ it's the kind of world in which people have large flats in New York and spend the summer yachting at Moriches, and the author, polite Or innocently Snobbish, assumes we all know all about it. This plebian didn't, but it's great fun to watch,‐ especially since the point, as in tennis (Billie's game), is not the activity or the content but the polish. Seton does waste time. The overview that emerges is a comic one, although muted by a sense of the great futilities lying beyond its perimeters. Life is a series of Choices you didn't intend to make, can't see beyond and end up being trapped by and one of the most‐important things you can learn (e.spedaily if female) is how to accommodate, how to compromise with grace. The “role models” (Erica would find this phrase intolerably sloppy) tend toward strong‐willed women whose lives nevertheless don't quite work out, and men who are weak of chin or insensitive as stuffed rhinoceroses, though there are a few admirable exceptions. Womens Lib is not something these women go in for, but the daughters do. They thereby beCome, apparently, pains in the neck (Seton is hard on political simplistics of any kind). But good. Erica does have her liberating moment: having spent all her life “taking orders,” doing what she thinks she ought to do, she finally does something she wants to do. It happens to be sleeping with her husband's brother, and since “The Half‐Sisters” is, a comedy of a kind, she is The jacket‐ cover indicates that this is Setan's second novel.

"Television,",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/05/archives/remember-men-lets-not-make-anybody-mad-television.html,"Occasionally just Occasionally; I make an effort to attend one of those panel discussions about tele vision that seem to be en prevalent around town. A recent example was sponsored by the New York chapter of the National, Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. With an audiente overflowing into the aisles of a large hotel ballroom the forum tackled the subject of “Bolder Themes in Television.” The moderator was David Susskind, unflappable and genially liberal but coldly persistent when cornered on a touchy issue. The panelists were, in alphabetical and seating order, Eugene Accas, vice president for network relations of a large advertising agency; Norman Lear, writer‐producer for his own very successful Tandem. Productions; William B. Ray, chief of the complaints and compliance division of the Federal Communications Commission; Thomas J. Swafford, vice president of program practices at CES‐TV, and the Rev. Constantine Volaitis, vice president of Morality in Media, Inc., a self‐appointed watchdog group. The mix was at least promising, But the discussion was generally most interesting as a study in sticking to predictable positions., As Father Volaitis, a Greek Orthodox priest, saw bolder television as the instrument of doomsday—responsible for a “state of animalizatione w”ere everything is falling about us”—Mr. Lear defended the bolder situation comedy as a one‐act play establishing a “rapport between a caring public and a caring group of writers, producers and directors.” Mr. Lear is asso dated with such one‐act plays as “All in the Family,” “Maude,”Sanford and Son” and “Good Times.” Perhaps the most significant remark of the evening was made casually at the Very beginning. Mr. Accas, who conceded he was not overly happy with the bolder themes (”I, don't know where the cutting edge is today”), went on to explain that commercial TV is a “marketing vehicle.” That fact of TV life is frequently stated but still not fully appreciated by the general public. It is astonishing that the most powerful instrument in the powerful spectrum of what is usually labeled “com municatiens” can be considered, with a great deal of accuracy, nothing more than a marketing vehicle. It means; in brief, that the programing serves, as filler for the space between commercials,. those cleverly designed messages selling products, life‐styles and even attitudes. Bolder themes, then, can create problems for the advertiser. The viewer might be‐bored with the blander variety of programing, but he is not likely to be upset or get angry with the sponsor. The primary function of the ad agency is to promote and protect the interests of the sponsor. So when a program comes along with a potential for provoking stiong reactions, the ad agency can go so far as to encourage the sponsor to withdraw support. That is what happened with “Sticks and Bones,” David Rabe's abrasive portrait of an Army veteran returning blind from Vietnam. Mr. Swafford noted, half in Jest, that by the time the program finally was broadcast, even “a couple of public health agencies asked not to be on” the spots vacated bysponsors. The filler of programing does, of course, serve the key, function of attracting a telptive audience for those comis mercial messege and it's conceivable, that all progrant ing could’ be kept at the carefully sanitized, slightly unreal level of a “Father Knows Best” It has not been kept there because producers like Mr. Lear have insisted on tackling more provocative materialand, more important, that material has proved immenselys successful with themass audience. The sponsorship logistics then become fasainating. “All in the Family” might regdlarly deal with such non‐situation comedy topics as bigotry, menopause, breast cancer or impotence, but a sponsor is not likely to withdraiv from his high‐priced spot in the most popular half‐hour on television. When Maude had her famous abortion the first time around, the reaction was minimal. But by the time the program was ready to be rerun, organized protest groups., created enough of a fuss, to make several aponsors nervous CBS was put in a position of antagonizing either the protesters or Mr. Lear. The protesters never had a chance. Mr. Lear is too valuable a property. “Maude” might have suffered a bit for that one showing, but the sponsors were back in full force the following week. ‘Throughout the discussion on “Bolder Themes,” Father Volaitis was adamant, bursting with a statements along the lines of “you tear down gratuitously the moral fabric of life in the society in which we live.” When the proceedings were opened to audience questions, and a member of a homosexual organization asked what TV had planned for more accurate depictions of homosexuals, Father Volaitis advised, “All I can tell you is to get pure.” Mr. Lear thought the priest was being curiously insensitive to “one of God's children.” Father Volaitis explained that homosexuality was a “frightful problem,” and “Bolder Themes in Television” dribbled on to a confused and confusing conclusion. By chance, the discussion took place the same evening and time that the American Broadcasting Company was offering the Joseph Papp production of “Wedding Band,” the Alice Childress play about a 10‐year‐old love affair between a black woman and a white man. Set in a South Carolina seaport town in 1918, the two‐hour presentation was provocative, bold, funny and quite moving. The lack of support from sponsors was glaringly obvious. More significantly, ‘Wedding Band” and other occasional special productions over the last year or two suggest that all of television doesn't have to be, must not be, a marketing vehicle all of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sounds of children roller‐skating and playing ball in the park ‐beside the mansion, the songs of birds and the hum of nearby traffi could all be heard inside the room. Outside, the city was actively ‐enjoying a weekend of good weather. But the Mayor and his wife had been forced to stay indoors, both suffering from the effects of a virus and a cold. Mayor Emma’ was upstairsyin bed, having had a temperature of 102 degrees on Friday. His wife who had been in bed since ‘Tuesday night had gotten up and come downstairs. “I can't wait to get, out again,” she said, putting a Small green handkerchief to her nose. “But’ I hear that this virus is going around, and who are we that we shouldn't get it?” ‘The Time to Relax’ For four months now, Mary Beame has been the First Lady of the City of New York. But the daughter of Abraham and Fannie Ingerman, who was born on the Lower East Side and became a bookkeeper to help support her family, remains a woman without pretensions. She appears comfortable in the role of Mayor's wife but makes it clear that being Mts. Beame is the role that still concerns her most. For example, Mrs. Beame said that she had not wanted her husband to run for Mayor. “At our age [Mr. Beame is 67 years old, Mrs. Beame is “over 601, I felt he shouldn't take on more problems,” she explained. “I thought now was the time to relax, to travel, to do some of the thing.s, that I would like to do.” “We'll see,”. was what’ he always answered, ‘ she said, “'because deep’ down in his heart, he wanted to. And if you can't fight em, you join „rye always risen to his sueiv. The Mayor is persevering abnut eyerything he does. Nobody‐ever worked* harder toward whatever goal he has in mind. But he should learn to play sometimes. It seems that work is his only fun and his enjoyment. There's always some emergency.” 46=15 For Mrs. Beame, apparently, this has been a source of some frustration, and her 46 years of marriage, she said, feel much more like 15 to her because her husband is always working. “I'd love to travel,” Mrs. Beame continued. “And’ I'm so envious of friends who tell me about Rome, Florence, Paris — all those lovely places. But even after a few days at the beach, my husband always says, ‘How can you sit around doing nothing? Let's go back.” Smiling, her dark eyes lighting up, she added that she was hoping that he might now accept some official invitations, such as one they received from Israel's Sephardic Chief Rabbi, to visit in Jerusalem. Mrs. Beame looks forward also to the Mayors’ Conference in San Diego, where she has friends, as something special and exciting. She said she would urge the Mayor to stay on there for “an extra day or two, or three.” Two weeks ago, Mrs. Beame went by herself to stay with friends in Florida. “I had to pinch myself when I was on the plane,” she said. “I couldn't believe that I would go somewhere alone.” They do not go to many plays or movies, she said, because, again, Mr. Beanie is always working. But she insisted that they, see Jane Powell in “Irene,’ and still exclaims about, how much she loved it. The key to a happy marriage, Mrs. Beame said, is “to see the other person's side of living.” “I must be big enough to see his side, his philosophy„,” she said. “Does he see my side? I don't know … I've never asked.” Born the youngest of seven children, Mary Beame recalled that there were times in her marriage when she was very lonely. “I've always made a life for myself,” she reflected, “but if I were ever interested in divorce, I could name New York City as the co‐respondent. I'm so jealous.” Ice Cream Before Bed Since moving into Gracie Mansion from her six‐room apartment in Belle Harbor, ueens, Mrs. Beanie has not had to shop for any toad, and she said she, doesn't miss it. Several cooks have been hired and discharged since Mayor Beame's inauguration, and a new one—who knows how to make blintzes—has just been engaged. The Beames like simple foods—“no sauces, no gravies certainly no cream sauce with meat,” Mrs. Beame said. They still use the same kosher butcher they patronized in Flushing, and the Mayor still likes ice cream—vanilla fudge or coffee—before he goes to bed. He gets up early and rushes through a breakfast of orange juice, Sanka and half a bagel with cream cheese while going over papers by himself in the dinette, a bright room wth green and white wallpaper. Mrs. Beame, who describes herself as “an afternoon person,” sleeps late and has begun, for the first time in her life, having breakfast served to her on a tray in bed—orange juice, Sanka, a slice of bread and some Velveeta cheese. On Monday mornings, Mrs. Beame prepares the week's menu for herself and the Mayor, as well as for the eight other people who now work in the house. ‘Upstairs. Downstairs’ “I am the overseer in the household,” said Mrs. Beame, “and having servants has required a very big adjustment for me. Sometimes, I feel like I'd just like to go down and fix something the way I.like it. And it's difficult to get everyone to get along, with one another. There are so many different personalities. I have to be the mediator. It's a problem.” Enjoying a rare vantage point for identifying with the situation, Mrs. Beame said she loved to watch “Upstairs, Downstairs,” a serialized program on kublic television that explores the relationship between a family and its servants during the Edwardian era in England. She has seen each episode more than once. “But you just don't get that kind of help today,” she said. Pipitsa, Kefalea, the Greek housekeeper who has been with the Beames since January, said that sometimes, on the weekends, when the cook is off, she and the Mayor's wife cooked together in the kitchen. “She teach me. I teach her,” she said, lighting a cigarette. “Mrs. Beame is a plain woman, not a fancy woman. She is a very good person. I like her. She like me.” An outgoing individual who has had to teach herself to spend a lot of time alone, Mrs. Beanie explained that she would follow Mary Lindsay's policy of maintaining Gracie Mansion as a private home, unlike Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who often opened it to public functions. ‘It Doesn't Bother Me’ Mrs. Lindsay often complained of Mayor‐watchers peering at the family, including one woman in Doctors' Hospital across the street who even used binoculars, but Mary Beanie makes no special plea for privacy. “Anything we do, they can see,” she said. “It doesn't bother me.” The Mayor's wife is proud about the work that she has supervised since moving into Gracie Mansion. “I don't think it ever had such warmth or such beautiful furniture,” she said, “and it's not even completed yet. The energy crisis held up deliveries on things that I had ordered. The Lindsays like modern art, but the Beames do not. Mrs. Beanie said she had gone poking with Joan Haber, her decorator, into dusty museum basements to find piCtures that would harmonize with the 176‐year‐old landmark that has now become her home. “None of the pictures in the Brooklyn Museum pleased me,” she said, “and there's picture in the sitting room which has no significance to me either. It's too dark.” She was referring to a landscape called the ‘Alpine Pool by John Singer Sargent. “I'm hoping Mr. Hoving will let me exchange it. He's been very cooperative with us.” The Beames brought some of their own furniture—such as their twin beds and lamps —with them’ to the mansion. But they had to buy new sets of stemware, silverware, dishes and linens. “Can you imagine,” asked Mrs. Beame, “I felt like a newlywed. But I got the dishes wholesale.” Mrs. Beame shops for bargains in clothes as well. “I buy it when I see it,” she said. “Not when I need it.” In her role as Mayor's wife, she has been attending more fashion shows than she ever used to. Mrs. Beame was wearing a blue mid‐knee‐length skirt, a white shell without a collar, and a red jacket with gold buttons and a gold chain belt across the front. Her black patent‐leather shoes had thin crepe soles. “I'm not much of a pantswearer,” said Mrs. Beame, who admits to worrying about her weight. “But I see that people are either wearing pants or long casuals, I'm going to have to go out and get some pants outfits, but feel that when I go into a city car, I should wear a skirt.” Does the Mayor dislike her wearing pants? “No,” she answered, laughing. “Anything that's moral, he doesn't mind.” “Abe Schrader's cut is good for my figure,” she continued, “and I've bought some ultrasuede at Blassport.” At Boltons and Loehmann's, she said, “you can hit it good, especially if you have a saleslady who’ knows you well.” Mrs. Beanie explained how friends of her had gotten bargain prices on things by Molly Parnis or Teal Traina, because a Loehmann's saleswoman would call them up whenever designer clothes came into the store. Although she was born in Manhattan, the city's new First Lady spent all her adult life in other boroughs and misses friends in Queens and Brooklyn with whom she said she was always working on some sort of charitable function, like the Jennie Levine Cancer Research Group, which’ she organized. “And no matter where we are,” said Mrs. Beanie, “we go to spend the Jewish holidays at the Brooklyn Jewish Center. But many of my Brooklyn friends have dispersed. They've moved to Florida. “In Queens,” she added, “we still have many friends.” Just as she was saying that, the doorbell rang. In tame friends from Queens who appeared to be the same age as the Beames. The man carried a package wrapped in aluminum foil that he was bringing, to the Mayor, still upstairs in bed. Mrs. Beame started showing them around the house. She pointed out a large terrarium given to her’ by the Queens Botanical Gardens, and said it was a real mistake to think that plants in bottles didn't need air. She took the cover off. In the sitting room, she stopped to ask for their opinion of the painting by Singer Sargent. “It's too dark here,” she told her friend. “I should change it. Don't you think?” Earlier in the interview, Mrs. Beame, who ‘does not smoke or drink, made it clear she was a traditionalist who keeps an eye on the future. She will not discuss abortion, and is tentative in her opinions of women's and homosexual liberation. She said,. for example, that she did not know too much about the homosexual civilrights bill pending in the City Council, but did not think that she would be opposed to it. Referring to objections that homosexual teachers would be a problem in the classrooms, she countered with the explanation that a child would not be likely to understand the difference, “And I don't hunk that homosexuality would have a bearing on the teaching of the child,” she added. Mrs. Beame whco has two sons, said she was Worried,'however, about the future of a society in which mothers, forsake time with their chilrdren in order to pursue careers. “When my daughter‐in‐law became pregnant, I begged, her to be with her children, at least up to the time they had to go to school,” ‘she said of Rona, the wife of here, son, Bernard. “To be there to, mold character, to give love —to me, that's a very important thing”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women and Their Doctors—The Sad and Cautionary Tales,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/07/archives/women-and-their-doctorsthe-sad-and-cautionary-tales-describes.html,"?? dealt with doctors', patronizing attitudes toward patients. A nurse whose specialty is obstetrics and gynecology, drew laughter when she told about her first visit ‘to a male, gynecologist’ after she became pregnant, with her'first child.’ “I had a very funny feeling when he started patting me on the head,” she recalled. “Then he sat me down and said, ‘Pregnancy, my, ‘dear, is not a disease.!” A’ few ‘of the women had kind things to say about their doctors:” Pamela’ Ohne reported that her gynecologist has a new examination table’ in which the woman's legs hang down rather’ than being unceremoniously up ‘in the air, in stirrups. “You feel much less like a chicken being trussed up,” she said. Sandra Goldstein, a college student, said she regarded herself as “one of the lucky people” because she. had found a gynecologist who is a human being. “At the’ first appointment, she asked nie, ‘Would‐JOU like to be called Mist ‘Goldstein or Sandy?’ “ Miss Goldstein said. “She also asked me if I wanted to be draped or not, and whether I wanted to see my’ cervix or not. My biggest, complaint is that you have to wait a long time because‐she does take a long time consulting. But you, know you'll get your halfhour when you get in there.” In the afternoon session, the women dispersed to various workshops on health care. ‘ At the ‘depression work shop, which was held in the center's recovery room, Barbara Sutter, a clinical psychologist, said that depression was a feminist issue because “women are socialized to blame things on themselves.” “Statistics show depressed females far outnumber males,” she said, “but males are other things, like drug addicts or alcoholics, and this is perhaps related’ to depression.’ Agreement Reached At the workshop on medical consumerism, women were urged to seek more than one medical opinion, especial ly when surgery is indicated. As an example, the women were told of a Mrs. A. B. from Queens, a 46‐year‐old woman who was told she had a tumor the size of a lemon and that she had to have a hysterectomy immediately. However, in visits to two’ other doctors, she learned that she had only, a tiny fibroid tumor, and that a hysterectomy Was not necessary. By the end of the conference, the women seemed to have generally agreed on several things: More women gynecologists are needed (at present, 97 per cent of gynecologists are men), because women gynecologists might be more sympathetic to women's medical problems; women should seek more than one medical opinion, especially when surgery has been recommended; women should not pay for poor medical care; more nurse‐midwives are needed; women should take know‐your‐body courses to dispel “loathsome feelings” about their bodies; medical records should be available patients who want them; and women should not rely ton their gynecologist as their primary physician. Takes a Gloomy View “With the declining birth rate, some gynecologists are pushing to take over as the primary physician,” Mrs. Seaman charged. “They just do not have the training for this, and I urge you to ask them why they think they're qualified to be your main doctor.” Smog of the last words were reserved for two male gynecologists who sat through the entire conference. They were Dr. Edward Stim, an authority on early abortion and former medical director of the Eastern Women's Center; and Dr. Warner Nash, a Manhattan gynecologist and staff member at Lenox Hill Hospital. Dr. Stim was pessimistic about health care in general. “I think it's hopeless,” he said. “So many doctors just don't enjoy what they're doing. They only go to medical school because medicine prnf vides a great sourbe of se, curity. Later on they wind unliving beyond their means. Dr. Nash was optimistie regarding women s health care. “I think things are chan ing,” he saick, “Female enr rollment in niedicalr schools has tripled, ‘an& ntore and more physicians like myself are showing ‐ra 7Woinan ‐ het cervix if she wanta to see it Just being at this preting is a small step the right direction„”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAWMAKERS BALK AT AID TO CON ED,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/08/archives/lawmakers-balk-at-aid-to-con-ed-an-audit-of-utility-is-asked-and.html,"ALBANY, May 7 — A bill that would empower the state to take over two new plants from the Consolidated Edison Company ran into major problems in both houses of the Legislature today, raising the possibility that financial aid to the utility could be delayed until a special session was held later this year. Support for the measure, drafted more than a week ago by Governor Wilson, began drying up among Democrats and among Westchester County‐and upstate Republicans. They began calling for a complete audit of Con Edison's books by a “blue ribbon commission” and for a method of reimbursing localities for millions of dollars in property taxes that would be lost if the state took over the two plants. The Assembly minority leader, Stanley Stemgut of Brook lyn, said in an interview that he wanted independent assurances’ that the utility was in as serious financial difficulty as it has maintained and that it required the $500‐million in state aid proposed by the bill. P.S.C. Official Concerned But one member of the Public Service Commission, Alan J. Roth, expressed concern about such a delay. He said: “If the majority of legislators are not satisfied that there is a need for the dispostion of the assets, then some provision might be written Into the bill to provide for prompt review and findings along these lines by an expert body. But to delay the bill until a special session or later, to assure the need is there, may mean that the necessary relief would come too late.” Mr. Roth declined to speculate on what the consequences of such delay might be. But other P.S.C. sources said that at the least it would mean costly delays in construction projects already under way clelays that could be passed along in higher utility rates for consumers — or even a form of receivership for the company. Nevertheless leaders in both houses of the Legislature were not overly impressed. Early today the four Westchester Republican Senators withdrew their support of the bill, followed by the Westchester Assembly delegation. Loss of Taxes Cited They expressed concern that property taxes of at least $2.1‐million would be lost to Westchester if Con Edison's Indian Point No. 3 nuclear plant was sold to the Power Authority of the State of New York. And New York City Democrats expressed their concern that $7.8‐million in taxes would be lost to the city by a state take‐over of the Astoria No. 6 oil‐fired generating plant. Late today the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, began a series of meetings with Governor Wilson in an effort to resolve these difficulties. Shortly before this meeting began at 3:39 P.M., Joe Cornell, the Senate's assistant journal clerk, opened the door on the towering mahogany grandfather clock at the corner of the ornate Senate chamber, walked inside, turned a switch and “stopped the clock,” both a real and symbolic indication that the 1974 legislative session was nearing an end. What this means is that any new bills not now alive on the Senate floor calendar will require “messages of necessity” from the Governor before they may be acted on—effectively limiting the number of new issues that can be debated before adjournment. In other action in the Capitol today, the following took place: HOUSING POLICE A bill to give New York City Housing Police authority to set up their own precincts and booking headquarters in each borough, instead of relying on the city's Police Department facilities, won final legislative approval in the Senate and was sent to the Governor. ABORTION The Senate approved overwhelmingly a measure that would require any hospital, clinic or group receiving state funds and engaging in abortion counseling to distribute, “at the time of giving such counseling, information regarding alternatives to abortion.” CREEDMOOR The Assembly gave final approval to a bill that would convey to the City of New York 52 acres of surplus state land in the vicinity of Creedmoor State Hospital for use as a tree farm. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE With some Democrats arguing that the measure was only a timid step toward complete financial disclosure, the Assembly passed a bill that would require all political candidates for state office to disclose all of their holdings in state‐regulated industries 45 days before a primary election — or if they were not primary candidates, 45 days before the general election. PUBLIC SALARIES The Assembly voted to increase the salaries of public administrators in the City of New York from the present $25,000 to $34,800 a year: THE BLIND The Assembly voted to prohibit discrimination by operators of nursing homes, convalescent homes and intermediate care facilities against persons solely because they are blind. ETHNIC QUESTIONS The Assembly voted to prohibit the Civil Service Commission and New York City's Department of Personnel from requesting information from job applicants regarding their age, race, creed, color or national origin. While the bill was said to be designed to eliminate certain surveys and questionnaires that might infringe on the rights of job applicants, black and Puerto Rican legislators said that it would prevent studies to determine if minority‐group persons were taking and passing Civil Service examinations. SCHOOL BOARD VOTE The Senate voted to restructure the voting in Community school‐board elections in New York city—transferring responsibility for the elections to the city's Board off Elections and creating a four‐member bipartisan panel within the board, appointed by, the full board, to oversee the voting. DRUG PROGRAMS The Senate voted to require that methadone‐clinic sites be reviewed by the Public Health Council before certification by the Commissioner of Health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 WOMEN IN LISBON WIN RIGHTS CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/08/archives/3-women-in-lisbon-win-rights-case-their-book-not-offensive-to.html,"LISBON, May 7 — Three women writers were acquitted by a Lisbon court today of having offended public morals with book attacking the repression of women's rights in Portugal. Maria Teresa Horta, Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Yelho da Costa immediately announced that with the new freedom established in Portugal after the military coup. April 25, they would start a women's liberation movement with the priority aim of legalizing abortion. The case evoked an international protest among champions of women's rights last year after “The Three Marias” were charged with having written pornographic book, “The New Portuguese Letters.” In letters, essays and poetry, the women had described the inferior sexual and social position of women in this male‐dominated society. The trial began in October and, at the rate of about one hearing a week, it continued until now. The book, seized after 3,000 copies, had been printed, caused little stir in Portugal, partly because press censorship under the former regime prevented wide publicity. But the case had been a cause of international embarrassment and consequently shortly before, the coup, the Government prosecutor had moved to dismiss the charges. Judge Artur Lopes Cardoso was believed to have been prepared to do so before the revolution, but had postponed his verdict to give himself more time to study the evidence. Today's decision was made even more inevitable by the climate, Of greater civil liberties and political change since the downfall of the old regime. Today Judge Cardoso agreed with the defense that the book was a work of literary merit. Miss Horta and Miss Barreno said that with the new freedom to gather and express ideas, they would start a women's movement. “Today's decision is only the beginning,” Miss Barreno said. The women in the small, crowded courtroom hailed the judge's decision by introducing a small but significant variation into what has become the universal chant of the revolution. For days people have been shouting in unison, “A united people shall never be, vanquished.” In the courtroom today the chant was “United women shall never be vanquished.” Miss Barreno, speaking of plans to get abortion legalized, said thousands of woken were resorting to it clandestinely, “under deplorable conditions.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accord Is Reported; On a 5% OTB Tax,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/10/archives/accord-is-reported-on-a-5-otb-tax-accord-reported-on-a-5-otb-tax.html,"ALBANY, May 9—Agreement has been reached to impose a 5 per cent surcharge on the winners’ pool at offtrack betting parlors, thus Paving the way for final approval of New York City's fiscal package, sources close to the negotiations reported to The agreement makes imposition of the surcharge optional for New York City, but if the. City Council adopts the Measure it would become Mandatory for offtrack betting operations lo other parts of the state. The surcharge is expected lo provide 330‐Million for NeW York City to help close an $818‐million gap in the budget for the coining fiscal year. The measure provides that where a race track is in a municipality other than New York City, the 5 per cent surcharge would be split between the city and the locality. In the case of Belmont ‘Raceway, it is expected to yield about $6‐million a year to Nassau County. Other municipalities that have on, such as Syracuse, would benefit in the same manner as would New York City. The amendment reads that “if and only if, any such city, having a population of more than one million [the, city of New York] adopts the local law … every other regional offtrack betting corporation or offtrack, betting operator authorized to conduct offtrack betting in this state shall, within 60 days of such adoption, also collect … the surcharge described …” Mayor Beame has been adamant in calling for the surcharge to be placed on the winnings rather than have the bettor put up $2.10 on a $2 bet and thus be reminded of the tax each time he approached the betting window. Lack of agreement between the Governor and the Mayor on where the surcharge would be imposed has held up approval of a measure authorizing the city to borrow $520‐million to help close the remaining portion of the, budget gap. Assembly Minority Leader Stanley Steingut offered the amendments shortly after 10 P.M. They also include a provision that the surcharge will remain in effect only until July 1, 1977. Other actions here today included the following: LEGAL ADVERTISING The Assembly approved bill to increase by about 25 per cent the rates state and local governments pay for public notices and legal advertising in local newspapers. ABORTION The Assembly debited and then recommitted a bill that would deprive a woman who underwent an abortion the right to her child if it were born alive and lived. The measure would also require that a second physician be in attendance if the abortion were performed after the’ 20th week of pregnancy and that it be performed in a hospital after the 12th week. Opponents of the‐measure argued that it was punitive, that it would increase the cost of abortions and that it would drive down the number of women submitting to legal abortions. TAYLOR LAW Governor Wilson has submitted to the Legislature a bill revising the procedure under the Taylor Law governing public employes for the resolution of impasses in collective negotiations where the report and recommendations of a factfinder do not result in an agreement. The Public Employment Relations Board would be empowered under the bill to hear the reasons why agreement had not been reached and attempt to mollify both sides before taking the matter to a legislative body. TEACHER TENURE A bill to reduce from five years to three the probationary period before teachers can re ceive tenure passed the Assem bly unanimously. The bill makes good on a promise Governor Wilson made to a teachers’ convention in Montreal in March. “The issue here isn't tenure for teachers, it is tenure for the Governor,” said Assemblyman John J. LaFalce, Democrat of Kenmore. MEDICAL PAYMENT The Assembly gave final passage to a bill ending the requirement that medically needy people who are not on welfare pay 20 per cent of their doctor bills. The state Medicaid program would now pay all bills, with the patient paying only nominal semi‐annual enrollment fee, if the Governor sigat the bill into law. FIREARMS CONTROL The Assembly late today gave final approval to a measure increasing the’ penalty for anyone using a loaded gun against someone else in the commission of a crime and made provision fora mandatory sentence anyone so convicted.

DAY CARE Democratic leaders and Mayor Beanie called for an appropriation of $15‐million for daycare programi in the state to maintain programs at their current levels. About $10‐million of the money, it appropriated, would go to New York City and would ease the impact of Federal fund limitations on the programs. The amount is similar to an emergency appropriation made last year and was said to be needed to keep programs operating and avoid making some working mothers go back on welfare. CHILD WELFARE The Assembly gave final approval to a measure appropriating $100,000 to a temporary state commission on child welfare to study and assess the effects of recent legislative, judicial and administrative decisions affecting children. PEACE OFFICER The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill granting peace‐officer status to motor‐vehicle Inspectors, enabling them to make arrests and carry a gun while investigating stolen‐car cases: ENERGY POWER The Senate gave final passage to a bill that would give Governor Wilson the power to order any electric or gas utility in the state to “discontinue or limit any activity which may encourage increased consumption of its services.” Its sponsors said this would give the Governor power chiefly over advertising, but others noted that it could also allow him to re‐examine the entire rate structure of the utilities, particularly with regard to bulk or promotional rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Illinois Impeachment Unit Asks Court to Reverse Ban on Its Ads,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/12/archives/illinois-impeachment-unit-asks-court-to-reverse-ban-on-its-ads.html,"CHICAGO, May 11—The Illinois Impeach Nixon Committee asked the United States Supreme Court yesterday to reverse a decision that permits a ban on advertisements callsing for the impeachment of President Nixon. The ban was imposed by the Chicago Transit Authority. The committee, which it has 167 chapters, sued the C.T.A. here after Thomas Buck, director of public affairs for the authority, refused to post impeach Nixon advertisements on trains and buses and at stations. Mrs. Lynne Heidt, coordinator of the committee, said that Mr. Buck had given no reason for turning down the paid advertisements. Mr. Buck said the decision He pointed out that the authority routinely accepts political campaign ads but rejects abortion ads. “We feel we have a right to accept or reject advertisements without a reason,” he said. On March 1, United States District Court Judge Thomas R. McMillen upheld the advertising ban and ruled that the authority could legally refuse ads of a partisan nature. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed Judge McMillen's ruling by a 2‐to‐1 decision. United States Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger stayed the appellate court ruling until the full Supreme Court could hear the case. Yesterday's move in court was a request to upset Justice Burger's order. Mrs. Sybille Fritzsche, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, here, which is representing the Impeach Nixon Committee and its coordinator, Mrs. Heidt, said the issue was simply a matter of free speech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disputed Measure On Abortion Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/12/archives/disputed-measure-on-abortion-advances-forcing-the-hands.html,"three months of pregnancy. Despite the ruling, opponents of abortions have continued their campaign to stop them from being performed in New Jersey. Their latest move is to attempt to bar the use of state or Federal funds for any such operation. Earlier this year, the state's Department of Health formulated a series of regulations governing abortions. The proposed rules were the subject of a stormy public hearing here earlier in May. The Merlino bill was approved, 3 to 1, by the Senate's Committee on Institutions, Health and Welfare. The lone dissenter was Senator Alexander J. Menza, Democrat of Union County. “This bill says, in effect, that abortions can be obtained only by the rich and the middle classes who can afford them,” Senator Menza declared. “This Legislature is deliberately moving a series of bills that will effectively do away with a woman's right to an abortion. It's just another attempt to erode the Supreme Court's decision, and it's wrong.” Measure Called Biased A female spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union contended that the Merlino measure was “discriminatory” and would deny poor women a chance of obtaining an abortion. The spokesman, Mrs. Dorothy Schoenwald, also said that similar efforts in Utah and New York State to prohibit the use of public funds for abortions had been struck down by the courts. Senator Anthony Scardino, Democrat of Bergen County, denied that the intent of the bill was to prevent poor women from obtaining an abortion.” “No one is denying them anything,” he said. “They still have their right to have an abortion.” However, Senator Menza asked the committee: “How can a woman on welfare—a woman with several children and trying to live on $4,000 a year—how can she afford to get an abortion?” But Senator Scardino interjected: “I'll ask another question. How did she get pregnant in the first place?” Senator Merlino contended that the Attorney General's ruling of last November was not clear and that the nhrase",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Italians Voting to Keep or Ban Divorce,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/13/archives/italians-voting-to-keep-or-ban-divorce-womens-ballots-seen-as.html,"ROME, May 12—Italians turned out in strength today to vote during the first day of two‐day referendum on divorce that women will probably decide. Among the nation's 37.5‐million enfranchised citizens, women exceed men by 1,715‐000. This margin is so wide that the votes or women will probably determine the outcome of what is expected to be a close contest on whether to repeal the three‐year‐old divorce law. Pope Paul VI, who had voiced “deep grief” when divorce was introduced in Italy in 1970, said today that he would not break his official silence on the issue. But he exhorted a crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon today to pray to the Virgin Mary “for the well‐being of the family.” This was understood as veiled plea, especially to women who revere the Virgin Mary, to vote against the divorce law. ‘Yes’ Means No Divorce Voters in the nearly 70,000 polling stations—mostly schools —were given pencils and ballots carrying the words “yes” and “no.” Voters in favor of repealing the law, were instructed to check the “yes,” and those wanting to keep the legislation in force were told to vote “no.” This complication is based on legal technicalities and produced much confusion. In a high school on Rome's eastern outskirts a white‐haired woman spent a long time in the voting booth and eventually stuck her head out to ask an official, “Are you sure you have to cross the ‘no’ when you are for divorce?” There was laughter and the bewildered voter was assured that this was the correct way to express her opinion. Voting took place from A.M. to 10 P.M. in generally good weather today and will resume at 7 A.M. tomorrow. The polls will close at 2 P.M. tomorrow, and the outcome should be known about eight hours later. Far‐reaching political consequences are expected from the vote, whichever way it goes. If one camp wins by a large majority, which is considered unlikely, the ensuing tensions could quickly lead to the fall of the Government, which Premier Mariano Rumor formed only eight weeks ago. Passage Was Delayed The campaign for the referendum has paralyzed much Government activity during the last two months while Italy was beset by runaway inflation and other ills. Fundamentally, the divorce battle is another attempt at defining relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the Italian state, ‘a problem that has continued since this nation was unified more than a century ago. Women's Ballots Seen as Decisive in a Close Contest on Repeal Tenacious opposition by the church delayed Parliament's passage of the divorce law until November, 1970. The law permitted divorce for the first time since Italy was unified. Earlier, divorce had been permitted briefly in parts of what is now Italy under the rule of Napoleon. Soon after the bill became law, a group of conservative Roman Catholics started collecting signatures on petitions to repeal the statute. More than 1.3‐million enfranchised Italians signed. Under the Constitution, 500,000 signatures are required to make mandatory a referendum on repeal of a law. This referendum is the first nationwide “yes‐no” vote since Italians voted out the monarchy by a slim margin in 1946. Only a few countries, including Spain, Argentina and Colombia, still outlaw divorce. 66,000 Divorces Granted Italy's law provides that judge can terminate a marriage if one party has been sentenced for a grave crime or if the couple has been living apart in a legal or de facto separation for five to seven years, according to circumstances. So far, 66,000 divorce decrees have been granted in this nation of 55 million people, and the number of new petitions has fallen off in the last two years. These statistics seem to challenge a main argument of the antidivorce forces—that the law threatens to disrupt the family, which in Italy more than in most places is regarded as the bedrock of society. Those favoring repeal have also denounced divorce as step toward permissiveness heralding sexual promiscuity, legalized abortion and pornography. Predictions Difficult Predictions of the referendum's outcome are difficult because the issue cuts across traditional alignments and splits, the coalition Government. The’ Christian Democratic party, Italy's strongest, is against divorce, as are the neo‐Fascists. The three other parties supporting the Rumor Cabinet—Socialists, Social Democrats and Republicans‐,‐‐are for the divorce law, as'lare the Communists and the Liberal party, a conservative groul). The Christian Democrats do, not agree on most issues with the neo‐Fascist Italian Social, Movement — National Right Wing and have seemed to ignore their support in the divorce battle. The neo‐Fascist party and some rightist Christian Democrats found common ground, however, in depicting the drive for repeal of the divorce law as an anti‐Communist crusade. In the last parliamentary elections two years ago, the parties that now favor the divorce law had a slight edge over the antidivorce parties. The church hierachy firmly advised Catholics to vote against the divorce law. Yet hundreds of dissident priests and laymen publicly condemned the church's stand as ecclesiastical interference in state affairs. Advice During Mass In thousands of churches throughout Italy today priests told their congregations during mass to “vote yes, yes for healthy family,” or asked in other terms for a vote against divorce. Most of Italy's leading newspapers—including Corriere della Sera and Il Glom° of Milan and La Stampa of Turin—are defending the divorce law. II Messaggero of Rome came out today—after its editorial staff suspended a three‐day strike—to urge its readers to vote for the divorce law. The promoters of the referendum clearly hope that even women who normally back leftist parties will vote for repeal. The antidivorce forces appear confident of the backing of the many “white widows” in southern Italy, women left behind by the nearly two million men who have gone elsewhere in Western. Europe to escape poverty at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

South Africa's Objectives,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/14/archives/south-africas-objectives.html,"PRETORIA, South Africa—The Republic of South Africa is a microcosm of the world's ethnic and political complexities. Since South Africa is an imperfect society and since no policy applied to a complex situation anywhere in the world is perfect, we expect and appreciate well‐founded criticism of the way in which we have set about restructuring our society. However, the vehement criticism in some United States newspapers and in political circles about developments in South Africa is too often unfounded. The lack of perspective and balance is so striking, and so persistent, that I. am sometimes inclined to attribute this state of affairs to intellectual, dishonesty rather than, ignorance. If these politicians and news commentators have not allowed themselves to be taken in by the empty rhetoric and double standards practiced in the United Nations, then their criticism’ of the broad pattern of development in South. Africa can only rest on a false premise; This premise is’ that while South Africa is inhabited by a majority of black people (aborigines), they’ are dominated economically and politically by a minority conglomeration of white settlers (latecomers) whose main objective is to stay in power while retaining the black people as’ source of cheap labor. In the eyes of these commentators, the solution to this state of affairs in South Africa lies in a speedy social and political integration of all the races, and the only real obstacle is the white people's craving for power. I have encountered this premise in almost every critical analysis of South African affairs in United States newspapers. But anyone who bases his argument on this premise with the facts at hand is being intellectually dishonest. Consider the following: South Africa is not inhabited by homogeneous black society with common loyalty, language, history or culture. Instead, the black people consist of disparate ethnic communities, different nations, with a recent history of internecine tribal warfare. As for “white settlers,” considering that Dutch pioneers began farming in South Africa just a few years after the Mayflower reached America and that even the language of the majority of the white people evolved in Africa, not in Europe, then any continued reference to “white colonists” is dishonest. The white South Africans are as much an identifiable African nation as the French or the Germans are European nations, and as a nation the whites are numerically stronger than any of the black nations in South Africa except the Zulu nation. Neither the black nations nor the white nation have a prior claim to all of South Africa except to those territories that they settled by right of first occupation. The reason these different nations find themselves within one border is a direct result of Brit ain's nineteenth‐century colonial conquest of the subcontinent of Africa. These considerations are at the root of South Africa's problem. With disparate nations living in one state there is a strong possibility of a clash of nationalisms if the distinctive political needs of these nations are not satisfied. What we propose to do about this multinational situation is piecisely what the world has ordered for itself in the last thirty years: sovereign states for each different nation. In 1945, there were only some 50 independent nations. Today there are 135. In southern Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth century there was only British South Africa. But take a look at the map of today. Now there are seven independent countries, and when our policy, is fully carried out there will probably be 14. And the elected parliament of one black nation in South Africa, the Xhosa, in March voted a resolution to prepare for independence within five years, a development that United States commentators might as well get used to. The basic objectives of our policy include self‐determination for the various nations in South Africa, protection of the identity of all ethnic groups and the elimination of domination of one people over others. This is a totally different picture from the one accepted by so many United States commentators. One can, therefore, argue lbout the carrying out of our policy but one can hardly question, our motives or the objectives of our policy. A rejection of our objectives is also an act of intellectual dishonesty, for those very objectives were readily accepted at the time the various black peoples of Africa were striving for independence from Britain, France and Belgium. This transition from a single South Africa state consisting of black nations and a white nation into a bloc of politically independent states, economically interdependent, is taking place systematically and peacefully. There is none of the violence that accompanied the abortion of Biafra or the birth of Bangladesh. May it continue to serve as a reminder to those Americans who two and three decades ago predicted the imminent violent death of South Africa by racial conflict. Their predictions failed and of the 120 wars, revolutions and coups d'6tat that have convulsed the world in that time, none have touched South Africa. It is high time more realism is shown in the evaluation of South African affairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Woman's Appeal Terms Police Surveillance Illegal,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/15/archives/womans-appeal-terms-police-surveillance-illegal-rights-held.html,"HACKENSACK, May 14 — A 39‐year‐old woman twice convicted of interfering with plainclothes state policeman taking pictures of a women'srights group in the Stae House in Trenton appealed her case to the Appellate Division of the State Superior Court today on the ground that the trooper's “surveillance” violated the First and 14th Amendments of the Constitution. Lawyers for the woman, Martha Buck of Montclair, contended ‘that the trooper, Sgt. John Majarawitz, was engaged in unlawful conduct when he took pictures of about 20 women gathered in the second‐flor hallways outside of the State Assembly gallery while the legislators debated an anti, abortion resolution the group’ opposed. The state police sergeant's, “photographic surveillance” of the women's‐rights delegation had a “chilling effect” in violation of their constitutional rights of lawful assembly and peaceful political activity, according to Frank Askin, of the Rutgers. Law School's Constitutional Litigation Clinic, who represented Miss Buck. The three‐member appellate court, consisting of Judges Joseph Halpern, Robert Matthews and William J. Bischoff, heard brief oral arguments in the Bergen County Courthouse here after having received opposing briefs from Mr. Askin and the State Attorney General's office. Miss Buck was arrested on the night of April 30, 1973, while a member of a statewide, delegation of women who had gone to Trenton to discuss the women's rights issues with their legislators. About midnight, after the group was ordered out of the Assembly gallery because of its alleged noisiness, Miss Buck, a field representative of the state's Division on Civil Rights then protested against the pip ture‐taking by Sergeant Majarwitz and grabbed for his camera strap. Testimony by the state police and by members of the women's group is contradictory, but Miss, Buck and several of her as sociates said that Sergeant Majarwitz, who was not in uniform at that time, first represented himself as news photographer but later gave his pictures to a fellow officer. Miss Buck had been found guilty not of resisting arrest in the State House incident but of obstructing and interfering with, “persons lawfully therein.” She was convicted first in Trenton Municipal Court and fined $75. and then, after a new again found guilty in Mercer County Court. While not disputing that Miss, Buck grabbed a strap of Ser‐geant Majarwitz's camera, her lawyer argued that the charge against her was invalid because of the sergeant's “unlawful” activity. Rights Held Violated The photographic surveillance of the “peaceful” group violated their constitutional guarantees, Mr. Askin stated, and he continued as follows “The New Jersey Supreme Court has recognized that the police surveillance power is not unlimited. It must be shown that the information to be gathered can be reasonably be lieved to be necessary to the performance of policeroles detectional and preventive. Neither of these objectives was satisfied by the photographing of the women who came to petition their legislators on April 30, 1973.” In contrast, Daniel J. Fitz patrick Jr., deputy attorney general in the state's Division. If Criminal Justice, argued that the women's behavior was “disuptive” in the Assembly galery, and that they continued their “noisy disturbance,” which grew “progressively worse,” in the hallway outside. “Clearly,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said on behalf of the state, “the aforementioned facts, supported by the record, correctly characterize Sergeant Maiarwitz's conduct as a reasonable exercise of his police function to prevent and detect unlawful conduct, not that of a ‘spy,’ which defendant maintains.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ecology Groups Offer Ratings Of Legislators’ Vote Records;,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/ecology-groups-offer-ratings-of-legislators-vote-records-similar.html,"LOS ANGELES, May 15 — A blizzard of charts as big as small tablecloths is signaling the start of environmental activists nationwide efforts to influence 1974 election contests. A relatively new device in environmental campaigning, the charts set forth the voting records of Congressional and state legislators on selected ecological issues and rank them, usually on a point system. The pattern setters in the movement are charts formulate ed by the Washinton‐based League of Conservation Voters. One just issued rates the 435 members of the House of Representatives on 19 measures, presenting, with some supplementary data, about 10,000 items of information. Four feet long and two feet wide, the chart approaches the height of the league's diminutive head, Marion Edey. Similar charts will rate Senators performances and those of key come mittees. The nonpartisan league's initial printing of its House chart was 15,000 copies and it expects to print at least 20,000 more. Raising Funds A secondary function of the charts is to raise campaign unds. The league's charts cost Si. Some of the charts on states run as high as $3. The league began its rankngs in the 1972 election. This year, league affiliates in California and a number of other states are producing state legislative versions. In 1972, evironmental issues figured importantly in about 60 Congressional and governorship victories. The league distributed $61,300 among 13 candidates, seven of whom won. It has not yet selected the candidates it will support this year. The league's steering com mittee for its chart operation includes representatives of two major conservation organizations, the Sierra Club and the Friends of the Earth. Another charting operation is that of the Washington‐based Environmental Action, which concentrates in each election on advocating the defeat of 12 House members it brands “the dirty dozen.” They were selected this year on the basis of their votes on 16 environmental issues, in combination with an estimate of those most vulnerable electorally. In the last two national elecions, half of the organization's “dirty dozen” designees were lefeated. The 19 Congressional votes selected as criteria by the League of Conservation Voters Included proposals relating to the Alaska pipeline, atomic power, mass transit, abortion, pesticides and support of the United Nations Environment Fund. On a scale of 100, House Democrats averaged a score of 55, House Republicans 28. Hawaii's delegation was the highest with an average of 90, and Mississippi's lowest, with 6. The New York delegation averaged 60. Eight House members, all Democrats, received ratings of 100. They were Representatives Bella S. Abzug, Edward I. Koch and Benjamin S. Rosenthal of New York, Ronald V. Dellums and Edward Roybal of California, Robert F. Drinan of Massachusetts, Robert W. Kastenmeier of Wisconsin and Andrew Young of Georgia. Twenty House members had scores of zero. Similar Yardstick Environmental Action's yardstick of 16 selected key votes was similar to the league's. The organization's “dirty dozen” consists of Representatives Dale Milford of Texas and Ffank A. Stubblefield of Kentucky, both Democrats; and 10 epublicans: Earl F. Landgrebe, William H. Hudnut and Roger H. Zion of Indiana, Burt L. Talcott and Robert B. Mathias of California, John E. Hunt of New Jersey, Glenn R. Davis of Wisconsin, Samuel L. Devine of Ohio, William J. Scherle of Iowa and Sam Steiger of Arizona. Representatives Landgrebe, Devine and Zion were repeat designees from the 1972 list who nevertheless won re election. The environmentalists basic strategy is to focus on races in which their influence may swing the outcome. In this way, Gov. Don Samuelson of Idaho, a Republican, was defeated in 1970, and Representative Wayne Aspinall, Colorado Democrat and long the powerful chairman of the House Interior Committee, was eliminated in the 1972 primary. George Wagner, president of the California League of Conservation Voters, noted that four state legislators backed by the league in 1972 last year had environmental voting records of between 91 and 100 points. “We went to bat for them, and for the most part they came through for us,” he said, “We think it's an illustration that ordinary citizens working with and contributing to an organization such as the California League can be a political force.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"LAWMAKERS VCIT ABORTION CURBS,",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/lawmakers-vote-abortion-curbs-hospital-care-and-a-second-doctor.html,"ALBANY, May 15—A bill that would restrict the state's fouryeat‐old abortion law received final passage in the Senate this evening after it was revived and approved in the Assembly with what Conservative party officials called the “very active” help of Governor Wilson. The vote in the Senate was 43 to 13. The measure would require, that the abortion of a fetus beyond the 12th week take place in a hospital and that a second physician be present at abortions involving fetuses 20 weeks or older, to attend to the survival of any that might be born alive. The opposition; led by the Senate's three women members, contended that the bill was oriented more toward election‐year publicity than health care and that it was unconstitutional and unnecessary. Proponents insisted it was needed to prevent the taking of life after live births in abortion operations. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Harold X. Grune, Republican‐Conservative of Stony Point, LI., was debated in the Assembly last week and withdrawn in the face of opposi:tion. Last night… however, with the Republican leadership in firm control of the closing agenda, it appeared in, amended form and was passed 81 to 31. in an interview, Serph Maltese, the State COnservative party's secretary, said that the measure had been revived in the final hours with the Governor's “very active” support after the Conservatives had put it: forth as a priority item. The Governor's office said that he would stand by his policy of not commenting on pending legislation. Mr. Maltese said that in recent weeks Conservatives, who can offer a second line on the ballot to Mr. Wilson, had been asking “a lot of questions about; the Governor” and his dedica tion to their principles. “I'm pleased to see he's mak ing some positive moves,” Mr. Maltese said. The Governor, a Roman Catholic who is opposed to abortion, has limited his comments since taking office last:,'December to noting that the United States Supreme Court has spoken on the issue by restricting the states rights to legislate against abortion. In the Senate debate, Senator Mary Anne Krupsak Democrat of Canajoharie, said the issue had been raised to score debating points with the electorate. “The tragedy of this piece of legislation is that it is a piece of public relations,”, she declared. The measure was defended by Richard E. Schertnerhorn. Republican ‐ Conservative of Cornwall, who said: “The purpose of this bill, is to protect the life of children:” “It's not a fetus” after it's horn,” he said of a 20‐week live birth. “If it. is, that's all we are.” Carol Bellamy, Brooklyn Democrat, noted that proponents had offered no documentation that a 20‐week live birth had ever been killed by a physician, and she noted that the State Medical Society opposed the bill. Frank Padavan, Republican‐Conservative of Queens Village, Queens countered by demanding evidence that existing abortion facilities had ever saved the life of a fetus born alive. An Unsuccessful amendment strongly endorsed by the three women Senators as a chance io protect the lives of women undergoing abortion would have mandated either clinic or hospital care in abortions beyand the 12th week. The clinic option was needed, they said, because it would perMit a good operation at less cost than at a hospital. A second physician at a 20‐week abortion should not be mandated, Senator Krupsak added, because that already is the policy of accredited hospitals and specifying it in taw would, she contended, permit double‐billing of patients. Senator H. Donovan, Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks, said he had received letter from a woman who said she was a nurse and had witnessed the killing by a physician of a viable 20‐week fetus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FLAHERTY BACKED IN PENNSYLVANIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/17/archives/flaherty-backed-in-pennsylvania-mayor-of-pittsburgh-seen-ahead-of.html,"HARRISBURG, Pa., May 16 — Just as Herbert S. Denenberg began his speech here last night to more than 800 Dauphin County Democrats, squad of red‐coated waiters began clearing the tables. Their heavy‐handed efficiency was exceeded only by the noise of their work, and Mr. Denenberg's remarks were lost in the clatter of 5,000 pieces of silver, crystal and china. When Peter J. Flaherty approached the same lectern a few minutes later, the waiters had all disappeared and the acoustics of the Penn‐Harris Motor Inn's ballrom had notice ably improved. It was a mere coincidence, but it was also rather strikingly symbolic of the campaigns waged by both men for the Democratic nomination to the United States Senate. Somehow, things are just working better for Mr. Flaherty, the boyish‐faced Mayor of Pittsburgh, who appears to be the favorite in the primary election next Tuesday. He has the tacit endorsement of Gov. Milton 3. Shapp, candidate for re‐election, the labor groups in the state and the support of his party's organizational and financial machinery. Problems for Denenberg In contrast, Mr. Denenberg, the former State Insurance Commissioner and university professor, has had problems with his staff, problems with money and problems with his image as a nonconformist better known outside the state than in. “And whoever wins the nomination is going to have problems in the fall,” predicted Richard Simons, a Harrisburg businessman and long‐time Democrat who regards the Republican incumbent, Senator Richard S. Schweiker, as a perhaps unbeatable fall opponent. Senator Schweiker is unop posed on the G.O.P. primary ballot and is seen by many in Pennsylvania as one of the few Republican, incumbents in the country relatively unscathed by the Watergate scandals. He has seldom voted with the Nixon Administration, he was on the list of “enemies” prepared in the White House and last week he asked the President to resign. Moreover, the Senator has been promised organized labor's support in the general election, a decision, according to union spokesmen, based on his “impeccable record” during his first Senate term. For the time being, however, labor's imprimatur is on Mr. Flaherty — just one of several organizational endorsements he has traditionally flaunted in his rise from assistant district attorney to the Pittsburgh Mayor's chair. Cause for Nervousness Referring to endorsements, the Mayor said in an interview at the start of his campaign: “I'm not asking for any. The only endorsements I want are the endorsements of people.” Mr. Denenberg, who was appointed insurance commissioner by Governor Shapp at the recommendation of Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, expressed the same sentiments, and the Democratic contest was touted as a race between two populist mavericks. It quickly became apparent, however, that Governor Shapp would play an important role in the Senate primary. In his first term, he had opposed the reinstitution of the death penalty, vetoed an antipornography bill and helped; maintain the legality of abortion in the state. “Those are the wrong sides of those issues, politically speaking,” an aide to the Governor said last night, “and don't think he isn't nervous.” The Governor, who is Jewish, was also said to be apprehensive about anti‐Semitic sentiments in Pennsylvania's urban areas. “So, it's easy to figure,” the aide explained. “If you can run for Governor on the same ticket with Pete Flaherty— an Irish Catholic from the western part of the state who has come down hard on smut and abortion and who sort of likes capital punishment—wouldn't you prefer that to Herb, just another Jewish liberal?” The Governor's answer was apparently in the affirmative. Since the campaign began, the word has come down from the state capital here to country chairmen and city leaders all over Pennsylvania that Mr. Flaherty is the man. Mr. Shapp, meanwhile, is expected to win renomination easily. He will probably face Drew Lewis, a wealthy Republican, in the November election. In the Senate race, Mr. Denenberg, who resigned his state, job to run, has criticized Mayor Flaherty for not stepping down from his, and for being the “covertly chosen” beneficiary of machine support in what was ostensibly an “open” primary. But many voters have had difficulty pinpointing any central issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alabama Curb on Abortions Is Ruled Unconstitutional,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/18/archives/alabama-curb-on-abortions-is-ruled-unconstitutional.html,"MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 17 (UPI) — Supernumerary Circuit Judge Frank Embry today struck down the Alabama anti‐abortion statute as unconstitutional. The Montgomery County District Attorney, James Evans, said he would file an appeal “forthwith” and would ask the legislature to pass a new law if the old statute was overturned. Judge Embry ruled in the case of Mrs. Faye Wilkerson, 52 years old, who was charged with performing an illegal abortion. Mrs. Wilkerson's attorneys argued that the 1911 state law was unconstitutionally vague. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a state cannot interfere with a woman's right to have an abor tion during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy and may impose only limited restrictions after that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Governor Signs Measure To Restore Death Penalty,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/18/archives/governor-signs-measure-to-restore-death-penalty-governor-signs-bill.html,"ALBANY, May 17—A limited death penalty was restored today by Governor Wilson, who found “sufficient benefit” to mandate it for the murderers of policemen and prison workers, and in murders committed by life‐term prisoners. In a news conference studded with references to moral issues, the Governor announced the signing of the capital‐punishment bill, saying that it appeared to be constitutional, and also made his first criticism of President Nixon on the Watergate scandal, The Governor said he was “deeply distressed” by the moral tone disclosed in the excerpts from Presidential conversations at the White Hetise. However, he added that it would be “mobocracy” to try to “shout the president into resignation,” and that the constitutional processes under way should be accelerated to end the problem and the “stagnation of government” it had caused. The Governor also said that he would sign into law the rent‐control bill passed by the Legislature In the closing hours of its session, although, he added, “it is not the bill I want.” He said he would try to persuade the legislators to modify it at the special session beginning May 29. Assessing the 18‐week session of the Legislature that ended yesterday morning, Mr. Wilson said he was generally pleased. Asked whether it might have been better if he had showed more of the “muscle” attributed to former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, Mr. Wilson replied by praising “my gifted predecessor,” but said of his own scorecard for the session: “I think it has been unparalleled, and I'll take the period of the last 25 years.” The Governor also announced the signing of legislation to permit the State Power Authority to purchase two Consolidated Edison Company plants, so as to provide $500‐million in assistance to the utility. He also signed the bill authorizing New York City to raise its sales tax by one percentage, point. The Governor, who must run for full term this year, emphasized that the idea had originated at City Hall.

On the latter topic, the Governor was asked whether he felt any moral clash between his own opposition to abortion and his signing of the death penalty — a question often raised by both sides on these issues in the Legislature. “I see no conflict at all between my approval for this bill [the death penalty] and my deep devotion to compassion for the people,” he replied, tracing the issue from recent history, when the United States Supreme Court struck down a permissive form of the new, limited death penalty, to the emphasis of the need for law in the Judeo‐Christian tradition of the Ten Commandments. He was reminded that one of the commandments was: Thou shalt not kill.” The Governor responded that just as the principle of a “just war” had evolved in human history, so was there “a just basis for execution.” The bill, he said, serves “the best interests” of the state's residents. The Governor said the bill appeared to be constitutional. Proponents have argued that the previous law was struck down because it had violated the equal‐protection guarantees of the Constitution by leaving convicted murderers subject to a jury's option on capital punishment, and that a mandated, version should remove this inequality. In discussing Watergate, Mr. Wilson altered his previous position of refusing to comment on the subject because of a lack of sufficient personal knowledge of it. He has not had enough time in the closing legislative rush to read all available transcripts, he said, but added: “I must say, with respect to the fragments I have read, that I am deeply disturbed by the lack of that degree of moral indignation with respect to the members of the discussions in those fragments which the peo fie have a right to expect from, public officials at every level of government.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An ‘827’ Session,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/18/archives/an-827-session.html,"The latest sitting of the State Legislature, which ended in the usual non‐deliberative frenzy as dawn broke Thursday, can perhaps best be classified as an “827,” though some critics would write it off as an “805.” In the code book enthusiastically quoted by legislators during the closing days at Albany, an “827” translates as, “Pardon me, sir, you obviously mistook me for someone who gives a (expletive deleted).” An “805,” according to the book, means: “It's been so (expletive deleted) bad, I can't believe it.” The session wasn't all that bad. It did produce some substantial gains for education, including more state school aid under an improved formula, a student aid program for colleges and full‐funding for City University. Following Governor Wilson's lead, the legislators provided significant assistance for mass transit and modest increases in welfare and unemployment benefits. They eliminated the corroboration rule in rape cases, made it easier for women to obtain financial credit and mandated interest payments on mortgage escrow accounts. These achievements are all to the good, but they hardly add up to an impressive record for a Governor and lawmakers who must face the voters next fall, especially when placed beside the session's glaring omissions and failures. In the face of public pressure for reform generated by Watergate, this Legislature's response was only perfunctory and tentative. The legislative process itself was made somewhat more open, but many old evils—most notably absentee voting—remain intact. Though a new elections commission may help curb some excesses, the new election law falls far short of true reform. Important legislation affecting courts, prisons and consumers all fell by the wayside. In contrast to these missed opportunities, new laws which the legislators did pass reinstating the death penalty and restricting abortions can only be regarded as regressions from past gains. In the final hours, a domineering leadership managed to push through the exhausted chambers a needed bill for state takeover and operation of two incomplete Consolidated Edison plants, but it elbowed aside an amendment designed to provide fuller protection for the public interest in this essential emergency measure. On the minus side was its herding to passage of a hastily assembled substitute rent‐control measure that almost totally disregards the interests of tenants. The windup session also featured, as usual, the sudden introduction and routine passage of other ill‐conceived measures that the lawmakers and their constituents—except for favored special‐interest groups—will come to regret. It was the usual shoddy finale or, as the code book puts it, an “809”—“Lovely, simply lovely.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RIGHTS DEMANDS GROW IN PORTUGAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/19/archives/rights-demands-grow-in-portugal-wall-still-solid.html,"LISBON, May 17 — Women end homosexuals have joined the, revolutionary movement that has swept Portugal since a military coup overthrew a half century of dictatorship April 25. The military junta that has ruled since then was confronted yesterday morning by 15 determined women demanding a headquarters for a new women's movement. It was the second demonstration in a week to push this demand, which the all‐male junta, pressed by problems it considers more urgent, has been slow to act on. The junta began allotting office space to various political groups and associations in the days following the coup. The space was made available by the disbanding of organizations associated with the old regime. The Communist party, for example, moved into rooms evacuated by the Portuguese Legion, which was an extreme rightwing paramilitary organization. Wall Still Solid The headquarters problem appeared relatively easy to solve compared with the longerrange problems of women's rights and the freedom of homosexuals from discrimination. Although many people, institutions and practices that flOurished under the dictatorship have been removed, the well of middle‐class values that held women in an inferior position and frowned on homosexuality is still solid. Maria Theresa de la Horta, one of three women writers acquitted last week of charges of publishing a pornographic book denouncing injustices to women, has been a leader of the demonstrations and of the women's movement itself. Before the coup, she told newsmen that women in Portugal had to fight against two types of oppression, that of the political regime and that of men. One of the first goals of the new movement is the legalization of abortion, strictly prohibited and performed clandestinely in this strongly Roman Catholic country. A left‐wing government began functioning Thursday. It is expected to act against prostitution which, while as illegal as abortion, is one of Lisbon's more flourishing activities. Women have noted that the same middle‐class and upperclass men who oppose abortion and women's rights are the mainstays of prostitution. Demand for Rights The homosexual movement was first noticed on May Day in Oporto, the country's second largest city, where one banner proclaiming ‘igay liberation” was seen in the parade there. This week the Movement for Revolutionary Homosexual Action, claiming 1,000 members, published a statement declarihg that homosexuals had been the victims “of the most authoritarian juridical and social repression” and demanding freedom to live as homosexuals. The statement called for the abolition of an article in the penal code repressing “vices against nature” and asked the freedom to practice homosexuality “as long as it is not the result of violence.” Sexual education in the schools that does not discriminate against homosexuality was also urged. The movement said there was now an antirepressive sexual movement parallel to the antirepressive political movement. It called homosexuality the “most destructive force” existing against bourgeois morality since it dissociates itself from the family, “which Karl Marx considered the institutional basis of capitalism.” The statement ended: “Love live homosexuality! Long live the revolution!”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Candidate as Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/19/archives/wilson-spent-some-time-wisely-the-candidate-as-governor.html,"ALBANY—With the closing of the legislative session, Malcolm Wilson has spent half of the precious campaign contribution left to him last December with Nelson Rockefeller's resignation—the gift of eleven months in which to serve as Governor before facing the voters next November. This time offers Mr. Wilson the opportunity to be both Governor and candidate and the legislative session that ended last week provided the largest single political platform he will have in this election campaign. There is dispute over how well Mr. Wilson has used it, but he did not neglect the chance, as shown by his earliest initiatives in the session—for example, moving the primary date from June to September. As Governor and statesman, Mr. Wilson offered the primary change as a response to the public's increased concern over corruption among public officials. The shorter campaign, he said, will mean lower costs and less temptation for a candidate to be vulnerable to fat‐cat contributors. As politician and strategist, however, Mr. Wilson was/stimulating the state Democratic party's traditional “blood bath” in choosing a candidate. The motive here is to keep them fighting through the summer so the Democratic winner will be too spent to put up a good fight the general election. One of Mr. Wilson's tasks as Governor has been to reassure voters that he is not a rigid conservative rooted in the dust of discarded ideas. There is no easy way to measure how much progress he has made, but the other night during a debate over the state budget, Stanley Steingut, the Assembly minority leader, stood up and complained: “My God, the socalled conservative Malcolm Wilson has outdone Nelson Rockefeller.” The complaint was over the size of the budget, $9.3‐billion, a figure, Mr. Wilson presents as almost entirely the product of built‐in spending for existing services—what he terms “the automaticity of existing formulae.” Maybe so, but politicians underlined as shrewd, if inconsistent, the Goyernor's willingness to let the legislative bloc from the predominantly middle‐class Republican suburbs push this year's school aid increase to $300‐Million—three times the size the Governor originally announced. This is fruitful political territory, part of what Mr. Wilson envisions as the “moderate, middle way.” The left shoulder ,of Mr. Wilson's middle road included his proposal to increase the amount of aid paid to welfare recipients. This may seem to be surprising initiative for Mr. Wilson, perhaps, but those who see politics in the fine print of legislation noted that the increase put welfare aid at the 1972 level of basic living costs—up from the previous 1969 level but short of 1974. This was seen as an attempt at backspin to reassure the conservative voter. Near the end of the session, some Conservative officials were complaining that Mr. Wilson was going too far afield in his programs. Last week, however, a state Conservative official said that Mr. Wilson had begun reassuring them by taking a “very active” role in getting such bills through in the Legislature's closing hours as an abortion restriction that would: require a second physician to be on hand to help any 20‐week old fetuses surviving the operation. He also signed a bill restoring the death penalty for murderers of policemen and prison employes and murders committed by life‐term prisoners. Part of Mr. Wilson's political task is to make initiatives toward new voters without alienating his traditional Republican and Conservative supporters. This is exemplified in the transit issue first by Mr. Wilson's engineering the state's first direct fare subsidy—$100‐million, mostly for New York City—. to keep the 35‐cent fare from rising. On the other hand, the Governor hesitated to accept another mass transit proposal: easing the restrictions on Port Authority bonds so that tunnel and bridge profits could subsidize transit construction. Critics portrayed the Governor as preoccupied with Wall Street interests in this matter and on the bill to help Consolidated Edison out of its fiscal difficulties. The latter proposal, however, was finally passed with Democrats aboard and talking in populist terms of the need to keep the lights burning. In the struggle for passage, the Governor had as an ally Mayor Beanie of New York. The Republican Governor has worked to stay on the friendly side of the Democratic Mayor of New York City where there are so many votes in the state election. In contrast, Mr. Wilson's real political problems lie within his own party where a considerable faction remains loyal to Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea. The Montauk Republican had ambitions to wrest the nomination from Mr. Wilson, but his efforts ended with a scandal. Mr. Duryea was indicted on charges of violating the Election Law, then cleared of the charges, but too late to restore his momentum. Mr. Duryea's supporters blame Mr. Wilson's mentor, Nelson Rockefeller,.for the inquiry that re suited in the scandal. And the political pressures involved in this issue and in the Governor's strategy to court New York City votes boiled over in the final hours of the session with the rent control issue. In this, Mr. Wilson had started slowly with a bill that Democrats considered landlord‐oriented, but then he delighted Democrats with a second version that was more favorable to tenants and, indeed, was written with Democratic help. But the plan was scuttled in the Assembly, where Speaker Duryea said the opposition of city Republicans prevented him from getting it passed. Some politicians charged that Mr. Duryea did less than he could to get the bill through because it would have been the key to Mr. Wilson's building new voting strength in New York City. However, other politicians say that Mr. Duryea has always had to cater to the city Republicans to keep the Speaker's chair. The Governor generally praised Mr. Duryea when asked about the controversy. But he also said that he had nothing to do with the bill eventually passed by the Assembly and that he might try to restore some tenant boons in the special session in two weeks. There is doubt that he can succeed in this, but by just announcing the attempt Mr., Wilson , may reassure some city voters. The acrimony over this isssue was left hanging in the sour air of the debating chambers as the Legislature adjourned after dawn last Thursday. Democrats left for home and the hustings wondering whether this year it might be the Republicans who have the blood‐bath. But Mr. Wilson expressed confidence as he prepared for the remaining half of the precious days inherited from Nelson Rockefeller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Book. Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/19/archives/book-ends.html,"Hard Sell. Everybody knows that publicity sometimes helps sell a book and everybody also knows that it is a bit more difficult to hook up a novelist on the talk‐show circuit. So we will call an expert witness to the stand on the subject of publicizing a novel, Sol Stein, the Stein of Stein & Day, publishers (his wife, Patricia, is the Day). He the only publisher, as far as we know, who is also a successful novelist; his last book, “The Magician,” sold over 500,000 copies in all editions. Since Mr. Stein has a new book out, published by Arbor House (sea page 38) and is reputed to be a man who knows how to push a hook, we were not.surprised to learn that he had just returned from a tour of a dozen or so cities. Another writer we know whose path crossed Mr. Stein's on the circuit noticed with awe his custom of appearing with a 3 by 5 card in hand. Mr. Stein explained that the card contains reminders to himself of things to talk about. The notes, printed in a large typeface known as Orator, Prod Mr. Stein to set the scene of the book, discuss all the characters, rather than just the main one; there are also such cryptic mnemonics as “coupling without a contract” (to remind Mr. Stein to say that he is no longer in favor of living together with benefit of clergy) and “after women's lib what?” which brings him around to the theme of his book. As for the importance of publicity, he learned from his last book that sales were highest in (a) the four cities which he had visited personally and (b) the cities in which the “David Frost Show” on which he had appeared was shown in prime time. His advice to novelists who want to go the talk‐show route: “Have a non‐fiction theme to talk about” (his is “post‐women's lib“ so “War and Peace” is, as Woody Allen said, a book about Russia). Also, being a publisher helps, since there are a lot of would‐be writers out there who want to know how to write a successful novel, Mr. Stein imparts three rules. What else did he learn? “The distribution of books in this country is abysmal.” There followed a typical author's story about none of his books being on display when he showed up for a bookstore appearance. Authors, even when they're publishers, are all alike. Oddments. The success of “The Whole Earth Catalog” has brought in its wake series of “large‐format paperbacks,” which measure around 8 by 10 and are illustrated. Two of the latest examples are Dell's “The People's Yellow Pages of America” and Bantam's “The Great Escape.” “The People's Yellow Pages” was compiled by a firm known as Heller & Son, consisting of Richard Heller, former book editor, and his six‐year‐old son (chats a son joke). The book, which sells for $5, lists nonestablishment groups providing wide variety of services such as abortion information, birth‐control counseling, theater groups, art guilds, architectural plans, film courses, etc. A ‘unique feature is a list of “Switchboards”—clearing‐houses located in number of cities providing information on places to stay, free rides, drug counseling and so on. “The Great Escape,” edited by and designed by Donald K. Wright, sells for $7 and is a slicker job, with articles under such headings as “Yoga Plus,” “Akido,” “Martial Arts,” “Sex and Science Museums,” “Bawdy Houses,” “Whitewater Rafting” about offbeat places and life‐styles. Both of these books are so inclusive that they resist summary, so you'll have to leaf through them yourselves. The Dell book is out, the Bantam is scheduled for June 12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Catholic Archdiocese of New York ordered him transferred to a church with the same, name in Poughkeepsie. The Archdiocese never told him ‘why it was transferring him, and it has since declined to comment on the move,; although Father Zicarelli made it clear he did not want to leave the Bronx and his parishioners demonstrated for him to Stay—even, on the day when he loaded his books in his green Volkswagen for the drive to, Poughkeepsie. Against U. S.

Why are we so hung up on sex? Is it because we are celibate?” When Catholics ask him advice, he urges them to make up their own Minds, but if they press him for his opinion, they get it. Is he getting anyone angry in Poughkeepsie? Possibily, but it is hard to find them. “He's made an impact here,” said City Manager Donald O'Hara. He relates very well to Poughkeepsie.” “He's as vibrant as a bow string,” said Msgr. Matthew Cox, pastor of St. Mary's Church here. “If he put his head against a wall, he'd keep pushing till the wall went down.’ As he did in New York, Father Zicarelli in Poughkeepsie immerses himself in public issues and sometimes public controversy. He recently told a group of supporters he would not run for the Poughkeepsie Board of Edtication because he thinks most of its present members are inept and he feels he can't work with them. But he does serve on the Planning Board and ‘was chairman of the Mayor's Task Force for the rehabilitation of a neglected area of downtown.Poughkeepsie. And now he's considering running in ,two years for Mayor of Poughkeepsie on the Democratic ticket. He's been a Republican all his life, but Watergate, he said, made it impossible for him to continue in the party. About 20 per cent of Father Zicarelli's parish is either first or second generation Italian. He relates to both; he was born in Rimini in northern Italy but spent most of his life in New York. Mount Carmel is a small parish, less Italian, less complicated in most way than Belmont. Indeed, the whole city of Poughkeepsie, which has a population of around 30,000, is one‐tenth the size of his old Bronx parish. Telltale Signs The Italianate character of Belmont is almost unrelenting..In Poughkeepsie's. Mount Carmel you have to look harder for it, but it is nevertheless there. In the area right around the church, where there is the heaviest concentration of Italians, one sees the telltale signs:, the neatly trimmed hedges; the aluminum fences that surround patches of tomatoes and peppers, the old men in stern brown sweaters. Grape arbors are frequent and purple lilacs Dress against painted white brick. A spring morning is quiet save for the sounds of nails being hammered or ‘assertive shrubbery being clipped: property is precious to the native born Italians who continue to settle here. Their houses are 19th‐ and early 20th‐century Yankee, yet Italianized in obsessive neatness. “The Italians have an exaggerated sense of the work ethic,” Father Zicarelli said of his parishioners. “They have limited horizons. If they didn't, they'd go crazy. For them it is important to make the concrete good, the wall plumb tad to sell the best cheese.’ But are these not of the same stock that produced da Vinci? “No. These are of the same stock that produced George Washington Bridge and the Sixth Avenue Subway.” Father Zicarelli likes Mount Carmel but he still visits Behrlont once a month to lunch in the rectory of the church there and to visit with old friends. He thought about his role in the church. “I can't change the church, only the envloment around me. I cun't change the church's savage position on so many things, only the way they affect a malt's soul. I know never become a monsignor, but it doesn't make much difference what you become in life as long as you make a success out of it. I'm going to do the best I can to dig up the patch around me and then go home to God.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Killian Runs Uphill in Connecticut Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/20/archives/killian-runs-uphill-in-connecticut-race-attorney-general-battles-a-.html,"HARTFORD, May 18 — In places where neighborhoods and politics shift as fast as they do in Hartford, a politician should not forget to look occasionally over his shoulder. While Robert Kenneth Killian, Attorney General of Connecticut, was building his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Governor, he might have been better off to have perceived earlier that the Hartford Democratic organization was falling into the hands of his enemies. After the coup, the organization endorsed a slate of 70 delegates to the state nominating convention in July, all more or less committed to support Ella Tambussi Grasso, the United States Representative from Windsor Locks, who is Mr. Killian's chief rival for the nomination. Frank Zullo, a former Mayor of Norwalk, is also running, but needs recognition and has a lot of ground to make up before he can hope to catch the others. Homer D. Babbidge Jr., a former presjdent of the University or Connecticut, dropped out of the race in March. There will be 1,213 delegates to the convention. Hartford will have the biggest single.bloc of votes. Hartford Victory Vital Mr. Killian speaks more bravely now, in the heat of primary election campaign, but three weeks ago he wrote to Democratic leaders around the state that he was aware of the implications of an electoral defeat in his home town. “I suffer no illusions,” he wrote. “A loss in the Hartford primary will be fatal to my candidacy.” The primary election is on Thursday, with Mr. Killian's own slate of 70 delegates pitted against the names endorsed by the organization that pfoduced him and then turned away from him. “I don't have any of the organization with me—the socalled organization,” he said with a certain bitterness that reflected a shaken belief that most things in politics are built on loyalty. He looks like a machine politician. At 54 years old, he is courtly in public end smartly dressed. His ties are just the right silky hues to go with the rust and gray colors in his hair, and they are knotted tightly, almost out of sight, under his big chin. His straight nose and long, sloping forehead, usually arched in rows of furrows, give him quizzical, almost astonished look, especially when he is trying to phrase a difficult political thought. Opposition ‘Isn't Easy’ “Running against a woman isn't easy,” he said. “You're in a situation where — well, you know — how deferential can you be?” In private, Mr. Killian is more relaxed than he appears to be in public. He props his feet up on the desk and talks easily, playing the part of gregarious Irish politician —a trait he may have acquired from his father, Edward, who was of Irish descent and an Alderman in Hartford. Robert Killian's mother was Jewish. More than half a century ago a mixed marriage in Hartford was a rare thing. Edward Killian and Annie Nemser were ostracized by both their families when they married. They moved to Bridgeport for year, where he worked as an electrician. They returned to Hartford only after the first child, Edward Jr., was born and the new grandparents softened. Edward Killian opened a tobacco shop in Frog Hollow, as much the melting pot of Hartford then as it is now. “There were Irish and Italians,” Robert Killian said. “There were blacks on Wolcott Street and Broad Street and Flower Street. There were lots of Poles, Finns, Jewish merchants up and down Park Street.” Robert Killian went to Union College in Schenectady, but left on Pearl Harbor Day, in the middle of his senior year, to enlist with a group of friends. The others all got into the more exotic branches of service they wanted. But Robert Kilian, who is color‐blind, landed in the infantry. He spent 27 months island‐hopping in the Pacific, until he was wounded in Okinawa by a hand grenade thrown during a nighttime assault by the Japanese. On the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor, he had married a high school sweetheart, the former Evelyn Farnan. They have two children, Robert Jr., a lawyer who is very active in his father's campaign, and Cynthia, a senior at Northwest Catholic High School. Mrs. Killian not only campaigns now like a soldier, but she selects those silky ties for her husband. He cannot tell one color from another. Mr. Killian ended the war as a first lieutenant, having made it through officer candidate's school, earning the credits on the way that he needed for a degree from Union College. He went to the University of Connecticut Law. School, then entered private practice and politics. He was assistant corporation counsel for Hartford. For a while he was Democratic town chairman, head of the machine that wound up on March 12 in the hands of Nicholas R. Carbone, the man Mr. Killian had kept from getting the job three years earlier. While Mr. Carbone has carried the organization into Ella Grasso's camp, the Democratic chief in New Haven, Arthur T. Barbieri, has done the same with his organization. Frank Santaguida has thrown the Waterbury Democratic organization behind her and is helping to gather support in the industrial towns in the Naugatuck Valley. “This whole aura or facade of nonpartisanship—” Mr. Killian said of Mrs. Grasso. “How. can she get the boss support and still pretend to be independent?” Mrs. Grasso's Italian heritage (is presumably helping her in Connecticut, where more than a million people have Italian roots—a third of the population. She speaks a lot of Italian on her walking tours. In the towns, political control has been passing from the Irish to the Italians for several yeirs, although Mr. Killian re fuses to believe that the phenomenon can hurt him in Hartford. In six and a half years as Attorney General, he feels he has gained a great deal of recognition. Four years ago he was one of two. Democrats on the state ticket to survive the Republican sweep. by Gov. Thomas J. Meskill. The other Democrat was Gloria Schaffer, the Secretary of the State. The unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor, Emilio Q. Daddario, won in Hartford by 16,000 votes. Mr. Killian's margin of victory in Hartford was 20,000, even without an Italian name. “That was in 1970,” he said. “How different was it then? If there was an ethnic thing, don't see it being a factor.” As Attorney General, Mr. Killian has ‘gone on record on most political issues, and has not flinched since. He pressed an antitrust action against the major oil companies. He fought for state aid to parochial schools, for more state aid for public transportation. None of these is really an issue among Democrats. The thing he gets asked about most often on the street is abortion. He is against liberal abortion laws, but so is Mrs.. Grasso. Mr. Killian thinks the stand will hurt her more than hiin, because it could offend the more liberal women's organizations that were behind her candidacy in the first place. The real test. he feels, lies in his ability to get out the Mote without a machine, and in his record, not in ethnics. Of Hartford's 160,000 people, perhaps 20,000 are of Italian descent, and they are leay. ing for the suburbs. The Irish in Hartford are departing even faster. But there are 45,000 blacks in Hartford, by far the biggest group. They have not really discovered yet how to get a lock on politics. There are also 20,000 Spanish:speaking people—Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Peruvians and others—who are not really represented in politics. Many have moved into Frog Hollow, Mr. Killian's old neighborhood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Father Zicuelli: Controversial as Ever,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/20/archives/father-zicarelli-controversial-as-ever-image-of-actiyist-father.html,"POUGHKEEPSIE, N. Y., May 10—A few years ago a little girl from a distant neighborhood mistakenly thought she had, lost her mother on a busy; street in the heavily Italian: Belmont section of the Bronx and wandered into a pasta shop, crying. “Don't cry,” the clerk comforted her. “In this neighborhood, nobody is ever lost.” The mother of that child recently visited the Rev. Mario Zicarelli—formerly of Belmont and now of Poughkeepsie‐and related the incident, “If you tell me stories like that,” he said, “I'll cry.” For 14 years, Father Zicarelli watt’ assistant pastor of Belmorit'sY Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and it has been a year and five monthe: since ,the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York ordered him transferred to a church with the same name in 1,Poughkeepsie. The Archdiocese never told him why it was transferring him, and it has since declined’ ‘to comment on the move,‐ although Father Zicarelli made it clear he did not want to leave the Bronx and his parishioners demonstrated for him to stay—even on the day when he loaded his books in his green Volkswagen for the drive to Poughkeepsie. But it is known that the hierarchy violently objected when. Father Zicarelli, in running successfully for the District 10 Community School Board, said publicly he did not believe in Federal aid for parochial schools. The 53; year‐old priest said he thought such money violated the principle of separation Of church and state, and the United States Coifttitutiorl.

Fifteen per cent of Mount Carmel's; studenth are black, and if ,more wanted to come to his school, Father. Zicarelli would be delighted. For him, something other than total integration is nnt.realistic. He also has views on education he wcinlitemper. “For some, education of an abstract nature doesn't work. We are making.a mistake if we try to train very black to become a lawyer. The dropout is the fellow who is telling you that.* at you have is not for, hintt” Father Zicarelli endorSes expanded roles for vocational schools. As for birth control and abortion, two areas where the Vatican has made itself very clear, Father Zicarelli openly disagrees with the church: “I don't think the Catholic Church has any business meddling in sex. Why are we, so hung up on sex? Is it because we are celibate?” When Catholics ask him advice, he urges them to make up their own minds, but if they.press him for his personal opinion, they get it.

Catholic Conference Is Sued as Lobbyist,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/21/archives/catholic-conference-is-sued-as-lobbyist-monsignor-called-lobbyist.html,"WASHINGTON, May 20—The lobbying activities of the United States Catholic Conference are being challenged in court for the first time in a suit brought by the Women's Lobby, a small group with a registered lobbyist that concerns itself with legislation affecting women. Implicit in the suit are questions about the tax‐exemption of the Catholic Conference which comprises all the Roman Catholic Bishops in the country, as well as other religious institution's. The pro‐abortion Women's Lobby is attempting to force the antiabortion Catholic Conference either to stop trying to influence legislation or to register with Congress as a lobbying organization. The conference has been a leading force behind a move in Congress to overturn last year's Supreme Court decision on abortion by passing a constitutional amendment to protect the life of a ,Ietus. The Women's ,Lobby ,suit contends that the conference spends a major portion of its time and money trying to pass legislation and therefore must register. as a. lobby. “We face this huge opponent, the Catholic Church, which spends lots of money and doesn't have to filed public reports with Congress on finances as other lobbies must do, said Carol Burris, president of Women's Lobby, as she explained the movie behind the suit. However, the potential impact of the suit reaches far beyond’ the abortion issue. If the court ruled in favor of the Women's Lobby, other religious denominations, which historically have been advocates in such legislative battles as prohibition, civil rights and aid to Israel, could be vulnerable to challenges to their tax‐exempt status. To win its case, the Women's Lobby must prove to Judge Aubrey E.

Start of Life Debated at Abortion Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/21/archives/start-of-life-debated-at-abortion-hearing-strident-lobbying.html,"WASHINGTON, May 20—As the few Senators in attendance listened with the perplexed attentiveness of students in an advanced biology course, scientists debated such matters as whether the moment when life begins can be scientifically determined, or whether an eightweek fetus feels pain. At the end of one scholarly presentation, the bulk of the audience broke into applause. Senator Birch Ilayh, Democrat of Indiana, and chairman of the subcommittee, peered over his half‐glasses in reproof and said: “I will report... we have some very intricate Matters to discuss. They are not going to be decided by an applause meter. I don't think that really helps us in the. process of deliberation.” But for the applauding audience at a recent Senate hearing, many of them festooned with red plastic roses, these “intricate matters” are simple, and the “process of deliberation” conceals one of the moss highly charged issues to haunt the Congress in some time: the movement to amend the United States Constitution to outlaw abortion for all women, under all—or nearly all—circumitances, on the grounds that bortion at any stage of preglancy is killing a human being. Strident Lobbying The issue indeed haunts Congress, because it is believed to lave no more than a wraith's ;hance of success but it will lot go away. Under the leadrship of the National Right o Life Committee, Inc., lobbysts descend on Capitol Hill weekly, carrying the red roses :hat they use as symbols, and handing out technicolor literature showing lurid and often enlarged photographs of a aborted fetuses. So persistent and strident is their lobbying in Congressional offices that has said to have alienated some legislators who might have been sympathetic to their cause. The movement, as such, began in New York State in the mid‐nineteen‐sixties in response to the rumbles of liberalization that led, ultimately, to that state's abortion‐reform law. For some years it was affiliated with the United States Catholic Conference; last year, it severed its ties with the church and is now incorporated as nonprofit organization with national headquarters in Wash Church Support It disclaims any connection with the Roman Catholic Church. Its director, the Rev. Warren A. Schaller Jr., is an Episcopal priest. Mr. Schaller said in a telephone interview that he could not estimate the group's membership, but that there were 864 groups “on our computer list.” That means that they receive the group's monthly newspaper and presumably share its goals, although they are not legal affiliates. In addition, he said, there are 10,000 individuals who paid $5 each to subscribe. Membership is heavily, but not entirely, Roman Catholic, and the group enjoys hefty, if unofficial, church support. Whatever the size of this group, its advocates are determined people focused on this single issue. Their shrill forcefulness has made their issue one certain to emerge in this year's politics. And for that reason, most members of Con gress wish to avoid tangling with it this year. The impetus for the group's nationwide growth was the Su preme Court decision in January, 1973, that effectively overturned state restrictions on abortion. Since’ then, three “right‐to‐life” amendments have been introduced in. Congress, two in the Senate and one in the House. No hearings have been held, nor are’ any scheduled, on the House amendment which was soonsored by Representative Lawrence J. Hogan, Republican of Maryland. Senator Bayh, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, began hearings in March on what he has called “probably the most volatile issue in American politics.” They have continued at regular intervals, with scientific witnesses on both sides of the arguments speaking, plus some politicians and four Roman Catholic cardinals, The two amendments being considered are those introduced by Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, and Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York. Mr. Helms's amendment, like Mr. Hogan's, would ban abortions, with no exceptions based on possible danger to the mother's life, or for rape victims. Mr. Buckley's proposal would prohibit abortion in all but those “emergency” cases in which there is “a reasonable certainty” that continuation of the pregnancy would mean the mother's death. At the most recent hearings, about two weeks ago, two scientists asserted that identifiable human life began at conception, and they urged the adoption of an abortion ban. Their testimony, which was followed intently and once interrupted by applause by partisans, was followed by testimony for the other side from three scientists, including Mongolism was the result of a 1972 Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Gerald M. Edelman. The first witness was Dr. Jerome Lejeune, a French physician and ‘geneticist Who was the first to demonstrate that an extra chromosome. Dr. Lejeune argued that “from its very beginning the ‘thing’ we started with is a member of our kin... the same human being from fecundation to death.” Dr. Lejeune contended that human life began at conception. “The very fact that we have to develop ourselves during nine months inside the bodily protection of our mother does not change anything,” he said. ‘Semantic Distinctions’ Dr. Lejeune also referred to a two‐month fetus as a “Tom Thumb,” a sort of personalization that was echoed in the testimony of the next witness, a New Zealand obstetrician, Dr. A. W. Liley. He maintained that distinctions between the unborn fetus’ and the newborn infant “are just semantic distinctions and somewhat arbitrary.” Dr. Liley also contended that a fetus was capable of feeling pain. Dr. Edelman, in his testimony, said: “There is no generally accepted scientific proof that a fetus has consciousness in the sense of self‐awareness. If one somehow attempts to glorify a fertilized egg or even an early embryo one must confront questions that are not capable of scientific answers: At what stage of development does a living, individual human being appear? This is essential ly a religious and moral question and is therefore open to sectarian interpretations and ‘prejudices.” But he then diverged from the scientific path to add his personal view and “it is an infringement upon the rights of a woman to tell her what to do with her eggs, fertilized or not,” and urged that any decision “be made on larger grounds, not by some simple appeal to scientific technology nor according to the dogmas of any single group, however sincere its beliefs.” He was followed by Dr. Norton Zinder, professor of genetics at the Rockefeller University, who stated: “Scientifically we cannot answer the question of when life begins.” Dr. John R. Biggers, professor of physiology and a member of the Laboratory of Human Reproduction and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School, asserted that “if the Helms amendment written into the Constitution, it is possible attempts may be made to outlaw the use of the IUD,” since it is believed that interuterine devices for birth control may function by preventing implantation of the fertilized egg. Earlier, a group of 21 women sent a telegram to Senator Bayh deploring “that so few women have been allowed to testify. We are the ones who will suffer from government attempts to control our reproductive lives.” Among the signers were Margaret Mead, Gloria Steinem, Barbara Walters, Mary Lasker, Joanne Woodward and Billie Jean King.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIFE OF ERVIN PANEL EXTENDED A MONTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/22/archives/life-of-ervin-panel-extended-a-month.html,"WASHINGTON, May 21 (UPI) —Overcoming vigorous objections by conservative Republicans, the Senate ektended today the life of its Watergate committee for another month. By a voice vote with about 20 Senators on the floor, the Senate adopted a resolution giving the panel until June 30 to file its final report. The report was originally due Feb. 28, then was delayed until May 28. The resolution, however, also provides that the committee “shall continue in existence” beyond June 30 in case there is no final court action by then on its suit to obtain five of President Nixon's Watergaterelated tapes. Even the ranking Republican on the Watergate committee, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, a co‐sponsor of the resolution, said he would vote against it if forced to roll‐call vote. After a behind‐the‐scenes strategy conference, the demand for a roll‐call was dropped and the resolution was adopted. ards, posters and television spots that focused simply on his nickname, “Pete.” Mr. Denenberg, on the other hand, was a peripatetic candidate, easily accessible to the media and almost constantly on the run. Although the DenenbergFlaherty race failed to fulfill its advance billing as a match between nonconformists, it was nevertheless a distinctive and at times a provocative campaign. Mayor Flaherty, a softspoken, Roman Catholic father of five children, emphasized his record as the Mayor of Pitttsburgh, citing reductions and cancellation of some taxes, a decrease in the crime rate and the building of a surplus in the municipal treasury. Mr. Denenberg, who despite his professional background is no Mr. Chips, similarly pointed to his record as the scourge of insurance companies in Pennsylvania and promised to take the same approach toward big business and other interests if elected. Governor Shapp's campaign received support from most of the party's organizations, although Mr. Mullen, who is Catholic, showed surprising strength in Philadelphia and in Erie. Mr. Mullen's campaign was characterized by his repeated emphasis on morality in government and his frequent attacks against the Governor's veto of bills that would have made abortion illegal and narrowed the state's obscenity laws. In addition to those statewide offices, 25 Congressional nominations were on the ballot as well as more than 200 state legislative seats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Survey Finds Young U.S.Workers In Dissatisfiedand Frustrated,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/22/archives/survey-finds-young-us-workers-increasingly-dissatisfied-and.html,"Working‐class young people in the United States are taking on many of the attitudes on sex, politics, patriotism, religion, the family, morals and life‐style that marked college student thinking of five years ago. The result, according to an attitudinal research study, is that workers are ‘becoming increasingly dissatisfied and frustrated at a sense of unfulfillment. The survey was conducted by Daniel Yankelovich, who said at a news conference yesterday that he found its results “impressive and a little bit bewildering.” He said the study strongly indicated that as workers move closer to what college students were, the students of today are predisposed to reconcile themselves to society, feel less alienation and hope they will be able to function constructively within it. The removal of United States ‘troops from the Vietnam, war played a major role in generating more optimism and good‐will among the students, he said.’ Mr. Yankelovich predicted that American society would be under “great stress And strain in the next few years” because of the disaffected working class, but emphasized he did not think this would cause violent upheavals among workers similar to those seen on college campuses in the nineteen‐sixties. Dimensions. of ‘Study The given ‘dimensions of the Yankelovich study are massive by the usual sampling norms. Mr. Yankelovich said his staff conducted interviews of between one and two hours in 1973 with 3,522 young people between the ages of 16 and 25 — 1,006 of them college students in two‐ and four‐year institutions, the rest working in a variety of jobs. This is the fifth survey Mr. Yankelovich has done On the changing values of American youth, and he described this as “the largest and most ambitious” of them all. It was sponsored by five foundations, led by John Did Rockefeller 3d's JDR 3rd Fund. The others were the Edna McDonnell Clark Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation, the Hazen Foundation and the Andrew','. Mellon Foundation. Among the findings were the following: ¶Sharply increasing numbers of both college and working‐class youth want more sexual freedom. Sixty‐one per cent of the students responded affirmatively to this question, as did 47 per cent of the working youth, which put them statistically where college students were in their attitudes five years ago. Twenty‐two per cent of college students said they thought that casual premarital sexual relations were wrong and 34 per cent of the working young agreed. But compared with five years ago, the greater change was among workers, not students. Fewer of them said they objected to relations between consenting homosexuals on moral grounds and fewer think having an abortion is morally wrong, as compared with five years ago. Percentages vary, and students remain more liberal, but workers are clearly headed in the same. direction. Religious Interest.Off ¶In 1969,‐ 64 per cent of young workers interviewed said they thought religion was “a very important value.* In this latest survey, the number dropped to 42 per cent"". Among college students, there was a more gradual decline at a lower interest, with only 28 per cent saying they ‐thought religion was important. Five years ago, the figure for college, students was 10 per cent higher. ¶Both Students and workers indicated overwhelmingly. they ‘would 4elconte less emphasis on money. Eighty per cent of the student so responded, as did 74 per cent of the‐workers.""But‐ the change from five years ago was most. Marked'arhOng. workers. There was also substantial evidence that fewer and fewer of all young believe that “hard _work always pays off.” Workers felt about the same as students.that “self‐expression” and “self‐fulfillment” are important : But workers are frustrated because their chances of getting what they want are less without college training, and they expressed what the study called “a strong desire :for various forms of additional trainfrig.” It they remain unsatisfied, Mr. Yankelovich feels, many workers Will “turn off” in future years. ¶There was substantial evidence of a mellowing among students toward societal values that their colleagues of just a. few years ago condemned. In 1971, a Yankelovich survey found that 45 per cent of the students interviewed felt “this is a sick society.” Now the figures, based on a broader sample; has fallen to 35 per cent. Increasing numbers of students also expressed the belief that they could work within society, and an even greater number — 66 per cent — condemned the use of violence as morally wrong. This is 10 per cent more than in 1971. The New Left lost strength. In 1970, Mr. Yankelovich found that 14 per cent of the students he interviewed identified with it. Now the number has fallen to 9 per cent. The dramatic thing was a tremendous rise in interest in the two major parties climbing from 57 per cent in 1971 to 73 per cent last year. Mr. Yankelovich said the vast majority of students so responding were attracted to the Democratic party, even though much of the interviewing was done before the Watergate scandal had attracted the interest it now has. Patriotism Lost Ground Among students and workers alike, the concept of patriotism as “a very important value” lost ground. Only 19 per cent of the students cited it as important, as did 40 per cent of the workers. In 1969, 35 per cent of the students thought it important, and 60 per cent of the workers felt this way. Two of the more negative aspects of the report concerned Vietnam veterans and young woman who had not gone to college. Veterans emerged in the study as having higher unemployment, alcoholism and drug abuse than their peers who did not serve in Vietnam. They were given to feeling like “second‐class ‘citizens.” Nearly twice as many veterans said they felt this way as did their peers who were not in the service. Thirty‐seven per cent of the Vietnam veterans were so disheartened by what they felt was the indifference of their country toward them, that they said they would rather live in another country. Twenty‐nine per cent of the non‐veterans agreed with them. Young women who had not gone to college glowed markedly less support for the feminist movement than their college counterparts. Mr. Yankelovith said that the thrust of women's liberation movements — with their emphasis on careers —appeared as a threat to working class women whose lack of education precluded them from many of the opportunities held in esteem by the feminists. Not unsurprisingly, blacks interviewed were having a harder time than their white counterparts and had less hope for their future. They were more cynical about American society than were the whites, but the study showed they were also clinging to older values; a strong support of and belief in education, living “a clean, normal life,” the work ethic and the importance of being physically strong. The complete Yankelovich study is to be published this fall by McGraw‐Hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flaherty to Face Schweiker for Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/23/archives/flaherty-to-face-schweiker-for-senate-shapp-to-face-lewis.html,"PHILADELPHIA. May 22 —Peter Francis Flaherty, the boyish‐faced Mayor of Pittsburgh, won Pennsylvania's Democratic nomination to the United States Senate yesterday with a narrow plurality victory over Herbert S. Denenberg, the former State Insurance Commissioner. With nearly 95 per cent of the ballots counted, the Mayor had 451,972 votes to 430,016 for Mr. Denenberg, with slightly less than 100,000 for two other candidates. Mayor Flaherty, the 48‐year‐old political maverick now in his second term in Pittsburgh's city hall, will now challenge Senator Richard S, Schweiker, the first‐term Republican who won renomination by his party without opposition. The extremely close Flaherty‐Denenberg contest, an example of the traditinal Pennsylvania battle between eastern and western strengths, contrasted sharply with other statewide races decided in yesterday's voting. Shapp to Face Lewis Gov. Milton J. Shapp, for instance, won renomination by the Democrats with a half‐million vote margin over his nearest opponent, and Drew Lewis, a wealthy, Philadelphia businessman, won the Republican gubernatorial nomination With but a few of the state's 9,610 precincts still unreported, the Governor had 694,866 votes while Martin P. Mullen, Roman Catholic state representative from Philadelphia who had campaigned against abortion, had 191,109, and a third candidate, Harvey Johnston, had 98,735. Similarly, Mr. Lewis, regarded by many in the state as formidable opponent for Governor Shapp in November, had 507,303 votes to 92,429 for Alvin J. Jacobson and 61,425 for Leonard N. Strunk. In other Republican contests of note, Representative Lawrence G. Williams, now in his fourth Congressional term, was defeated by Stephen McEwen Jr., the District Attorney of Delaware County, in the race for the G.O.P. nomination in the Seventh District. In the Fifth Congressional, District, John Robinson West, a former White House aide who campaigned against the President and recanted his associations with the Administration, was beaten by State Representative Richard Schulze, in a G.O.P. race precipitated’ by the retirement of Representative John H. Ware, a Republican. Early Denenberg Lead The focal point of the primary elections yesterday was the battle between Mayor Flaherty and Mr. Denenberg. As the returns began, the 44‐year‐old Mr. Denenberg, a former professor at the University of Pennsylvania, took a slim lead over the softspoken Mayor by virtue of 21,000‐vote margin here in Philadelphia and a slight plurality in Erie. Despite the Mayor's support from organized party machinery, Mr. Denenberg had expected to do well in the eastern part of the state and when, by early this morning his lead had reached about 17,000 votes, there were many In his camp and elsewhere who believed he had won. United Press International, for instance, declared Mr. Denenberg to be the Democratic nominee shortly before midnight last night. However, in a spate of returns from Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and other western locales, Mayor Flaherty drew quickly even, then took a slim lead and finally drew away to a margin of more than 15,000 votes. It was not until the predawn hours today that the Mayor's lead seemed substantial enough to justify a celebration. As a result of yesterday's voting, Governor Shapp is said by many to have strengthened his own candidacy against Mr. Lewis in November although he denied having taken any sides in the Senate race. A widely accepted notion was that he much preferred Mayor Flaherty's geographic and religious identification over Mr. Denenberg's. The Mayor is a Roman Catholic while Mr. Denenberg, like the Governor, is Jewish. The strength of Mayor Flaherty in the west, as evidenced in the voting yesterday, “must bring great joy to Shapp's heart,” one veteran Democratic leader concluded today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Court Rejects Suit Asserting Catholics Lobby on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/25/archives/court-rejects-suit-assertingcatholics-lobby-on-abortion.html,"WASHINGTON, May 24—A suit challenging the lobbying activities of the United States, Catholic Conference has been dismissed by Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The judge did not rule on the substantive issue of whether the conference should be forced to register as a lobby but based his decision on a technical point. The Women's Lobby, a small organization that concerns itself with legislation affecting women, asked the court to enjoin lobbying by the Roman Catholic group, particularly on abortion legislation. Judge Robinson, in a twopage decision, said that the Women's Lobby had failed to show that efforts to enforce criminal statute on lobbying would not have achieved its purpose. The judge maintained that without such a demonstration, he had no authority to issue an injunction. “There is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a, principal purpose” of the conference and Msgr. James T. McHugh, director of the Family Life Division of the conference, is to influence legislation, Judge Robinson said in his decision. According to the United States Code, any person or organization whose “principal’ purpose” is to work for the passage of legislation must register as a lobby. Carol Burls, president of the Women's Lobby, said the organization brought the Suit because “we want the public to know that it is the hierachy of the Catholic Church that is the backbone of the prolife mOvement.” Gladys Kessler, the lawyer for the women's Lobby, declined to comment today on whether the organization would pursue the issue. The conference, which has worked for passage of a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision of the Supreme Court last year allowing abortions, issued a statement today denying that the conference had violated Federal lobbying laws. The Moat Rev. James S. Rausch, general secretary of the conference, has termed the case “an: indication of the lengths to which the proabortion lobby is willing to go in order to put pressure on those who defend the right of life of the unborn child.” Article on S.D.S. in Error On Professor's Racial Stand CHICAGO, May 24 (AP) —The Associated Press erroneously reported May 16 that Prof. Edward Banfield, the urbanologist, had written that blacks were inferior to whites. Professor Bonfield, a mem ber of the university of Pennsylvania faculty and former faculty member at Harvard, is the author of “Unheavenly City,” an urban study. In this study, Professor Bonfield challenged many assumptions underlying present thinking about urban affairs, including efforts to draw slum inhabitants into planning their area's future. Professor Bonfield was mentioned in The Associated Press story of May 16 in connection with the suspension by’ the University of Chicago student government of a chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. The S.D.S. chapter prevented the Professor from delivering a lecture last March 20 at the university.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asserting that this theme could be applied to all areas of government, he said that in a time of widespread cynicism about government, people would be demanding that public institutions and officials be held more accountable. The Nassau Republican spoke at the Roosevelt Hotel at the eighth and last in a series of hearings held throughout the state by the platform committee. Daniel J. Reidy, chairman of the committee, said it expected to complete a platform draft by the end of this month for submission to the Astar.e corninittee when it meets June 11 and 12 to pick candidates for statewide races. The committee heard a wide variety of suggestions, some of them contradictory, from a parade of witnesses.

Bridgeport Mayor Seeks Connecticut Governorship,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/26/archives/bridgeport-mayor-seeks-connecticut-governorship-party-to-meet-in.html,"BRIDGEPORT, Conn.—It was only a few years ago, people here sometimes have to remind themselves, that Nicholas Panuzio was picking up extra money taking tickets at University of Bridgeport basketball games and talking about the city's need to awaken from its legendary torpor and despair. The 38‐year‐old former university administrator is the Mayor Of the state's largest city now, two'nd a half years after he squeaked into City Hall with a 9‐vote margin and a promise to get the city moving again. And he is rapidly emerging as a front‐runner for the Republican nomination for Governor, a Republican who overthrew 44 years of Democratic and Socialist domination in Bridgeport and is now the Republican leadership's apparent choice in what looks like an uphill battle this year to hold on to the statehouse. Party to Meet in July The party will meet on July 27 to pick a candidate, having tasted power under Gov'Thomas J. Meskill for only four years after decades of lost elections. Mr. Panuzio's appeal to the 1,287 delegates chosen for that convention is his proven ability to run against heavy odds and win, and his successes as Mayor of this troubled city. Like his major competitor for the nomination, Representative Robert Steele of Vernon, whose district, takes in much of the eastern half of the state, and like his probable opponent in the general election, Representative Ella Grasso of Windsor Locks, a Democrat, he has not yet focused his campaign tightly on issues, running instead on popularity, party strength and the win. 13ut,‐Mr. Pariuzio will, it asked, diacuss issues, generally sticking close to an orthodox Connecticut line—against a state income tax, against abortion personally but willing to abide by the recent Supreme Court decision allowing it; in favor of a Federal take‐over of welfare payments but ‘until that day in favor of holding the line on welfare payments and stressing instead job training and day‐care Since he announced his candidacy early last month with the support of some of the party's major figures, he has criss‐crossed the state to court delegates nearly every evening after finishing work and recording his nightly radio message to the city's 155,000 residents. “I feel very strongly that I'm going to win this convention easily—I’ already have about 500 delegates,” he said one day recently while driving his official limousine through the city streets, honking and waving at passers‐by and keeping one ear cocked to the police radio. “I sell myself to them on the fact that I'm well‐known in Republican circles,” he said. “I can win in Denlocratic areas. I'm the only one running in either party with any administrative experience and I'm the only one who has proven he can run against Watergate and win'The rest have yet to face that issue at the polls. And I'm from Republican Fairfield County, which any Republican has to carry to win the state.” Changes in Bridgeport “People say this is a bad year for Republicans, but it's never been a good year for Republicans in Bridgeport,” Mr'Panuzio, a man of generous girth who is partial to long sideburns and wire‐rim glasses, said with a shrug. “I've got story to tell. If the people buy it, I'll be Governor. If not, well, I've got a lot to do here in Bridgeport.” Mayor Panuzio spends his days on the details of city goVeriunent—convincing the install more company to more downtown sidewalk booths, threatening gasoline companies with condemnation unless they tear down abandoned filling stations and eyesores,.'and selling the city's new‐iniage campaign, “Bridgeport’ Is Better,’ to everyone who happens within reach. Mr. Panuzio grew up in Bridgeport, and his City Hall office was his grade‐school classroom when the building was still a school. He keeps it decorated with statues of elephants, dolls of elephants, carvings of elephants and figurines of elephants, emphasizing not only his party affiliation but also recalling P.T. Barnum, the circus entrepreneur who is the city's major historical figure, He graduated from the University of Bridgeport 17 years ago, becoming at the age of 21 an assistant dean of admissions and working his way up to become business administrator, director of the student center and development administrator. Along the way, he took on countless odd jobs to help, make ends meet and finance his.'.’ modest six‐room ranch house in a development section, on the outskirts of the city.1 He ran for Mayor first in 1969, losing by 14,000 to 24,000 votes. By 1971 he had amassed enough support to win by 9 votes, and last fall he won a second two‐year term 2,000 votes. His decision to run for Governor was facilitated by vacuum of confusion and opportunity created when Governor Meskill decided on March 11 that he would not seek a second four‐year term. “The decision to go for Governor was very hard for me,“, Mr. Panuzio said in his limosine. 9 have a, very.... strong feeling for‐Bridgeport and I've mit a tremendous amount.of effort into seeing it improve'I made the decision because think I can do some of the same things for the state. Also, I'd like to be the Governor'It's got to be an exciting job and, well, we all have egos.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IUD DEVICE CITED IN DEATHS OF FOUR,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/29/archives/iud-device-cited-in-deaths-of-four-letterr-by-company-warns-about.html,"The Dalkon Shield, a widely’ preScribed type of intrauterine) contraceptive device (IUD), has been implicated by its manufacturer in the deaths of four woriien who became pregnant while wearing the device and suffered septic spontaneous abortions in the second threemonth period of pregnancy. Thirty‐two other women suffered similar septic abortions, but did not die. A septic abortion is a miscarriage caused by an infec tion in the uterus. The findings were disclosed in ‐a‐letter sent to 120,000 doetors by the device's manufacturer, A. H. Robins Company of Ilichmond, Va.

House Votes to End Antipoverty Agency,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/30/archives/house-votes-to-end-antipoverty-agency-house-votes-to-let-oeo-expire.html,"WASHINGTON, May 29 The House of Representatives voted today to let the Office of Economic Opportunity die June 30 and to transfer most of its few remaining programs to a new Community Action Admin. istration. The new agency would be a part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Some O.E.O. functions have al. ready been shifted to that de. partment and to the Labor Department, the Small Business Administration and Action, the agency that administers volunteer programs such as the Peace Corps. Passage of a bill to set up the Community Action Administration and continue the remaining programs of the antipoverty agency under the Department of Health, Education and Welfare came on a 331‐to53 roll‐call. Under present law, O.E.O., which has disbursed $12.5‐billion since its creation 10 years ago, expires at the end of June. Before today's vote, few members of the House rose to mourn the end of the agency described a decade ago by President Johnson as designed to bring “total victory” in the highly publicized war against poverty. The most hotiy debated item during the four hours of floor action on the bill was an amendment, passed, 290 to 91, that would prohibit the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. The amendment, introduced by Representative Harold V. Froelich, Republican of Wisconsin, states that “No financial assistance shall be extended for medical assistance or support in cases of abortion.” Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, argued against the amendment, saying that it would result in the denial of abortions to poor people because they could not afford to pay. The Froelich amendment is similar to four others that have been added to bills in both houses recently. Two of these, amendments to the foreign aid bill and the public health bill, have already been enacted. The Senate and House voted earlier this year to take legal services out of the O.E.O. and create a new public corporation to handle the program. The final version of that bill has been approved by the House and is now awaiting Senate action before being sent to the White House. There was surprisingly little debate on the financial provisions of today's bill, which would authorize $3.70‐billion for antipovety programs during the fiscal yeras 1975‐77. These funds go to programs such as the following: ¶Head Start, which provides classes, recreation and meals for preschool children, $1.58billion. ¶Community Action, which aids the creation of local groups that help the poor obtain jobs and education, $1‐billion. ¶Follow Through, which gives special assistance to children going from Head Start into grade school, $180‐million. Additionally, funds would be used to aid Indians, migrant workers, pregnant women and the elderly. Federal money would also be used to purchase and distribute emergency food supplies, assist rural housing, create local consumer groups—and combat pollution. The bill, which specifically repeals the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, was sent to the Senate, where no action on it has been taken as yet. Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, which will consider the legislation, is preparing a bill of his own that would create a separate Federal agency to direct community services, rather than having them placed in the Department of Health, Education and Wel‘fare.

House Votes to End Antipoverty Agency,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/30/archives/house-votes-to-end-antipoverty-agency.html,"WASHINGTON, May 29 —The House of Representatives voted today to let the Office of Economic Opportunity die June 30 and to transfer most of its few remaining programs to a new Community Action Admin. istration. The new agency would be a part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Some O.E.O. functions have a1. ready been shifted to that de, partment and to the Labor De. partment, the Small Business Administration and Action, the agency that administers volun. teer programs such as the Peace Corps. Passage of a bill to set up the Community Action Administration and continue the remaining programs of the antipoverty agency under the Department of Health, Education and Welfare came on a 331‐to53 roll‐call. Under present law, O.E.O., which has disbursed $12.5‐billion since its creation 10 years ago, expires at the end of June. Before today's vote, few members of the House rose to mourn the end of the agency described a decade ago by President Johnson as designed to bring “total victory” in the highly publicized war against poverty. The most hotiy debated item during the four hours of floor action on the bill was an amendment, passed, 290 to 91, that would prohibit the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. The amendment, introduced by Representative Harold V. Froelich, Republican of Wisconsin, states that “No financial assistance shall be extended for medical assistance or support in cases of abortion.” Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, argued against the amendment, saying that it would result in the denial of abortions to poor people because they could not afford to pay. The Froelich amendment is similar to four others that have been added to bills in both houses recently. Two of these, amendments to the foreign aid bill and the public health bill, have already been enacted. The Senate and House voted earlier this year to take legal services out of the O.E.O. and create a new public corporation to handle the program. The final version of that bill has been approved by the House and is now awaiting Senate action before being sent to the White House. There was surprisingly little debate on the financial provisions of today's bill, w fiqb would authorize $3.70‐billion for antipovety programs during the fiscal yeras 1975‐77. These funds go to programs such as the following: Head Start, which provides classes, recreation and meals for preschool children, $1.58billion. Community Action, which aids the creation of local groups that help the poor obtain jobs and education, $1‐billion. cFollow Through, which gives special assistance to children going from Head Start into grade school, $180‐million. Additionally, funds would be used to aid Indians, migrant workers, pregnant women and the elderly. Federal money would also be used to purchase and distribute emergency food supplies, assist rural housing, create local consumer groups—and combat pollution. The bill, which specifically repeals the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, was sent to the Senate, where no action on it has been taken as yet. Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, which will consider the legislation, is preparing a bill of his own that would create a separate Federal agency to direct community services, rather than having them placed in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The community services bill has been opposed by the Nixon Administration, which sought to disband the antipoverty agency but was prevented from doing so last year by a court order. President Nixon sought to end Community Action programs, relying instead on revenue sharing as a means of keeping some of them going if local governments chose do so. Congressmen seeking to keep the intent of the antipoverty agency alive, if not the separate entity, argued that antipoverty efforts would be downgraded if Community Action programs were placed in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, rather than in a separate agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates range from three tc five million (as against nine to 10 ‘million women using oral contraceptives), with the Dalkon shield having between onequarter and one‐third of the market. Thus far, the particular complication of septic abortion has been linked only to the Dalkon shield, but the company and the Food and Drug Administration are trying to determine whether the hazard is unique to: the shield or may occur with other intrauterine devices. The F.D.A. is unable to act against any medical device until: and unless it has clearcut evidence of a hazard to health thPt in the judgment of the agency's medical advisers outwpighs the benefits of the device. The House and Senate held hearings last year on legislatitm that would give the F.D.A. authority to insist upon premarket testing and clearance of medical devices. The Senate has passed legislation to this effect, but the bill has not yet came up for a vote in the House. ‘Last year, the F.D.A. recalled another intrauterine device, the Maizlin spring, beciuse it was found to be associated with an undue number oe adverse side effects and tended to become imbedded in tlig wall of the uterus.

H.I.P. PAID FEES TO OWN OFFICIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/01/archives/hip-paid-fees-to-own-official-80000-for-abortions-went-to-board.html,"An investigation by the State Insurance Department has determined that the Health Insurance Plan (H.I.P.) paid more than $80,000 in the last 18 months to a Queens abortion center operated by Dr. Martin Gold, a member of the health plan's board of directors. The state's deputy superintendent of insurance, John Day, disclosed on Thursday that the findings of his investigators had been turned over the department's general counsel. “At minimum,” Mr. Day said, “we'll stop them from continuing this.” He said he was also considering how to get back the $80,000 for the health plan's treasury. Under an arrangement with Dr. Gold—who operates the Flushing Women's Medical Center as well as the Upper Queens Medical Group at 59‐25 Kissena Boulevard, a H.I.P. center, in partnership with Dr. Leon Oris—H.I.P. paid $70 for each abortion performed on one of its subscribers. Dr. Gold said the center did about 100 abortions a month. Allen Kornfeld, president of HIP., said yesterday that he had received no notification about the abortion payments from the State Insurance Department. “I feel very comfortable with what we are doing,” he said, “namely, to provide a benefit to the patient which would make it possible for her to have an abortion supervised as to quality of care under all safeguards by H.I.P. and to save the patient from $100 to $200 in possible hospital costs. We are not, in any way that I can see, in violation of the insurance law or the contract we have with the medical groups affiliated with H.I.P.” Dr. Gold had declared earlier that he opened the center in an effort to aid H.I.P. and that its operation had cost him more than $20,000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOW Expands the List of What It's For and What It's Against,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/01/archives/now-expands-the-list-of-what-its-for-and-what-its-against.html,"The Houston conference of the National Organization for Women, which ended with a board meeting this week, committed NOW's 700 chapters to increased action on behalf of “personhood”—a word newly prominent in the feminist vocabulary—or older women, homemakers, nurses, volunteer workers, women in sports, “aggrieved women and children of divorce,” women in poverty and even women in foreign countries. At the same time, the seventh annual conference confirmed support for the Equal Rights Amendment and opposition to any anti‐abortion amendment to the Constitution as NOW's overriding national legislative priorities. Tish Sommers of Oakland, Calif., coordinator of the NOW national task force on older women—established only last year—hailed adoption of its resolution attacking “ageism no less than sexism.” She said she considered the affirmation of equal rights for older women by the 1,600 members attending to be “comparable in significance to earlier conferences where the issue of lesbianism first hit the plenary sessions.” “We recognize and encourage as many choices for older women as for any others—in housing, in life‐style, in sexual orientation, in recreation,” the resolution said in prologue to its specific commitments. “We need to build a personhood that crosses age barriers and bridges generation gaps as well as one that helps to overcome racial, ethnic, religious and class differences, all of which serve to keep us separate and powerless.” Linked with the plight of older women was a resolution demanding that the national board “designate a fulltime employe” to implement the 1973 conference resolutions on women in poverty. The conference voted that NOW should “go international,” with official chapters and affiliations in other countries, and seek consultative status with the United Nations as a nongovernmental organization. It postponed a policy decision on whether women's sports should be fully integrated with men's or “separate but equal,” but promised to work to defeat a current Senate measure that, it said, would “legislate discrimination in revenueproducing high school and college sports.” A proposal for “a national NOW daynursery school corporation” was defeated, on the ground that “day care is the responsibility of society, not of women's organizations.” A proposal to endorse “prior rights for the mother” in contested child‐custody cases was rejected as contrary to the principle of NOW and the Equal Rights Amendment. Sears, Roebuck & Co., described in a resolution as “a major offender” against equal‐opportunity employment laws, was approved as the target of a corporate‐compliance action. The company's full‐page advertisement in the conference journal was headed, “We Don't Separate the Women from the Men.” The conference, a nondelegate assembly open to all members with time or money to attend, is NOW's highest policy‐making body. (Women, ranging from the barefoot to the silverblue‐coiffed, outnumbered men about 19 to 1). The resolutions endorsing new directions as well as longstanding objectives were only one reason for the running debate over whether the conference was or was not a “watershed” in NOW's development. A bruising, four‐candidate battle over NOW's first seriously contested election for president, described by one member as “two days in the death of NOW,” was called by another “normal family fight—by a big family growing up, and on the move without a roan map.” Karen DeCrow, 36‐year‐old Syracuse lawyer, author and lecturer, was elected over Mary Jean Collins‐Robson of Chicago, coordinator of NOW's national task forces, who was attacked with conflict‐of‐interest resolutions because NOW has printing and mailing contracts with a company owned by Mrs. Collins‐Robson and her husband, James (a NOW member who also uses their combined name). The rights of older women were defended by one of the conference's major resolutions. It was hailed for attacking ‘ageism no less than sexism.’ One result was a vote to have NOW establish guidelines for doing business with “feminist entrepreneurs” as well as with NOW officers. The long, pre‐election floor flight played hob with scheduled workshops and led to midnight plenary sessions—“I've never seen the conference so shambly,” said Kay Clarenbach of Madison, Wis., one of 28 founders of the organization in 1966. Proposals mushroomed to change either the form of the conference or the system of elections, or both. Beneath the surface was a confrontation described by some as being between radicals and conservatives; more precisely, it was between styles or tactics. “We've got to have a very loving session first thing in the morning,” Miss DeCrow was heard telling another officer just after her election was official. At the post‐conference board meeting she asked for the resignations of all national task‐force heads, who are appointed—including Mrs. Collins‐Robson, their coordinator—and it remained to be seen to what extent the procedure was pro forma. Miss DeCrow, whose service on the board since 1968 goes back longer than any other member, made clear at its meeting that board nrmbers must identify and discuss philosophic differences, according to Jo‐Ann Evans Gardner, a Pittsburgh psychologist who is eastern regional co‐director and was defeated for legal vice‐president. Miss DeCrow says she is interested in “changing the mainstream of society” while integrating women into it. She is among NOW members who favor pay for the presidency and perhaps other officers, to make them accessible to women without money or time of their own; forgoing tax‐exempt status for NOW, to increase its power through political endorsements, and more grassroots decisions and “direct highly visible actions” that, according to Dr. Gardner have diminished “since Betty Friedan got us out into the streets.” Ann Scott, legislative vice‐president and a supporter of Mrs. Collins‐Robson, denied later that she had said she “would not work with” Miss DeCrow and said that the new board and officers were “responsible and committed.” Dr. Scott said the difference 14‐tween the positions of the candidates was also “endemic in the women's movement,” with Miss DeCrow stressing “a behavioral and social‐practice revolution” somewhat different from her own prime stress on “an economic revolution that addresses itself to the real needs of real women in their daily lives —because all women are economically deprived.” Dr. Scott saw the widespread wearing of “chapter rights” political buttons as mainly a manifestation of NOW's greatest asset—a feisty chapter. “At this conference we established our own ‘affirmative‐action program’ within NOW for minority and lesbian women,” said Del Martin, a board member from San Francisco. Noting that these groups had increased their membership on the 38‐member board from three to six, she said, “We passed beyond tokenism and started to really tackle the problem.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We may also be damned if we don't,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/02/archives/the-trouble-with-a-zerogrowth-world-we-may-also-be-damned-if-we.html,"One of the dangers of swings in intellectual fashions is that ideas become accepted before their implications have begun to be explored, as yesterday's unconventional wisdom becomes transmuted into today's unquestioned orthodoxy. The success of the advocates of nongrowth in bringing about mass conversion to their view is a case in point. By now we all know what the physical world will look like by the year 2000 or so, assuming that nothing will change except that there will be more of everything. The picture of an overpopulated and overexploited world, with too many people competing for too little space, is guaranteed to chill the spines of even those agnostics who, like myself, remain skeptical about some of the more simpleminded predictions that have been made. If faith in growth—the identification of progress with rising material standards of living—is the original sin of Economic Man, then he no longer has any excuse for being unaware of the consequences if he does not repent soon. Just as the men and women of the Middle Ages were warned by the stained‐glass images in their cathedrals of the results if they did not change their sinful ways, so today's congregations are being warned by the images on their television screens of the effects if they do not repent: The vision of a hell on this earth has replaced the medieval vision of a hell in the next world. But if the arguments in favor of a nongrowth society deserve to be taken seriously, then it is imperative to explore some of the implications of moving in this direction. It is, of course, just possible that if—by some miracle—the United States were suddenly to decide to adopt a policy of nongrowth, this would simply freeze the existing social and political system in perpetuity—that the history of the future would be nothing but the rerun of the same old movie. This, however, is the least plausible of all the possible scenarios; it seems highly unlikely that it would be possible to introduce a revolutionary change in the economic basis of society without also affecting profoundly the social and political relationships of its members. The trouble is that, precisely because nongrowth would mark a sharp break with our existing habits of thought and ways of doing things, a fundamental discontinuity in our historical experience, no one can predict what would happen—while prophesying what will happen if growth continues unchecked, in its present form, is all too easy. But if it is impossible to predict, it is essential to speculate. For the paradox is that while modern societies are beginning, if all too slowly and hesitantly, to learn how to cope with some of the consequences of growth (like dealing with pollution), they are utterly unprepared to deal with the effects of nongrowth. Yet these effects, particularly if they are unanticipated and undiscussed, could be shattering. It not all that difficult to sketch out a scenario social catastrophe in a nongrowth society to equal, in its horror, the scenario of ecological catastrophe in a growth society. The starting point of such a doomsday scenario would be the Hobbesian assumption that politics in societies like the United States is about the allocation of resources. There are different groups —some ethnically defined, some economically defined—struggling to improve their position in society, as measured by their incomes, their housing, their access to education, job opportunities and so on. At present, economic growth tends to blunt the edge of this conflict. For everyone can expect to be better off next year than they were last year, even if their relative position does not change. Furthermore, it is possible for some groups actually to improve their relative position, without anyone actually being worse off in terms of hard cash. The competition for resources (social and financial) therefore a game in which everyone can win at least something. Now imagine the situation transformed by decision to halt all economic growth. Immediately the competition for resources becomes a zero‐sum game. One man's prize is another man's loss. the blacks want to improve their share of desirable goods, it can only be at the expense of the whites. If the over‐65's are to be given higher pensions, or improved medical services, it can only be at the expense of the working population or of the young. From this, it would seem only too likely that the haves would man the barricades to defend their share of resources, against the have‐nots. The politics of compromise would be replaced by the politics‐of revolution, because the have‐nots would be forced to challenge the whole basis of society, and its distribution of wealth and power. For those who think that this distribution is wrong—and that most of the compromises are cosmetic anyway—this would be a welcome confrontation; not so, however, for those who take a more optimistic view of the possibilities of change in the existing society. But the tensions created by nongrowth within single political society like the United States would be compounded, more catastrophically still, within the international political community. For again, economic growth creates at least the possibility—even if in practice it has turned out to be illusory for some nations—of a general and continuing rise in standards of living. To abjure growth, by freezing the present situation, is thus to repudiate hope. It is to condemn a majority of the globe's inhabitants to permanent poverty unless (once again) the have‐nots successfully manage to challenge the haves in order to bring about a redistribution of global resources in their own favor. It is difficult to conceive such a challenge stopping short of war; perhaps the extreme form of this particular scenario would envisage China ultimately leading a coalition of the developing countries against the bourgeois superpowers, Russia and the United States. Given this kind of political doomsday assumption, not many of us would be left alive to witness the ecological disasters predicted by the antigrowth school; the problem of overpopulation would have been solved dramatically — unpleasantly but efficiently. Like most speculations about the future, this doomsday scenario carries a contraband of undeclared assumptions in its baggage. It takes man to be an acquisitive, competitive and aggressive animal. It assumes a social ethic of work, struggle and achievement. Indeed this sort of political doomsday prediction is based on the same trick of argument as the ecological doomsday prophecy: it projects the present into the future, without allowing for the possibility that a changing situation will produce changing attitudes or policies and so falsify the forecasts. If one reverses the assumptions, if one allows for the possibility that nongrowth will in itself create a new political and social situation, then it is possible to draw up a much more optimistic scenario at the opposite end of the spectrum of possible futures. This, I suspect, is what most advocates of non growth do, if only explicitly. In the optimistic scenario, competitive man is an aberration, the product of a society dedicated to growth, which stunts and distorts its members by generating artificial wants. From this point of view, the competition for limited resources is seen not as inevitable but as socially induced, a sign of the corruption brought about by tasting the apple of economic growth.

NORTON AND COMPANY Given this approach, then, the repudiation of economic growth would in itself create the opportunity for a new kind of society to arise. This was, for instance, the view taken by one of the earliest advocates of nongrowth, John Stuart Mill, the English political philosopher, as long ago as 1848. “I confess that I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on,” Mill wrote, “that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of humankind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress.” Instead, he thought, “the best state for human nature is that in which, while no one is poor, no one desires to be richer.” And he concluded: “This condition of society, so greatly preferable to the present, is not only perfectly compatible with the stationary state, but, it would seem, more naturally allied with that state than with any The stationary state of John Stuart Mill is the nongrowth society of today, and many of his views are reflected (if in less stately prose) in the writings of people as diverse as Marcuse or Galbraith. It is worth noting, though, that while Mill thought that the United States provided the most favorable conditions for the development of such a society—since the northern and middle states had “got rid, of all social injustices and inequalities”—he was disappointed by the lack of progress in this direction: “All that these advantages seem to have done the whole of one sex is devoted to dollar‐hunting, and of the other to breeding dollar‐hunters.” In his advocacy of the stationary state, Mill was, of course, drawing on a tradition as old as Western thought, a tradition which put the emphasis not on productive work but on reflective, artistic and other noneconomic activities—a point of view which also finds an echo in the works of Karl Marx when he contemplates the future or society after the disappearance of capitalism. In this perspective, it is the growth society which is the aberration—a temporary phenomenon of the past 500 years or so, against which must be set the thousands of years of history during which nongrowth was the norm. Thus nongrowth can be seen as a resolution of social and political tensions, rather than as their cause. Stated in these deliberately crude and extreme terms, neither the pessimistic nor the optimistic scenario is particularly convincing. Both are rather like the naive scenarios fashionable in the early days of the hydrogen bomb, which postulated a simple antithesis between a universal nuclear holocaust or universal nuclear disarmament. They beg crucial questions about what is meant by a nongrowth society, about how such a society might evolve and about whether one is talking about a single nation‐state like the United States or about the world community. Nongrowth is a deceptively simple slogan. It would seem to imply a combination of zero population growth (Z.P.G.) and zero economic growth (Z.E.G.)—by which is usually meant, no further rise in the total population nor in such conventional indicators as the Gross National Product. This, in turn, would seem to suggest a rather unthreatening picture of a society continuing to enjoy its present standards of living which, in the case of the United States at any rate, are luxuriously high for the great majority. But, forgetting for a moment the international setting and making a start with the case of a single society like the United States, this particular intellectual ball of wool turns out to be a remarkable tangle which requires teasing out. The first difficulty comes in trying to relate the two components of the stable society —Z.P.G and Z.E.G.— to each other. If it is assumed that progress towards these two aims will proceed harmoniously in step, then it follows that no one's standards of living (as measured by per capita income) will fall—and the stable society appears as a well‐cushioned resting place, a plausible setting for the optimistic scenario. But it is at least possible that economic growth might stop before population growth; indeed more than likely, since it is impossible to insure a stable population in the absence of compulsory abortion or euthanasia. If so, there would actually be a fall in per capita income. In turn, this would raise some exceedingly awkward questions as to whose income should be cut: the pessimistic, social and political cutthroat scenario would seem to be rather apposite in such an event. ‘No‐growth in the United States means less growthelsewhere, given the nature of the world economy.’ Mancur Olson pointed out a further permutation in his introduction to the issue which Daedalus, journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, devoted to the subject of the No‐Growth Society (Compulsory reading for anyone interested in this subject). This was that it might be possible to combine a static economy with a falling population. In this case, there would actually be an increased income per capita, which would perhaps permit a superoptimistic scenario about a paradisiacal future combining affluence with ecological safety, social stability and social reform on behalf of deprived and underprivileged minorities. But before jumping into this or into any other future, we should do well to ask a rather different sort of question: What are the social and political processes which will produce a stable society, as distinct from the social and political problems that may be created by the emergence of such a society? The two are obviously related, in that the circumstances of the birth are bound to affect subsequent developments. The discussion so far has, like most discussions of the nongrowth society, skirted round this issue; it has rather taken it for granted that there will be a collective social revelation, resulting in a collective social decision. This, of course, is a nonsense belief, and it is precisely because this belief is widely held that much of the discussion about the stable society tends to have an element of religiosity about it, more concerned with spiritual conversion than practical realities. For the implications of even beginning to move toward a stable society are immense; political institutions would come under great pressure and social friction would grow. This contention can easily be illustrated. To return to the first element in the equation of the stable society zero population growth—there is no problem about this, only assuming that, by some instant process of education creating a generally shared consensus, all families in the United States will more or less keep to the required number of children (although there is obviously a little scope for variety, since some families may decide to have no children at all). But what if they don't? What if some ethnic groups in the population keep to their ratio, while others exceed it? Would this be acceptable? Or would it be resisted since—in the long term—voting power tends to follow population size, and therefore differential ethnic population growths would imply a change in the ethnic balance of power? The idea of actually enforcing standard family sizes (as distinct from persuading people to accept voluntary limitation and introducing financial incentives designed to encourage such a development) tends to be widely resented, anyway. The idea that such a policy should be enforced on a discriminatory basis against a particular ethnic group would, surely, he equally widely resisted. It would introduce a particularly sensitive and divisive new issue into a political system which is already under strain in dealing with current social proplems. Difficulties of a different sort, but no less formidable, arise in the case of Z.E.G. It is implausible to assume that the present economy will remain as a mummified museum piece for perpetuity, that the United States will forever go on churning out the same number of cars, television sets, Ph.D.'s and garage mechanics. A stable society does not mean a frozen society, one hopes. But allowing for the possibility—indeed necessity—of change, how is such change to be controlled? For stability does imply control. It predicates that if Firm X (or University Y) produces too much in the way of goods, then Firm Z (or University W) will have to cut production back, if the total is not to be exceeded. It means that. if health and public services are to expand and improve in quality, the resources will have to be found by cutting other items of consumption. The last point underlines the fact that progress from growth to a stable society is also likely to mean progress from a society in which most of the decisions are taken by individuals or individual firms to a society where most of the decisions are taken collectively. It means (a we are really serious about Z.E.G.) more central control over the production and allocation of resources. This is not necessarily a distressing prospect. Collective decision‐making must not be confused with totalitarian decision‐making, and it has indeed been argued by J. K. Galbraith and others that present‐day American society offers the illusion rather than the reality of individual decision‐making, since not only are these decisions affected by the brain‐washing activities of Madison Avenue but take place in an economic and social environment controlled by the “techno‐structure” of big business and government. But it would clearly impose extra burdens on existing political institutions. As it is, there is already much debate about the adequacy of Congressional control over the executive and a widespread feeling that the present balance is unsatisfactory. However, progress towards Z.E.G. would demand a more powerful executive backed by a more all‐embrac ing bureaucracy. In turn, this would imply yet a further shift in the balance between Congress and the executive—between accountability and centralized power — unless there was an accompanying change in the political institutions of the United States deliberately designed to meet this danger. Collective decision‐making also ought to be distinguished, though, from giving greater priority to collective services for society as a whole. On the whole, advocates of the stable society also tend to be advocates of the provision of more collective goods: more hospitals and fewer private cars, to encapsulate the standard argument. But while in a growing economy public and private affluence can go handin‐hand, they part company in a stable society. The choice becomes sharpened in conditions of Z.E.G., and it certainly cannot be taken for granted that there would be a consensus in favor of allowing the rise in expenditure on health, education and pollution control to continue if this would actually mean a reduction in private consumption (it's all too easy to forget that measures designed to improve the environment or control pollution actually cost money, and therefore appear in the Gross National Product. It is just possible—if one actually does believe Professor Galbraith's contention the people only want the gadgetry of modern technology because of the artificial pressures of the admen—that a collective decision would go in favor of more collective goods. However, it might be as well to consider seriously the possibility that the collective decision might be in favor of more private goods. If so, the result might paradoxically be more pollution and more political tension, since less would be spent on cleaning up the environment and on making the inner cities acceptable places in which to live. If this were the outcome, progress toward a stable so ciety would actually increase social stress. At this stage in the argument, however, it is necessary to reveal yet another concealed assumption. So far, have tended to accept what might be called the social‐engineering view of social change: that, given the political will and a little tinkering with the machinery of administration, it is practically possible to bring about certain desired changes. Only the selfevident difficulties of persuading a population to accept the personal implications of the general idea of Z.P.G. have been touched far. But, in returning to Z.E.G., it is far from clear that in the present state of knowledge, it is actually possible to exercise the sort of precise, finger‐tip control which is implied by the idea of nongrowth. The evidence, rather, appears to point in the opposite direction. But if, in fact, the economy continues to perform on a cyclical pattern, then it would seem—if Z.E.G. is to retain any meaning at all—that if by some unfortunate mishap the economy were to grow in one year, there would have to be a compensating fall in the following year. The manic‐depressive pattern of economic management of recent decades might well be reinforced, with deeper and sharper recessions deliberately engineered to compensate for accidental growth —what might be called an economic abortion program. In turn, such a policy of economic management would once more entail political friction, deepening rather than narrowing divisions between the various economic, ethnic and social groups in American society. All this may seem unnecessarily pessimistic, deliberately stressing the negative aspects of the evolution toward an American society based on nongrowth while neglecting the possibility of agreed and harmonious change. But the picture of possible futures painted so far appears positively cheerful and encouraging if the wider, global setting is also considered. Again, there is a whole spectrum of scenarios, offering various mixes of gloom and optimism. For example, one possibility might be a unilateral decision by the United States to introduce no‐growth in one country, on the reasonable enough argument that the American dream has been fulfilled in economic terms. Clearly such a conscious decision (always assuming that it is psychologically plausible and politically possible) would, in itself, tend to create that sense of dedication which would be required to cope with the problems so far discussed. Still, even this sort of ideological and economic isolationism would come under severe pressures. It would have to survive, for example, the spectacle of other countries—particularly in Western Europe — overtaking the United States in terms of percapita income. In practice, though, it is difficult to take this particular scenario seriously. For even a unilateral American decision in favor of Z.E.G. has implications for the rest of the world. No‐growth in the United States means less growth elsewhere, given the nature of the world economy. In effect, therefore, the United States would be taking a paternalistic decision with damaging effect on much poorer nations (again, it's worth noting that, just as expenditure on improving the environment shows up in the national accounts, so does expenditure on foreign aid—and that both might be a casualty of Z.E.G.). Leaving aside the morality of such a course, it obviously has considerable implications for American foreign policy and the balance of power throughout the world. Economic isolationism implies political isolationism. ‘Futurology is useful only as a game, stirring up discussion about what might otherwise be neglected policy options.’ Abandoning this particular scenario, therefore, and accepting that the United States is inescapably a member of the global community, it then follows that the problems of a nongrowth society have to be considered in this wider context. The sorts of difficulties which have been discussed within the setting of a single country must now be translated in terms applicable to international society. Again, there are the problems of distribution—this time not as between ethnic groups and social classes, but as between different countries. Again, there are the problems of enforcing policy decisions—this time not in terms of strengthening the governmental machine of a single country but the mechanisms of international control. It hardly needs pointing out that while all the problems would be that much more severe, the means for tackling them are at present effectively nonexistent. Indeed, what does the concept of a stable society imply when applied to the world community? Obviously the idea of Z.P.G. has even more urgency when applied on a global scale than in the case of a single country like the United States, since it is the soaring numbers in the underdeveloped and developing countries which help to per petuate their poverty. Equally obviously, though, the difficulties of actually enforcing such a policy are compounded; indeed it is seen by some countries, notably by China, a threat to their power. But it is the idea or Z.E.G. on a global scale which is politically implausible. This would in effect mean condemning the majority of the world's population to poverty for the rest of time. But if this is a nonsense way of interpret ing global Z.E.G., who is to decide which nations get how much? Who will ration out permission for growth? What are the standards—in terms of per capita income—which are going to be the upper limit of permissible growth? Assuming that there would be no voluntary agreement, based on an international consensus, on points like these, the most likely outcome would be an attempt by the prosperous nations (whether capitalist or Communist) to enforce their policies on the rest of the world. In turn, such an attempt would be seen—and resisted—as an effort to make the world a pleasant place for the prosperous to live in, at the expense of the poor—a new form of colonial exploitation. However, the developing countries might well decide to push for a redistribution of the global income in their own favor, using their control over what are going to become increasingly scarce natural resources like oil and various metals as their weapon. The “have” countries might actually be faced with the possibility of accepting a fall in their standards of living or engaging in an economic confrontation — possibly shading off into a military one —with the “have‐nots.” The stable society, in population and economic terms, might turn out to be, in political and military terms, a singularly unstable one. In discussing the possibility of such developments, there is always the danger that one will be misunderstood to be predicting a particular outcome. This is far from being the intention of this article. For the only certain aspect of the future is that it will be a great deal more complex than the sort of simplified scenario that it is possible to construct. Futurology is useful only to the extent that it is seen as an intellectual game, creating an awareness of possibilities that might otherwise be ignored and stirring up discussion about what might otherwise be neglected policy options. Indeed, by far the most plausible scenario does not involve anything even remotely resembling a deliber ate policy decision to adopt a nongrowth policy, but a muddled, half‐conscious drift — a gradual emphasis on new priorities, like trading economic growth for more leisure time, hesitantly and perhaps even inconsistently pursued over a period of decades as social values evolve. In this scenario, the change would first become apparent in the societies of economic satiety, like the United States, and slowly percolate elsewhere; conspicuous nonconsumption, on this reading of the situation, is the luxury of the well‐to‐do and the paradox may be that the acceptance of nongrowth in itself depends on the achievement of growth (just as population control seems to catch on only when it is seen as a way of increasing living standards. Leaning on history, this scenario might then suggest that a society which had adopted the values of nongrowth would be introvert rather than extrovert, traditional rather than innovative. Whether it had settled for an egalitarian distribution of wealth or for the perpetuation of inequalities, it would be resistant to change, stressing social control as the inevitable counterpart of social stability. There would be little social mobility, since this tends to be a product of eco nomic growth. There might well evolve a gerontocracy, with power going hand in hand with seniority, since it would no longer be open to the young to secede from existing organizations to start their own. The only frontiers that would be open for exploration would be those of artistic or spiritual activity. The resemblance of the picture to medieval society in Western Europe is not accidental. For that was a society which was based on nongrowth, whose mold was indeed broken only when the Protestant ethic of economic achievement became the ideology of the newly developing capitalism. It would be absurd to push the parallel too far a society which commands technological resources of infinite potential, but refrains from using them to their full limits to create extra economic wealth, cannot be equated with one which was ravaged by starvation and the plague. But perhaps it is worth remembering that building cathedrals can go hand in hand with burning heretics, that emphasizing spiritual rather than material values does not necessarily imply tolerance, that a sense of community may be achieved at the cost of accepting social hierarchy. This is not to imply that nongrowth will, inevitably, bring about such a situation —any more than growth will, inevitably, bring about ecological disaster. It is to suggest, however, that nongrowth may carry certain social and political risks just as growth may carry certain ecological dangers, and that it may need a determined effort to avoid both ■ ‘Nongrowth may carry social and political risks, just as growth may carry certain ecological dangers.’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forces Against Abortion Assemble, With Optimism",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/02/archives/force-against-abortion-assemble-with-optimism-ideas-trends-the.html,"WASHINGTON — Once again this week, physicians and geneticists will read their learned papers to a small group of earnestly attentive Senators and an audience sporting plastic roses. Outside on Capitol Hill, technicolor pictures of fetuses will be handed out to passersby. That is, there is another hearing scheduled on two proposed constitutional amendments that would effectively prohibit abortion for any woman for any reason. They have been introduced, and are being supported, by those who wish by this means to overturn the January, 1973, Supreme Court decisions that effectively did away with state restrictions on abortion. The red plastic roses are carried by people who describe themselves as “pro‐life.” They are not unaware that this description puts their opponents in the position of being somehow “antilife” or “prodeath.” The roses symbolize the babies they see as being killed by abortion. Those who wear them are enthusiasts, some have used the word fanatics. And their cause has had some successes. The two amendments are given little or no chance of passage in this election year. But the antiabortion movement, and the climate it has created, has contributed to significant legislative riders. The foreign aid bill was amended to prohibit the use of American aid dollars for abortion. A public health bill was amended to allow any physician or hospital to refuse to perform an abortion on the grounds of conscience. Who, and how many, are in the movement, is difficult to establish. There is a National Right to Life Committee, incorporated as a nonprofit organization last year, after several years of formal affiliation with the United States Catholic Conference. It claims about 10,000 individual subscribers to its monthly newsletter; and 864 informally affiliated groups on its computer list. It is a single‐issue group. And so are the occupational local and state organizations that make up its troops, with names such as National Nurses for Life; “Lifespan” in Detroit, and Americans Against Abortion. Many of its members, probably the largest single group, are Roman Catholics, many others belong to more or less fundamentalist religious sects. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments has already held a series of hearings on the two proposed amendments. One, introduced by Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, would prohibit abortion under any circumstances. The other, sponsored by Conservative‐Republican Senator James L. Buckley of New York, among others, would allow abortion in “emergency” cases, when the mother's death would be certain unless the pregnancy was terminated. The parade of witnesses has included four Roman Catholic Cardinals. Their appearance, some believe, may have been an embarrassment to the movement's efforts to disassociate itself from the widely held notion that it is a front organization for the church. Most of the other witnesses have been scientists. They have debated such remote issues as whether or not the moment when identifiably human life begins has been scientifically determined. The Opposition The opposition is generally smaller, and quieter, although some of its literature is equally lurid. It features photographs of the sprawled, naked corpses of women who have died as the result of self‐induced or criminal abortions. Right‐to‐Lifers, when they are asked how they propose to deal with the social problems, that many see resulting from antiabortion laws, tend to say that, of course, those problems are vital and will be dealt with. Few couples now, for example, want to adopt black or racially mixed illegitimate babies. The Rev. Warren A. Schaller Jr., an Episcopal priest who serves as the national group's paid director, said this was “a good question,” and one that he could not answer. He added that a pending bill that would give tax breaks to adoptive parents to cover the initiat costs of the adoption procedure was the sort of legislation that the group “may very well support.” What many who oppose the proposed constitutional amendments fear is that not only that might they pass (as the efforts of another small, unhappy and determined band succeeded some 50 years ago in making it illegal to have a drink). They fear that a ban on abortions would lead, inevitably, to attempts to ban certain forms of contraception, such as intrauterine devices, which may be abortifacients, and the so‐called “morning‐after” pill. The antiabortion forces, a predicted 2,000 strong, will be meeting here at the end of the week at the Shoreham Hotel for their annual convention. There will be panels and discussions and speeches. The keynote address will be from astronaut Joseph Kerwin, a physician who was interviewed in “National Right to Life News” last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A talk with Simone de Beauvoir,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/02/archives/a-talk-with-simone-de-beauvoirr-marriage-is-an-alienating.html,"PARIS. “I don't want my life to obey any other will but my own,” Simone de Beauvoir wrote in her diary when she was 19. She has indeed made her own life, and the will of others has played a remarkably small part in it. She always wanted to write; now at 66 she is one of France's most admired and best‐selling authors. Her lifelong close relationship with JeanPaul Sartre, the existentialist philosopher and novelist, is legendary, yet she never married him. She spoke of being “faithful and free” and had several affairs. She has no children. She always longed to travel and there are few countries she has not visited. She said recently: “I envy no one. I am perfectly happy with life as it is. If I had to start my life all over again I would not make it otherwise.” I went to talk with Mile. de Beauvoir in her studio flat in Paris—she was granting me one of her very rare interviews. The studio, overlooking the Montparnasse cemetery and just around the corner from where she was born, is in an ugly nineteen‐thirties block of flats. Two walls of the main room are lined with books and records; two divan beds, covered in yellow rep, with brown and green cushions, act as sofas. Mile. de Beauvoir, a short, handsome woman, with hair severely braided on the top of her head, and cold eyes set wide apart, moves around it with no impression of belonging, rather as if it were a friend's house, or a hotel room. (She has never been interested in possessions, and until she was 46 lived mainly in hotels.) At first she appears abrupt, unsmiling and humorless, with an intense, harsh voice. She has been described, with some malice, as a “clock inside a fridge,” but her friends speak of her as a shy, generous, immensely disciplined woman, with something of the good secretary about her, who has done a number of things in her life not because she really wanted to, but because she felt that she owed it to her philosophy to do them. Since she stopped work three years ago on the fourth volume of her autobiography, “All Said and Done” (just published in England), Mile. de Beauvoir has returned to the subject that first made her famous outside France: the aeration of women. Most of her conversations today seem to lead back to this theme. “The Second Sex” was published in 1949 and sold 22,000 copies during the first week in France—it has since sold nearly a million in paperback in America alone. “One is not born, but rather becomes a woman,” she wrote then. “It is civilization as. whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.” Women were oppressed and subjugated, conditioned from birth to expect mediocre, dependent lives. It is 25 years since the book first appeared, and I asked Mile. de Beauvoir whether she feels that women have made any real gains in that time. “No, there hasn't been the change I hoped for,” she said. “That's why I'm caught up in the movement again. “What is good is that women are now depending very much less on men than I did when I wrote ‘The Second Sex.’ I believed then that one could work with honest men, and that the progress of Socialism was closely linked with the progress of women's liberation. But I was wrong. In Socialist countries men and women are still far from being equal. I strongly agree with the theses of the women's movement. There are two things we have to fight: One is capitalism, the other patriarchal attitudes. And yet even after capitalism is defeated, we will still be far from overthrowing these patriarchal attitudes.” While her real interests lie in France, Mile. de Beauvoir keeps up her contacts with women in the movement in many countries; they write to her, send her their theses on her work, come and see her when they can. “American women too are disappointed by what has happened,” she says, “because the stronger the movement becomes, the greater is the reaction to it. “There are still many women in the United States who want to keep their secondary role, they actually want a feminine role. So the leaders, the women who started it all, are disappointed. They believe that their radical, extremist movement has been taken over by women who call themselves ‘liberal,’ which basically means that they are very middle class, want to improve some aspects of woman's position, but not to make women effectively equal.” Though many of Mile. de Beauvoir's supporters feel that her ideas have never received the recognition they deserve —“People were not ready for what she said in 1949, and since then they have forgotten just how radical it was at the time,” says one Frenchwoman—she has nonetheless become required reading for anyone interested in the liberation of women, and something of a cult figure in France. “The Second Sex” was not greeted with much enthusiasm in 1949, however. “It was very, very badly received here,” Mile. de Beauvoir says. “I was astonished by people's reactions. “Camus was furious; he reacted with typical Mediterranean machismo, saying I had ridiculed the French male. Professors hurled the book across the room. People sniggered at me in restaurants. The fact Cat I had spoken about female sexuality was absolutely scandalous at the time. Men kept drawing attention to the vulgarity of the book, essentially because they were furious at what the book was suggesting—equality between the sexes.” The force of this hostility came as a shock to her. “In the life I was leading then, there wasn't much difference between men and women. It was not until after ‘The Second Sex’ was published that I noticed that some of my male friendships were really very eceptive.” Mile. de Beauvoir has returned to the attack today on several fronts. “We are devoting an entire issue of Les Temps Modernes [the leftwing paper she, Sartre and le cercle intime, a small group of close friends, have been editing since the war] to women, written by women, for women. “Then we've started a sexist column in the paper: Since December we have collected all the insults, all the stupidities written about women to try to shame men. We are also setting up an association, of which I am president, to be called the League for the Rights of Women, which will take up cases of discrimination against women. We'll have an office, somewhere, that people can visit, one evening a week, or to which they can write, to report instances of discrimination.” Until recently, Mile. de Beauvoir was also president of Choisir, a pressure group dealing with abortion, which is still illegal in France. She was one of a group of prominent women who signed an abortion manifesto, making it clear that she had had an abortion herself. “A new law is being proposed on abortion in France,” she told me, “but make no mistake, it will be just as conservative as the last one, just as irrelevant. We want free and legal abortions, paid for by social security, so that women can be mistresses of their own bodies and their own decisions.” Freedom for women is a basic theme in her work, the notion that women must be true to themselves, and not live as women through men. She based “The Second Sex” on the ethics of existentialism, the moral imperative that every human being must have the right to engage in freely chosen activity. And she frequently attacks any relationship in which both parties are not equally free, or in which women are treated as objects rather than equal human beings. In “The Second Sex” she wrote that the principle of marriage was obscene because it transformed into rights and duties an exchange which should be founded on spontaneous attraction. She says now: “I don't think the whole social system should be based on marriage. It's hard to say what should be put in its place, but the fact that one criticizes it doesn't mean that. one has to find something to replace it. After all, the American slaves didn't ask themselves what was going to happen to the American economy when they won their freedom. “I think marriage is a very alienating institution, for men as well as for women. I think it's a very dangerous institution—dangerous for men, who find themselves trapped, saddled with a wife and children to support; dangerous for women, who aren't financially independent and end up by depending on men who can throw them out when they are 40; and very dangerous for children, because their parents vent all their frustrations and mutual hatred on them. The very words ‘conjugal rights’ are dreadful. Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one.” Looking at Mile. de Beauvoir's life, you see how determinedly she has lived her theories. She met Sartre when she was 20 and he was 23. For 45 years they have seen each other—except on rare occasions—every day, but apart from a short spell immediately after the war when they lived on separate floors in the same hotel, they have never shared a house. They have always addressed each other as vous not tu. A friend tells of visiting them one afternoon in 1948 in the flat Sartre shared with his mother and finding Sartre and Mile. de Beauvoir working in different rooms, like children doing their homework. Mile, de Beauvoir has always protected Sartre from too many visitors, watching that he doesn't drink too much or catch cold. She even tried to stop him getting a television lest it interfere with his work. As a friend of theirs put it: “In their own way they seem to have resuscitated the old bourgeois couple. They live apart, but when you come down to it there are just the two of them.” Others, he added, have paid the price for it: Both Sartre and Mile. de Beauvoir have had many affairs, and not all their partners have emerged very contented with the situation. “We have pioneered our own relationship—its freedom, intimacy and frankness,” Mile, de Beauvoir wrote in her autobiography. “We had also, rather less successfully, thought up the idea of the ‘trio,’” The trio, which she was later to call a “machine doucement infernale,” usually consisted of herself, Sartre and a woman friend of Sartre's. Yet for all her freedom there seems little doubt that she was jealous in the ordinary way. “She was acutely aware of rivals,” says Mme. Henriette Nizan, wife of Sartre's great friend who died during the war. “She steered them away just as anyone else would have done.” And there is no lack of testimony for her real love of Sartre. “For 45 years they have really been interested in each other,” a young friend says. “They really listen and look at each other.” And in her autobiography Mile. de Beauvoir wrote: “I knew that no harm could ever come to me from him—unless he were to die before I did.” Twenty years ago, she said to Mme. Nizan: “If Sartre died, I wonder what I would do. Perhaps I would commit suicide.” Nor is there much doubt about Sartre's affection for her. “I found her beautiful, have always found her beautiful,” he has said. “I wanted to meet her because she was beautiful, because she had the sort of looks that I like.” She may, however, have been irritated by the rest of his sentence: “The wonderful thing about Simone de Beauvoir is that she has the intelligence of a man . . . and the sensitivity of a woman.” However much she may have disliked this distinction applied to herself, Mile. de Beauvoir has never denied that there is a great difference between men and women; but she insists that it is culturally determined. “I think the difference begins immediately, at birth. Even such a ridiculous thing as choosing a pink or a blue blanket means that the parents start discriminating,” she said to me. “By the age of I the little boy has already been turned into a boy, the little girl into a girl. I was very struck by a psychoanalyst read recently who said that if masculinity isn't built up in a little boy then he turns out just as feminine—if you can call it that—as a little girl.” It is not enough, she points out, for parents to try to provide an identical upbringing for boys and girls, because everything with which children come into contact‐the stories they read, the clothes they wear, the toys they are given — show them clearly that they are meant to be unalike. “To achieve perfect equality you would have to start at the very roots, reconstruct an entire educational system, and, to do that, a totally new society. Boys and girls should be given exactly the same experience, as I hear they are trying in nursery schools in Sweden and Denmark. “Cleanliness, for instance, should not just be handled by mother or women teachers. Fathers should do just as much cleaning up. Just as there should be men nursery teachers, so that boys grow up thinking that a man looks after children, too. But all this is terribly difficult without a basic change in society.” However, more has to be done than simply improving the expectations of girls. “To change the mentality of women one would also need to change that of men, so as to create a person in which is combined the best of man and the best of woman.” Childhood plays a central role in Mile. de Beauvoir's theories. It is during childhood that the foundations of future strength and temperament are laid. “I think that one can never really understand someone properly unless one has grasped the keys of his childhood,” she says. “It's very important—it was important for me—to have a very happy early childhood, to have been a wanted child. After that you can face up to all sorts of difficulties. ‘She tried to stop Sartre from getting a TV lest it interfere with his work.’ “If you haven't been happy very young, you can still be happy later on, but it's much harder. You need more luck, you have fewer resources within yourself, and fewer possibilities of enjoying the world. In order to love reading, you have to have loved it very early; to love traveling you have to have enjoyed exploring. ft's good to have had a childhood in which you haven't been dried out, or humiliated: that's what gives the gift of happiness.” I asked her what she thought was the best setting for a child. “Family life rarely provides the best background,” she said. “A mixture of people is needed . . . you have to take children out of the suffocating family cell. Perhaps a kibbutz, though that is another form of tyranny; children there escape their parents but are under the tyranny of their peers. Perhaps some kind of community, some way of having children living together with several adults. . .” Mile. de Beauvoir herself received the gift of happiness. “I was endowed,” she says, “with what is known as a happy disposition.” She was the elder—and the favorite—of two girls born to an uppermiddle‐class family; her father was assistant to an established lawyer, and an amateur actor. Her father was also an atheist, and it was the contrast between her mother's conventional piety and her father's “pagan ethical standards” which, Mile. de Beauvoir told me, made her start thinking for herself. “This conflict between them was a good thing for me, because it meant that I couldn't fasten on to either of them and had to decide for myself. Conflict can, of course, be upsetting. But for me, coming as it did when I was 13, and after a very secure childhood, it was certainly a good thing.” At 15 she lost her faith and went through a difficult and rebellious period. (Her father used to say, “Simone has a man's brain; she thinks like a man; she is a man.”) M. de Beauvoir's financial ruin forced his daughter suddenly to start preparing herself for a career. “So I was freed. It's financial independence that counts. Help girls to study; that's how they are going to be freed.” To earn one's living is not an end in itself, she adds, but it is the only way to achieve securely based inner independence. Her own freedom took her to the Sorbonne where she met Sartre and Andre Herbaud, who gave her the nickname by which she is still known today: Le Castor Beaver. (“You are a beaver. Beavers like company and they have a constructive bent.”) By the age of 18 she was convinced that intellect and culture were more desirable than material wealth, that her future lay in literature, and that she had no life other than as a writer. Kafka, Proust and Joyce are the authors she most admired; she admits that Hemingway's technique influenced her. “The way he wrote about all the things that one does in life, the way people drink, the way they eat, the very fact of putin all those details.” Mme. Nizan, who first met her in the Sorbonne days, says that both Mile. de Beauvoir and Sartre lived in chaos. “There were combs, brushes, toothpaste, dirty plates all scattered around the hotel rooms they lived in. They weren't a bit concerned about disorder. And Simone always gave the impression of being in mourning: she often wore black and her clothes were always neat. Later, though. when she traveled, she brought exotic things to wear back with her.” By then Mile. de Beauvoir had already decided that she did not want children. “When she met me in the park pushing my baby along in its pram,” says Mine. Nizan, “she was appalled. She found the whole idea of children incredible and terrible.” For 10 years, though writing a good deal, she never managed to produce anything good enough for publication. She earned her living as a teacher in lycées. It was not until “She Came to Stay” was accepted by the publisher Gallimard in 1943, when she was 35, that she gave up teaching. She had never been really discouraged by her early failure. “I am by no means insensitive to praise or blame,” she explains in her autobiography. “Yet, if I dig down into myself, it is not long before I reach a bedrock of almost total indifference to the extent of success.” The war changed her. “My real encounter with the world and politics was the war,” she told me. “I realized I had led a very sheltered life. I lived the war with the feeling that I was a pawn of political forces.” Like Sartre and the group of friends with whom she spent her time, Mile. de Beauvoir was a Marxist, but she had never been as much involved in politics as the others. “Then during the war I took a strong, violent opposition to the Nazis . . . since then I have never ceased to be involved. But I've never been militant, never joined a party, because no party has ever completely suited me.” Both she and Sartre were close to the Communists immediately after the war —a period she described in “The Mandarins,” a novel which won her the Prix Goncourt in 1954 — but soon the labor camps and the lack of free speech in Russia alienated them from the party. To this day both she and Sartre occupy a rather isolated position in the French left wing. “It's very hard to keep one's political independence, one's own views on some points,” she told me. She is, however, still hostile to the right, and the French bourgeoisie always plays the villain's part in her writing. Her undefined position on the left has never prevented her from championing an immense range of left‐wing causes and groups. Mile. de Beauvoir, like Sartre, has given her name to magazines and papers—the Idiot Internationale, for instance—to prevent them from being closed down, on the ground that the authorities would be less ‘likely to take action against prominent literary figures. She was outspoken on the war in Algeria — she wrote a book about an Algerian girl, Djamala Boupacha, tortured by the French—was a member of Bertrand Russell's anti‐Vietnam committee, and has campaigned strongly for better social conditions in France, on every issue from safety in factories to abortion reform. “People have said I take too peremptory a tone in my essays,” she once wrote. “I don't think so. The best way to explode a bag of hot air is not to pat it but to dig one's nails into it.” Few of her causes, however, have turned out quite as she hoped they would. She was disillusioned by the French after Algeria, and by the beginning of the nineteensixties gave up her revolutionary hopes for the West and turned to the Third World. There, too, she has been disappointed. “No, I think that for the moment there is no socialism,” she said. “I think that for the proletariat, or a government representing It, to own the means of production is not enough to change the relationship between people. That's what is really important, to change relationships between people.” Nor has Algeria produced the socialist system she hoped for. “I don't think it has worked out at all in Algeria. It is state socialism, but that's nothing to do with real socialism. And then the thing that really revolts me in Algeria, as in all the Moslem countries, is the condition of women. I can't accept the way they oppress their women; veil them, impose forced marriages on them. Frantz Fanon thought they would become emanicpated after the Algerian war. On the contrary, they have been crushed.” Mile. de Beauvoir has some praise for China, however, which she visited in 1956. “I know it's easy to construct myths about countries that are very far away, but in China they do seem to be making an effort towards real equality. They are also trying to emancipate children, by giving them a share in the production, small roles of their own, and by teaching them to do meaningful things. That gives children a sort of dignity. They are trying to turn children into citizens from very early on, and stop them being merely the possessions of their parents, and that is an excellent thing.” She denies, though, that the failure of many of the things she believed in has made her pessimistic, something she was widely accused of being when she wrote at the end of the third volume of her autobiography: “Turning an incredulous gaze toward that young and credulous girl, realize with stupor how much I was duped.” Critics then were quick to attribute her disillusionment to her loss of faith, to the fact that she was childless, to her unconventional life. “I wouldn't say that I am pessimistic,” she told me. “I have a fundamental optimism. I am healthy. I have a life. I have plans. When I do things, I believe they are going to work out. What I meant by ‘duped’ was that I had discovered that the world is horrible—there is no other word for it—and that one cannot isolate one's own destiny from that of the world. If, like me, you have had a privileged bourgeois childhood, you are promised a happy life in a happy world. But then I discovered that men are unhappy, that the world is a dreadful place, and that one cannot be happy in isolation. This happiness is only a sort of snare, and that's of being duped.” ‘We have to fight two things,’ she says, ‘capitalism and patriarchal attitudes.’ Mile. de Beauvoir says that she wrote about women in “The Second Sex” because, wanting to write about herself, she realized that she would first have to discover what it was to be a woman. She took up her second cause, old age, for the same sort of reason. “I realized that I was aging, and that all my friends were getting older, and I saw that it posed a lot of problems,” she said. “I wondered whether to write a novel about old age. I did write a short story about it —‘The Age of Discretion’—but it wasn't very good, mainly because the subject is too big to tackle in this way. So then I decided that the best thing to do was to face up to the problem head on, and simply write about old age.” Once again, what attracted her was the idea of “demystification, doing away with cant and humbug. What I came to see when I wrote my book is that old people don't exist as a separate category. Women exist; they are women all their lives, and you can see clearly the ways in which they are discriminated against. But discrimination against the old is kept hidden; they can all vote, and some of them are very powerful. The split in class is very inportant. There is an immense difference between an old tramp and an old oil millionaire. One can just imagine, though it doesn't exist yet, a movement of solidarity among women; but one can't possibly imagine solidarity among the old. “So how do you improve their position? Once again it's a question of politics. It's too late to start thinking about what can be done to amuse a man when he's 60. His whole life has broken him by then. A man should have a man's life, have leisure and culture, and should not have been exploited.” It is not enough to have more generous old‐age policies, higher pensions, better housing and organized leisure. “It is the whole system that is at issue, and our claim cannot be otherwise than radical—change life itself. “The least unhappy old people among the poor are those who have lived in the country. A man who has spent his life interested in flowers, in the garden, and in animals can keep his interests when he is old, and stay alive until he dies. But a miner, or a craftsman, has absolutely nothing to do when he is old.” Mile. de Beauvoir argues that old age is a rare occasion when women come out on top. “Old age is better for women than for men. First of all, they have less far to fall, since their lives are more mediocre than those of most men. And then they still have their homes, their housework, cooking, their children . . . all the ‘feminine’ culture.” Aging and death have always obsessed her, and she says that from the moment when she first knew she was mortal, the idea of death has terrified her. Her mother died when Mile. de Beauvoir was 55; she was never very close to her mother, but the account of her death is probably one of the most moving and least guarded passages in the entire autobiography. ‘It's important to have a happy early childhood,’ she says. ‘If you haven't been happy when young, you can still be happy later on, but it's harder. You need more luck.’ Mile. de Beauvoir is in fact at her best when she is writing from direct observation or about things that have actually happened to her. She admits that she has always found reality more “rewarding than the mirages of the imagination.” It is no coincidence that her life and her causes have made their way into all her books; that “She Came to Stay,” for instance, is a novel about the trio, and “The Woman Destroyed” is a cautionary tale about the dependency of women on men. The searchlight she focused on her friends did not go over very well with everyone. Nelson Algren, the American writer with whom she had an affair for several years, vented his rage at finding himself unmistakably portrayed as Lewis in “The Mandarins” by a very malicious article published in Playboy not long ago. Certainly no one could accuse her of being soft, either on her friends, or on herself. “What one must do is perpetually pull oneself to the surface of life,” she has written, “keep oneself above the void, and above all recognize the importance of each single individual.” She has worked hard at these aims, and no one has been more concerned with equality and justice than she has been. Her whole life has been very disciplined and hardworking. Her books have each taken two to three years to write; she works slowly, rewriting page by page, chapter by chapter, about six hours a day, with a break in the summer for her annual six weeks in Rome with Sartre. “A day in which I don't write,” she has said, “leaves a taste of ashes.” She is said to have rewritten “The Mandarins” twice, on Sartre's instructions. And she has also signed manifestoes, gone on marches, writ ten political articles, made speeches, talked to women from the woman's movement, and to the many students writing about her work; she has kept diaries and written letters. An excellent memory explains the incredibly detailed autobiography. She has never led a social life, but frequently sees her few close friends — some of them former lovers. “Chatter doesn't interest me,” she said. This slightly self‐righteous tone quite often creeps into her conversation; not without reason, a critic once accused her of being more a moralist than anything else. There is little humor in her; she takes herself very seriously. She is also something of a puritan. On the very rare occasions when she writes about physical relationships, she is ill at ease, striking an awkward, rather false note. She is intensely self‐contained, letting little of herself show through her possessions, and she makes no concessions in her wary and abrupt way of talking. She says that as a child she saw grays and halftones everywhere; they seem to have become very black and White since then. Behind this fluent exterior it is hard to see whether her recipe for freedom has really worked; just how honest is she being when she glosses over her own and Sartre's affairs? She condemns weakness, yet how self‐indulgent is she in the book after book that she writes about herself? And she has certainly not answered all the questions. There is of course no need for her to have had children to speak about them—this is the point she rightly makes about women and freedom. But this is one aspect of women's lives she knows very little about. The look she has taken at the world is a very cerebral one. Her own summing up of herself is perhaps the best one can give: “I have not brought the shimmer of feelings back to life, nor caught the outer world in words. But that was not my aim. I wanted to make myself exist for others by conveying, as directly as I could, the taste of my own life.” ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRAZIL IS SEEKING A HIGH BIRTH RATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/03/archives/brazilis-seeking-a-high-birth-rate-cites-economic-strategic-and.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO, May 29—Brazilians are deeply divided over population policy, but the prevailing view appears to be that there is power in numbers. While most countries are sending delegations to the World Population Conference in Bucharest in August to discuss ways to control the population explosion, the Brazilian contingent plans to defend till right to growth. Brazil has an area as large as the territorial United States, with a fast‐growing population of 104 million, a high rate of economic growth and serious aims to become a world power. According to recent studies by Brazil's National Security Council, only India, Canada and Brazil have the geographic conditions and economic potential to become new work powers. At the present rate of growth, Brazil is expected to r?? big‐power status in 20 years, with a gross national product of more than $180‐billion and a population of inure than 200 million. The Brazilian Government, which drafted its position several months ago for the population conference, which the United Nations is sponsoring, wants to reject any action to limit Brazilian population increase and to oppose any general plan for population control that does not take into account regional differences, according to sources close to the Government. Threefold Argument The Brazilian position is backed by a threefold argument that can be considered a credo of the military system that has ruled Brazil for the last decade. The first point is that there is a need to occupy the vast, sparsely inhabited regions of the north and west, to insure national sovereignty. Then there is said to be a need to create a large, strong internal market to develop national trade and industry. Finally, Brazilians say, there is a need to meet the minimum population requirement to become a world power. Initially, it was reported that the new Government headed by Gen. Ernesto Geisel might alter the population policy of this largely Roman Catholic nation. President Geisel, who took office two months ago, is a Protestant. Furthermore, the new Minister of Finance, Mario Henrique Simonsen, is known to be a partisan of birth control. However, President Geisel's closest aide and adviser is Gen. Golbery Couto e Silva, one of the chief theorists of the military Government, who believes that population growth is necesssary for national security. Brazil's military rulers have usually found themselves at odds with Catholic church leaders and left‐wing intellectuals, but there is general agreement on the population issue, although for different reasons. Traditional Arguments Right‐wing church leaders such as Vicente Cardinal Scherer of Põrto Alegre give the traditional Catholic arguments against birth control. However, church liberals speak very much like the military on the population question. The Most Rev. Lucas Moreira Neves, auxiliary Bishop of São Paulo, declared in a recent interview, “Population increase is a necessity in Brazil, above all when the country needs to create an internal market and occupy its territory to grow and to gain economic independence.” At the same time, a group of economists at the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Research in São Paulo has drafted a report for the Bucharest meeting stressing that the principal problem is the distribution—not control—of the population and wealth. There have been influential voices here raised in favor of population control, but they are in the minority. Finance Minister Simonsen, former Finance Minister Roberto Campos and a former head of the National Housing Bank advocate making birth control accessible to the masses as a means of improving the quality of life. The only organization dealing with birth control is Bemfam, set up in 1965 by a group of Brazilian gynecologists as an affiliate of the London‐based International Federation of Family Planning. “We were tired of seeing women die from abortion complications just because they wanted to limit the number of children and didn't have the means to do it the right, sure way,” says Dr. Walter Rodrigues, executive secretary of Bemfam and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Bemfam runs 84 clinics around the country and gives advice to 400,000 women. “But it's only a beginning,” a social worker for the agency said, pointing out that there are about one million abortions yearly. There is a change here in that the debate on birth control is now common and in the open. In Fortaleza, a heated argument was recently reported between two priests, one charging that birth control was “euth??nasia” and the other defending Bemfam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HIGH COURT BACKS EQUAL PAY SCALES FOR BOTH SEXES,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/04/archives/high-court-backs-equal-pay-scales-for-both-sexes-justices-uphold-64.html,"WASHINGTON, June 3—The Supreme Court upheld today for the first time the 10‐year. old Congressional mandate that employers pay women equal wages for equal work. Dividing 5 to 3, the high court ruled that women workers were entitled to the same wage scales as men with the same sort of job whether or not the men worked different shifts or claimed special privileges predating the equal pay act that went into effect in 1964. Directly, the decision is expected to cost the Corning Glass Works at least $600,000 in back pay required to compensate for arbitrarily low wages that women have been receiving in at least three plants. Nationally, the principle endorsed by the Supreme Court will almost certainly eventually require employers to pay women millions of dollars a year more, raising their wage levels either voluntarily or under court order to an equivalent scale with their male counterparts. Law Believed Ignored Advocates of equal rights for I women are convinced that the 1Federal law has been widely ignored and disobeyed since its enactment, with companies leaving intact old practices, originally legal, that tended to let only men into higher‐paying jobs. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall declared that it was not enough for an employer to make women eligible for a higherpaid classification involving the same duties. All women doing the same work must be raised to the male wage scale, he said. Before the high court were two virtually identical cases objecting to the glass company's paying night inspectors in two plants, all of them originally men, higher wages than day inspectors, all of whom were women. Federal District Court in New York ruled in favor of the Secretary of Labor with respect to the Corning plant, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. But in Pennsylvania, where Corning has a plant in Wellsboro, the company's wage differential was upheld both in District Court and the Third Circuit. Dissenting from the ruling were Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William H. Renquist. Justice Potter Stewart did not participate in the case. The dissenters did not write an opinion but merely endorsed the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which held that night and day shifts involved different “working conditions” for which different wages could properly be paid. Labor Department officials took satisfaction in the majority's observation that “it is now well settled that jobs need not be identical in every respect before the equal pay act is applicable.” Two areas in which the decision is expected to have major impact are the retail sales industry and hospital and medical services, in which women have traditionally occupied most of the lower paying positions and few of the higher. JAMES EARL RAY PLEA In another decision, the high court declined to review a ruling that James Earl Ray, thee, convicted killer of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was entitled to a hearing on his current contention that his guilty plea was not voluntary but the product of selfish pressure by his lawyers. The prisoner, now serving 99‐year term, maintains that he was the victim of a contract under which he and his attorneys were to share in the proceeds of a book about the King assassination to be written by William Bradford Huie. If he had gone to trial, Mr. Ray argued, all of the facts he saved for Mr. Huie would have become public, so his lawyers, first Arthur Hanes and then Percy Foreman, pressed him to plead guilty to protect their financial interest in the writing project. If the Court finds that Mr. Ray was coerced into pleading guilty, it could order a trial on the charge that he murdered Dr. King, the civil rights leader, in 1968. PERMISSION FOR ABORTION The Justices refused to act on a challenge to the constitutionality of a Florida statute requiring a wife seeking an abortion to have her husband's consent and an unmarried woman under 18 to have the consent of her parents. The law has been invalidated by a three‐judge Federal District Court, but the Supreme Court said today that decision should be carried to the. Court of Appeals, rather than directly to the Justices. They also affirmed a ruling that opponents of the statute were not entitled to an injunction against its enforcement pending appeal since there was no evidence the state intended to enforce it. LAKE CHAMPLAIN POLLUTION The high court declined to approve a recommended settlement in the long‐standing dispute between the states of New York and Vermont over water pollution in Lake Champlain, much of it allegedly caused by the International Paper Company. The Justices rejected a proposal by a special master after two years' study on the grounds that it did not include important findings of fact and conclusions of law and would require the Supreme Court to alter its role by exercising some continuing supervision over the settlement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rough Ex‐Nixon Aide Charles Wendell Colson,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/04/archives/rough-exnixon-aide-charles-wendell-colson-friendship-with-hunt.html,"In President Nixon's old inner circle, Charles Wendell Colson stood out for his capacity to inspire passionate distaste—and enjoy it. Man in the News Democrats loathed him for playing rough Man politics and even in the more for being successful at it, News as he was in his campaign to win over hard hats, teamsters, Roman Catholics and ethnics for the President during the 1972 re‐election campaign. Many Republicans, and some of his old colleagues on the White House staff, abhorred him even more. Herbert G. Klein, formerly the White House director of communications, called Mr. Colson a “cobra.” Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Republican of Connecticut, complained a year ago that Mr. Colson was spreading rumors about him. “You make me sick,” the Senator shouted when Mr. Colson tried to explain, ordering him out of his office. In an oft‐quoted memorandum that Mr. Colson wrote several years ago, he stated “I would walk over my grandmother if necessary” to re‐elect Richard Nixon. The line confirms his father's admiring description of his son as “Viciously loyal— but it is only one of many proclamations of the tough‐guy notion of politics as a form of warfare held by Mr. Colson, who today pleaded guilty to trying to disseminate derogatory information about Dr. Daniel Ellsberg and his attorney. A poster from the Marine Corps, in which he served as a company commander, adorned his White House office. Mrs. Patty Colson says her husband's favorite tune is the Marine Corps Hymn. Friendship With Hunt To compound the military theme, the master list of more than 200 Nixon “enemies” was drafted in Mr. Colson's office, and the political staff that he gathered at 9:15 A.M. daily during the 1972 campaign was formally named the “attack group.” Last year, Mr. Colson said he had undergone a religious conversion in which he found “a great inner serenity, really a new life” through Jesus. The report was greeted with skepticism among some who had known him well. Because of his long friendship with E. Howard Hunt Jr., the former spy who pleaded guilty to involvement in the Watergate break‐in, Mr. Colson was once widely suspected as the Watergate master‐spy. A secret affidavit from Mr. Hunt said that Mr. Colson knew nothing about Watergate until after it happened. Yet in a tape transcript released by the White House, President Nixon is quoted as saying that Mr. Colson “is up to his navel” in the Watergate affair. Mr. Colson was born in Boston on Oct. 16, 1931, the only child in a conservative family. His father, Wendell, worked his way through law school at night and became a lawyer in the Boston office of the Securities and Exchange Commission. One of Mr. Colson's grandmothers traced her ancestry to George Washington's mother. Yet the formative spirit in the Colson household during the Depression years was more nearly that of aspiring ethnics rather than Yankee Brahmins—a point that colored Mr. Colsons political outlook. At the Brown and Nichols School in Cambridge, he was a star enough debater and good scholarship student to receive a yard. But nearby Harvard seemed both stuffy and radical, and he anticipated correctly that he would be a bigger wheel at Brown where he was active in student government, debating, the Marine officers training program, and young Republicanism. He was graduated with honors in 1953. After peacetime service in the Marine Corps, Mr. Colson joined the staff of Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Republican of Massachusetts, in 1956. At 27 he became the youngest administrative assistant on Capitol Hill, simultaneously attending George Washington Law School at night. Mr. Colson put his personal stamp on the Saltonstall reelection campaign of 1960. Senator Saltonstall's easy victory confirmed Mr. Colson's instinct for “constituency” politics—that is, appeals to special interest, working class and ethnic groups—that he would apply again in the Nixon White House. Mr. Colson was a principal author of the Nixon re‐election appeals to restless Democrats, including a campaign pledge of Federal aid to parochial schools and repeated attacks on abortion, amnesty and busing. During the 1960's, Mr. Colson operated a law firm here and in Boston. His first wife, Nancy, from whom he was divorced in 1963, still lives there with their son and two daughters. The law firm flourished and by 1969 Mr. Colson had his own chauffeur and a six figure income. Yet money is not believed to be his principal drive. When the White House offered him a job of wide scope and influence, Mr. Colson jumped at it and quickly invested all his fervid loyalty and aggressive energy in the cause of Richard Nixon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bold Poetry by Voznesensky Electrifies S.R.O. Moscow Crowd,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/07/archives/bold-poetry-by-voznesensky-electrifies-sro-moscow-crowd-an.html,"MOSCOW, June 6—Even before it began, the evening had the earmarks of a special event. Women students in slick imported raincoats and bright umbrellas ignored the damp evening to plead on the sidewalk for extra tickets. At the door of the Writers Union hall, the jam was unbearable. Squeezing through the crush of people was like cramming onto a rush‐hour subway in New York a split second before the doors close. A few freshly‐barbered internal security men had been called in to help the regular police keep order among the crowd on the sidewalk. They stopped Andrei Voznesensky's blonde wife, Zoya, until they recognized the comedian Arkady Raikin with her. As they were admitted, a few gate‐crashers slipped past the security like. An Expectant Audience Inside, the audience was expectant. People snatched each other's seats. Among the notables were Maya Plisetskaya, the ballerina; her composer‐husband, Rodion Shchedrin, and Viktor Sukhodrev, the English interpreter of Leonid I. Brezhnev. But mostly the crowd was young, gently mod or shaggyhaired, drawn by one of Mr. Voznesensky's rare Moscow poetry readings. The young were not let down. Before he finished the reading, in honor of Pushkin's 175th birthday, the boyish poet, now 40, had electrified them, with a string of new poems, one denouncing “pornography of the spirit,” in rebuttal to conservative critics who have chided him for pornography in his verse. One startling poem drew stunned silence and sudden applause when it asked “Where is the, grave?” of Vsevolod Meyerhold, the innovative theater director who perished in a Stalinist camp in 1940. Another drew a string of laughs by lampooning the endless lining up and signing up in Soviet life—for ballet tickets, for cars, for spare parts, or abortions. Yet another, “Time Out for Repair,” playfully mocked official sloganeering by suggesting: “Time has come for devaluing the, minute so one old minute will equal 1.2 new minutes. The number of hours in a day will increase, labor productivity will, grow, and the rest of the time, we shall sing patriotic songs.” The Tuesday night performance was more than a reading. It was an entire production. It opened with the full Soviet, radio and television choius, accompanied by Mr. Shchedrin, performing melodramatic excerpts from Mr. Voznesensky's oratorical, modern hymn to. Russia. Tatyana Doronina, a movie actress, protested against male supremacy by reciting “Someone is Beating a Woman,” a poem, from “Anti‐Worlds.” Yuri Lyubimov, the director of the Taganka Theater, quietly intoned Mr. Voznesensky's reproach to his contemporaries from a new poem about Gogol, in which the 19th‐century satirist pleads with his countrymen to heed his biting critique of authority, bureaucracy and hypocrisy. Valery Zolotukhin, a Taganka actor, recited poems from Mr. Voznesensky's play, “Watch Your Faces,” shut down by the censors four seasons ago, and then startled the audience with the unexpected question about Mr. Meyerhold: Where is your grave—Or maybe even just a mound—Vsevolod Emilyevich Meyerhold? Where can we put a monument? There is no grave. You cannot be frozen into a statue, Like some docile teacher' pet. You blaze From the pedestals of the world stage, Vsevolod Emilyevich Meyerhold. Just as in poetry reading 10 to 10 years ago, the fusion of art and politics and the boldness of the poet's probing brought the audience to life. Mr. Meyerhold is officially canonized, but his fate under Stalin is normally left unmentioned. On, hearing Mr. Voznesensky's candid memorial, the audience broke into rhythmic applause. Mr. Lyubirnov embraced him. Through the first half of the performance, the poet sat on stage off to one side, his pale face showing pained embarrassment. But, dapper in a houndstooth sport jacket, blue velvet trousers and a foulard scarf, he emerged after intermission to hush a new flow of gate‐crashers with his own reading. The shyness disappeared. He knew the rhythms, felt the moods, played the puns better than the other readers, and characteristically ended with short; quick lines that left lasting imagery. Quickly the audience was his. Mr. Voznesensky amused them with his satire on the “scientific‐technological revolution” that ended with a plea not to make artificial caviar out of oil but oil Out of natural caviar, and touched them with his celebration of Marc Chagall's return to Russia last year. From “Anti‐Worlds,” he repeated his protest against censors who have choked the throats of poets from Cervantes to Pasternak: Amen. I have killed a poem. Killed it unborn. To hell with it. We bury, Bury poems. Come see. We bury. Then he read excerpts from a long new and still unpublished “detective poem” in which he goes searching for a missing ikon, a modern madonna, among lines of Russians, waiting for ordinary things in life. To the audiences delight, he sniped at the practice of people's writing numbers on their hands to show their place in line and at the busybodies who monitor queues: I am 41st for Plisetskaya, 33d for the theater at Taganka, 45th for the graveyard at Vaganhovo. I am 14th for the eye specialist, 21st for Glazunov, the artist, 45th for an abortion (when my turn comes—I'll be in shape), I am 103d for auto parts (they signed me up when I was born), I am 10,007th for a new car (they signed me up before I was born). Bid the poem the young seemed to like best was his pointed retort to critics who have chastised him for sexual imagery and gutter language in his poetry. Turning the criticism against them, he denounced “pornography of the spirit” displayed in closed ideological briefings on the arts. A girlfriend dances in public With a naked admirer. Hail, porhography of the flesh But there is also a pornography of the spirit. Sometimes during a lecture, a functionary Is as competent in art as a cook, a And reveals to his audience His porhography of the spirit. In a Picasso; to him everything is unclear And Shostakovich has no ear. This kind of humbug would embarrass Even a Paris whore! Then, in an allusion to the. poet. Yevgeny Yevtushenko who was reported to have visited Canada last year wearing a sealskin coat and a large diamond ring, he said: When they make a dancer strip, I feel shame for those who pay her. But when my “brother” turns prostitute, I am ashamed for him himself. When the Motherland feels the pinch, Underground millionaires Display their pornography of the spirit By going around in diamonds and seals. Condemn the striptease on the the screen, Cover the belly buttons of Venuses, But the spirit is what counts most, Down with pornography of the spirit!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FEMINIST CLEARED IN TRENTON CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/07/archives/feminist-cleared-in-trenton-case-scuffle-with-trooper-called.html,"TRENTON, June 6—The Appellate Division of State Superior Court, citing a lack of evidence, today set aside the disorderly conduct conviction off, a woman arrested during a scuffle with a state trooper in the State House last year. In dismissing the case against the woman, Miss Martha Buck of Montclair, the three‐judgel appeals court also said that the state police had “created a tempest in a teapot” and that a Mercer County Court judge who had upheld a Trenton Municipal Court conviction of Miss Buck on disorderly conduct charges had erred. The Appellate Division did not rule, however, on the Constitutional issues of free speech and assembly that had been raised by Miss Buck's lawyer, Frank Askin of the Rutgers Law School's Constitutional Litigation Clinic, acting for the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 30 Feminists Ejected Miss Buck's arrest occurred in a second‐floor State House hallway outside the Assembly chamber on the night of April 30; 1973, after a group of 30 feminists were ordered out of the gallery during a rebate on a controversial abortion bill. Miss Buck and other membei.s of the group protested when a trooper in pain clothes, Sgt. John Majarwitz, began taking pictures of them. Miss Buck sald she grabbed at the strap of Sergeant Majarwitz's camera after she learned that he was a trooper and not a news photographer, as, she contended, he had first identified himself. After the altercation, Miss Buck, a field representative of the State Division on Civil Rights, was taken from the hallway by the troopers and accused of interfering with others “lawfully” on the premises. In initia arguments before the appellate division in Hackensack last month, the A.C.L.U. lawyer complained that Sergeant Majarwitz had violated Miss Buck's Constitutional rights through his unlawful “photographic surveillance.” The trooper's actions had a “chilling effect” on the group's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments relating to lawful assembly and political activity, it was argued. Rather than remand the case to the trial court for admission of possibly new evidence, the Appellate Division dismissed the case on the ground of insufficient evidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conferees Agree to Ban Research on Live Fetus,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/08/archives/conferees-agree-to-ban-research-on-live-fetus.html,"WASHINGTON, June 7—Senate and House conferees have agreed on legislation to impose a temporary ban on research involving the living human fetus, a subject of great controversy in recent months. The ban would be limited to research supported, directly or indirectly, by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, but this covers a major share of all health‐related research in the United States. Furthermore, policies of the National Institutes of Health, the department's biomedical re search arm, are strongly influential here and even abroad because of the global reputation of the institutes. The temporary ban on fetal research was part of a much larger package of issues likely to have major effects on the conduct of medical research and, in some important aspects, on Government‐supported health care. The Senate‐House conferees teached agreement on the package last night, staff sources said. It will probably be another week before this is set down in concrete language. The proposed legislation bears the strong imprint of ideas advanced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massach setts. Senate and House subcommittee staff members who worked on the conference report said, however, that the agreement represented a compromise. For example, Senator Kennedy had favored a permanent nationalc ommission for the protection of human subjects of medical experiments. The compromise agreed upon by the conferees calls for a temporary commission to function for two years. Thereafter it would be replaced by a national advisory council for the protection of subjects of ?? and behavioral research. This would retain many of the functions of the commission. The temporary commission would be charged, in particular, with studying two areas of great current controversy—fetal research and psychosurgery. The conference agreement, staff members said, calls for a four‐month ban on research on the living human fetus, either in utero or after abortion, unless the purpose of the research is to save the life of the fetus. The ban would run from the time of establishment of the commission for four months. Following this, the commission would be required to make recommendations on permanent policy to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. The fetal research issue, a subject of great controversy nationally for more than a year, was intensified last April when five doctors were indicted in Boston in cases involving the fetus. One of the doctors was charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of a fetus during a legal abortion. The others were charged with violating a 19th‐century law on grave robbery after they used human fetal tissue for research. It is generally agreed that the issues of fetal research and abortion are separate, but the opponents of one are likely to be opponents of the other also. In recent months the arguments have often been emotionally charged. Representative Angelo D. Roncallo, Republican of Nassau, a leader in Congressional forces opposed to fetal research, sponsored a successful amendment to a House bill permanently banning such studies. Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative Republican of New York, sponsored a temporary ban in a Senate version of the same legislation. A spokesman for Mr. Roncalla today called a temporary ban unsatisfactory and said Mr. Roncallo would contest the issue unless a further compromise considerably closer to his position could be worked out. The issues of fetal research, psychosurgery and establish.. ment of a national commission on biomedical research ethics arose in bills mainly concerned with supporting research training grants for persons in the pre‐and post‐doctoral phase of science careers. Last year the administration had sought to phase out such grants for medical research training. Both Senate and House have moved to retain them. Representative Paul Rogers, Democrat of Florida, leader in the House effort to this end, said elimination of the programs could cost the United States its pre‐eminence in science. A Senate staff source said today that the grants and fellowships Would be called national research service awards. They will be coupled with payback requirements such as time periods devoted to research, teaching or some form of medical service. The conference agreed to authorize spending nearly $208‐million for each of the two years on such programs. In another bill important to medical research the SenateHouse conference agreed on establishing a temporary commission to oversee the effectiveness and the programs of the National Institutes of Health. In the original Senate version, this commission had been permanent. The Administration threatened a possible veto if the commission was enacted. The bill in question authorizes continuation of the huge national research effort against cancer, a major Administration initiative. Several weeks ago, Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, suggested establishing a blue ribbon panel to study the effectiveness and appropriate policy for all Governmentsponsored research in the fields of health and biology. In both bills the compromises worked out between House and Senate were often between Representative Paul G. Rogers's preference for temporary and time‐limited panels for studies of biomedical research issues, and Senator Kennedy's proposals for permanent commissions. While the focus of the panel's activities would be on research, the proposed legislation also calls for adoption of many of the research guidelines on ethics by federally sponsored programs of medical care. An obvious case in point is the use of voluntary sterilization by family planning clinics that are federally funded. The proposed national commission and the advisory panel to follow it would be concerned particularly with the rights of children, prisoners and the mentally incompetent when they become involved in research or in medical service programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hearings Wind Up in Suit Asking Hospital Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/08/archives/hearings-wind-up-in-suit-asking-hospital-abortions-rights-violation.html,"TRENTON, June 7—A weeklong hearing on a lawsuit seeking to compel private voluntary hospitals in New Jersey to open their facilities for women electing to have abortions ended in State Supreme Court today. The case is considered crucial because the decision of Judge Herbert Horn of Superior Court, who has presided over the hearing, which began in Bridgeton last Monday, will establish the legal basis for abortion practices and policies, not only by private hospitals, but also by church‐supported hospitals, where religious beliefs are often cited for refusal to permit elective abortions. The suit was brought by the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Jane Doe and Mary Roe, the unidentified plaintiffs, against three hospitals in South Jersey that have refused to permit elective abortions although they have allowed the operation when the mother's life is in danger. Rights Violation Alleged The defendants are they Bridgeton Hospital Association of Bridgeton, the Salem County Hospital in Salem and the Newcomb Hospital of Vineland. They are situated in a region, according to the A.C.L.U., where adequate facilities are not otherwise available. In arguing the case for the plaintiffs, Nadine Taub, a lawyer representing the State A.C.L.U., contended that the three defendant hospitals provided the only adequate health and maternity care in the area. She also held that, by refusing to permit abortions, they were depriving the plaintiffs and other women, as well as doctors willing to perform the operation, of their constitutional rights to terminate a pregnancy. The refusal further violates state licensing requirements mandating that full health services be provided by the hospitals, the A.C.L.U. suit contends. The suit holds that, despite heir nominal “private” desigiation, the hospitals are in effect institutions for the public welfare and any refusal to provide medical care is a “state action” specifically prohibited by the United States Supreme Court landmark abortion decision on Jan. 22, 1973. In court papers being studied by Judge Horn, the State A.C.L.U. said: “The United States Supreme Court has recognized that private enterprises may in fact he so involved with the government that they are acting under color of state law and subject to the same constitutional limitations that the governments are. Paralleling the Federal law, New Jersey has developed its own public trust theory whereby private hospitals are judicially regarded as quasi‐public institutions.” Lawyers for the hospitals have argued that the institutions acted in accordance with community opinion on abortion. Stephen Nagler, executive director of the state A.C.L.U., said, however, that “community opinion” should not he allowed to sanction the violaton of constitutional abortion rights any more than it could enforce segregation in defiance of desegregation statutes. In a separate case, the State A.C.L.U. will defend the group opposed to abortion, known as Right to Life, in a suit being brought by Dr. Robert Livingston to bar the opponents of abortion from picketing his office in Englewood. Dr. Livingston, an obstetrician and gynecologist, has challenged the state's abortion laws for more than two years and has performed hundreds of abortions in defiance of the statutes. His application for an injunction against the Right to Life group will be heard in Bergen County Superior Court in Hackensack next Tuesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STATE TO MONITOR JUDICIAL CONDUCT,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/09/archives/state-to-monitor-judicial-conduct-a-stop-gap-measure.html,"ALBANY, June 8 — A measure creating a nine‐member Temporary State Commission on Judicial Conduct, composed primarily of non‐judges, with power to investigate complaints against a judge with regard to his conduct, performance, fitness and qualifications has been signed into law, Governor Wilson's office announced today. The commission will have the power to conduct the hearings, subpoena witnesses and have them testify under oath, grant immunity, request and receive assistance from any public agency and require the appearance of the judge named in the complaint. If the commission determines that the complaint is invalid, it can dismiss it but it must notify the complainant, of the action. If the commission determines that the complaint war ran action, it will report its findings to the judge's superiors to take disciplinary action against the particular judge. The measure is an outgrowth of complaints that while gross criminal acts committed by judge are subject to disciplinary action, other activities, such as repeated intemperance, incompetence, inefficiency or displays of injudicious temperament often go unpunished. A Stop Gap Measure The bill is the major piece of court‐reform legislation enacted this year that can go into effect immediately. It is not so strong as the proposed constitutional amendment creating permanent commission with greater powers, but is viewed as a stopgap measure until stronger version is passed by the next session of the Legislature and submitted to the votin referendum. Under the feasure signed by the Governor, the commission will consist of only two judges, at least two laymen and at least one lawyer. The other four mebbers could be either lawyers or laymen. The Governor also signed a number of relatively minor measures and still has before him about 800 bills passed during the regular session of the ??egislature. He has not acted yet on a bill repealing the 1962 covenants on Port Authority bonds prohibiting the use of its surplus funds for deficit ‐ ridden mass ‐ transit systems or on a measure restricting the state's four‐year‐old abortion law by requiring that abortions beyond the 12th week of pregnancy take place in a hospital and that a second physician be present at abortins beyond the 20th week of pregnancy. Thut far, Mr. Wilson has vetoed only two bills and is expected to hold off in announcing any further vetoes until after the state Republican nominating convention, which takes place next week, in the interests of maintaining party unity.Other measures signed by the Governor will do the following: ¶Authorize the Secretary of State to reject corporate names that are indecent or obscene or that ridicule persons or that indicate or imply unlawful activitiees. The measure is the outgrowth of a Court of Appeals ruling last year that the Secretary of State had acted arbitrarily in rejecting permission for incorporation of the Gay Activist Alliance. ¶Permit New York City to finance over a five‐year period its $70‐million share of the state operating assistance subsidy program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONTROL TO TIGHTEN ON U.S. STUDENT AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/09/archives/control-to-tighten-on-us-student-aid.html,"WASHINGTON, June 8 (AP) —The Department of Health, Education and Welfare says it is instituting tighter controls to prevent “unwise use” of Federal aid to medical and dental students. The department responded Monday to a report by the General Accounting Office disclosing that students applying for loans were allowed to list among their needs such things as an abortion for a girl friend and fodder for a spouse's horse. The G.A.O. also contended that loans and grants under the Health Professions Student Assistance Program had not significantly increased the supply of doctors and dentists. “Although the number of students accepted by medical and dental schools has increased and the quality has improved since H.S,S.A.P. began, it does not appear to have been a significant factor in these increases,” the Congressional watchdog agency said. In comments appended to the report, the Health Education and Welfare Department disagreed with the conclusion that the aid program had not achieved its objectives. However, it said it “accepts as valid the criticism for relying too heavily on the schools of medicine and dentistry to administer the student assistance program.” The G.A.O. study investigated administration of the program over a nine‐year period ending in 1973, when it was reorganized with more emphasis on regional control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Importance of Fetal Research,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/09/archives/the-importance-of-fetal-research.html,"Current efforts to prohibit or significantly limit research involving fetuses and infants seriously jeopardize the health and welfare of our children and of our children's children. Senate and House conferees have agreed on legislation banning for four months research on the living human fetus, either in the uterus or after abortion, unless the research is to save the fetus's life. The ban, to be limited to research supported directly or indirectly by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, would run from the time of establishment of a temporary commission for the protection of human subjects of medical experiments. Instead of providing appropriate safeguards from real, though infrequent, abuses by a few investigators, these initiatives and recent court actions to prohibit fetal research are likely to severely limit our ability not only to protect children from serious illness but also to promote their optimum growth and development. It may not have been sufficiently communicated to the public and people in positions of political responsibility that the prevention and treatment of diseases that threaten children's health and survival depend especially on fetal and infant research. A substantial number of problems in young infants start in the uterus, and several important medical developments have been made possible only through research on the human fetus and on the newborn. In the last decade, for example, amniocentesis, a technique used to remove fluid from the amniotic cavity —the sac of fluid in which the fetus floats‐in order to detect diseases, has made possible the identification of more than fifty diseases before birth, many of which if not prevented or treated result in death or mental retardation. This technique was first used for the measurement of intrauterine pressure during labor and would not have been considered necessary to the survival of that particular fetus. The development of the test for Rhblood‐group incompatibility and ultimately the preventive treatment for the mother would not have occurred without human fetal research. Our ability to prevent premature birth and brain injury from asphyxia occurring during labor, both of which may lead to death or cerebral palsy, will be obstructed by prohibitions against fetal research. Our ability to increase the survival of healthy children who develop hyaline‐membrane disease or Rh disease early in life depends directly on fetal and infant research. Infections, which take such a large toll during the fetal and newborn periods of life, require at some stage the testing of new antibiotics on the human fetus and newborn infant; tests on animals and human adults that should be done first are not sufficient because of the enormous differences between an infantand adult. There are over forty metabolic disorders that occur in childhood for which fetal research provides the greatest likelihood of decreasing sickness and death. The health of adults may also be hurt by prohibitions against fetal research. Progress in the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease may be compromised. Our ability to prevent and treat certain disorders of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis among them, as well as a variety of cancers of adult life, and even our ultimate ability to ameliorate the aging process, are likely to depend in part upon investigations of fetal life and early infancy. Those who oppose legal abortions have been some of the major supporters of prohibitions against fetal research. However, the goal of fetal research is to preserve the right to life in its fullest sense by preventing and curing disease. In some instances, research may even eliminate the need for therapeutic abortion. Ethical safeguards are essential In medical investigation. The preservation of life and, the prevention and treatment of injury are the only ethical and legal bases for physician‐scientists to carry out research on a human baby, premature infant or fetus who is developed enough to survive outside the uterus. Investigation of a fetus outside the uterus who has no possibility whatsoever of surviving independently also requires certain ethical and legal safeguards to protect the fetus's own in terests as well as those of its parents, society and future generations. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare is now formulating regulations. They should be promptly made public and reviewed by Congress and the public to make sure that they provide necessary protection for fetuses, infants and children, both by preventing abuse by unethical research and by preserving every child's right to a life not limited by disease that research can eradicate. We should not delay protection of fetuses and infants from disease by delaying, badly needed research while we study these matters. We cannot allow critically needed research on behalf of our children and theirs to be severely compromised by a ban on fetal and infant research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pro‐Abortion Groups Prepare Extensive Statewide Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/11/archives/proabortion-groups-prepare-extensive-statewide-campaign-ban-on.html,"TRENTON, June 10 — Proabortion forces in New Jersey, feeling the need to combat the anti‐abortion drive that they say threatens to make abortions illegal once again, met here tonight in preparation for what promises to be a new round of bitter and divisive legal and legislative battles. The group, calling itself the Right to Choose, agreed to launch an extensive mail, telephone and personal campaign to make abortions easily available and inexpensive in New Jersey. “Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of a woman's right to privacy in this issue,” said Carol Cogsville, who presided at the meeting, “compulsory pregnancy pressure groups have devised a national battle plan and are spending vast sums of money to implement it.” The United States Supreme Court ruled in January, 1973, that not state could interfere with abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Particular “well ‐ organized and lavishly funded” anti‐abortion groups, including the Right to Life group, have been bombarding state legislators with mail, Miss Cogsville said. The Right to Choose organization will attempt to offset the action by those groups by employing a legislative lobbyist. It will also seek an early meeting with the new State Health Commissioner, Dr. Joanne Finley. Nadine Taub, a lawyer representing the American Civil Liberties Union in a suit to make hospitals in the state comply with the Supreme Court ruling, told the group of more than 100 women that, while the state could not prohibit early abortions, it nevertheless had refused to license abortion clinics throughout the state where the operations could be obtained inexpensively. At present, hospital abortions, including doctor fees, run as high as $375. However, Dr. Robert Livingston of Englewood Cliffs has been performbig some 150 abortions a week in a medical facility he owns with several other doctors for an average of $100 each, Miss Taub said. Ban on Pickets Asked A suit by Dr. Livingston to have Right to Life pickets removed from in front of his office wil lbe heard in Bergen County Superior Court tomorrow. In that case, the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the Right to Life pickets, on the ground that it is their constitutional right to picket. The Right to Choose members, many of whom asserted they do not favor abortion for themselves, drafted a resolution supporting a woman's right “to choose whether or not to hear a child,” calling it “unthinkable that anti‐abortion groups be allowed to impose their personal choice” on the women in this country. Regarding specific state legislation, the group agreed to oppose Senate Bill 503, sponsored by Senator Joseph L. McGahn, Democrat of Atlantic County, that would allow any hospital or doctor to refuse to perform an abortion. The pro‐abortion group will also oppose Senate Bill 528, proposed by Senator Joseph P. Merlino, Democrat of Mercer County, that would bar use of Medicaid funds for abortions. Groups represented at the meeting tonight were the Young Women's Christian Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, Woman's Political Caucus, the National Organization of Women and the National Council of Churches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Tackler of Controversial Issues Gerhard Alden Gesell,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/12/archives/a-tackler-of-controversial-issues-gerhard-alden-gesell.html,"WASHINGTON, June 11 —In his six years on the bench, controversy has been routine for United States District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell. The 63‐year‐old judge is now hearing pretrial motions in the case of the break‐in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist—and making headlines for his stinging rebukes to James D. St. Clair, President Nixon's lawyer. Man in the News Today, he startled those following court actions growing out of the Watergate scandals when he separated the case of John D. Ehrlich man from that of the others accused in the break‐in. But the white‐haired jurist is well known for his willingness to tackle controversial issues and make potentially far‐reaching decisions, as well as for his tart commentaries. In November, 1969, Judge Gesell (pronounced as in gazelle), in his first widely noted decision, overturned the District of Columbia's abortion law as unconstitutional. Challenging the Traditional The next year, Judge Gesell took on one of the more cherished Capitol Hill prerogatives, ruling that a Congressional committee report —one that was issued by the House Internal Security Committee and that listed some 65 “radical revolutionary” campus speakers — could not be printed and distributed at public expense. The report, he said in his opinion, had “no relationship to any existing or future legislative purpose and was issued solely for exposure of intimidation.” (Later that year, the House adopted a resolution that overruled him, and the report was printed.) Early in 1971, the judge ruled that it was unconstitutional for members of Congress to hold militaryreserve commissions during their terms of office. The same year, he ruled that the F.B.I. must restrict its distribution of arrest records outside the Federal Government. In June, 1971, Judge Gesell refused a Government request for an injunction halting publication by The Washington Post of a series of articles based on a Pentagon study of United States involvement in Vietnam. “Our democracy,” he wrote in his ruling, “depends for its future on the informed will of the majority, and it is the purpose and effect of the First Amendment to expose to the public the maximum amount of information on which sound judgment can be made by the electorate.” Critic of Pre‐Trial Publicity But he has been highly critical of pre‐trial publicity at times, telling the Special Watergate Prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, in February, “It seems to me your good sense should keep you off [television] talk shows” during the pre‐trial hearings in the case of Dwight L. Chapin, who was convicted in April of lying to a grand jury. Judge Gesell, a Democrat who was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967, has the reputation of being one of the most liberal, and civil libertarian, of judges on the Federal bench here. In the courtroom, he is always attentive, capable of withering scorn alternating with a sudden, disarmingly warm smile of deference. Gerhard Alden Gesell was born in Los Angeles on June 16, 1910. His father, Arnold L. Gesell, was a noted pediatrician whose advice was the basis of a generation of childrearing. The son graduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1928, from Yale College in 1932, and from Yale Law School in 1935. Start With the S.E.C. In 1936, he married and moved to Washington, with his wife, Peggy. There he was an attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission until 1940. In 1941, he joined the prestigious Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, of which he was a partner when appointed to the bench in 1967. The Gesells, who have a house in Georgetown, have a son, Peter, 35, who is assistant superintendent of the. Furnald School for the Retarded in Massachusetts, and a daughter, Patricia, 32, who teaches at the Bank Street College of Education, in New York City. The Gesells generally spend their summers on an island in Penobscot Bay, in Maine; weekends are often spent at their small cattle farm near Leesburg, Va. The judge, a very moderate social drinker who smokes a pipe in chambers but rarely at home, is described by one friend as a “joyful, serious man.” He enjoys presiding over a New Year's Day open house in a red waistcoat that, with his white hair, pink apple cheeks and sparkling blue eyes, make him a model of Mr. Pickwick or, as one friend sees him, of a clean‐shaven Santa Claus. But he is also, friends say, deeply concerned with social problems and with the ethical and moral issues facing the country and his own profession.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/14/archives/new-jersey-briefs-abortion-prisoner-released.html,"Warren H. Slough, a layman who helped a doctor perform an abortion and was convicted under a state law that has been ruled unconstitutional, was ordered released from prison yesterday. The 52‐year‐old prisoner, who lived in a Camden suburb before going to prison five years ago, was convicted in 1967 in Camden County Court. The doctor was convicted, too, but has been back practice for some time, according to Peter A. Buchbaum, a New Jersey American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Mr. Slough on his appeal through the State Public Defender's office. Mr. Slough had been convicted three previous crimes, including an earlier abortion, and had been sentenced to 12 to 20 years as a habitual offender. His release was ordered by the Appellate Division Superior Court after the State Attorney General's office conceded that he had been convicted under a law that was unconstitutional. The state's old abortion law permitted the operations only when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger. Under a United States Supreme Court ruling, abortions are now sanctioned when authorized by physician. 2 Arraigned in Kidnapping Two men were arraigned in Federal Court in Manhattan on charges of kidnapping a 51‐year‐old Bronx resident West New York, Tuesday, and holding him for $30,000 ransom. The victim, Orlando Lopez, of 2500 Johnson Avenue In Riverdale, described variously by the Federal Bureau Investigation as a butcher, a carpenter and a handyman, was released 28 hours later without payment of ransom. United States Magistrate Sol Schreiber set $75,000 bail for Eugenio Farinas, 26, of 5512 Madison Street, West New York, and $50,000 for Roman Villegas, 27, of 1040 Gerard Avenue, the Bronx. F.B.I. agents arrested them on Wednesday at 91st Street and Columbia Avenue in North Bergen, a drop point for the demanded ransom. Mr. Lopez was forced at pistol point into a car in West New York and driven across the George Washington Bridge to New York, according to the F.B.I. complaint. Man Freed in Plot to Kill Ex‐Wife A 53‐year‐old Ho‐Ho‐Kus man has been freed in Hackensack by a jury that found him temporarily insane when he consipred to kill his former wife. It was the second trial on the charge for the defendant, William Hedger, whose conviction in March, 1972, was set aside in April, 1973, by the Appellate Division of Superior Court because he had been denied an opportunity to make the temporary insanity plea. The second trial, which lasted nine days, was held solely on the question whether Mr. Hedger was temporarily insane at the time of the murder plot. Rutgers Names a Law School Dean Frank Askin of West Orange, a specialist in constitutional law and the Federal Courts, has been named associate dean of Rutgers Law School in Newark. Mr. Askin has been a member of the school's faculty since his graduation with high honors in 1966. He is also a member of the National Board of the American Civil Liberties Union, a post he has held since 1968. He has written on political privacy and has challenged the authority of governments to engage in the surveillance of political activities. State Sues Figure Salons The defunct Nu Dimensions Figure Salons of New Jersey, Inc., which operated health spas in seven communities, has been sued by the state for going out of business before its customers got their money's worth. The Division of Consumer Affairs said that Nu Dimensions had failed repay money to “a substantial number” of customers who had paid $200 for a lengthy exercise program. Nu Dimensions operated salons in West Caldwell, Wayne, Paramus, Lyndhurst, Edison, Hazlet and Fort Lee before going out of business last January. Superior Court Judge Melvin P.

A School Program Designed To Help Pregnant Teen‐agers,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/14/archives/a-school-program-designed-to-help-pregnant-teenagers-each-is-an.html,"BRIDGEPORT, Conn. — In this age of the pill, Planned Parenthood clinics, liberated women and legalized abortion—all of which exist even in Calvinist and Catholic Connecticut—teen‐age schoolgirls continue to have babies. The Center for Interim Education (a school here for pregnant teeti‐agers run by the Board of Education) enrolled more than 100 girls in the last year. Ranging from 12 to 19 years old, they participated in a program that saw them through pregnancy and childbirth and returned to their regular schools. Why do they become pregnant? Why, once pregnant, do they choose motherhood rather than abortion? The answers are varied: recognition‐seeking, religious conviction, loneliness, rebellion, ignorance, cultural milieu or the simple desire to have a child. Janet Stern, a registered nurse employed as a social worker to coordinate the center's program, said that an underlying motive for many of the girls “Is that, for the first time in their lives, they have something exclusively their own.” “The emotional deprivation among these girls is tremendous,” she added, “and it's nothing unusual to see a nine‐months' pregnant girl sucking her thumb.” Said one 15‐year‐old center student: “At first I thought it was a bad dream and I would wake up not pregnant. It was awful. But once I knew for sure, I wouldn't terminate it. That would be murder. I waited three months before I told my parents because I thought they would make me have an abortion.” Each Is an Individual By the time a girl enters the center, physically or psychologically well into the pregnancy, abortion is no longer likely to be an issue. “If I see that a girl is really unhappy and uncertain about wanting the baby, will ask if she is interested in an abortion,” said Mrs. Stern. “But I don't ask it routinely. We have to counsel each child individually.” The program, open to all Bridgeport schoolgirls, caters primarily to black and Puerto Rican students, reflecting to some degree the city's population composition. The aims of the school are to help the girls develop a sense of selfworth and of parental responsibility. “Originally the program was set up to prevent school dropouts,” said Mrs. Stern, “but I feel our major goal is to prepare young kids for parenthood and to offer them assistance in the most difficult time of their lives.” Pregnancy can be a frightening experience for a young girl. “They come into the program absolutely immobilized with fear, masked by symptoms of hostility and indifference,” said Jean Riley, a home economics teacher who is the other full‐time staff member. “But when we get into it, we find that these are real scared kids—not just frightened about the pregnancy, but schoolwork and all kinds of things.” As for responsible parenthood, center staff members constantly hammer at that phase of the program. Mrs. Stern cited one 13‐year‐old who gave birth two years ago. “She is a fine little mother,” said Mrs. Stern, “better than most young women I see in the neighbor. hood. The baby is beautiful, bright, well‐behaved and well cared for.” Since no center student has given her baby up for adoption in the last year, indications are that parental feelings do develop. Now in its sixth year, the Center for Interim Education grew out of the changed official attitude in the late nineteen‐sixties that all students, pregnant or not, were entitled to an education. Comparable programs now exist in various parts of the country, including several in New York State. New York City's Board of Education has six schools for pregnant girls in the five boroughs. Attitudes toward unwed mothers may be changing, particularly among educators and officials, but not everyone is empathetic. In speaking to one women's organization in Bridgeport recently, Mrs. Stern was met with the response, “Do you mean to say that our taxpayers' money goes to making life easier for these bad girls?” In Connecticut, the Bridgeport center stands out as the most comprehensive teenage parent program in the state, according to Mrs. Stern. Originally a federallyfunded pilot project, it has undergone several years of makeshift arrangements and a temporary shutdown, filially emerging a year ago with a revitalized program and a strong staff. The school still limps along without its own budget, a stepchild of the Board of &ideation, looking hopefully to better days. In the meantime, Thomas Holmes, Director of the Social Services Center, has rescued the school by making available the top floor of his building. The Center for Interim Education, with two full‐time and five part‐time teachers, offers, in addition to academics, individual and group counseling, Lamaze childbirth training, dental care, coordi nation of medical care and tours of the labor and delivery rooms at Bridgeport Hospital. Interaction Is Clear A course called “Preparation for Parenthood,” taught jointly by Mrs. Stern and Mrs. Riley, covers pre‐ and post‐natal care, child development, anatomy, physiology, consumer education, nutrition, home economics, family planning—“anything that the children should know about themselves and their babies.” The state‐supported Westminster Infant Day Care Center, directed by Doris Randall, is closely allied with the program, offering a child development experience for the girls and later providing a nursery, if needed, for their babies. The advantages of the interim education plan are many: a program geared to pregnant girls, small classes, personal attention, and, most important, shared mutual problems. Annetta and Lenore, two girls in the program last spring who became close friends, typify the interaction that takes place. Annetta's baby died at birth, a shattering experience for her, while Lenore gave birth a month later to a healthy boy. “At the end of the school year we had a farewell luncheon for the girls,” said Mrs. Stern. “We were in the kitchen preparing lunch when Lenore said suddenly, ‘I have an announcement.’ She handed her baby to Annetta and said, ‘You have to reserve time in three weeks because you are my baby's godmother.’ It was a tearful scene — for Annetta, Lenore, all of us.” Mrs. Stern often finds it difficult to establish contact with the girls' parents. Some are apathetic, others angry, punitive, and still others, humiliated. Parental and cultural attitudes compound a girl's problems considerably. “White parents try to keep it under cover as long as possible,” said Mrs. Stern. “They see it as a tragedy and a disgrace.” She cited the case of a middle‐class girl whose parents kept her in hiding throughout the pregnancy, driving her back and forth to school and keeping her indoors at home. Cultural Problems Vary Puerto Rican girls are faced with different cultural problems. “The father lays down the rules,” said Mrs. Stern, “and the Spanish youngster, once she gets a boyfriend or gets married, transfers her dependence from her father to the boy. “No matter how much you try to incur a sense of selfworth, that she has a right to education, to know and control her own body, she responds negatively. She will not emancipate herself. She will not take the pill if the boyfriend says ‘don't take the pill.’ It's the whole machismo thing. You've got to produce the baby to prove he is a man. “We lose almost all the Spanish girls,” she concluded. “They will go to school here until their baby is born, and after they turn 16 or get married, they quit. I find the black girls much more highly motivated and potentially independent.” Following childbirth, the girls are out of school for a two‐week recuperative period (four weeks for Caesarean operations). They leave the center at the end of the marking period, returning to regular school. Outreach worker Florene Williams follows the girls' progress, visiting them at home and in the hospital, seeing that they get six‐week checkups. After the baby's birth, in many cases, the grandmothers take charge while the girls are at school. “I get home from school at 3,” said Dawn, a high school junior. “Usually the baby is sleeping, so I do my homework. When she wakes about 4:30, I dress and feed her.” Because the program stresses health care and because Mrs. Stern provides such a strong role model, many of the girls elect to become nurses, and look to the day when they can raiselheir children independently. Several are already in college and one is in graduate school. The girls return reluctgntly to regular school, where they miss the center's rapport and intimacy. But they return with the memory of a positive experience and a better attitude toward school. “We hope that this attitude will be passed on to the next generation,” said Social Services Director Thomas Holmes. “After all, the babies of these girls are our next crop of schoolchildren.” “The emotional deprivation among these girls is tremendous, and it's nothing unusual to see a nine‐months' pregnant girl sucking her thumb.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assembly to Debate Antiabortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/14/archives/assembly-to-debate-antiabortion-bill-conference-group-votes-to.html,"TRENTON, June 13—The Assembly Conference Committee agreed today to bring a highly controversial abortion bill, supported vigorously by antiabortion groups, to a vote on the assembly floor during the current special legislative session. The measure, which has already passed the State Senate and is called the “conscience clause” bill by antiabortionists, would permit hospitals or individuals to refuse to perform or assist in an abortion without fear of legal or disciplinary action. Supporters of the bill, which is sponsored by State Senator Joseph L. McGahn, Democrat of Atlantic County, roamed the corridors of the State House today, wearing red roses and buttons proclaiming their association with “Right to Life, Inc.”, a leading antiabortion organization. Although hoping for more conclusive action at this time, they indicated they were pleased that the 15‐member Assembly Conference Committee had vote to bring the measure to a full vote by the Assembly, perhaps by June 24. The issue of whether hospitals or other health‐care facilities can refuse to perform abortions is already in the courts, however. The American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two unidentified women, has filed suit to compel the Bridgeton Hospital Association, the Salem Hospital and the Newcomb Hospital in Vineland to perform elective abortions. Conference Group Votes to Bring Plan to Floor in Special Session Judge Herbert Horn of the Superior Court ended a week of hearings on the suit last Friday, and, after receiving additional papers from both sides, he is expected to rule on the case early this fall. The State Senate briefly considered this afternoon another abortion bill, also sponsored by Senator McGahn, but after members acknowledged their failure to understand its effect its sponsor moved to have it put over for consideration, and possibly amendment, at a later date. Changes Mind State Senator Alfred N. Beadleston, the Republican minority leader, effectively brought debate to an end when he said that he had at first favored the bill, which ostensibly restricts “reports on referral for abortion services” to certain authorized agencies, because he had “been given to understand” that it would preserve the “confidentiality” of persons submitting to abortions. But upon studying the meas ure and hearing it discussed, he continued, he decided that the “confidentiality” he favors would be violated by the measlure. “We're not here to make it easy for agencies to compile statistics and violate confidentiality,” he said. Another restrictive abortion bill, sponsored by State Senator Joseph P. Merlino, Democrat of Mercer County, was put over for a vote on Monday. The measure would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds under the State Medical Assistance and Health Services Act to pay for abortions “for any reason except where it is medically indicated to be necessary to preserve the woman's life.” If approved, the bill would almost certainly be challenged on the ground that it violated a decision by the United States Supreme Court on Jan. 22, 1973, barring any interference with or prohibition by the state of abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. In New York and elsewhere, similar efforts to restrict the use of Medicaid funds have been fought on the basis of constitutional “equal protection” guarantees. The challenges have emphasized that such restrictions on Medicaid funds in effect discriminate against the poor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/16/archives/news-summary-and-index-metropolitan.html,"SUNDAY, JUNE 16, 1974 The Major Events of the Day—Section 1 International It was not apparent that formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Syria were nonexistent as hundreds of American flags flew and many thousands of people jammed the streets of Damascus to welcome President Nixon as he rode in an open car with the Syrian President, Hafez al‐Assad. When Mr. Nixon arrived at Damascus International Airport, he was met by a large group of Syrian officials, platoons of troops and honor guards. The Assad Government appeared anxious to improve relations with the United States and gave Mr. Nixon's visit favorable notice in the newspapers and broadcasts. There was speculation in Damascus and Washington that diplomatic relations between the two countries, broken during the Arab‐Israeli war in 1967, would be restored today before Mr. Nixon moves on to Israel. [1:4–5.] Syria, in accordance with her troop‐separation agreement with Israel, got back a big piece of her territory that was taken by Israel in the October war. A 40‐squaremile area southwest of Damascus was evacuated by the Israeli army, and units of the Syrian army, led by the Defense Minister, Gen. Mustafa Tlas, and some civilians, moved in. Israel is scheduled to withdraw from virtually all the territory captured in the October war by June 25. [26:1–2.] Vandals scratched the letters I.R.A. two feet high across Ruben's celebrated “Adoration of the Magi” in King's College chapel at Cambridge University in Britain. Although the large painting's surface had been damaged, the pigment did not break. “It will be an expensive job to repair,” the chapel's dean, the Rev. Michael Till said. The painting was completed by Rubens in 1634. It was given to King's College in 1960 by Maj. Alfred Allnatt, an industrialist, who had bought it two years earlier for $770,000. [1:2–3.] The Government of Gen, Antonio di Spinola in Lisbon prepared greater restraints on the country's news media. Portugal's television system, which has been privately owned only in part, will be brought under complete official control and management. Regulations providing for military supervision of the press are being put into force pending promulgation of a new press law in the next few weeks. [3:1–3.] Protesting alleged racial discrimination and harsh discipline, a number of American sailors assigned to the United States aircraft carrier Midway in Yokosuka, Japan, have jumped ship. Estimates by Japanese police and American antimilitary organizations off the base, and by the men themselves put the number involved at from 20 to 200. The crew totaled about 4,000. [2:1–2.] National The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether a Watergate grand jury had the right to name President Nixon as a participant in the Watergate cover‐up without indicting him for a crime. The Court, in effect made the White House challenge to the grand jury's action a part of the dispute between Mr. Nixon and Leon Jaworski, the special Watergate prosecutor, over access to 64 tape recordings that the President has refused to surrender. The Justices refused to unseal the record of the tapes case as it developed before Federal Judge John J. Sirica, except for one sentence in which the grand jury declared that there was “probable cause to believe that Richard M. Nixon (among others) was a member of the conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice.” [1:8.] President Nixon, Secretary of State Kissinger and Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. have been subpoenaed by John D. Ehrlichman as defense witnesses in the “plumbers” trial due to begin June 26, well‐informed sources said. They said that the subpoenas were served about 10 days ago on J. Fred Buzhardt Jr., the White House counsel. Federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is reliably reported to be considering the acceptance of written interrogatories from the President in lieu of his appearance in court. He could also rule that the President's subpoena was not relevant to Mr. Ehrlichman's defense and quash it. [1:6.7.] In all except a few states, buyers of condominiums, which are proliferating across the country, can expect little protection against deception or fraud under the real estate laws. New York is one of the exceptions. Under what is believed to be the country's strongest law, realty developers must make detailed disclosure statements approved in advance by the state Attorney General. It is estimated that there are fewer than 10 states with protection laws similar to New York's. Among these are California, Michigan, Virginia and Hawaii. [1:4–7.] Metropolitan The Democratic State Committee ended an exhausting 13‐hour meeting in Niagara Falls with the designation of Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse as its candidate for the United States Senate nomination, but gave former Representative Allard K. Lowenstein of Brooklyn enough votes to force the fight with Mr. Alexander in the Sept. 10 primary. The Democrats also were able to get the balanced ticket they wanted, but four primary fights were in prospect. [1:1.] In an attempt to attract new bettors and revive sagging ticket sales, the New York State Lottery will hold 24 daily drawings next month. It will be the state's first experiment with a daily lottery. The lottery's regular, 50‐cent weekly ticket will be used for the weekly and daily drawings. Thus, in addition to the weekly prizes ranging from $50,000 to $2.50, a ticket holder will be eligible for one of the 20 daily prizes of $500. [1:2.] A bill that places restrictions on New York State's four‐year‐old abortion law was signed by Governor Wilson, It requires that abortions performed after the 12th week of pregnancy take place in a hospital only on an in‐patient basis, and that a second physician be present during abortions performed after the 20th week of pregnancy. [1:3.] Three Brooklyn men who had been arrested as they allegedly prepared to rob the house of a city official, whom the police would not identify, were said by the police to be leaders of a 40‐man burglary ring that they said had been hired by an organizedcrime “family” to steal from other organizedcrime “families.” [1:1–2.] QUOTATION OF THE DAY: “I have many moods but no sense of frustration. I have never felt frustrated because I find the world is an exciting place, a challenging place. And I think it would be dull without troubles. I do not think any individual or group or country can grow unless it has such challenges.”—Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking of India's difficulties.

ABORTION CURBS SIGNED BY WILSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/16/archives/abortion-curbs-signed-by-wilson-bill-requires-women-beyond-12th.html,"ALBANY, June 15—Governor Wilson signed into law today a bill placing restrictions on the state's four‐year‐old abortion law. The measure requires that abortions performed after the 12th week of pregnancy take place in a hospital and only one an in‐patient basis. It also requires that a second physician be present during abortions performed after the 20th week of pregnancy “to take control of and provide immediate medical care for any live birth that is a result of the abortion.” The Governor's approval of the abortion measure follows his help in obtaining its passage in the Legislature earlier this year at the behest of the Conservative party leadership. Age of Majority Mr. Wilson also signed 52 bills dealing with the age of majority of 18‐, 19‐ and 20‐year‐olds, conferring a broad range of legal rights and responsibilities on such persons, including for males the right to get married without their parents' consent at the age of 18. In mid‐afternoon, Mr. Wilson interrupted the signing of bills, which must be completed by midnight, to attend the Conservative party convention at the Holiday Inn near La Guardia Airport in Queens to seek an endorsement for Governor, which he was given. Although the signing deadline was tonight, it was not required that the announcement concerning the bills be made immediately. In other actions, the Governor vetoed a score of bills, including one that would have required liquor shipped into the state to “come to rest” in a licensed warehouse before being delivered to a retail store. Opponents of the measure said that it would have raised the price of private label liquor by more than 50 cents a bottle. In vetoing the bill, the Governor said that it would have permitted mail‐order sales of liquor to unlicensed individuals and that the state would lose tax revenues. Other measures signed by the Governor do the following: ¶Prohibit discrimination against the mentally and physically handicapped in employment, housing and places of public accommodation. ¶Redefine the obscenity statutes to say that any material is obscene that “the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that considered as a whole, its appeal is to the prurient interest in sex and depicts or describes in a patently offensive manner actual or simulated sexual intercourse, sodomy, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadism, masochism, erection or lewd exhibition of the genitals and lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.” ¶Require school buses manufactured after Dec. 31, 1975, to be equipped with padded back rests at least 28 inches high and with padded arm rests. ¶Extend the prisoner‐furlough program for two years and establish a new Community Services Program whereby eligible inmates will be permitted to leave prison to participate in community activities, such as religious services and athletic events. ¶Require the State Boards of Medicine and Dentistry to promulgate standards for the practice of acupuncture by license or supervised practitioners. ¶Transfer the authority to regulate school buses from the Department of Education to the Department of Transportation. ¶Authorize New York City to appoint rent administrators to collect rents and put them in escrow and make repairs in buildings found by the courts to have serious violations or lack of heat, hot water, electricity, or to have rodent infestation or other dangerous conditions. ¶Authorize New York City to foreclose on multiple dwellings found to be abandoned by the courts. Other Vetoes The Governor vetoed a measure that would have permitted breweries and liquor distillers to own wineries in the state. Other measures vetoed by the Governor would have done the following: ¶Permitted the sale at auction of any legal rifles or shotguns seized by police agencies. ¶Required the return of fingerprints taken of employes and prospective employes to them within 180 days. ¶Required that paper ballots be available at polling places to be used in the event that voting machines broke down. Mr. Wilson also vetoed a line item in the supplemental budget that would have deleted $32.9‐million from the capital construction budget authorizing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to extend and strengthen runways at Stewart Airport in Newburgh. In his veto message, the Governor noted that he had not restored the funds to allow the development of a fourth jetport in the metropolitan area. “I have stated in the past and I wish to re‐emphasize at this time, that I favor only such development of Stewart Airport as is necessary to permit its use as a cargo port and this action is taken only for that purpose,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary and Index SUNDAY, JUNE 16, 1974",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/16/archives/news-summary-and-index-national.html,"International It was not apparent that formal diplomatic relations between the United‐ States and Syria were nonexistent as hundreds of American flags flew and many thousands of people jammed the streets of Damascus to welcome President Nixon as he rode in an open car with the Syrian President, Hafez al‐Assad. When Mr. Nixon arrived at Damascus International Airport, he was met by a large group of Syrian officials, platoons of troops and honor guards. The Assad Government appeared anxious to improve relations with the United States and gave Mr. Nixon's visit favorable notice in the newspapers and broadcasts. There was speculation in Damascus and Washington that diplomatic relations between the two countries, broken during the Arab‐Israeli war in 1967, would be restored today before Mr. Nixon moves Israel. [1:4–5.] Syria, in accordance with her troop‐separation agreement with Israel, got back big piece of her territory that was taken by Israel in the October war. A 40‐squaremile area southwest of Damascus was evacuated by the Israeli army, and units of the Syrian army, led by the Defense Minister, Gen. Mustafa Tlas, and some civilians, moved in. Israel is scheduled to withdraw from virtually all the territory captured in the October war by June 25. [26:1–2.] Vandals scratched the letters I.R.A. two feet high across Ruben's celebrated “Adoration of the Magi” in King's College chapel at Cambridge University in Britain. Although the large painting's surface had been damaged, the pigment did not break. “It will be an expensive job to repair,” the chapel's dean, the Rev. Michael Till said. The painting was completed by Rubens in 1634. It was given to King's College in 1960 by Maj. Alfred Allnatt, an industrialist, who had bought it two years earlier for $770,000. [1:2–3.] The Government of Gen. Antonio di Spinola in Lisbon prepared greater restraints on the country's news media. Portugal's, television system, which has been privately owned only in part, will be brought under complete official control and management. Regulations providing for military supervision of the press are being put into force pending promulgation of a new press law in the next few weeks. [3:1–3.] Protesting alleged racial discrimination and harsh discipline, a number of American sailors assigned to the United States aircraft carrier Midway in Yokosuka, Japan, have jumped ship. Estimates by Japanese police and American antimilitary organizations off the base, and by the men themselves put the number involved at from 20 to 200. The crew totaled about 4,000. [2:1–2.] National The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether a Watergate grand jury had the right to name President Nixon as a participant in the Watergate cover‐up without indicting him for a crime. The Court, in effect made the White House challenge to the grand jury's action a part of the dispute between Mr. Nixon and Leon Jaworski, the special Watergate prosecutor, over access to 64 tape recordings that the President has refused to surrender. The Justices refused to unseal the record of the tapes case as it developed before Federal Judge John J. Sirica, except for one sentence in which the grand jury declared that there was “probable cause to believe that Richard M. Nixon (among others) was a member of the conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice.” [1:8.] QUOTATION OF THE DAY: “I have many moods but no sense of frustration. I have never felt frustrated because I find the world is an exciting place, a challenging place. And think it would be dull without troubles. I do not think any individual or group or country can grow unless it has such challenges.”—Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, speaking of India's difficulties. [2:6.] President Nixon, Secretary of State Kissinger and Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. have been subpoenaed by John D. Ehrlichman as defense witnesses in the “plumbers” trial due to begin June 26, well‐informed sources said. They said that the subpoenas were served about 10 days ago on J. Fred Buzhardt Jr., the White House counsel. Federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is reliably reported to be considering the acceptance of written interrogatories from the President in lieu of his appearance in court. He could also rule that the President's subpoena was not relevant to Mr. Ehrlichman's defense and quash it. [1:6–7.] In all except a few states, buyers of condominiums, which are proliferating across the country, can expect little protection against deception or fraud under the real estate laws. New York is one of the exceptions. Under what is, believed to be the country's strongest law, realty developers must make detailed disclosure statements approved in advance by the state Attorney General. It is estimated that there are fewer than 10 states with protection laws similar to New York's. Among these are California, Michigan, Virginia and Hawaii. [1:4–7.] Metropolitan The Democratic State Committee ended an exhausting 13‐hour meeting in Niagara Falls with the designation of Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse as its candidate for the United States Senate nomination, but gave former Representative Allard K. Lowenstein of Brooklyn enough votes to force the fight with Mr. Alexander in the Sept. 10 primary. The Democrats also were able to get the balanced ticket they wanted, but four primary fights were in prospect. [1:1.] In an attempt to attract new bettors and revive sagging ticket sales, the New York State Lottery will hold 24 daily drawings next month. It will be the state's first expertment with a daily lottery. The lottery's regular, 50‐cent weekly ticket will be used for the weekly and daily drawings. Thus, in addition to the weekly prizes ranging from $50,000 to $2.50, a ticket holder will be eligible for one of the 20 daily prizes of $500. [1:2.] A bill that places restrictions on New. York State's four‐year‐old abortion law was signed by Governor Wilson. It requires that abortions performed after the 12th week of pregnancy take place in a hospital only on an in‐patient basis, and that a second physician be present during abortions performed after the 20th week of pregnancy. [1:3.] Three Brooklyn men who had been arrested as they allegedly prepared to rob the house of a city official, whom the police would not identify, were said by the police to be leaders of a 40‐man burglary ring that they said had been hired by an organized crime “family” to steal from other organizedcrime “families.” [1:1–2.] Index to the Other News in Section 1 International South Korean trial strains ties with Japan.

Peasants know perfectly well where babies come from,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/16/archives/misconceptions-peasants-know-perfectly-well-where-babies-come-from.html,"An imaginary scene: Whack‐a, whack‐a, whack‐a—the rhythmic beat of the helicopter's rotor startles the languid cattle wandering on the parched Indian plain. Shankar Ram looks up from the shade of the doorway of his mud but to see the machine growing rapidly as it bears down on the small village of Patala. His eight hungry children scramble past him, and his emaciated wife joins him as they all stare at this visitation from another world. Being illiterate, he cannot read the label on the side of the helicopter—“Christian Family Planning League of Texas.” Suddenly the air is filled with tiny packets fluttering to the ground. His son Krishna scampers up and hands him a small foil container. He tears it open and takes out six balloonlike objects and a folded piece of paper. Why, he wonders, would balloons be delivered from the sky? As his children assemble a small mountain of the packets, Ram unfolds the paper. In shock he turns; moves away from his wife. The diagrams! They remind him of the things a traveler once told him about Khajuraho. Then slowly he realizes the diagrams are not intended to titillate, but are rather a set of instructions. It is all clear. If he uses these “balloons,” his wife will have no more babies. If everyone in his village uses them, there will be more land and food for all. If everyone in India use them, it no longer will have problems of overpopulation. Joy fills his heart and brings tears of thanksgiving to his eyes. As he looks around the cluster of huts, he sees that his neighbors have also understood the message—there are tears in their eyes also. He offers a small prayer of thanks for the unknown who have become saviors. Mrs. Dee Jay Sturdley wipes a tear from the corner of her eye and breaks out of her reverie as she turns her air‐conditioned Cadillac into the driveway and pulls into her marked slot in front of the modern, two‐story, air‐conditioned building on the parched Dallas plain. As she steps through the door labeled “C.F.P.L.T.—Christian Family Planning League of Texas”—the vision of the imaginary peasants lingers in the back of her mind. Her determination grows—today she'll get the board to agree to a crash fund‐raising program. She can't stand the thought of any more TV shows on starving people. They make her most uncomfortable. Mrs. Sturdley has an advanced case of the “condoms from helicopters delusion”—a psychological condition that is rampant among well‐meaning upper‐middle and upper class Americans. Like all thinking people, she realizes that overpopulation is a desperate problem for underdeveloped countries and that birth control is the only possible humane solution to the problem. But she and many others think that the populations of these countries are growing so rapidly because people there don't have the know‐how or the equipment to keep from having more babies than they want. Indeed, some think that many of the world's impoverished and primitive peoples hardly know where babies come from. Being action‐oriented, Mrs. Sturdley thinks that we Americans ought to do something to help those poor ignorant peasants. And what could, be more logical than to bring a fleet of helicopters to sweep over half‐a‐million villages, showering a latex manna from heaven? What indeed, especially since Mrs. Sturdley's view of the problem is not different in kind from that of high officials of the United States Agency for International Development? Give them the knowledge and the equipment, and Indian couples will start “stopping at two” instead of, on the average, having five or more children.  Athough Mrs. Sturdley and the C.F.P.L.T. are imaginary, they symbolize the dominant attitude of many concerned Americans toward the world population problem. Unfortunately, these attitudes are subject to serious question. To begin with, the idea that some people (especially Australian aborigines) don't understand how babies are made is an antique chestnut once put forth by some anthropologists who didn't know how to ask people about their sex lives. It is a common conceit of our culture to consider “primitive” people to be unsophisticated (even though, for instance, the dumbest aborigine keeps track of many more complex kinship relationships than the smartest Texan). Anyway, if some stranger wandered up to us and asked if we knew where babies came from, we'd tell him from under cabbage leaves. Wouldn't you? Some anthropologists given such an answer by, say, an Eskimo or Masai have been fools enough to take him seriously. Nor is there real reason to believe that overpopulated countries are overpopulated because the people lack the know‐how to have fewer children. Many cultures, when examined closely, seem to have social mechanisms that regulate population size if there is a perceived need for such regulation. In the Middle Ages, primogeniture (inheritance by the eldest son only) helped reduce population pressure in Europe. Farmland was not divided into ever smaller and less economically viable parcels. Excess sons went off on Crusades to kill heathens for Christ and often ended up getting killed themselves, or, more often, dying of disease. Some Amazonian Indians use war in a similar fashion; Eskimos used to “expose” excess female babies and old folks; the English in the last century institutionalized infanticide under the euphemism “baby farming,” and Italians denied access to contraception recently had the highest known rate of illegal abortion. When socioeconomic changes occur that make fewer children seem desirable, birth rates always start to come down before family planners and birth control devices arrive on the scene. It happened in almost all of today's industrialized countries in the last century; it happened in Taiwan and South Korea recently. People just aren't all that ignorant and unenterprising—and scientists are beginning to realize it. Today, for instance, naturalproducts chemists are scouring the world for “folk contraceptives,” many of which are now suspected of being fairly effective and having possible commercial value. Access to modern contraceptives may make family planning easier, but it is not clear how much that access, in itself, will help to lower birth rates. The question of how many children people “really want” is more complex. Much of the problem is defining “really want” and then developing techniques to make an accurate appraisal of that “want.” People's desires tend to change with many things, including how many children they already have, changes in their social and economic status, attitudes of their friends and acquaintances, and so on. An “unwanted” pregnancy often turns into a “wanted” child. People are loath to admit that they have been careless if they have a child by accident, or they may be unwilling to confide that they want more children but can't afford them. Answers to questions or questionnaires are often tailored by the respondents to fit what they think the questioners want to hear. This is especially common when the interviewer is perceived as a social superior—a common occurrence when social scientists conduct surveys in underdeveloped countries or ghettos. Such considerations make it tough enough to evaluate the percentage of American children that are in some sense “unwanted”; they make it virtually impossible to determine even in a general way what proportion of children in underdeveloped countries would not be born if people had full control over their fertility. Some very competent demographers, like Charles Westoff of Princeton, think high proportion of babies in underdeveloped countries are unwanted; others, like Kingsley Davis and Judith Blake of Berkeley, think relatively few are. It would be nice if Westoff were right, but the evidence suggests that Davis and Blake are. A prime piece of evidence is the example of India's family planning program. It started over 20 years ago, when India's birth rate was around 40 per 1,000, and shifted into high gear around 1965, when the birth rate was still around 40, but the death rate had dropped several points. In terms of governmental commitment, longevity and effectiveness in reaching a large proportion of the population ?? virtually unmatched in any other country), India's program has been a “success.” Two percent of the national budget was spent on family planning during the last fiveyear plan period (1966–71)—a far greater portion than was allocated by any other country. In fiscal 1972, the national budget for family planning was $101‐million, and there were over 100,000 people working in the program. Until 1971, there were also substantial contributions from developed countries, including the U.S., and some assistance is still provided by the United Nations. Statistics on the accomplishments of India's program are—superficially at least—impressive. Since 1965, 14‐million people have been sterilized, nearly five‐million I.U.D.'s have been inserted, over 320 ‐million condoms have been distributed, and millions of pills and other forms of contraceptives have also been provided. It is believed that at least 13 per cent of married couples of re, productive age have been reached by the program. Yet, despite all this effort, India's birth rate is still around 40 to 42 per 1,000 (according to the U.N.; India claims 37, but its census data are extremely suspect), and the population is fast approaching 600 million. What has gone wrong? A further examination of family planning statistics provides a clue: The average candidate for sterilization or contraceptives has at least four living children and has borne five or six babies. The same is true in nearly all underdeveloped countries for which figures are available. Like peasants in most countries, rural Indians (80 per cent of the population is rural) depend for security in old age on their sons. Given India's relatively high infant and child mortality rates, a couple must bear at least six children in order to ensure survival of one son to adulthood. Small wonder they view family planners' propaganda to “stop at two” as slightly insane! They aren't going to use contraceptives to reduce their family sizes because they want large families. Still, the United States Agency for International Development by 1973 was providing technical assistance in demography and providing contraceptive materials (including 1.5 million gross of condoms, over 50 million cycles of the pill and three million I.U.D.'s between 1968 and 1973) to over 60 underdeveloped countries in programs that reflected the attitudes depicted above. Is there that much harm in doing so? There can be if such approaches divert funds from projects that might be more effective. And there is if they fool people into thinking a problem is being solved when it isn't —this has already happened as inflated rhetorical claims for the “green revolution” in agriculture have not been borne out in fact. When such things happen, they can only bolster existing suspicions about all the activities of overdeveloped countries that purport to help poorer lands. Many Vietnamese and other third world people will tell you that if you have Americans (or Frenchmen, or Russians, or Japanese) for friends, you don't need enemies. Furthermore, there are other pernicious fallacies in the “what we as Americans can do about the world population problem” game. Let's start with a fallacy that the authors helped to create —the idea that we might successfully pressure governments of developing countries into launching effective population control programs. In the first edition of our book “The Population Bomb,” it was suggested that the United States try to use its food aid as a lever to get recalcitrant governments moving on population control programs. The logic then (as today) was impeccable. If you deluded people into thinking that either the U.S. could (or would) supply food in perpetuity for any number of people, you were doing evil. Sooner or later, population growth would completely outstrip the capacity of the United States or any other nation to supply food. For every 1,000 people saved today, perhaps 10,000 would die when the crunch came. Simply sending food to hungry nations with population explosions is analogous to a physician prescribing aspirin as the treatment for a patient with operable cancer—in deferring something unpleasant, disaster is entrained. Yes, send food—but insist that population control measures be instituted. But despite the logic, no one in the U.S. Government paid the slightest heed to that suggestion (or to related proposals by William and Paul Paddock in their 1968 book, “Famine‐1975!”), and the point is now moot. since we have no more surplus food. A more prominent fallacy today is the “industrialize the underdeveloped countries reduce their infant mortality rates, and their birth rates will drop” approach to population control. The thinking of this school is based on the notion that what worked in the past for today's overdeveloped countries will naturally work in the future for today's underdeveloped countries. In the United States and Western Europe, industrialization was accompanied by a decline of death rates, followed several decades later by a drop in birth rates — a so‐called demographic transition. Why not try to cause a similar transition in underdeveloped countries by promoting Western‐style economic development? This theory fails for two reasons. First, because of economic and resources considerations, the underdeveloped countries can't be industrialized in the patteni of the overdeveloped countries and, if they could be, the environmental systems of the world would collapse as a result. Second, industrialization would take decades, and further decades would have to pass before a demographic transition could lower birth rates to anything like the level of replacement reproduction. And once replacement reproduction was reached, it would take additional half Population control won't be achieved without cultural change; until it occurs, there is little we can do to help. Century or more for the population to stop growing — to reach zero population growth. (There is a common confusion about the relationship between reaching replacement fertility, which means each generation is just replacing itself, and zero population growth. Because several generations are alive at one time, and because growing populations have disproportionately large numbers of young people, replacement level reproduction must be maintained for about 50 to 70 years before a population will stop growing.) Those who look to a demographic transition to solve the population problem therefore must overlook the economic realities of industrialization, the constraints imposed upon development by resource availability and environmental fragility, or—assuming these limits could be overcome—the long time necessary for such a transition to take effect. If you figure that the transition will take 100 years or so (optimistically assuming 35 years to industrialize; 15 more to reach replacement reproduction and 50 more to reach zero population growth) then you also have to count oi. the world's population exceeding the level of 12 billion in that time. Yet only fools believe the planet can support that many. A “solution” that involves enormous increases in death rates, with hundreds of millions of people dying prematurely, will overtake us long before then. Indeed, few knowledgeable people think the population will even reach eight billion, twice its present size, before collapse occurs. Programs to reduce infant and child mortality alone are sometimes also promoted as the road to population control. The basic idea is that by exporting Western medical expertise, the survival of more children can be assured. Then parents in many societies will see that large families are no longer required to guarantee the survival of at least one son to support them in their old age. It sounds like a fine program for situations where lack of social security is a major reason for large families, until you realize the time lags involved—optimistically perhaps a decade for the program to be implemented and a generation or so (say 35 years) for people to perceive the change. All through that period, population growth would be accelerated by further lowering of the death rate. And then, of course, there is the minimum 50‐year gap between reaching replacement reproduction and reaching zero population growth. “Population control by reducing infant mortality” is another scenario that won't Stand the test of arithmetic. Does this mean there is nothing Americans can do to help hold back the world population flood? Should we not ship pills and condoms to the underdeveloped countries; should we not help them industrialize; should we not send them medical aid to lower their infant mortality rates? We probably should not, except under very special circumstances, but we probably will anyway. Who could morally deny aid to dying children, even if that aid promotes the death of many more children in the future? The only hope seems to be that these countries themselves will change the kinds of aid they request. The underdeveloped countries must break away from the ridiculous patterns of development that the overdeveloped countries followed and come up with their own goals and plans—ones that are appropriate to their cultures and realistic in terms of their resources and the need to maintain environmental quality. They must carefully control outside agencies, especially multinational corporations, that attempt to impose dangerous or unnecessary programs on them. These revised development plans should incorporate measures designed to reduce birth rates as rapidly as possible in ways that recognize the special characteristics of each country. Rather than trying to emulate the U.S. and other overdeveloped countries, they might look to. China, whose population policies are fully integrated with the health program and efforts to “develop.” Unfortunately, China has also pursued a course of massive industrialization, but in recent years, her goals have become relatively realistic. When realistic development plans are formulated, underdeveloped countries may ask for American aid, and hopefully we will be wise and compassionate enough to supply it. In a few countries, development and population control may involve limited industrialization. If their plans make sense and they want help, we should give it to them. In most countries, the best population control program may involve such approaches as the institution of social‐security systems and the expansion of maternal and child health programs, combined with intensive promotion of birth control. If these plans seem justifiable, the United States might help bankroll them. (A social‐security program showed promise at a pilot level in India). But it is clear that simply providing contraceptives without profound changes in the social system will have little effect. Other useful programs might include efforts to raise the status and educational level of women and a reversal of migration from farm to city. If underdeveloped cowltries want technical help, we could supply it. American helicopters might yet end up flying birth control devices around. But the point is that such aid should not be granted until the motivation has been provided by cultural change. Then and only then can aid in providing family planning services prove helpful. And the responsibility for planning and execution must remain with each country itself. It is questionable whether the underdeveloped countries can or will institute such programs in a way that can outrun the arithmetic of growth —many of their leaders are as infatuated with industrialization as most of ours (after all, a lot of them were trained in the London School of Economics) but their choice is to change or die. In the meantime, what can Mrs. Sturdley and other concerned Americans actually do to help solve the world population problem? The very best thing they can do is to forget about clumsily conceived overseas programs and concentrate on setting a good example here at home. That might seem a limited goal, but since the U.S. has for years stood as such a model of development for underdeveloped countries to emulate, it could make an important difference. The fact is that even at its current rapidly declining level, population growth in the U.S. is the most serious in the world, because of our enormously wasteful economy. We put the greatest per capita drain on irreplaceable resources. We launch the heaviest per capita assault on the global environmental systems on which civilization depends utterly for its existence. We have, it is true, recently dipped slightly below the replacement level of reproduction, but because of the lag time after achievement of low fertility, about 50 million Americans will be added to our population before we reach a state of zero population growth if the low fertility continues. In terms of damage to the planet, those 50 million are the equivalent of about 2 billion people added to the populations of the underdeveloped countries. So if Mrs. Sturdley truly wants to do something about the world population problem, she will have to make some sacrifices. She mild have her tubes tied before she has her second child. She ‐could disconnect the air‐conditioning in her Cadillac, drive it at no more than 55 miles per hour until it falls apart, and then replace it with a subcompact. She could urge C.F.P.L.T. to institute a crash program designed to keep the birth rate in the United States well below the replacement level— and to make sure it is designed to hit the superconsumers more than the poor. Mrs. Sturdley could pressure her oil millionaire husband to buy a few Senators and Congressmen and have them join forces with the few people already in the Government who understand the population problem in an effort to buttress the trend to fewer births with an explicit policy. They could urge Congress or the President to announce that not only is America overpopulated, it is too greedy for resources and too destructive of the environment. “Two at the most” could be declared the national childbearing goal, and the weight of Government propaganda could be thrown into achieving that goal. In addition to setting a direct example on the population control front, the United States could also take action on the consumption‐pollution “multipliers” that add so much to the impact of American population growth. Numerous steps could be instituted to reduce wasteful consumption and minimize environmental deterioration—tough, meaningful steps like bans on big cars, on most airconditioning and on most illuminated outdoor advertising. Adequate insulation could be required on all buildings. In short, the Government could adopt a tough population policy and move the economy into a period of “dedevelopment”; it could admit that we have gone too far down the road of growthmania. Perhaps if we did that, some underdeveloped countries would move more rapidly to change their development goals—after all, who would want to emulate self‐admitted mistakes? Such an approach, of course, would not be as easy or as comfortable as authorizing funds for programs of technical aid or supply, and for that reason, it is not likely to occur. But it might be a lot more meaningful, in the shrinking, time that is left, than condoms from helicopters, and it would certainly be more honest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAMUELS TO MEET LEADERS ON PLANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/17/archives/samuels-to-meet-leaders-on-plans-assails-unholy-alliance-wilson-and.html,"Howard J. Samuels, Democratic State Committee designee for Governor, said yesterday that he would meet a variety of leaders in the next few days to explore a course on the party's statewide primary contests. Meantime, he attacked Governor Wilson, the Republican nominee, for an “unholy alliance” with the Conservative party. He said the Governor had accepted the designation of “the Conservative party that stands against minimum wage, against unemployment insurance, even against Social Security.” “Malcolm Wilson has to show where he stands on the issues of the Conservative party,” Mr. Samuels asserted. For himself, he said he would “take the Liberal party support if I can get it.” On Saturday the Liberals designated former Deputy Mayor Edward A. Morrison for Governor but he indicated that he might withdraw in favor of Mr. Samuels or Representative Hugh L. Carey, depending on which one won the Sept. 10 Democratic primary. With other statewide Democratic primary contests currently slated for the nominations for Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Court of Appeals. Judges and United States Senator, Mr. Samuels said his only commitment so far was to back Judge Harold A. Stevens, first black member of the state's highest court. Judge Stevens and Justice Lawrence Cooke of the Appellate Division receieved State Committee designations for the two judgeships at stake, but Supreme Court Justice Bertram Harnett also won enough votes to allow him to enter a primary fight. An expected local primary battle for District Attorney of New York County materialized over the weekend when District Attorney Richard H. Kuh, appointed by Governor Wilson last Feb. 13, officially an nounced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Kuh must face Robert M. Morgenthau, former United States Attorney, who has been endorsed by the New Democratic Coalition. In announcing, Mr., Kuh attacked Mr. Morgenthau for “hectoring of unpopular individuals with repeated and unprovable indictments,” citing the lawyer Roy M. Cohn as having been indicted three times and acquitted each time. Representative Carey spent Father's Day yesterday with his 12 children at Shelter Island. Mr. Samuels, noting that he had nine children, took part in a WCBS‐TV “Newsmakers” broadcast and interviews afterward. Although he said he had had 70 per cent backing in both the State. Committee and the New Democratic Coalition, Mr, Samuels estimated, it would cost him $1 ‐ million for his campaign to primary day, even with both organizations at work. Any opponent like Mr. Carey would have to spend $1.5‐million for a field force and campaign, he said. Mr. Samuels hit at the abortion restrictions signed into law by Governor Wilson as “unconstitutional” and a program that “harasses the poor and the middle class.” The bill requires that abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy take place in a hospital, and those after the 20th week must have a second physician present to aid any live birth. While Mr. Samuels said he supported liberalized abortion, he said the trend had been “too much to one extreme encouraging abortion,” and “I think there is a right to life.” Asked about “another Catholic issue,” Mr. Samuels said his views on aid to parochial schools had “changed totally” In the last 10 years so that “I think pluralism in American education is now very essential.” He proposed aid on tax returns for “pluralistic” day care centers, voluntary hospitals and parochial schools. Ramsey Clark, former United States Attorney General, announced that he was starting collection of petitions at parties across the state at midnight last night, the first legal moment, to run in the primary for Senator. The Democratic State Committee had designated Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse for the nomination, but gave former Representative Allard K. Lowenstein enough votes to run in the primary without petitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aborting an Amendment,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/17/archives/aborting-an-amendment.html,"More than a year after the United States Supreme Court declared that abortion should be considered a private matter between, a woman and her physician, a strong campaign is on to make it a public matter between a woman and the Federal Government. This would be the effect of four “human life” amendments to the Constitution, now being pushed in Congress. All are designed to restrict the right of a woman or her physician to terminate pregnancy voluntarily. One Amendment would prohibit abortion even if a woman's life is in danger; another would go beyond abortion and prevent the use of birth control devices or drugs. The anti‐abortion forces already have achieved victories by attaching riders to other measures. Thus Medicaid “payments for abortion are denied to the poor under the Social Security Act; the foreign aid law includes a provision restricting funds for abortion, and the bill creating a legal services corporation would bar legal aid to the indigent in cases that might result from abortion. New York's three‐year‐old legalized abortion law has caused a decline in deaths from abortions, in maternal and infant deaths, and in the number of women hospitalized by furtive abortions. A constitutional amendment would be an unjustifiable and unworkable intrusion upon family life. The nation would simply return to a double standard under which the wealthy would continue to obtain abortions and the poor would be victimized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dual theme dominated Mr. Nixon's tightly scheduled 26‐hour visit to Israel, which included two meetings with Israeli leaders, a state banquet and a somber ceremony at. Yad Vashem, the memorial to the six million Jews killed during World War II. The President then went on to Amman, Jordan, for the last stop of his Middle Eastern tour. [1:8.] The Atomic Energy Commission said that China conducted a relatively large nuclear test early yesterday at her test range in the northwestern part of the country. Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger expressed no particular concern over the test. He said it “simply reflects the slow‐paced Chinese program,” which, he said, has been deliberate but “moderately successful.” [1:7.] A majority of the world's large oil‐exporting countries announced a 2 per cent increase in royalties paid by Western oil companies, But Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter, dissociated herself from the increase. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also decided at a ministerial meeting in Quito, Ecuador, to continue the posted price of oil at present record levels for another three months beginning July 1. [1:3.] A bomb that London police said was planted by the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army damaged Westminster Hall, the oldest and most historic part of the Houses of Parliament. Eleven persons were injured, none seriously. [1:5–6.] National “Your honor, I'd like to let you know how deeply embarrassed I am and how much I regret standing here before you this afternoon,” said Herbert W. Kalmbach, President Nixon's former personal lawyer, as he was sentenced to six to 18 months in prison and fined $10,000 for illegal fund‐raising activities on behalf of the White House. He was sentenced by Judge John J. Sirica in Federal District Court in Washington. [1:1–2.] Supermarket spokesmen promised to try to reduce meat prices and promote sales at a White House meeting of Government and food‐industry officials on the financial troubles of the nation's cattle producers. [1:4.] In a decision regarded as a serious setback for women's rights advocates, the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that states can deny disability benefits to women incapacitated by normal pregnancy without committing unconstitutional discrimination. In the majority opinion, Justice Potter Stewart said, “there is nothing in the Constitution that requires the state to subordinate or compromise its legitimate interests solely to create a more comprehensive social insurance program than it already has.” [1:5–6.] Metropolitan Four more Regents examinations were canceled, bringing to nine the number of tests called off by state education authorities. The Brooklyn District Attorney, Eugene Gold, said that he believed that test booklets or answer sheets had been stolen from three schools in the borough and given wide distribution. The latest examinations that were canceled were the revised chemistry and physics tests and the comprehensive social studies and Hebrew tests. [1:1–2.] The New Jersey State Senate, voting 23 to 13, passed a controversial bill that would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for elective abortions. The bill's opponents contended that it discriminated against the poor and was unconstitutional. It will go to the Assembly. [43:2–3.] A Brooklyn Congressional district that had been reapportioned under a Justice Department order so that a black could be elected will probably have a white Representative instead. City Councilman Samuel D. Wright, the black Democrat who had been expected to run for Congress in the new 14th Congressional district, said he would not run because he believed he could not win, even though the district is more than half black and Puerto Rican, owing to poor voter turnout in minority areas.

Jersey Senate Restricts Medicaid for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/18/archives/jersey-senate-restricts-medicaid-for-abortions.html,"TRENTON, June 17—The State Senate passed today controversial bill that would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for elective abortions. The vote, 23 to 13, came after 20 minutes of debate during which opponents of the measure contended that it would discriminate against the poor and was unconstitutional. The bill now goes to the Assembly, which is expected to consider on Monday another anti‐abortion proposal, also passed earlier by the Senate. The latter measure would permit hospitals or individuals to refuse to perform elective abortions without fear of being liable for legal or disciplinary sanctions. The restriction on Medicaid payments for abortions was sponsored by Senator Joseph P.

Abortions cannot be said to save life. If anything, they destroy it. Medicaid is intended to pay for medical services to combat sickness and save life.

Similar arguments came from Democratic Senators Matthew Feldman, the majority leader, of Bergen County; Mrs. Anne Martindell, of Princeton; Stephen B. Wiley, of Morris County and Martin L. Greenberg, of Essex County. All expressly avoided taking aides for or against abortion, concentrating their fire on what they insisted were the bill's discriminatory and unconstitutional aspects. “The court has spoken,” said Senator Wiley. It is a divisive and difficult issue, and whatever our personal views may be, the court's ruling is the law of the land.” And Senator Greenberg added: “The issue is, shall we distinguish among our citizens. Shall we pick and choose between those who have rights and those who don't?” Senator Feldman commented that “whether you are proabortion or antiabortion is quite beside the point.” Describing the bill as “clearly unconstitutional,” he said the measure imposed restrictions 'only on women poor enough to be on welfare and who have no other resources to pay for abortion.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/20/archives/metropolitan-briefs-suit-assails-property-tax-for-schools-city.html,"Suit Assails Property Tax for Schools Boards of education, public school children and parents from 25 school districts throughout the state charged in a suit yesterday in State Supreme Court in Mineola, L.I., that New York's system of financing public school education through property taxes violated the state and Federal Constitutions. The suit charged that the system discriminated against children in “poor” school districts compared with those attending wealthier districts. Similar suits have been successful in California and New Jersey, but one in Texas failed. The class action, led by the Levittown, L.I., Board of Education, is against the University of the State of New York, the Commissioner of Education, the State Controller and the State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. City Project Rents Limited Some 11,850 families in City Housing Authority apartments will be spared all or part of the rent increases that are to take effect Aug. 1, the authority chairman, Joseph J. Christian, and Mayor Beame announced. The families involved, mostly elderly nonwelfare tenants, will be limited to rent payments equal to 25 per cent of their income, the two officials said, at a cost of some $364,000 to the city. Across‐the‐board rent increases of 7.5 to 8.5 per cent effective Aug. 1 in Housing Authority projects were announced last month. Tenants were asked to react to the announcement. “Of all the responses we received,” Mr. Christian said, “by far the most moving appeals came from elderly families ... who are living on tiny fixed incomes and who would experience genuine hardship.” City officials said they would seek reimbursement from the state for the cost of this project. Harrison Moves Toward Village Status Town Supervisor John Passidomo ruled favorably on a petition by residents of Harrison to incorporate as a village, short‐circuiting attempts by the fire district of Purchase to proceed with its own plans to incorporate, form its own zoning board and walk away with a substantial portion of the Harrison tax base. Unless Purchase contests Mr. Passidomo's ruling within 30 days, a townwide referendum will be held determining whether or not the Harrison incorporation becomes law. Since Harrison voters outnumber Purchase voters 4 to 1 it's expected to pass easily. Once Harrison achieves village status Purchase is precluded under state law from any further attempt to incorporate. Byrne Backs Medicaid‐Abortion Ban Governor Byrne said he would sign legislation to prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for elective abortions. Such a bill cleared the Senate Monday and is favored to win approval in the Assembly. Asked at a news conference if he thought the bill was constitutional, since similar ones have been struck down by the courts in other states, Mr. Byrne said: “If it isn't, it isn't,” adding that he would leave the final decision up to the courts. The American Civil Liberties Union is expected to bring a court challenge on any bill that bans Medicaid payments for abortions. Jury Selection Starts in Brasco Trial As the selection of jurors began in Federal District Court here for the retrial of Representative Frank J. Brasco, Democrat of Brooklyn, on charges of influence peddling, Judge John M. Cannella told them that they would be sequestered for the duration of the trial. Edward M. Shaw, chief of the Organized Strike Force for the Southern District, said he expected the trial to last three to four weeks. Mr. Brasco, 41 years old, and his uncle, Joseph Brasco, 72, were indicted last year on charges of conspiring to obtain post office contracts for a trucking company with alleged organized crime connections in return for $27,500 in payoffs. The first trial ended in a hung jury last March. Joseph Brasco's case has been severed because of his illness. From the Police Blotter: A man who was found lying in front of 302 Livonia Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn with a puncture wound of the chest late Tuesday night died early yesterday at Brookdale Hospital. He was identified as Henry Simmon, 28 years old, of no known address...

Governor Would Sign Ban On Medicaid for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/20/archives/governor-would-sign-ban-on-medicaid-for-abortion-3-catholics.html,"TRENTON, June 19—Governor Byrne said today that he would sign legislation pending in the Assembly that would bar Medicaid payments to poor women for abortions. Such a measure was approved by the State Senate on Monday and sent to the Assembly, where final approval is anticipated. The bill would negate a ruling, handed down last November, in which the then State Attorney General, George F. Kugler Jr., sanctioned the use of Medicaid funds for “medically indicated” abortions performed on poor women. Last year, the United States Supreme Court ruled that no state could interfere with the right of a woman to have an abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Legislative efforts to restrict the use of public welfare funds for elective abortions have been consistently struck down by the courts. Recently, the United States District Court in Connecticut ruled that the State Welfare Department must pay for elective abortions for poor women. The court said that a state law that banned such payments except when the life of the mother was at stake violated the Supreme Court decision. Mr. Byrne's decision promises another politically explosive confrontation on an issue that has divided the state on religious grounds. 3 Catholics Opposed The Governor's antiabortion position also is consistent with that of his two predecessors, William T. Cahill, a Republican, and Richard J. Hughes, a Democrat. All three are practicing Roman Catholics in a state where the majority of the voters are estimated to be Roman Catholics. As a result of Mr. Kugler's ruling, Medicaid payments have been provided in New Jersey for abortions. The state's Medicaid director, William J. Jones, estimates that the program has provided more than $240,000 for such operations since the Supreme Court ruling last year. At a news conference in his outer office here, Mr. Byrne was asked if he thought the pending legislation was constitutional, given the decisions handed down by courts in other states. The Governor replied that he had not received a legal opinion from the State Attorney General, William F. Hyland. In any event, he said, some questions are better left to the courts to decide. The legislation's chief sponsor, State Senator Joseph P. Merlino, a Mercer County Democrat, said the bill was designed “to force the hands” of Governor Byrne and the New Jersey courts in interpreting last year's Supreme Court decision. Despite that ruling, New Jersey's Right to Life organization, the principal antiabortion group in the state, has continued to campaign hard against abortions, with its latest move directed against the use of any state of Federal funds to pay for them. No Hope for Compromise Unlike other emotionally charged issues that have divided the Legislature, abortion does not hold out the hope of compromise. Opponents of abortion contend that it is murder. Advocates of abortions contend that it is a mother's undeniable right to decide whether to have a child or to terminate her pregnancy. Furthermore, they contend that the Merlino bill is particularly discriminatory since it would effectively bar abortions to poor women, while the rich and the middle class could afford them. Should the Merlino measure receive final approval later this year in the assembly and the Governor sign the bill into law, such groups as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization of Women are expected to institute a legal attack against it almost immediately. In another development, the Governor said he would now support a move by the commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to appoint Gerdes Kuhbach as the authority's executive director. Mr. Kuhbach has been serving in the post in an acting capacity, filling the vacancy created when Austin J. Tobin retired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ACCORD REACHED IN ABORTION SUIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/21/archives/accord-reached-in-abortion-suit-2-doctors-drop-case-after-pickets-a.html,"HACKENSACK, June 20—Two Englewood physicians agreed today to drop their suit against a local anti‐abortionist group after the anti‐abortionists agreed to move picket lines away from the offices where the physicians perform abortions, vasectomies and other medical services. A consent order obtained in a private conference with Superior Court Judge George B. Gelman here provided that the demonstrators, representing the Right to Life anti‐abortion organization, will confine their picketing to an area across the street from the offices of Metropolitan Medical Associates to prevent them from confronting patients, employes or the physicians. The partners in the medical group, Dr. Robert M. Livingston and Dr. Stephen H. Jaffe, had filed suit in Superior Court to have the picketing enjoined. They charged that threatening gestures by the pickets' signs and shouted epithets such as “slut,” “whore” and “murderer” against individuals entering their offices could provoke violence and result in “a clear and present danger to the community.” Infertility Expert Dr. Livingston, an obstetrician and gynecologist, who has performed hundreds of abortions in direct challenge of New Jersey's laws, has become a particular target of such antiabortion groups as Right to Life. He is also a specialist, in the field of treating infertility. Before an open hearing scheduled in Judge Gelman's chambers began, lawyers for they two physicians and for the New Jersey Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is defending the anti‐abortionists in a surprising change in its customary defense of the right to abortion, met privately with the judge for nearly an hour. Judge Gelman then announced in open court that both sides had agreed on the terms of consent order “regulating the defendants and all other persons who wish to demonstrate and picket and to carry on their activities in connection with the plaintiffs' medical office.” 4 Hours a Day The decree provided that the picketing would be limited to four hours a day, and to one day a week, that the marching would be restricted to the east side of Engle Street, across from the physicians' office and in front of the Englewood Public Library, and that copies of the court order would be distributed to all members of the Bergen County chapter of the Right to Life Committee and other demonstrators. Judge Gelman noted that the order was “not limiting anyone, verbally or otherwise” in a way that would deprive them of their constitutional rights of free speech or assembly. Ironically, the state chapter of the A.C.L.U. defended Dr. Livingston when he was charged with breaking the state's antiabortion laws, which have since been declared unconstitutional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/22/archives/letters-to-the-editor-save-our-innercity-neighborhoods-on-baiting.html,"To the Editor: New York needs a comprehensive program to safeguard existing innercity neighborhoods having moderate population densities and to redevelop others. Proposed mortgage assistance to brownstone owners is highly welcome. However, a broader and more neighborhood‐oriented approach is needed. We should recognize that highdensity areas should alternate with areas of moderate or low density, or with adequate‐sized open spaces, if urban patterns are to be viable, either environmentally or economically, over more than two or three generations. High buildings need low buildings near them if they are to be permanently livable. City planning and development agencies gradually should plan such neighborhoods into the city fabric, through special rezoning and developmental initiatives. The prevailing high‐density approach to inner‐city residential development fails to attract the families which the city most needs for its economic and social health, The environments which result are inhabited principally by the rich, by couples, by single persons and by large numbers of impoverished households, much of whose housing must he subsidized, either directly or through increased costs of community and welfare services. The city has endured well‐known environmental, transportation, fiscal and social crises concurrently, and probably as a consequence. Families reared their children with relative convenience and safety (without being subsidized) when New York's inner neighborhoods were composed of town houses, tenements and moderate‐sized apartment buildings, and when densities in such blocks ranged upward from forty families to the acre, occasionally reaching 100, but rarely exceeding this maximum. Densities have been allowed to increase constantly until real‐estate developers today can insert apartment towers with 400 families to the acre (R‐10) in many already heavily builtup areas, and huge publicly sponsored residential developments, like Battery Park City and. Manhattan Landing, propose densities of from 200 to 250 (11‐8). Unless inner‐city neighborhoodslike East and West Village, Chelsea, Clinton and the huge West Side—are to be overwhelmed by the twin menaces of high‐developed pressures or excessive physical decay, methods must be found whereby they can be redeveloped in ways which are socially and environmentally acceptable, largely through private realestate initiative. For this to take place, however, moderate‐density environments must be programed in the inner city in order to attract more families able to afford the products of this initiative. HENRY D. WHITNEY New York, June 12, 1974 The writer, an architect and planner, is former chairman of the Committee on the Plan For New York City of the American Institute of Planners. On Baiting Con Ed To the Editor: Mrs. Stafford's June 8 Op‐Ed article regarding her harassment of Con Edison does no credit to her; nor does it enhance your own good judgment to devote space for such a story. Apparently both Mrs. Stafford and you do not realize that it is precisely people like her who increase the costs of this valuable service to all of us. Her pride in her inanities reminds me of the graffiti “artists” who also forget that their childish doings violate the esthetic feelings of all of us by smearing public property. It is time that we realize that our public utilities, like municipal services, are not to be abused. The costs of such abuse are being borne by all of us, and not by a mythical Mr. Con Edison or Mr. Telephone Co., etc. am truly outraged at the lack of understanding portrayed by a “supposedly” intelligent citizen. FREDERICK S. BLASER Kew Garden Hills, N. Y., June 10, 1974 How to Raise Oil Prices To the Editor; The Saudi Arab‐Aramco “agreement on ownership of Aramco” (news story June 11) is not an agreement and has nothing to do with ownership. The sole owner, Saudi Arabia, has again raised its take per barrel. Previously, Aramco owed Saudi Arabia $8 for each barrel which Aramco produced: $5.29 as “tax” on the “equity” portion (¾) and $2.71 as the price of the “buy‐back” portion (¼). Now the equity portion is reduced to 40 per cent, the buy‐back portion is raised to 60 per cent, and therefore the payment per barrel has been raised to $9.32. (The numbers are approximate; the exact figures vary by quality of oil.) If Saudi Arabia were now to reduce the “posted price” from $11.65 to $9, its take per barrel would be down to about $7.20, an 80‐cent reduction after the midyear. For the year as whole, it might be money ahead or behind. But as of “June 10, nothing has happened except another hike of $1.32 per barrel, retroactive through the first of the year 1974. M. A. ADELMAN Professor of Economics, M.I.T. Cambridge, Mass., June 14, 1974 • On the Abortion Battle To the Editor: We appreciate your editorial [June 17] on the abortion situation. It will help alert people who are unaware of the many successes that the compulsory pregnancy people have had in their drive to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court abortion decision. There is one point in the editorial which requires clarification. The amendment to deny medical payments for abortions, introduced by Senator James Buckley, passed the Senate by voice vote and is now in a joint conference committee. It is appalling that such a blatantly discriminating amendment could pass the Senate, but with one exception, such amendments, made on the floor with no committee discussion, have been passing both houses consistently, overwhelmingly and with little public awareness. BEATRICE BLAIR Executive Director Natl. Abortion Rights Action League New York, June 17, 1974 In Lieu of Spanking To the Editor: As a dean in an intermediate school I have followed with great interest the reports on the paddling incident at J.H.S. 22, Bronx. 1 find that it is usually regarded in isolation from other factors and no attempt is made to draw the necessary conclusions. Corporal punishment in greater or lesser degrees takes place in many intermediate and junior high schools that are in economically depressed areas. What has been happening at 22 is a symptom of a greater pathology whose primary agents are the central Board of Education (not withstanding the Chancellor's recent pronouncements in favor of humane treatment of students), most local boards, elected officials and political leaders of hoth parties and, sad to say, the Shanker leadership of the United Federation of Teachers. These groups have encouraged the notion that schools such as J.H.S. 22 should be basically custodial, whose graduates will provide a cheap labor pool. Shanker's rationale for corporal punishment (U.F.T. advertisement June 2) is that it tends to elicit “obedietice.” Far from improving behavior (and presumably learning), physical punishment nearly always has the opposite effect of further alienating students by humiliating them. If we are serious about reversing the trend of massive pupil failure which usually accompanies serious behavior problems, then we must be prepared to implement many radical changes now. We must strive to eliminate racism and sexism in all its many forms. We must completely overhaul our teacher training institutions and make them more relevant to the tasks of today's urban teacher. The pathological bureaucracy at 110 Livingston Street (including its tenant the Board of Examiners) must be torn down and replaced with women and men who are familiar with the problems of the community and who will see to it that community boards hold superintendents and principals accountable for their actions. The main criterion for judging their performance must be the degree, to which aid is given to the classroom teacher which enables the latter to do a more effective job. Finally, the U.F.T. leadership must stop its collusion with the employer in many areas which are detrimental to both students and teachers (meek acceptance of budget cuts, favoritism for certain jobs, lack of a desire to evaluate old programs and push for the necessary changes, etc.). However, before there can be any hope of lasting positive changes the union must find a way to gain the trust of and form alliances with parents and interested members of the community.. DAVID SILVER Dean, I.S. 33, Brooklyn Brooklyn, June 14, 1974 To the Roots of Inflation To the Editor: Your report by Michael C. Jensen on June 7 of the warning by the panel of prominent economists that world inflation is approaching the “crisis stage” cited the various factors contributing to it and pointed out that “government borrowing and government‐guaranteed borrowing to pay for social programs were dominating the long‐term capital markets which provide the benchmark for other credit markets.” But the remarks of Albert Sommers, chief economist of the Conference Board, also quoted by the report, tended to raise the level of thinking to embrace deeper and wider implications: The real roots of inflation, Mr. Sommers said, lie in “a profound historical shift in the social conditions and value systems of democratic cape italism.” And because of the “explosion of expectations that carry demand for output far beyond their finite resources,” he concludes that “a real solution can only be found in a change of attitudes.” This is easier said than done. The groundwork for runaway inflation was laid some forty years ago when etassical economics was ditched for the Marx ‐ Keynes syndrome. From that time, the dubious “full employment” concept, implemented by budget deficits and high taxation, was assiduously promoted by the entire liberal fraternity. Thus, undue emphasis was placed consumption to the disadvantage of savings and production, and of a sound currency. Instead of producing, in order to consume, the mood Of society thereafter became one of con suming in order to produce. To reverse the process, therefore, requires a new kind of thinking, a new psychology. Inflation may be construed as demand far outstripping supply, but it is also supply prevented from matching de?? mand. Certainly cut non‐defense spending to the bone if necessary (as urged by President Nixon, not for the first times on May, 28 in his interim economic report), but at the same time increase the supply factor of the monetary equation by freeing industry of all bureaucratic meddling and persecution. This would include repeal of the costly and ineffectual antitrust laws and those taxes (such as the progressive income and inheritance taxes) that raise the level of industrial costs an hinder capital accumulation, and are levied not primarily for revenue but for redistributing wealth. Admittedly this is an, ambitious program, but if a real solution requires “a change of attitudes,” the hackneyed notion that only government action can cure inflation must, be abandoned, and liberal, unconditional reliance placed for the very first time on free markets. RAYMOND V. MCNALLY London, June 8, 1974 • Tolerated Terror To the Editor: Mr. Faris of the Association of Arab‐American University Graduates in his letter of June 15 on terror by, Jews, stopped short of the main point: The inexcusable attacks he noted, were perpetrated by independent ?? vate armies in existence before the establishment of the State of Israel. Once the Government started functioning, it gave notice that such groups would not he tolerated. This policy was forcefully underscored by the destruction of the Altalena in June 1948 as she was bringing arms to the Irgun, the largest of the private armies. Were the Arab nations to act similarly, who can doubt that a major cause of violence in the Mideast would disappear. Lebanon is presently most grievously at fault in this regard. MELVIN S. FINSTEN, New Brunswick, N.J., June 15, 1974, • Blood's Worth To the Editor: The legislation submitted by Representative Koch (H.R. 700) to allow a Federal tax deduction as a charitable contribution of $25 for donation of a pint of blood, with a maximum of. $125 annually (letter, June 11) is potentially a fine idea. However, it extends one of the gross inequities of the United States income tax system and would result in the anomaly that a rich man's blood is worth more than a poor man's blood. A married taxpayer having a taxable income of $5,000 a year pays a tax of 19 per cent on his income; accordingly, his deduction for a done.; tion of one pint of blood would by worth $4.75 in tax savings to him. But a married taxpayer earning $100,000 a year who pays a tax of 62 per? cent on his highest income would receive a tax savings of $15.50 for the same donation of a pint of blood. Equity, it seems to me, would require that Representative Koch redraft his bill so as to provide for a tax credit of, say, $10 instead of a deduction. WILLIAM D. SIEGEL Mineola, L.

Tracking down a predatory prey,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/23/archives/the-death-of-the-detective-tracking-down-a-predatory-prey-by-mark.html,"Mark Smith, who published two relatively unnoticed novels during the 1960's, has now written one remarkable for both its ambition and its accomplishment. It is 596 pages long, and every one of them is a pleasure to read. It is full, rich and deep—a complete success. It is set in Chicago, during the Korean War, the city hunched and twitching in air thick with menace, an “atmosphere of sequestered sin and naked violence.” Our anxious eyes keep seeing things in the restless shadows, a human form, a madman shaking his fists at the moon, Joseph Helenowski, who has just broken out of the asylum that sealed him off from us while he bided his time. He is out to prove that what his doctors call a delusion of grandeur is as sure as sin and more certain than life. Joseph Helenowski believes that he is Death itself, the most potent force in the universe, its secret motive and design. His first victim is a drunken Indian asleep under a bush in Bughouse Square. Around the smothered commotion of the murder, figures wheel as though On a carrousel: crackbrained orators, jeering listeners, an unraveled female courting Jesus with hymn and dance, a marching Salvation Army band, old men singing “Home on the Range,” and teen‐age boys looking for trouble. Helenowski flits out of sight, reappears, is glimpsed haunting the shrubbery beside the mansion of a rich old man who lies dying. Inside, the old man is dictating a hugger‐mugger letter of accusation and confession to his maid, an “account of insanity, imprisonment, adultery, abortion, rape, venereal disease, illegitimacy, threats of murder, along with less definable actions of inhumanity, sacrilege, perversion” —as the squirming old man and his uptight maid see it. The reader, once the details come out, is likely to see it as only a bit more than ordinary human selfishness and Lust. Helenowski, nursing wrongs real and imagined, sees it as grounds for “unmasking, blinding, castration, death,” the recipients of which are to be the old man, his doctor, his lawyer—and Magnuson, once a policeman, then a detective, and now the famous head of a vast organization of uniformed private guards. In the minds of Chicagoans, Magnuson and his men stand for all that seals off from honest citizens the lunatic violence that is everywhere, biding its time. As Helenowski stalks his victims, Magnuson stalks Helenowski, the detective always arriving on the scene just after Death has struck, by drowning, by strangulation, by shotgun, hatchet, pitchfork, beer bottle, by whatever lies at hand, until there are a dozen corpses. The crossings of these great opponents trace out a map of Chicago, from Lake Forrest mansions, Gold Coast luxury apartments and the Mayor's offices to factories and parks, working class taverns, lesbian bars, whorehouses, carnivals, Polish picnics, slums, slaughterhouses, rubble, renewals and new ruins, Skid Row. A thousand concrete observations gradually build up all the mass and detail of the city's double existence as material and imaginative fact. The means of construction is a realism so selective and precise and everything is at once a and simply what it is. Lodged on the various ethnic and social strata of the city are scores of characters. They are remarkably diverse, vivid and distinct. But finally they seem as though caught in a buried network of fatal interconnections, bound to their positions and to each other by hidden ties of blood or marriage, of occupations or crime, of obsessions or vices, of uncanny symmetries and obscure complicities. These characters are all shaken in their knotted fixities by the passage of the detective and his predatory prey, who are themselves knot ted as close to each other as if bound by their navel cords. At one point, dazed, tired, no longer sure who or what is right or wrong, the detective wonders whether he has “deluded himself into believing he was preventing murders and chasing a murderer when in fact he was the murderer and pursued no one but his mad, malevolent, violent self.” His delirious conclusion, which has its own kind of truth, is that “it was not so much a man that Magnuson pursued as it was a force. The evil, natural, ultimate force of death. But not so much a force as the working out of Magnuson's own spiritual destiny, which was in the end himself. Which was in the end no more or less than death.” In spite of a few (very few) passages like the one just quoted, this novel is no monstrous allegory; even less is it a black comedy or zany satire. In its crowded inventiveness, its shouldering complications and looping exfoliations of plot, in its haunted urban atmospherics, the novel reads as though it were written by a resurrected Charles Dickens, one chilled by a hundred years of graveyard brooding, his humor become muted and grim, his melodrama twisted into a pervasive eeriness, the moral shrouded in ambiguities. I would guess that Mark Smith has meditated this novel for a good number of years. It is certainly the product of careful writing and patient observation. It is absolutely worth reading. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thousands have signed a document that says, in effect: ‘If I'm terminally ill, pull the plug’",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/23/archives/the-living-willand-the-will-to-live-thousands-have-signed-a.html,"A few years ago, at a conference on death and dying at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, I sat next to an attractive young woman whose name tag read, “Hi! I'm Betty L—.” During the coffee break, as we talked, she showed me a “Living Will” requesting that doctors take responsibility for doing what she herself would be unable to do if she became hopelessly ill—terminate her life. Although the will was not binding, she hoped that when “her time came” they would take it seriously. Addressed to “My family, my physician, my clergyman, my lawyer,” this legal‐looking document expressed the wish that “if there is no reasonable expectation of my recovery from physical or mental disability, I, Betty L—, be allowed to die and not be kept alive by artificial means or heroic measures . . . I ask that drugs be mercifully administered to me for terminal suffering even they hasten the moment of death.” It was hard to visualize that vivacious woman hooked up to the awesome machinery of intensive care—the catheters, respirators, monitors, bottles and intravenous tubes by which a dying person can be kept alive. But her fear of this possibility, I found out, is not unusual. At least 300,000 model wills have been distributed by churches, doctors and even schools, and no one knows how many people have written their own. When Abigail Van Buren described the will in her widely syndicated “Dear Abby” column, the Euthanasia Educational Council—prime supplier of the document—received 50,000 requests representing every state the union. “Right to Die” educational kits are supplied by the Euthanasia Council to schools throughout the country, down to grade seven; and for $55, a 56‐minute “Right to Die” film, in color, can be rented by organizations. Bills to legalize voluntary euthanasia have been introduced in a number of state legislatures (none, however, have been approved); and although doctors in general are wary of committing themselves in public, many admittedly “pull the plug”—or have the nurse trip over it—when there is no hope of recovery. Dr. Walter W. Sackett Jr., a Miami, Fla., general practitioner—if not the Semmelweiss of geriatric medicine, at least its Billy Mitchell—boasts that he has allowed “hundreds patients” to die by withholding treatment, and sees no other satisfactory answer to the problem of prolonged terminal illness. The right to die hardly competes with Women's Lib for public attention, nor is it as controversial as abortion; to many people, however, it represents one of the last unresolved issues in the battle for human rights. Many civil libertarians, for example, contending that everyone is entitled to control over his own body, assert that one's mode of dying should be as privileged a part of one's life‐style as long hair, clothes and sex. Under the Constitution, they argue, the right to die is as inalienable as the right to live. The slogan of the movement, “Death with Dignity,” implies a rejection of the paraphernalia by which a terminal patient is kept alive, usually at great cost to his family and in isolation from them. Such “intensive care”—so the argument goes—is often less for the patient's benefit than the physician's; it reduces the person to an object, prolongs dying (rather than living) and, for many people, needlessly makes death a psychologically, if not physically, anguishing experience. This upsurge of interest in death with dignity, however, has obscured an undercurrent of doubt, and even outright opposition, on the part of clergymen, doctors and legal experts who question whether dying is quite that simple, or that it is a “right” that can be isolated from society's right to protect human life. Some of the movement's earliest ideologists are also beginning to have second thoughts about specific directions the movement is taking. “The Living Will is hard for me to swallow,” says Dr. Austin H. Kutscher, a professor of dentistry at Columbia Presbyterian Medical School and president of the Foundation of Thanatology, a New York‐based educational and research organization that promotes a broader understanding of the “new” dying among both professionals and laymen. “An individual signs it under circumstances when he is not concerned with his own death. It becomes operative at a time when he is 100 per cent involved. There's no provision for canceling out.” (Mindful of this criticism, the Euthanasia Council has since amended its will by suggesting that signers redate it once a year if their wishes are unchanged). For Dr. Robert Kastenbaum, a research psychologist and gerontologist who has written widely on the subject of dying, promoting the right to die is a “cop‐out” that gives the medical profession an excuse to limit, rather than improve, care of the dying. “It's much easier to talk about mercy killing,” he says, “than to try to add comfort and value to a terminal life.” Critics of the right to die admit there are times when human life is so meaningless that death may be preferable. A man or woman with irreversible brain damage who remains hostage to a heart‐lung machine can hardly be said to “live” at all. Similarly, the moribund old person is psychologically, if not physically, dead, although it is unlikely that he suffers. For these patients, “pulling the plug” may be the only solution. A matter of medical judgment, often performed with the family's consent, it is a perfectly legal as well as merciful way letting “natural” death take over from the machines. It does not, however, expedite what otherwise would not have occurred. Such clear‐cut instances, however, represent a small number of problem deaths and, in any case, medicine already handles them with discretion and mercy. The real danger, these opponents point out, lies in an overly simplistic attitude toward dying in general, primarily the view that a “good” death is something that can be anticipated and managed. What may appear to be an Individual right, moreover, is actually entwined in a number of social relationships. Before a verdict can be rendered, they say, at least four crucial aspects of the problem need to be examined: (1) Does a person, in fact, have a constitutional right to die? If so, is the right always in his best interests? (2) Does death by choice represent medicine's best answer to the admittedly difficult question incurable and/or terminal illness? (3) Does society have an investment in human life—and the concept of its sacredness—that overrides the individual, if not legally, at least morally? (Conversely, does the notion of “easy death” give society a dangerous weapon to regulate population in a world burdened with too many unproductive people?) (4) Does the right to die, in effect, sanction unconscious, self‐destructive impulses in people? it another escapist symptom in a world looking for easy answers to the human dilemma? The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on a case involving the right to die; its constitutional standing, therefore, is not certain. Lower courts have almost always ruled in favor of the individual when it can be shown that he or she is a mentally competent adult. A few years ago, in Miami, Fla., Judge David Popper, of the Dade County Circuit Court, declared that a Cuban refugee, Mrs. Carmen Martinez, had the legal right to refuse continued treatment for hemolytic anemia. The treatment was extremely painful—“cutdowns,” or surgical incisions, were made into the skin so that blood could be forced into her veins. After two months of this, Mrs. Martinez begged her doctors to let her die. Uncertain of their own rights, they went to court and received approval to stop treatment. “This woman has a right not to be hurt,” Judge Popper ruled. “She has a right to live or die in dignity.” The transfusions were stopped and one day later Mrs. Martinez died. To avoid the need for adjudicating every questionable case that might arise, some 1,700 New York State physicians petitioned the Legislature several years ago to permit voluntary euthanasia, with safeguards. To exercise this right to die, however, the patient was required to make solemn application on a prescribed form in the presence of two witnesses. The sponsorship of two doctors was also necessary. An independent referee would then interview the person, to be followed by a five‐day waiting period in which he could change his mind. Final decision was to be made by a court, which had three days to act. If the petition was denied, the patient had the right of appeal. Clearly, this was no road to a quiet and easy death. For all practical purposes, the dying person was required to fight a lawsuit, in the face of which, one lawyer commented, “it might really be easier for him to hang on and make the best of it.” Nevertheless, a streamlined, somewhat less cumbersome version of this bill has been redrafted and is awaiting introduction in the next session of the Legislature. Critics of such legislation point out that the real problem is not the mentally competent adult who suffers an incurable and painful disease, but the unconscious or confused patient who is in no condition to make his wishes known and who, in fact, may not be suffering at all. A California doctor cites a patient with irreversible brain damage who was kept “alive” for eight years with a catheter his bladder. “Every eight hours a nurse would poke a tube down his throat and shoot some food in . . .” Three special nurses were required and the cost of “treatment” for the period amounted to almost $200,000. Dr. Richard Restak, writing in The Washington Post, describes the case of a young Pennsylvania man, Robert Carter, who was injured in an automobile accident in 1966 and has been unconscious ever since. At one point, six years after the accident, Carter's father decided that it was time to quit and, with the doctor's consent, plans were made to stop the intravenous feeding. Then, overnight, the father changed his mind. He was willing to go on with his 27‐year‐old son in an unconscious state. The mother of a man I know is senile, although otherwise sound at 89. Recently, she fell and broke her hip. Surgery, if she survived it, would prolong her life for months, if not years. The family, not the mother, must make the decision. “How can I ask her if she wants to go on living,” her son says, “when she doesn't know who I am?” Advocates of death by consent say these problems would be taken care of by the Living Will; this is doubtful, however, since the will at present has no legal force. Professor Cyril Means of the New York University Law School, an expert on constitutional law, suggests solving the question by a Committee of the Person to do for the unconscious or incompetent patient what the law already provides for in the management of his personal affairs—in a word, death (or life) by committee. Some hospitals already employ group decisions to this end. Family, clergy, medical staff and possibly a psychiatrist are brought in to render a verdict when the patient cannot speak for himself. But, in the opinion of many doctors, the risks inherent in choosing death may be even greater when the patient can speak for himself. The option of refusing treatment can seldom be separated from the subjective context of the illness. In short, the patient may not necessarily know his true condition. He may think he is dying when, in fact, he has good chances for recovery. He may be in postoperative depression. He may worry about the financial burden he is imposing on his family. None of these reasons justify the termination of treatment. Doctors tend to resist such pleas, even though the courts now seem to side with the patient. Unfortunately, a strictly construed “right to die” includes the right to be mistaken. Worse, it is a mistake that, once made, cannot be corrected. Although he is a member of the Euthanasia Council's Medical Advisory Committee, Dr. Avery Weisman, a Boston psychiatrist and professor at Harvard Medical School, has never signed a Living Will. “I don't want someone pulling the plug on me because they need the bed,” he says, adding, “I know some doctors that I wouldn't want in charge of telling me the time of day, let alone the time to die.” For most physicians, however, it is not the truly terminal case that creates a dilemma. Far more common are patients who suffer from such prolonged illnesses as cancer, coronary disease and kidney failure, as well as the elderly man or woman who “lingers on” with a multiplicity of ailments long after death has started rapping at the door. For the former group, modern drugs not only control pain but can make possible an extended life span that is useful and meaningful to the person. They also hold out the promise of a cure. Pernicious anemia and diabetes mellitus were once “incurable” diseases. Blood infections were often fatal, as was pneumonia. Effective treatment of such diseases, once considered “extraordinary,” is now commonplace. The “right to die,” physicians point out, comes at a time when breakthroughs in medical progress have never been brighter, and when society is placing a renewed value on the lives of the elderly. In any case, they add, it is not machine medicine that allows more people to live to be old and feeble, but antibiotics, a healthier environment, improved nutrition and better medical care in general —and no one proposes to eliminate these. Nor is intensive care always the chamber of horrors that death‐with‐dignity enthusiasts accuse it of being. It is the outsider's unfamiliarity with this equipment, medical specialists contend, that makes it resemble a torture rack. The patient who has difficulty breathing, or who cannot swallow, would be more uncomfortable without it even in a terminal situation. “Dignity,” writes Dr. Franklin H. Epstein of the Harvard Medical School, “lies in the patient's fight for life and in his struggle to maintain human contact, in the feeling that someone cares about him and is trying to help him.” Withdrawing treatment doesn't necessarily mean that a patient will die with dignity; it means that he will probably die quicker. There is some evidence, in fact, that intensive care, in spite of its frightening apparatus, reassures the seriously ill person and strengthens his will to live. Dr. Thomas Hackett and a group of colleagues studied a number of coronary patients in the intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. They found that those who accepted the “machines” most readily, and by implication denied that they might die, were most likely to recover. Patients with the least denial ‐‐‐ 8 per cent of the sample—accounted for 50 per cent of the mortality in the unit. To conclude that an illness might be fatal, hence subject to withdrawal of treatment, can weaken the will to live. At one hospital in London devoted to the treatment of the terminally ill, an average of 10 per cent of all patients so diagnosed are regularly discharged—to live months, and even years, longer. But if a person is in pain, and hopelessly ill, how much suffering must he face before he is allowed to die, and who is to be the judge? If the family, which members? What if they disagree? What hidden death‐wishes might be buried in their decision? If no family is available, what are the risks of death by committee? Age itself might be the determinant. When a number of physicians in Great Britain were asked to propose a point beyond which a dying person should not be resuscitated, suggestions varied from 65 to 80 years! The lower age was frequently cited because that is presumably the last year of productivity. But an attitude which encourages those over 65 to bow out gracefully and a little sooner than they might ordinarily choose, becomes one more booby trap in the minefield of old age. Unproduc tive, often burdensome to others, they are presented with a “right” which may look more like a duty. Social critics of the Living Will think that it may operate as a subtle document of self‐rejection. Dorothea Jaeger and Leo W. Simmons, in their book, “The Aged Ill,” state that, because the elderly “see an image of themselves as not useful citizens, [they] are likely to go tacitly along with euthanasia programs.” ‘I know some doctors that I wouldn't want in charge of telling me the time of day, let alone the time to die.’ But if the 25,000 members of the Euthanasia Council are typical, by far the largest bloc of support for voluntary death comes from the middleaged. These people are apparently signing up for what they consider to be a “good death” for themselves when they get old. The indications are, however, that at least some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the Living Will change their minds when the moment of truth arrives. Mrs. Arthur E. Morgan, wife of the former head of the T.V.A., once wrote, in a letter that has been widely circulated by church groups and others, that “one should be allowed to drink the hemlock in some dignified and simple way.” Although she later became blind, largely deaf and senile, she herself did not reach for the hemlock, nor was it passed to her. A family conference called to discuss the matter decided against it, and Mrs. Morgan died in a nursing home at 94. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that people are less likely to want to die when they are old than when they were young and “useful.” In 1972, the Gannett newspaper chain assigned a reporter, John Dalmas, to interview residents of Rockland County, N.Y., on the subject of euthanasia. He found the most ardent supporters of death by consent to be those who had the least contact with the elderly and the ill. At a Jewish home for convalescents, residents, who ranged in age from 63 to 85, generally opposed voluntary death. “Talk to some young people,” a man in his sixties told Mr. Dalmas. “They'll be glad to talk about it. You're not going to get much interest here.” Mr. Dalmas did talk to young people and found that the most enthusiastic supporters of the right to die were teen‐agers. Thomas Bane, a chaplain at Grasslands Hospital in Westchester County, says that in his three years there, and in 10 years as a parish priest, no one has ever begged him to hasten death. “A woman in my parish had a stroke,” he reported, “and as far as people could tell she was completely comatose. They would talk in front of her as if she weren't there. I'd visit and hold her hand. Before she died, she partially recovered and told me she knew we were there. She appreciated what I had done. There was some kind of life experience that had meaning for her.” More than 20 million persons in the United States are 65 or over—between 10 and 11 per cent of the population; with a lowering of the birth rate in the next few decades, this proportion is expected to rise to 15 per cent. Because many of these people will be economically if not socially superfluous, death for the old may be viewed in terms of Malthusian pressures as well as merciful release. Although not pleading for euthanasia, Dr. Charles K. Hofling, a psychiatrist, thinks it “unlikely that the termination of individual human life . . . can be left indefinitely to natural causes' People will have to decide when to let natural causes take over.” With Medicare and Medicaid paying for a large part of terminal care, financial reasons alone may force a cut‐off point for the impecunious patient that does not reflect his true medical condition. It is. probably no coincidence that the Euthanasia Council's most numerous supporters are found in California, or that the most persistent efforts to legalize euthanasia take place in Florida. Both states have a disproportionate number of old people among their populations. “In my opinion,” Dr. Alvin I. Goldfarb of Mount Sinai Hospital told a Right to Die symposium sponsored by the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, “the [current] preoccupation with death is a sign of ultraconservatism and authoritarianism . . .” One danger of this preoccupation, he added, is that “controlling forces within the establishment may decide for the living that their lives are considered of little value, that they may be killed or allowed to die at government whim.” In Germany, in the 1930's, thousands of mental incompetents and “useless eaters” were put to death by psychiatrists acting quite independent of Hitler. No one in this country seriously proposes such an approach, yet voluntary death might be even more insidious—democracy's use of a civil liberty to encourage what it cannot do by flat. Many civil libertarians assert that one's mode of dying should be as privileged a part of one's life‐style as long hair clothes and sex. Psychiatrists who work with dying patients point out that a person brings to his death all the conflicts and frustrations, as well as the hopes and fulfillments, that have gone into his life. A “good” death, therefore, is not necessarily one that is free of pain but one that retains for the individual whatever options are left to him, including the struggle to stay alive. “I don't believe in people dying peacefully,” says the clinical‐psychotherapist, Lawrence LeShan, who works extensively with terminal patients. “I choose to aid the patient to fight for life.” Dr. LeShan calls this approach the “open encounter” and says that one's fear of death actually drops off when he struggles against dying. Those who would expedite the dying process almost always ignore the effect of such action on survivors. Math is a social event; it involves many people. Even under favorable circumstances, the loss of a close relative usually creates feelings of “survival” guilt. In cases of sudden accidental death and suicide, it has been shown that the effects of grief and guilt are even more shattering, often leading to serious physical illness and even death among the survivors. Dr. Kutscher of the Thanatology Foundation thinks this could also be one of the dangers of the Living Will. “The weakest link in the right to die argument,” he says, “is that it neglects the alternatives. If a person can be made comfortable right up to the end, he doesn't need to be put to death.” Why not, he suggests, form “life conferences” rather than death committees? Family, clergy, doctor, social worker and psychiatrist would be concerned with the patient on a daily basis, making certain that he enjoys both professional and human support in his passage from life. Emphasis would not be on ending treatment, but on strengthening the patient's morale, on making him feel wanted in this greatest and last of life's crises. Some physicians would go further. For several years, therapists at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center near Baltimore have used psychedelic drugs on dying patients to control the pain of some diseases and to lessen anxiety. Pioneered by the late Dr. Walter Pahnke, a Doctor of Divinity as well as an M.D., this approach seeks to give the dying patient a semimystical “peak” experience, or ecstasy—a symbolic death‐and‐rebirth as a preliminary to the real thing. Even when such a peak is not achieved—about two‐thirds of the 60 patients who volunteered for the initial project settled for less—the therapeutic results were considered favorable. Similar experiments at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kan., suggest that LSD does have value in alleviating the feeling of “doom and destruction” that hangs over the dying patient. The school's Dr. David V. Sheehan has reported that “patients on LSD were so strikingly unconcerned about death or any other anticipatory concern that death seemed unimportant . . . the imagery and esthetic stimulation of the drug seemed to create a new zest for experience. . .” More conservative practitioners question the value of a “psychedelic afterglow” or an “oceanic sensation” for the dying and doubt that death can or should be made into a “trip.” They argue that, just as it does with the healthy, drug‐induced euphoria violates the integrity of the self and excludes the possibility of genuine experience. With the terminally ill, what matters is not the number of days that are left but the quality of those days. Dr. LeShan, who notes that a terminal illness may last for a considerable period of time, urges his patients to do what they have always wanted to, within the limits of their situation. One man, given three months to live, decided to become a sculptor, made two trips to Italy, created several statues and lived not three months but two years—“the most important in his life,” in LeShan's words. “I tell my patients, Your life is worth fighting for. Sell it at the highest price you can get.” In one instance, this advice had unexpected results. Encouraged to do his own thing, a terminal patient decided to leave his wife while he was still well enough to do so. More typical is the 68‐year‐old woman dying of cancer who decided to write a history of ballet. Filling her hospital room with books, playbills and newspaper clippings, she worked until the very end. The book was not completed but her life was,” LeShan says. “She died in vital contact with what she was doing.” The future of the right‐todie movement, however, may well lie with the civil libertarians rather than the medical profession. The current proliferation of “death and dying” courses in colleges, and even high schools; a fashionable insistence on dying at home; an effort to rationalize what is essentially an opaque and inexplicable experience; the effort by organized religion to reclaim the dying souls that have been lost to organized medicine; the anti‐technology of present‐day liberalism—all these have tipped the balance in favor of death by consent, and all in the name of a human right. The Euthanasia Council's membership has grown five‐fold in the last six years. The courts are increasingly sympathetic to the wishes of the dying patient, and the Living Will is beginning to be honored by some physicians. “Great,” said one doctor in a Westchester public hospital when he first heard of it. “This makes things easier for all of us.” Skeptics are not so sure. The real right of the dying, they say—the human right—is to be treated as one of the living, with respect, good care, compassion and a measure of hope. Such an approach disturbs few consciences, minimizes risk and imposes no undue responsibility on society for deciding when people have lived long enough. The vast majority of us, even when old and ill, are in no hurry to die. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Democratic Party Leaders Are Still Aiming for a Balanced Ticket,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/24/archives/democratic-party-leaders-are-stillaiming-for-a-balanced-ticket.html,"Democratic party leaders and top aides of Howard J. Samuels, the leading contender for the gubernatorial nomination, are still trying to thin out the ranks of Democratic primary contestants, with the ultimate aim of coming out of the primary with a balanced ticket. New York Political Notes The prime targets of the pressure to step aside are State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, the contender for Lieutenant Governor and the only woman seeking a major‐party state nomination; Allard K. Lowenstein, the Senate hopeful, and Supreme Court Justice Bertram Harnett of Nassau, who is seeking a Court of Appeals nomination. They have until Saturday to withdraw, although all are insisting that they are in the race to stay. The party leaders want Senator Krupsak to withdraw because they prefer Mario M. Cuomo, the Queens lawyer, for the designation and fear that, in a three‐way primary for Lieutenant Governor, either Senator Krupsak or Assemblyman Antonio G. Olivieri would win. Both are considered too liberal—both supported abortion legislation, for example—for the Italian‐American Catholics whom they are supposed to attract to the ticket. As for Mr. Lowenstein, party leaders, in what they admit is a long shot, would like him to run for the House, possibly in his home District, the 14th District in Brooklyn. Otherwise, they fear that in a three‐way race for the Senate nomination with Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse and Ramsey Clark, the former United States Attorney General, either Mr. Clark or Mr. Lowenstein would win. Mr. Lowenstein, who is Jewish, would further unbalance the ticket, while Mr. Clark is perceived by party leaders as so liberal and even radical that he might sink the entire Democratic state ticket if he were on it. As for Justice Harnett, party leaders want him out because he, too, is Jewish and because they want to insure that the only black on the state's highest court, Judge Harold A. Stevens of the Court of Appeals, is nominated. At the moment, Judges Harnett and Stevens and Appellate Division Justice Lawrence H. Cooke of Monticello are vying for only two nominations. • Meanwhile, warning that “people choose a candidate they can relate to,” the Queens Democratic leader, Matthew J. Troy Jr. declared in a television‐interview program yesterday that to go into the fall election with a top state “slate that is primarily Jewish would be a disaster.” Appearing on WCBS‐TV's “Newsmakers,” Mr. Troy, chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, observed that the “balance” on the Republican statewide slate “is pretty strong,” and he urged that Democratic voters in the September primary support the “balanced” ticket that was selected at the party's recent convention. “If you lock nut the Polish, the Irish, the blacks or Italians on a ticket, they might go somewhere else,” he warned. • Speaking of the Democratic state ticket, Mr. Samuels's first preferences as running mates were Westchester County Executive Alfred DelBello for Lieutenant Governor, Representative Ogden R. Reid, also of Westchester, for the Senate, and Senator Krupsak of Canajoharie for Attorney General. However. all the preferences were sidetracked in the maneuverings, back‐stabbings and other goings‐on during the exhausting all‐night session with party and labor leaders after Mr. Samuels had won the state committee designation. Representative Hugh L. Carey, who got enough votes to qualify for another shot at Mr. Samuels in the primary, stayed clear of the Machiavellian machinations. He had enough problems with his own candidacy and had assured party leaders that he would not bargain over running mates for himself. • For the second year in a row, the founders and leaders of the Conservative party are confronted with a major insurrection in their own ranks. Last year, J. Daniel Mahoney and Kieran O'Doherty — who are brothers‐in‐law as well as state chairman and a vice chairman, respectively, of the Conservative party —were rebuffed by New York City Conservative leaders, who endorsed Democratic Representative Mario Biaggi for Mayor despite the opposition of the party founders. This year, the two leaders would suffer a serious and possibly fatal setback if they were unable to put across the Conservative endorsement of Governor Wilson, who had maintained his ties with the Conservatives even during the years when then GOV. Nelson A. Rockfeller was lambasting them. Mr. Wilson won the support of a majority of the Conservative state committee, but T. David Bullard, an upstate fruit farmer, won about 40 per cent of the vote and an automatic place on the primary ballot, unless he declines by Saturday. If he does remain on the ballot, many Republican leaders believe that Governor Wilson would decline the Conservative state committee designation rather than get into a primary fight in which he would have to demonstrate how conservative he is—just before the general election when he would be trying to demonstrate that he was not that conservative. Henry Paolucci, a Con servative vice chairman and a professor at St. John's University, is Mr. Bullard's running mate for Lieutenant Governor. Last year, the professor led the charge for Mr. Biaggi. All of which makes some Conservatives suspect that Professor Paolucci would like to be the party leader. • Speaking of the Conservatives, the party's candidate for the United States Senate, Mrs. Barbara A. Keating of Mamaroneck, a 35‐year‐old war widow and mother of five, came up with one of the better one‐liners of the various state‐committee meetings when she declared that “it is time for Jacob K. Javits to give up his seat to a lady.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Catholic Study Sees Influence on Church Of Secular Society,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/27/archives/catholic-study-sees-influence-on-church-of-secular-society.html,"WASHINGTON, June 26 (UPI)—Tolerance for such secular ideas as abortion and other methods of birth control that are disapproved of has taken the place of church teaching for a significantly large number of American Roman Catholics, according to a new study by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. “At the very least,” the study said, “many would say that for a large number of Catholics, the influence of secular society—and all that implies, for good as well as ill—counts more heavily than the influence of the Church,” But the study, prepared for American bishops in preparation for the world‐wide synod of bishops this fall at the Vatican, also stressed that the church in the United States was not collapsing. The paper was presented as an overview of trends and did not include statistics. “American Catholicism is changing, not collapsing, and while a period of change is not a time for complacency, neither is it a time for gloom,” the study said. The study said that the emerging question for the Catholic community in the United States is whether that community will continue to derive its fundamental beliefs from Catholic Christianity “or whether its beliefs and attitudes will be drawn more and: more from the secularistic, humanistic value system of the society around it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDY EXAMINES TEEN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/28/archives/study-examines-teen-pregnancy-three-out-of-10-who-have-intercourse.html,"Nearly three out of ten teen‐age American girls who have premarital intercourse become pregnant, with 35 per cent of the pregnant girls marrying before their babies are born, according to a continuing analysis of a nationwide study of adolescent sexuality. All told, according to the study, less than 10 per cent of girls 15 to 19 years old had experienced a pregnancy at the time the survey was made in 1971. The study, conducted among a random sample of 4,611 girls, represents the first attempt to quantify on a national basis phenomenon that had long aroused speculation and controversy. Since funds were not awarded for a follow‐up study, however, no trends can be discerned and the effects of modified abortion laws and greater contraceptive availability can only be guessed. The analysis, made by Melvin Zeinik and John F. Kantner, both professors of population dynamics at Johns Hopkins University, disclosed that by 1971 an estimated total of 1.1 million teen‐age girls had experienced a first pregnancy, with three‐fourths of them having conceived prior to marriage. Although two‐thirds of all premarital first pregnancies were unintended, only about 14 per cent of those who got pregnant had used any form of contraception, the survey showed. A previous analysis by the Johns Hopkins sociologists had shown that contraception was used by less than half of the 2.4 million unmarried adolescent girls who have had sexual intercourse. Nearly half of all unmarried women have had sexual intercourse by the time they are 19 years old, another analysis showed. Of the births to teen‐age girls that result from first pregnancies, 45 per cent are illegitimate, and 6 in 10 of the legitimate births among girls in this age group had been conceived before marriage, the new analysis indicates. “To marry and then to conceive is the exception among teen‐agers,” the authors wrote in the current issue of a Family Planning Perspectives, a publication of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Other studies have indicated that one‐third of brides aged 18 or younger are pregnant at the time they take their marriage vows. At the same time, teen‐agers account for nearly half of the nation's total number of illegitimate births. At the time or the study in 1971, abortion was a relatively uncommon way of dealing with a teen‐age pregnancy, according to the survey findings. All told, about one‐fifth of the pregnancies were terminated by induced abortion. Family planning experts believe that the change in abortion laws would have increased this proportion substantially by now. In 1971, abortion was more common among white teen‐agers than among blacks, as was legitimating the pregnancy by marriage. About two‐thirds of all premarital first pregnancies to black teen‐agers resulted in illegitimate births, whereas only one‐fifth of premarital first pregnancies to whites have such an outcome, the survey showed. White teen‐age girls were also much more likely than blacks to give their babies up for adoption, the authors found. While soaring illegitimacy rates among teen‐agers were reportedly temporarily reversed after 1970, presumably because of increased availability of abortion, a new California study also published in Family Planning Perspectives indicates that illegitimacy is rising again among white teen‐agers, thdugh black teen‐age illegitimacy rates continue to decline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Archbishop Has Liberal Activist Credentials,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/28/archives/new-archbishop-has-liberalactivist-credentials.html,"Newark's, new Archbishop is liberal activist who is backing the farmworkers' boycott of grapes and lettuce, who opposed the war in Vietnam and who developed strong ties to black Catholics years before the urban ministry became fashionable. In short, the Most Rev. Peter Leo Gerety is widely regarded as almost ideal for the job he assumes at 4 P.M. today, when he is installed in Sacred Cathedral as the leader of the 1.6 million Roman Catholics in the Archdiocese of Newark. The sixth largest archdiocese in the country, Newark is second to none in the problems of urban blight, delicate citysuburban relationships, weakening finances and declining church membership. In its 540 square miles, the archdiocese encompasses Hudson, Essex, Union and Bergen Counties and includes some of the nation's poorest inner‐city blacks and Puerto Ricans as well as relatively affluent and conservative suburban whites. Will Live in Newark Bishop Gerety has made it clear that he will not make major changes overnight, but his first decision was symbolic, Unlike his predecessors, who have lived in a mansion in the fashionable Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, the new Archbishop will live in the rectory of sacred Heart Cathedral, in inner‐city Newark. He comes to Newark from Portland, Me., where for the last last eight years he ministered to a diocese of 270,000 Catholics, including 180,000 Frenchspeaking parishioners of Canadian descent. The 61‐year‐old bishop spent 23 years before that in New Haven, near his native Shelton, Conn. From 1956 to 1966 he was pastor of the predominantly black parish of St. Martin de Porres. His reputation there was that of a forward‐looking, socially conscious churchman. Several years ago, he was named chairman of the American Bishops Liaison Committee with the National Office of Black Catholics. “Renewal and change don't come by pushing a button,” he said in a recent interview. “We are in a period of change and people have to adapt to new ways of prayer and new approaches to the sacramental life. The church must work for the fellow in the suburbs as well as for the parishioners in the city and rural areas.” The number of Catholics in the Newark Archdiocese, which has a population of nearly three million, has been dwindling rather rapidly. The Official Catholic Directory put the number at 1,725,128 in 1973. This year there are 1,520,163. After he was appointed Co succeed Archbishop Thomas A. Boland, who is retiring at the age of 78 after 21 years, Bishop Gerety named a 15‐member committee to assess the financial situation of the Archdiocese. This was seen as a significant step, since the archdiocese has never before made public a full report of its finances. Bishop Gerety recently described himself as “delighted” with the changes taking place within the church, Last year, he was one of 14 New England Bishops to sign a statement backing the boycott of nonunion lettuce. Earlier, the had called on Maine food retailers to stop selling nonunion grapes, and he also defended the rights of Conscientious objectors who refused service in Vietnam. He led Catholic opposition, ultimately unsuccessful, to a bill in Maine legalizing abortions in certain circumstances.

House Rejects Plan to Prohibit Federal Funds in Abortion Work,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/29/archives/house-rejects-plan-to-prohibit-federal-funds-in-abortion-work.html,"WASHINGTON, June 28 (AP) —The House has turned back an attempt to prohibit use of any Federal funds directly or indirectly for abortions or abortion research. It voted 247 to 123 last night against an amendment by Representative Angelo D. Roncallo, Republican of NassauSuffolk, to a $33.2‐billion appropriation bill for the DePartment of Labor and of Health, Education and Welfare for the 1975 fiscal year, starting Monday. The one‐all bill was approved by a 349‐to‐43 vote and sent to the Senate. Of the total, $29.5‐billion would go to H.E.W., $3.4‐billion to Labor and $260‐million to nine related agencies and boards. Mr. Roncallo's amendment sparked a House debate on abortion. Representative Tim Lee Carter, Republican of Kentucky who is a physician, said that the amendment would have banned Federal aid for abortions even in cases of rape incest or where the pregnancy endangered the life of the mother. Representative Stewart B. McKinney, Republican of Cannecticut, said that abortion was an individual matter and that Congress had no business dealing with it. Before passing the over‐all bill, the House voted 231 to 17.1 to add $300‐million for 40,000 new public service jobs to ease unemployment. The amended section now provides $970‐million for 144,000 jobs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/29/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"The Major Events of the Day International President Nixon and the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, moved toward an agreement that would reduce the number of antimissile defense systems permitted under the treaty they signed two years ago. Authoritative sources said that negotiations at the Kremlin had focused on limiting each nation to a single antimissile complex instead of the two now allowed. The 1972 agreement permitted the United States, and the Soviet Union to maintain two complexes with up to 100 launches each, one to, protect the capital region, and the other to guard offensive strategic missiles. [1:8.] High Administration officials have disclosed that President Nixon went to Moscow with his, two top advisers on national security, Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James, R. Schlesinger, still in disagreement over what would constitute an acceptable accord now to limit strategic nuclear weapons. Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Schlesinger were described as having the kind of fundamental differences where neither can be shown to be right or wrong. One Administration official said that “It is a matter of judgment and the President has a clear choice.” [1:7.] The word “personal” was dropped, from the official Soviet translation of a speech by President Nixon in Moscow in which he said that the “personal relationship” between him and Mr. Brezhnev would be the basis for continued Soviet‐American détente. The deletion caused a controversy and it was interpreted by some in Moscow as indicating that the Soviet Government did not want to tie relations with the United States to a President involved in impeachment proceedings. [10:1–2.] The State Department said it had been. informed that the eight Palestinian guerrillas who were convicted of killing two senior American diplomats add a Belgian in the Sudan last year were now in prison in Egypt. The department had denounced the virtual release of the eight men after commutation of their life sentences by the Sudanese Government on Monday. [1:5.6.] In Portuguese Guinea, soldiers of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde and troops of the Portuguese Army gingerly confronted each other, but the tension dissolved in smiles‐and handshakes. It was another of the fraternization meetings that have become daily occurences between the two armies. [1:6–7.] National Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr. of the House Judiciary Committee was accused of bias by some Republicans, and a White House spokesman called for his discharge as head of the impeachment inquiry. A partisan furor followed an article in The Los Angeles Times that quoted Mr. Rodino as saying that all 21 Democrats on his committee, were prepared to vote for President Nixon's impeachment. The chairman went to the House floor and denied and denounced the story and said there was, no chance that he would resign. [1:3.] John D. Ehrlichman's lawyers, offering a new defense in the White House “plumbers” case, accused David R. Young Jr., one of the co‐conspirators in the Watergate prosecutor's case, and who is expected to be a key prosecution witness, of falsifying statements and documents against Mr. Ehrlichman “in order to save his own neck.” [1:4.] The three year‐old case of William Farr, a newspaper reporter, who has been held in Los Angeles for contempt of court took another turn with the indictment of the chief prosecutor and a defense lawyer in the 1970 Charles Manson murder trial on three counts each of perjury. Vincent T. Buglosi, the prosecutor, and Daye Shinn, a defense attorney, were accused of perjuring themselves in denying they were the sources of an article by Mr. Farr about the Manson trial in The Los Angeles Herald Examiner. [1:4.5.] Metropolitan The chancellor of the State Board of Regents, under pressure from members who oppose busing, announced that the board would review its 14‐year‐old policy of firm support of busing as an integration tool in the state's public schools. This was a victory for the growing number of Regents who have expressed doubts about the policy of “forced” busing. The forthcoming review was condemned by Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the board's only black member, who perceived that the decision to review the policy could be a prelude to weakening it. He said the review proposal was “the most serious crisis of my eight years on the board.” [1:1–2,] The Other News International Bhutto apologizes to Bangladesh for '71 events.

DALKON SHIELD SALE HALTED BY COMPANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/29/archives/dalkon-shield-sale-halted-by-company.html,"RICHMOND, June 28 (UPI)—The A. H. Robins Company announced today it was suspending distribution and sale of its Dalkon Shield intra‐uterine contraceptive device pending a safety study by the Food and Drug Administration. A number of women who became pregnant while wearing the device have died from blood poisoning resulting from spontaneous septic abortions. The company has maintained that there is no evidence that the shield was the cause of the deaths. Robins has also advised the F.D.A. that some women who became pregnant while apparently using the Dalkon shield had suffered septic spontaneous abortions. More than 2 million of the devices have been distributed in the United States but the company has said there is no way of knowing how many are in use. The company disclosed the information last month and notified more than 120,000. In its letter to doctors, the company recommended that women who became pregnant while wearing a Dalkon shield should have the device removed or consider having an induced abortion.

French Assembly Allows Wide Contraceptive Sales,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/29/archives/french-assembly-allows-wide-contraceptive-sales-special-severity.html,"PARIS, June 28—The French Assembly gave overwhelming endorsement today to a law not only authorizing general distribution of contraceptives but also providing that the cost be borne by the social security system. There was only one vote against the bill, which was sponsored by the Government. It was a dramatic reversal of attitudes in a country that had one of the world's most restrictive set of laws on contraception and abortion. Passage of the law by near unanimity came as such a surprise that it was the day's biggest news in the major Paris newspapers. It was hailed by many commentators as a sign that the new Government of President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is going to be much more liberal than anyone expected. Many reasons were given for what seemed a sudden, drastic shift in social judgments. The one most widely advanced was that a highly vocal, militant campaign for liberalized abortion in the last two years had turned the traditionalists completely around, so that they were now prepared to accept free birth control as the lesser evil. Special Severity The special severity of previous French law in this area dates mainly to 1920. It probably had more to do with the slaughter of young men in World War I and fear of a steady population decline than it did with religious dictates. Roman Catholic France has always listened to the church and republican France has always resisted its demands. And by and large, with a narrow band of exceptions, the two have pretty much represented the same Frenchmen according to pressures of the moment. The new law replaces one passed with difficulty in 1967, permitting the distribution of contraceptives only on medical orders and requiring personal prescriptions with a time limit. Medical experts have charged that even that modest legalization of birth control was systematically sabotaged by the authorities. Estimates of the number of French women currently using the contraceptive pill vary from 6 to 10 per cent, compared with 46 per cent in Britain. The new law also wipes out the requirement that girls tinder 18 have written permission from their parents, as well as from a doctor, to obtain contraception. Proponents of the measure argued that it was exactly among the very young girls that the lack of birth control produced the greatest number of social tragedies and illegal abortions. Health Minister Simone Veil, who presented the Government's bill to the Assembly, promised a vigorous public information campaign to spread word that birth control was now a matter of “common right,” freely available to all without question. The social security system will also establish clinics to provide free medical examinations and counseling. Despite the thesis that traditionalists acepted birth control in an effort to head off legal abortion, the victory of those who argued that family planning is a human right was expected to lead to renewed efforts to change the abortion law. Current Law The current law permits therapeutic abortions only when the life of the mother is found to be in danger by two doctors in addition to the mother's own doctor. Between 1966 and 1970, 132 legal abortions were performed in the Paris area. Nobody knows the exact number of illegal abortions performed in France each year, but estimates run from 300,000 to 800,000, with a population of 10 million women of childbearing age. Mortality rates are high: 1 to 3 per cent of the women involved. The courts have enforced the law with unpredictability, sometimes imposing heavy fines and long prison sentences on the women as well as the abortionists. Famous Case For decades, the subject was taboo. But a case in the fall of 1972 suddenly drew wide public attention and became a focal point for advocates of reform. A 16‐year‐old girl who refused to bear her child was tried along with her mother for violating the law. After much public debate, the judge acquitted her. Last year, a somewhat reluctant Government introduced a bill to liberalize the abortion law, but abandoned it without formal debate when it ran into quiet opposition from what the politicians evidently considered the powers that be on moral and social issues. That retreat, considered pusillanimous by reformers, became an issue that was frequently brought up against the Gaullists during last May's presidential election campaign, although Mr. Giscard d'Estaing himself did not take a stand on the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Photography,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/30/archives/a-feminists-viewpoint-photography.html,"ONE of many ideas which underwent modification to the point of metamorphosis during Susan Sontag's recent tripartite skirmish with photography in the New York Review of Books was her startling announcement that, “Strictly speaking, it is doubtful that a photograph can help us to understand anything.” Sontag's reconsideration of this stance was implicit in her subsequent evaluations of the politics and ethics of various modes of photographic image‐making. “All possibility of understanding,” as she pointed out, “is rooted in the ability to say no,” and once she began saying no to numerous bodies of photographic work some stringent revision became necessary. Had Sontag not drastically altered that position, a book such as Abigail Heyman's “Growing Up Female: a personal photojournal” (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, $11.95 hardbound) would have been an easy and effective counter‐argument. “Growing Up Female” is a coherent essay composed of precise, articulate images. It is accompanied by a text which adds a specifically autobiographical undercurrent; its presentation in hand‐lettered farm personalizes the words. But, having seen a large selection of these images before their publication in book form, I can attest that the photographs' communicative effectiveness is independent of the writing. These images embody ideas, and the best way to approach them is perhaps to examine some of those ideas and agree or disagree with the understandings they convey. * Heyman is a self‐professed “feminist” who says of herself, “I looked at people and events long before I owned a camera, more as a silent observer than a participant, sensing this was a woman's place, It is no longer my place as a woman, but it remains my style as a photographer.” That last unresolved dichotomy notwithstanding, both Heyman's feminism and her reserve can be clearly discerned in her photographs. Her feminism pervades the intensely subjective world she creates, a world in which men generally treat women badly—at best as possessions, at worst as meat—but in which women never mistreat each other or men. Her “silent observer” posture is apparent from the infrequency with which she comes physically close to her subjects or engages with them transactionally. As a rule, she maintains social distance between herself and those she photo. graphs. (My use of the term “social distance” is intended proxemically, to indicate range from four to twelve feet, not socio‐economically.) The book's first two images are one of a dressed‐alike mother and daughter and another of a young bridesmaid nervously gnawing the strap of her purse. They are about childhood experiences of tradition, role, and ritual in relation to gender. The closing image is of a woman seated on the low wall against which her bike is propped, looking out to sea; it metaphorizes individuation and search. The images in between are recognitions along the path which Heyman sees as linking them. The eighth image in the book, for example, is a head and shoulders portrait of a young girl. Apparently she is a Native American, for she wears a beaded headpiece and hair decorations and several necklaces. This is ceremonial jewelry, intended to idealize and beautify her. The metal decorations on her teeth seem part and parcel of this outfit; it takes a moment to realize that those metal decorations are orthodontic braces, our own primitive culture's ritual artifacts for making maidens attractive. Further on there is a photograph of a man and woman sitting facing each other but yards apart on a porch. Some profound alienation is implicit, some deep inability to make contact. Yet in fact there is not a shred of evidence to indicate that these people even know each other. The presumption of meaning is contextually derived, not implicit. The same holds true for a beach image which shows two women, fully dressed except for their shoes, standing at the water's edge while five men disport themselves in the water. (Perhaps it's my own naivete, but I know of no cultural dictum which prohibits women from swimming in the ocean.) One of the book's grimmer images—autobiographical, as the camera's viewpoint makes clear—shows the featureless, impersonal form of a gauze‐masked doctor standing behind the V of a woman's spread legs. With a pair of forceps he holds something unidentifiable; traces of liquid glisten on her upper thighs. The caption reads, “Nothing ever made me feel more like a sex object than going through an abortion alone.” This does not quite jibe with statements elsewhere in the book about taking full responsibility for one's body and one's actions, and seems to cast the physician as the villain in the image, which makes little sense even though he is male. The sexism rampant in the medical profession is symbolized lucidly in a later photograph showing four small boys and two girls dressed in what appear to be official hospital uniforms: the boys are equipped as doctors, while the girls are garbed as nurses. Heyman's point there is concisely made and inarguable. But would the experience of the abortion have been significantly improved had the operating physician been a featureless, impersonal, gauze‐masked woinstead? * Another image with which I find myself quarrelling shows a man eating alone at a table in the background while a woman in the foreground holds and plays with three young children. The setting is a living room. The theme, once again, is alienation. Assuming, as Heyman intends us to, that these people are a nuclear family, the picture directs our sympathies towards the mother and her children. It is they who are placed in the foreground, relating to each other, touching and holding; it is the father (who might in truth be the uncle, or the brother‐in‐law) who sits isolated and remote in the background, relating to no one, touching and holding no his face. By its structure, this image is intended to convey that specific understanding, and does so effectively. The understanding, however, is shallow and unsatisfying, for it includes no channel of sympathy for a man who goes out and does whatever work his society requires of him in order to provide his family with the wall‐to‐wall carpeting on which they romp, whose job apparently brings him home past normal dinner time, and who is not thereupon surrounded by his wife and children but excluded from the circle of their warmth and left to eat by himself like a servant. That is an equally, viable interpretation of the situation, though certainly not one to which Heyman's image directs the viewer. There is much in this book that is oversimplified, polemical, propagandistic. There is also much that is intelligent, illuminating and pertinent. Heyman is a highly accomplished photographer, even if the clarity of the thinking does not always match the clarity of the image‐making. Just how personal Heyman's vision is can be gauged by the contrast between her book and “Imogen! Imogen Cunningham: Photographs 1910.1973” (University of Washington Press, $15 hardbound, $7.95 paper). This quirky, provocative retrospective monograph, containing “rediscovered” images by someone who also grew up female, chronicles more than six decades of professional and creative activity by a photographer who scandalized Seattle with a series of nude studies of her husband back in 1915 and hasn't stopped making waves—or images—since, In addition to a private life involving family and children, Cunningham has made important contributions in the areas of portraiture and still life (among others) and today, in her nineties, continues to teach, make images, exhibit and publish. That, apparently, is what she sensed was a woman's place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Decisions, decisions, decisions",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/30/archives/decisionsdecisions-decisions-parent-and-child-choosing-the-sex-of-a.html,"A longing to be able to predict and, best of all, select the sex of offspring has given rise since ancient times to a rich variety of folklore prescriptions. They range from the Hebrew Talmud suggestion that placing the marriage bed in a north‐south direction favors the conception of boys and the advice of the Greek philosopher Parmenides in the fifth century B.C. that wives wishing boys should lie on their right side after intercourse to tae practice, still current among husbands in Germany's Spessart mountains, of taking an ax along to bed to produce male progeny and leaving it in the woodshed when they wish girls. Today we seem to be nearing the point where science may well fulfill the age‐old longing. Already, choice of sex is a possibility through amniocentesis, a procedure in which a needle is inserted in the mother's abdomen and amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is sampled to determine genetic make‐up. This technique offers parents a kind of veto power—through abortion—when the fetus is found to be afflicted with a genetically caused illness, and there are indications that it has also been used (abused, some physicians say) when the sex of the fetus is the determining factor. Going beyond this, a few months ago investigators in a Berlin laboratory reported development of a technique designed specifically to isolate male‐producing human sperm and, almost simultaneously, in a New York laboratory researchers experimenting with mice developed a method of increasing the yield of females. Both techniques need refinement; their application to human reproduction will not come tomorrow. But it is hardly doubted any more that sex selection is scientifically possible, and serious questions are being raised about its potentially wide‐ranging social, psychological and political effects. Some observers are even asking whether the whole business should be allowed to Lawrence Garton, who specializes in medical subjects, is author of “The Silent Disease: Hypertension.” His newest book, “Don't Give Up on an Aging Parent,” is scheduled for publication next fall. For example, Dr. Hans Zeisel, professor of law and sociology at the University of Chicago, says: “I have always thought that this is the type of discovery that should not be made. The mere possibility of destroying this natural balance carefully developed over millions of evolutionary years is dangerous.” Foreseeing an increase in male births over female, Dr. Zeisel finds it “not difficult to foresee some of the consequences: more homosexuality, more adultery, more rape, more crime in general (men commit 90 per cent of it)— altogether a profound conflict between individual whims and the interests of a healthy society. One need not be a religious person to be in awe of such natural constants, and to fear the wrath of the gods if they are tampered with.” Others see in sex selection some risk of the development of a “frontier” kind of society. tion may be concerned that sex selection could lead to sex discrimination. Modern research in sex‐selection has long sought to use, in one way or another, the known or supposed differences between sperm carrying the X chromosome for female and those carrying the Y for male offspring.* In the early nineteen‐thirties a German physician, Unterberger, caused a considerable flurry when he reported that in treating women for sterility he had noticed a high correlation between the use of alkaline douches and male offspring. Of 54 patients so treated, 53 succeeded in having babies, all male.. It appeared that an alkaline douche after intercourse selected against X sperm. Other scientists, however, were unable to duplicate the results and the interest in the method faded. *An ovum always carries an X chro. mosome; a sperm may carry either an X or a Y. Depending upon which sperm does the fertilizing, the fetus develops as a girl (XX) or boy (XY). One method of sex selection that is practiced today was proposed in the nineteensixties by Dr. Landrum B. Shettles of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Because Y sperm swim somewhat faster than X, timing intercourse with ovulation could be a major element in determining sex, Dr. Shettles suggested. If coitus occurs shortly after ovulation, when the egg is still high in the Fallopian tube, there should be a greater chance that fertilization will be by a Y sperm. That timing of coitus has an influence in predetermining sex has been confirmed recently by a Polish physician, Dr. Franciszek Benendo of the County Hospital in Plonsk, who, after studies with 322 couples, found that if ovulation occurs before or within a day after intercourse, the ovum is more likely to be fertilized by a Y sperm; if it occurs three or more days following intercourse the conception of female is favored. The newest research takes a different tack—in fact, two different tacks. In Germany, investigators are using differences between male‐carrying and female‐carrying sperm to separate out mechanically the male‐carrying for use in fertilization; in New York, the effort is to use the body's immunological defenses against infectious agents and foreign bodies to knock out one type of sperm or the other (thus far, the work has been limited to eliminating the male). By Lawrence Galton The efforts to separate X from Y sperm so one or the other could be implanted artificially with assured results go back many years. Since the Y chromosome is known to be smaller than the X, Y‐carrying sperm should be smaller and thus lighter and hence it should be possible to separate them from the X‐carrying by centrifugation. But the centrifugal whirling had to be so forceful that many sperm were damaged. Then, in 1972, Dr. A. M. Roberts at Guy's Hospital Medical School, London, removed all sperm from a tube of seminal fluid, poured them back in again and found that Y sperm moved down through the fluid more rapidly than the X. Building on Roberts's work, a German team—R. J. Ericsson; C. N. Langevin and M. Nishino of Schering A.G., a Berlin pharmaceutical firm —devised a way of culling Y sperm from X. They placed sperm separated from seminal fluid in an albumin‐containing solution dense enough to offer some resistance to swimming (which sperm do by lashing their long tails). After an hour, the sperm which had penetrated into the solution were removed and stained with a dye that is capable of making Y‐bearers show up as bright dots under a fluorescence microscope. Sure enough, a preponderance of the penetrating sperm were Y‐bearers. By putting this sperm population through the solution‐swimming process several times, the Schering workers ended up with a population in which Y sperm comprised 85 per cent of the Are human sperm after such processing capable of normal fertilization? As yet there is no answer; trial human fertilization Isn't entered into lightly. But rabbit sperm, so treated, have been found fully fertile. Reporting in Nature, the science journal, the Berlin researchers stress both the simplicity of the procedure “and practicality of application to humans and perhaps other mammals.” So far, the ability to cull X sperm to favor female offspring has eluded them; the problem is that what is left after Y sperm are separated out is not a collection of X's alone but rather a mix of normal plus abnormal, nonmoving sperm of both X and Y types. In New York, the entirely different immunological approach has been taken by Dr. Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan‐Kettering Cancer Institute and Dr. Dorothea Bennett of Cornell Medical College who got Into sex selection research tangentially in connection with their basic research on cells. How, they wanted to know, do individual cells fit themselves into the body's society of cells? How do they recognize where they belong? (It is failure of such recognition that occurs in cancer.) The cell surface is the structure through which cells interact with each other and the environment. The surface can be likened to a wall composed of many bricks. Some surface components are common to all cells; some are unique to specific cells, differentiating them from all others. It is these differences in surface components which cause a transplanted organ to be immunologically rejected. It has been recognized as foreign because of certain antigens—tiny protein markers—on the surfaces of its cells. These stimulate the recipient's body to produce antibodies that lock onto the antigens and inactivate the cells of the Drs. Boyse and Bennett became interested in an antigen known as H‐Y male. Female mice, rejecting, grafts from males, produce an antibody to H‐Y antigen. This antigen is present on most if not all cells of male mice, including the sperm. However, it apparently is not evenly distributed among the sperm, which led to the question: When the H‐Y antigen is present in a sperm cell, does this indicate the presence of the Y chromosome? In other words, is this a male‐producing sperm cell? To test this, Drs. Boyse and Bennett and their co‐workers collected from female mice blood with a high assay of H‐Y antibody. They then suspended in this blood mouse sperm that were to be used for insemination. Forty‐five minutes later, the insemination process was undertaken. The natural sex ratio among mice is 53.4 per cent males to 46.6 per cent females. But in this experiment the progeny of mice inseminated with the treated sperm showed a different ratio‐45.4 per cent for males, 54.6 per cent for females, an 8 per cent reduction in males. An appreciable number of the Y‐bearing sperm had apparently been knocked out by the H‐Y antibody, thus favoring female offspring. Although an 8 per cent reduction in males may not seem a major change, it is enough to be considered of potential importance in breeding livestock. As yet it hardly represents the ultimate change to be expected of the technique—for livestock or possibly for humans. Says Dr. Boyse: “My personal belief is that because of the technical inadequacies in work which was really just a first go; the figure is very much less than what could be expected when the tools are In fact, he and Dr. Bennett have already hit upon promising refinements. Dr. Boyse sees a definite possibility for varying the technique so as to select in favor of either male or female offspring. He also envisions combining the antibody‐antigen, or immunologic, method with the Schering albuminsolution technique, using the latter to make a first separation of X and Y sperm and then the immunologic for nearly 100 per cent separation. It seems highly likely that as research intensifies, it will lead to even simpler techniques which will avoid need for artificial insemination. But is all this really desirable? To be sure, there are notable “pluses” for sex choice. It could help reduce the incidence of sex‐linked genetic diseases—hemophilia and Dtk chenne muscular dystrophy, for example, two genetic conditions “carried” by females that usually afflict only males. Parental desires, of course, would be gratified—and the gratification could contribute significantly to population control. “It would be an error to dismiss parental desires as trivial,” says Peter Steinfels, an associate of the five‐year‐old Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences in Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N. Y., which is dedicated to examining the “ethical, legal and social implications of advances in the life sciences.” The desire for boy or girl may be a matter of simple preference (“a girl would be fun this time; we've had boys”), Mr. Steinfels concedes, but it also can be a matter of economic or political importance (to carry on a family enterprise or be the next Shah of Iran), of psychological importance (to maintain a family name or compensate for a parent's inability to identify with children of one sex or the other), of religious significance (Judaism has put a high value on having a son to say Kaddish for the deceased father). So important are male offspring considered in a country like India, for example, that a sex‐control method able to assure at least one per family might well lead to fecundity restraint not otherwise obtainable. Here in the United States, sociologist Sanford Winston in 1932 studied 55 college students and recorded anonymously their desire for children. All told, they wanted 86 boys and 52 girls, a 65 per cent greater demand for sons than for daughters. Other studies in 1951 and 1960 found a similar preference. Second only to preference for boys, studies indicate, is a parental wish to have at least one of each sex in completed families, adding to the likelihood, investigators believe, that sex predetermination would result in smaller But how much would the normal sex ratio be upsetand with what consequences? Once sex control is available, the actual preference for boys is likely to be larger than studies have suggested, according to Dr. Amitai Etzioni, director of the Center for Policy Research, New York, and professor of sociology at Columbia University. “Attitudes,” he declares, “especially where there is no actual choice, reflect what people believe they ought to believe in, which, in our culture, is equality of the sexes. To prefer to produce boys is lower class and discriminatory. Many middle‐class parents might entertain such preferences but be either unaware of them or unwilling to express them, especially since at present there is no practical way of determining whether a child will be a boy or a girl.” There have been calculations based on census data of how much the normal ratio might be upset under several sets of circumstances. If every family had first a male child and then let come what may, all one‐child families of course would be male; among 2‐child families over‐all, there would be 1.5 males for each female; and among 3‐child families, 2 males for each female; and in toto the ratio would be 70 per cent male, 30 per cent female. If every family had first a male child and then chose, alternately, female and male, the result would be 60 per cent male and 40 per cent female offspring. If every 3‐child family chose 2 boys and a girl instead of making no choices deliberately, the population would be approximately 55 per cent male, 45 per cent female. And if every single‐child family had a son only and all other families made no deliberate choices, the population would be 54 per cent males and 46 per Any such significant change in sex ratio, some sociologists believe, could bring changes in many aspects of social life. Women generally read more books, see more plays, attend church more often, and account for a much lower proportion of crime. A significant male surplus could produce a kind of “frontier” society With reduced availability of marriage partners, some delay in the marriage age of men, some rise in prostitution and in homosexuality might occur. Interracial and interclass tensions might be intensified, Dr. Etzioni believes, because some groups—lower classes and minorities—seem to be more male‐oriented than the rest of society. If there is an especially great male surplus in lower status groups, the extra males would hunt females in higher status groups or in some religious group other than their own, in which females also would be scarce. If there were to he a very simple and virtually 100 per cent effective sex‐choice technique, there conceivably could be psychological effects on children, Mr. Steinfels suggests. There might develop, for example, a general assumption (as is almost the case today with contraception) that everyone uses it. In that situation, children would assume, if second‐born, that they were second‐choice. But Mr. Steinfels is not convinced that this would necessarily be serious or anything more than “just another one of the many problems in life all of deal with.” The possibility of other psychological problems is foreseen by Dr. Marc Lappe, a colleague of Mr. Steinfels at the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences. “Parents who are willing to invest heavily—both financially and emotionally—in exi.,‐ximental sex‐selection techniques might be less willing to accept deviations from their idealized versions of femininity or masculinity,” he says. Tolerance for gender heterogeneity which has been increasing of late might decrease. Children might be more firmly expected to live up to the parents' idealized versions of sea roles, and the problems implicit in homosexuality and Lesbianism might be exacerbated. If gratified, the seemingly prevalent desire to have a boy might well have repercussions disturbing to advocates of women's liberation. For psychological Studies suggest that firstborn are more likely to achieve educationally and economically. On the other hand, there could be a dividend for women resulting from a male imbalance. At present, without sex selection, more males are born than females. The ratio is 51.4 per cent boys to 48.6 per cent girls. But by age 20, the ratio is evened out—1:1. Thereafter, the ratio changes every year to favor females. By age 65 there are only 7 males to every 10 females. But if sex selection were to bring about a heavier imbalance in favor of males in the early years, the 1:1 ratio might be extended from age 20 to, say, age 35 or later, possibly even as late as 65. If so, one consequence might be elimination of lonely widowhood or spinsterhood for many older women. Could some, or even much, of this be a tempest in a teapot? Nobody really knows how well society can absorb sex imbalances. They have existed in the past. In 1960 New York City had 343,470 more females than males—without any noticeable effect. They exist now—in Washington, D. C., with a preponderance of females and in Alaska with a preponderance of males. If sex selection were to disturb the natural ratio significantly, heavily favoring boys, would that continue or would the scarcity of girls make them more highly valued and soon shift the ratio back toward neutral? Dr. Charles F. Westoff, sociologist at Princeton, and Ronald R. Rindfuss, a research associate at the University of Wisconsin, recently reported on a random survey they had made of 5,981 married women about their sex preferences in children. The study showed that if sexcontrol technologies were to be widely adopted in the U. S., the temporary effect would be a surplus of male births in the first couple of years, followed by a wave of female births to achieve balance, and that such oscillations would eventually disappear, so that the sex ratio would be similar to the present natural sex There is also the question: What steps might society take to curb sex selection altogether or at least limit it, if that were the choice? Stop research? Hardly thinkable since advances applicable to sex selection often come from basic research not specifically related to it. Withhold Government grants and otherwise discourage applied technology? That could be done. A tremendous amount of applied research would be needed to refine the Schering and Boyse‐Bennett techniques and to test them properly before they could possibly be used in human reproduction. But to curb that research would be to interfere with development of better solutions to such problems as sexlinked genetic diseases. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters To the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/30/archives/letter-to-the-editor.html,"To The Editor: It was thoughtful of you to label Carlos Fuentes for us (May 5). He does such a clever job of disguising his scholarship in the, review of Juan Goytisolo's “Count Julian” that I read the piece twice and then came upon your footnote setting forth his credentials: “Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.” Mirabile dictu! I haven't had a chance to read Goytisolo's book yet, and so it may well be as pornographic as Fuentes describes it. I do, though, know something about Spain. Spain is not now, nor was it ever, the abortion he tries to make it out to be. Early on he seems taken with the idea of the triple cultures of Catholicism, Islam and Judaism competing in Spanish society. So was Gregorio Marañon, but where Marañon saw that competition as transitional Fuentes seems to see it as the ideal situation. In taxing Spain for narrowmindedness in wanting to have done with multiple cultures Fuentes is misidentifying culture and the motivation of the Reconquest of the peninsula and the Conquest of the New World. He is also giving short weight to the quality of Spanish Catholicism and to the longing in the Spanish soul for a “wholeness.” Like so many revisionist writers nowadays, Fuentes seems to be faulting the Middle Ages for social and political concepts that didn't exist anywhere before 1750. He is wrong too about the expulsion of the Jews as synnonymous with the expulsion of intelligence from Spain. How anyone who is a Mexican and a product of Spanish culture, although at one remove, can say a thing quite so stupid is beyond my comprehension. And he is wrong about the Inquisition, which he seems to think was revived by Doña Isabel to harass the Infidel. Quite the contrary, it was set up to oversee the belief and practice of men and women who though they were professed Christians were suspected of other practices. Fuentes writes anti‐history when he pretends not to understand that in those times everywhere there was nothing in the life of the average man more important than integrity of belief and practice. This conviction was not unique to Spain, though Fuentes seems to think it was; Spain stood out in bolder color because she had such large minorities of erotic peoples within her borders. Once again Fuentes is looking at the Middle Ages through 20th‐century eyes. He is wrong too about the relationship between Spain and her colonies as compared to Great Britain and hers. When he says “we plunged... into the formal imitation of modernity proposed by the United States, France and Britain, without actually transforming the substance of our Spanish colonial heritage,” he betrays, car perhaps feigns, an ignorance of the early history of the Latin American Republics. Where he slips up here is in not recognizing that their greatest error was not the adoption of American forms, but unfaithfulness to their Spanish heritage. Their inherited way of life could have been adapted to American principles, though that wasn't necessary; they could have done the opposite —adapted the principles to their way of life. Instead they went chasing off after the foxfire of American forms in combination with French Revolutionary principles. Hence And he is wrong when he says that Charles V, in putting down the revolt of the Comuneros in Castilla, crushed the seeds of pluralism, democracy and bourgeois ideas there. The Comuneros were not the bourgeoisie, or the peasants, or a rising mercantile class; they were the nobles of Castilla who rose in defense of their feudal rights; the last thing they had in mind was a defense of democracy. So the emperor, in putting down the rebellion was, in effect, contributing to the demise of feudalism, and thus fostering the very concepts Fuentes accuses him of destroying. To imply that the Spanish Renaissance was somehow crippled by the departure of the Jews and Moslems or by the presence of the Inquisition is to fly in the face of established fact. The Renaissance was astonishingly fecund in every field whether it was painting, sculpture, architecture, decoration, literature, mysticism, music, drama, etc.; assuredly, not all was of great quality, but the fonts of inspiration were true, and the volume of production breathtaking. It is nonsense to say that the Archpriest of Hita, El Corbacho, and Fernando de Rojas absorbed their coarseness or sensuality from Arabic sources. In those days everybody wrote that way; Chaucer had no Arabs with whom to rub elbows, yet see how coarse is his great work “The Canterbury Tales.” And Marlowe? And Shakespeare? And Boccaccio? It is more nonsense to say that the last erotic novel was published in 1528. Even de Rojas's “La Celeslina,” in spite of its sensuality and in spite of its author's Jewish origins, came down the centuries in edition after edition and in full view of the Inquisition, too, recognized on all sides as a genuinely Spanish work of art. What Fuentes has to say about Jesus Christ, John of the Cross and Teresa of Jesus is a gratuitous calumny that does not offend only because thinking people are able to view it in the whole setting of makebelieve in which he writes. Speaking of the Spanish writer, Luis Vives, he says that Vives wrote to his friend Erasmus in 1534: “The times we live in are extremely difficult, and I cannot truly say which is more dangerous, to talk or to keep silent.” That is all he gives us, just the quotation, no background. It sounds pretty ominous, doesn't it? Almost as if the royal assassins were climbing the balcony while the agents of the Inquisition were battering at the doors. Vives was of Jewish stock and he was a first‐class intellect just like his friend Erasmus. Fuentes doesn't tell us this, but he suggests it by mentioning the names. Nor does he mention that Vives left Spain in 1509 and never returned. He lived for a time in England, where he Was tutor to Princess Mary. At the time of the celebrated divorce he was arrested and banished for having defended Queen Catherine (of Aragon) in writing. He made his way to Flanders, to the University of Louvain, and taught there until his dismissal because of his He married and settled in Bruges (now in Belgium); he was still there in 1534 struggling to get back his teaching post at the university. The enigmatic quotation could mean anything and is probably a reference to his problems with the university or with the Lutheran theologians with whom he carried on a running battle. Fuentes would like for us to take it as a reference to Spain. Too bad it bombed... Spain has made many mistakes in her long history, and you have a right, even an obligation, to disapprove them, but by running Fuentes's account, in which he certifies every facet of Spanish life as tainted, you make your readers feel uneasy and you yourself look ridiculous. What of that vaunted dedication to scholarship, that in‐depth reporting, that appeal to the thinking man?... GERARD LA MOUNTAIN, O.A.R.

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/03/archives/letters-to-the-editor-job-satisfaction-the-swedish-example-how-to.html,"To the Editor: On a recent trip to Soldertale, Sweden, I had the pleasure of visiting the Saab‐Scania factory and witnessed the job enlargement program in the engine assembly division. Tom Wicker, in a recent column, wrote about the Volvo plant in Kalmar, Sweden. The Saab experiment preceded Volvo's endeavors by almost four years. Witnessing the corporate philosophy of Swedish industry was a unique experience to an American economist. Job enlargement and efforts to increase job satisfaction were inspired on humanitarian grounds and not linked to productivity problems. In contrast, American corporations solve productivity problems with job enlargement programs, and job satisfaction is merely a by‐product. As he walks through the Saab‐Scania plant, the observer is greeted by gardens and sanitary conditions. You are told that they are “backlogged” on orders for ten months on ScaniaValis trucks. In an effort to play devil's advocate, I asked about the possibilities of increasing the speed of the assembly line. I was told that this was the pace which the workers wanted to maintain and that they would not consider increasing the number of trucks produced per day. In the engine assembly division, workers are grouped in multiples of How to Speed Inflation To the Editor: The current monetary‐fiscal policies maintained by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks—trying to curb inflation by raising the cost of borrowing money — is nonsense. It seems obvious that by increasing the cost of money, the universal necessity of all businesses, we are increasing the rate of inflation. If such a policy works at all, it works during a demand‐pull inflation, i.e., those situations where inflation is caused by a lot of money chasing limited amount of goods. The inflation which we are now experiencing is cost‐push inflation, where prices are rising because of the increasing costs of the component parts of providing goods and services, such as labor, raw materials and financing. Almost every business operates on borrowed money. As you increase the cost (interest rate) of borrowed money, you are increasing the cost of doing business and thereby the prices that must be charged for goods and services. Therefore, current fiscal policy is compelling all businesses, to inthree per engine assembly table. They can choose to assemble it as a team or assemble it individually. Most of the machinery had been designed by Saab‐Scania and was later purchased by various international machine manufacturers. The noise level of the machinery was far below the decibel level of comparable American machines. It was indicated to me that noise was below the required legal maximum. In contrast to the noisy and dirty conditions of comparable American plants, one could not help but be astonished. Outside of the plant was a beautiful lake owned by the company. Workers from the plant were sailing, playing tennis on the grounds, and enjoying a beautiful location in one of the garden spots of Sweden. I saw no evidence of industrial pollution but rather felt more as though I was in protected national park. We have much to learn from our Swedish corporate counterparts. One can only be dismayed upon returning to the United States and witnessing the industrial conditions which prevail. ARTHUR S. WEINBERG New York, June 12, 1974 The writer is coordinator of the Worker Exchange Program, New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations. crease prices to compensate for the increased cost of financing its work in progress, inventories, accounts receivables, start‐up money, etc. If we decrease the costs of borrowing muney, we, must experience a decrease in the rise of the costs of goods and services. This deflationary effect on all business will more than offset the effect of a theoretical increase in the supply of money. The theory of reducing inflation by reducing the money supply by increasing the costs of money is not demonstrating an ability to reduce inflation, but, rather, appears to increase inflation. MARC S. GOLDBERG New York, June 25, 1974 To Protect the Unborn To the Editor: Your “Aborting an Amendment” editorial (June 17) continues to overlook the data from genetics, embryology, and fetology which lead to the conclusion that “to terminate pregnancy voluntarily” is but a euphemism for “to kill an unborn human being.” Precisely for this reason, supporters of a human life amendment cannot agree that abortion is a “private” matter between a woman and her physician. Yeshiva University's Rabbi J. Irwin Bleich made this point eloquently at the recent Congressional hearings when he said: “No individual may justifiably take the life of another, other than in the process of selfdefense. Fetal life, as a form of human life, is entitled to the self‐same safeguards and protection which society accords to all its members. Abortion is not a private matter between a woman and her physician. It impinges upon the most fundamental right of a third party … the unborn baby's right to life. It is precisely because the unborn baby is defenseless and unable to defend its rights that society has an obligation to guarantee the fetus protection under the law.” Supporters of a human life amendment advocate no return to a “double standard under which the wealthy would continue to obtain abortions and the poor would be victimized.” They advocate a single standard which would simultaneously protect the innocent unborn, whether belonging to the rich or the poor, encourage responsible parenthood and premarital chastity and assure adequate social services for the (pregnant) poor. (Rev.) DANIEL S. HAMILTON Director, Bureau of Public Information Diocese of Rockville Centre Rockville Centre, L. L, June 17, 1974 Pat Hearst and the System To the Editor: In his May 29 letter “Our Pattys and Tanias,” Robert Vogel presents rather naive picture of the Patricia Hearsts of the world. As a former college president, no doubt Mr. Vogel met many potential Pattys. Did it ever occur to him that in each case there is perhaps a poorly developed ego with a consequently distorted value system. It, is always easy to blame the system, especially if we are an integral part of it. A college president who so readily emphasizes and accepts ego functioning breakdown as a mere disenchantment with our system is a real danger to our society. Less self‐hatred and more willingness to separate himself from his college students might give Mr. Vogel the confidence that his own daughter would not have been Patty. If Patty has been hypnotized or drugged, we no doubt must empathize. However, in speculating, we must not omit the possibility of a disenchanted girl with a long history of cop‐outs. They are not our Pattys and Tanias, Mr. Vogel, they are yours. SALLY OLSHIN Great Neck, L. I., June 10, 1974 ‘Give Me a Train…’ To the Editor: You editorialize continually on imposing higher taxes, tolls on the nowfree East River bridges, raising the rates on toll bridges and taking away the special commutation privileges that save some motorists a few dollars—all to “free the city from the tyranny of the automobile and the poison of exhaust fumes.” Give me a transportation system that doesn't make me wait twenty to thirty minutes for a train during nonrush hours. Give me a train where I can have a seat, a clean train that does not turn into a turkish bath in the summer. Give me a train I can feel safe in. Give me a train in which I don't have to fear muggers or purse‐snatchers. Give me buses that don't travel in “banana bunches” and, oh yes, give me courteous and respectful drivers. Give me these, and I'll gladly leave my car at home and come to the parks, theaters and museums and again enjoy the privileges that so much of my “auto tax” dollars pay for. HARRY JACOBS Brooklyn, June 19, 1974 On Balaguer's Victory To the Editor: During the past few weeks, several news reports appeared in the U.S. press in general, regarding the recent presidential election in the Dominican Republic. These articles contain important factual errors which misrepresent what was in reality an impressive exercise of political democracy in my country. These articles cited widespread abstentions and boycotting of the election. The facts are otherwise. I feel it is my duty, both as a citizen and an official of my Government,. to set the record straight with regard to these reports. Of two million Dominican citizens registered to vote in the past election, more than 1.3 million, over 65 per cent, actually went to the polls—a much higher percentage than voted in the past Presidential election in the United States. Of these, nearly one million voted for President Balaguerclose to a majority of all registered voters and an overwhelming majority of those who actually voted. The undisputed fact is that President Balaguer won a successive elected third term through a popular landslide. Statistics aside, critics of the recent election should note that the electoral process in the Dominican Republic is one of the most advanced in the hemisphere and was cited as such by the Organization of American States in 1965. Each eligible voter is subject to five separate checks and counterchecks to prevent any possibility of fraud, The entire process is administered by an independent election board, is open to critical inspection by all parties who are represented in each polling booth, and is also subject to the surveillance of one of the freest presses in the hemisphere. Nearly one million voters cast their vote for President Balaguer. This was an unprecedented vote of confidence in his record of social and economic development established over the past eight years. These years have seen modern laws for land redistribution and a veritable explosion in schooling, tourism, housing, and medical care. As a Dominican, I am proud—and I know that all Dominicans are proud —of the high degree of civic responsibility demonstrated by the people of the. Dominican Republic in the past election. This experience shows that the strife and errors of the past have been put aside and that the people have devoted themselves to the development of their country under the leadership of President Balaguer. PEDRO E. MORALES TRONCOSO Secretary of State Without Portfolio Santo Domingo, June 21, 1974 To Catch a Bus To the Editor: The June 15 editorial “Run, Don't Wait” may have the effect of prodding the Metropolitan Transit Authority into another brief spurt of activity. Sustained effort, of course, is not to be expected. Failure to maintain the legibility of route number signs along the city's various thoroughfares is but one manifestation. Actually, replacement is what's needed. To prove really helpful, such indicators ought by now to have been updated to take into account the new route numbers introduced several months ago. In a commendable effort to unscramble the numbers jumble—one Route 15 operated on First and Second Avenues, a second ran crosstown along 23d Street and still another linked Fifth Avenue with Jackson Heights—each of these lines now has been awarded a separate designation. Unfortunately, this innovation has also deteriorated into a halfhearted, incompletely realized enterprise. Many of the buses continue to display their original route signs. How is an outaoftowner to know that either a No. 20 or an M‐28 will transport him across 57th Street from one river to the other? Even natives are apt to be confused. Then, too, the “limited stop” pronouncement was evidently overlooked when the new route‐number rollers were designed. Various makeshift bits of cardboard serve as substitutes, but it takes a keen eye to spot them. The result is frayed tempers when unwitting passengers are carried beyond their destinations. The amateurishness of these and other aspects of our transit operation would hardly be countenanced in Squeedunk. Should New Yorkers be expected to accept it uncomplainingly? Whatever the cost of the ride, the traveler ought not to be in constant doubt as to where the bus he's aboard is headed or whether it will stop at his usual corner. THOMAS G. MORGANSEN Jackson Heights, N. Y., June 15, 1974 Besieged New Yorkers To the Editor: The politicians have done It again: a raise in our real‐estate taxes, a $15 auto‐use tax and eight cents of every dollar. No wonder the taxpayers in this city are leaving. We are tired of dirty streets pitted with potholes, filthy subways and buses, rampant crime, graft in welfare and Medicaid, greedy and demanding unions, corrupt police, corrupt judges and most of all lying politicians.

G.O.P. Hails Wilson On Patronage Jobs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/05/archives/gop-hails-wilson-on-patronage-jobs.html,"In his first six months in office, Governor Wilson has made 467 appointments of his own, and to the politicians who keep a close watch over such things, he has already demonstrated a talent for dispensing patronage more suitable to Republican party leaders than his predecessor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. The pattern of appointments thus far shows more of the careful Wilson style. For one thing, party officials no longer find relative strangers presenting i.o.u.'s for jobs that were promised to them in some last, enthusiastic chat with Mr. Rockefeller outside the patronage channel. They used to come out of the bushes the day after a banquet and say ‘Nelson promised,’” according to one knowledgeable source who said that Mr. Rockefeller had the knack of eventually adjusting these sudden enthusiasms with his party responsibilities. The Wilson method is more studied, and Republican officials say that while there has been no large‐scale scattering of high‐paying jobs, there have been a number of reassuring signs from the new Governor. These include the following: ¶A greater reliance by Mr. Wilson on the preferences local county organizations. These are organizations in the lower chain of command that Mr. Rockefeller was accused of ignoring at times and that Mr, Wilson has been trying to rally strongly in his election drive. ¶Mr. Wilson's own first‐hand, detailed knowledge of people and places, garnered in his 35 quiet, dogged years of roaming about state politics. He is credited with expertly using a batch of well over 100 largely unpaid slots—boards of visitors at mental institutions and training schools, labor and management advisory posts—to honor leaders of scores of communities in this election year. An avoidance of the grand gesture in appointments that party professionals sometimes found disquieting about Mr. Rockefeller. The most celebrated example was Mr. Wilson's replacement of Emil (Bus) Mosbacher, the yachtsman and political neophyte named by Mr. Rockefeller to head a new superagency, the Racing and Wagering Board. The choice and the salary —$75,000 a year —had left some Republicans furious. Mr. Wilson, privately terming the job‐heavy superagency “an abortion,” chose a reassuring replacement in the eyes of party professionals — Bertram D. Sarafan, a respected Republican trouble shooter — and lowered the salary by $20,000. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rockefeller hardly were’ at odds generally over patronage, party officials say. Some politicians feel Mr. Wilson's choice of David L. Yunich, the former Macy's executive, as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also was Mr. Rockefeller's choice. Mr. Wilson showed how closely he heeds the word of influential county leaders during the special legislative session last May when he fulfilled a cross‐party judgeship agreement that had been made by Assemblyman Joseph M. Mar giotta, the Nassau County G.O.P. chairman, but had become snagged in the screening process. The screening committee reconsidered and approved the choice of William J. Deeley Jr., a Democrat and former chairman of the Nassau County Bar Association, and the Governor appointed him to a $43,817‐a‐year seat on the Court of Claims, helping Mr. Margiotta keep his word. To some extent, there are parallels between the Governor's appointment habits and his election strategy. In addition to working to please Mr. Margiotta, the Governor appointed the Republican chairman of neighboring Suffolk County, Edwin M. Schwenk, chairman of the new state Sport Authority, a $25,000‐a‐year post. Both Republican counties figure large in Mr. Wilson's strategy. The thing about patronage dispensation, politicians emphasize, is that it can be as thankless a task as it is thankful. “It there are 10 politicians vying for the same patronage job, the official who must make the appointment will leave nine enemies and an ingrate” was the political maxim quoted by a state Republican a few weeks ago. He used ft when Governor Wilson's nomination on the Conservative party ballot was threatened by a man the Governor had appointed a short while before to the State Agricultural Advisory Commission —T. David Bullard, a vice chairman of the Conservative party. As things turned out, Mr. Bullard dropped the primary challenge with a warm endorsement of Mr. Wilson, and many politicians agreed that as a Cornell‐educated operator of a 500‐acre apple farm, Mr. Bullard deserved the agriculture post, unsalaried but prestigious in the farm community. “It was a clear signal to our party,” said Serphin Maltese, the Conservatives’ executive director. “This was the first time a Conservative was ever appointed by a Governor to any commission. We were no longer excluded.” Richard M. Rosenbaum, the state Republican chairman, sees patronage dispensation as “the single biggest source of rancor.” Recently he made a tour of private meetings with county organizations. During a meeting in Brooklyn, the shouted demands from rank and file for more appointive jobs could be heard by one bystander in another room. “Give us something more, for God's sake,” one politician urged.

G.O.P. Hails Wilson On Patronage Jobs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/05/archives/gop-hails-wilson-on-patronage-jobs-wilson-is-praised-by-republican.html,"In his first six months in office, Governor Wilson has made 467 appointments of his own, and to the politicians who keep a close watch over such things, he has already demonstrated a talent for dispensing patronage more suitable to Republican party leaders than his predecessor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. The pattern of appointments thus far shows more of the careful Wilson style. For one thing, party officials no longer find relative strangers presenting i.o.u.'s for jobs that were promised to them in some fast, enthusiastic chat with Mr. Rockefeller outside the patronage channel. They used to come out of the bushes the day after a banquet and ‘say ‘Nelson promised,’” according to one knowledgeable source who said that Mr. Rockefeller had the knack of eventually adjusting these sudden enthusiasms with his party responsibilities. The Wilson method is more studied, and Republican officials say that while there has been no large‐scale scattering of high‐paying jobs, there have been a number of reassuring signs from the new Governor. These include the following: ¶A greater reliance by Mr. Wilson on the preferences local county organizations. These are organizations in the lower chain of command that Mr. Rockefeller was accused of ignoring at times and that Mr, Wilson has been trying to rally strongly in his election drive. ¶Mr. Wilson's own first‐hand, detailed knowledge of people and places, garnered in his 35 quiet, dogged years of roaming about state politics. He is credited with expertly using a batch of well over 100 largely unpaid slots—boards of visitors at mental institutions and training schools, labor and management advisory posts—to honor leaders of scores of communities in this election year. An avoidance of the grand gesture in appointments that party professionals sometimes found disquieting about Mr. Rockefeller. The most celebrated example was Mr. Wilson's replacement of Emil (Bus) Mosbacher, the yachtsman and political neophyte named by Mr. Rockefeller to head a new superagency, the Racing and Wagering Board. The choice and the salary —$75,000 a year —had left some Republicans furious. Mr. Wilson, privately terming the job‐heavy superagency “an abortion,” chose a reassuring replacement in the eyes of party professionals — Bertram D. Sarafan, a respected Republican trouble shooter — and lowered the salary by $20,000. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rockefeller hardly were’ at odds generally over patronage, party officials say. Some politicians feel Mr. Wilson's choice of David L. Yunich, the former Macy's executive, as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also was Mr. Rockefeller's choice. Mr. Wilson showed how closely he heeds the word of influential county leaders during the special legislative session last May when he fulfilled a cross‐party judgeship agreement that had been made by Assemblyman Joseph M. Mar giotta, the Nassau County G.O.P. chairman, but had become snagged in the screening process. The screening committee reconsidered and approved the choice of William J. Deeley Jr., a Democrat and former chairman of the Nassau County Bar Association, and the Governor appointed him to a $43,817‐a‐year seat on the Court of Claims, helping Mr. Margiotta keep his word. To some extent, there are parallels between the Governor's appointment habits and his election strategy. In addition to working to please Mr. Margiotta, the Governor appointed the Republican chairman of neighboring Suffolk County, Edwin M. Schwenk, chairman of the new state Sport Authority, a $25,000‐a‐year post. Both Republican counties figure large in Mr. Wilson's strategy. The thing about patronage dispensation, politicians emphasize, is that it can be as thankless a task as it is thankful. “It there are 10 politicians vying for the same patronage job, the official who must make the appointment will leave nine enemies and an ingrate” was the political maxim quoted by a state Republican a few weeks ago. He used ft when Governor Wilson's nomination on the Conservative party ballot was threatened by a man the Governor had appointed a short while before to the State Agricultural Advisory Commission —T. David Bullard, a vice chairman of the Conservative party. As things turned out, Mr. Bullard dropped the primary challenge with a warm endorsement of Mr. Wilson, and many politicians agreed that as a Cornell‐educated operator of a 500‐acre apple farm, Mr. Bullard deserved the agriculture post, unsalaried but prestigious in the farm community. “It was a clear signal to our party,” said Serphin Maltese, the Conservatives’ executive director. “This was the first time a Conservative was ever appointed by a Governor to any commission. We were no longer excluded.” Richard M. Rosenbaum, the state Republican chairman, sees patronage dispensation as “the single biggest source of rancor.” Recently he made a tour of private meetings with county organizations. During a meeting in Brooklyn, the shouted demands from rank and file for more appointive jobs could be heard by one bystander in another room. “Give us something more, for God's sake,” one politician urged.

Greek Orthodox Church Forms Social Action Unit,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/05/archives/greek-orthodox-church-forms-social-action-unit.html,"CHICAGO, July 4 — The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America has established its first Office of Social Concerns and has committed the new agency to “organize, implement and develop” a program of social action for the church's two‐million members in the United States and Canada, Establishment of the office, which will have a full‐time director housed in the denomination's headquarters in New York City, has been a goal of the church's socially minded clergy and laity for many years. The agency will give the Greek church an outlet for social activism that similar units in Protestantism, Roman Catholicism and Judaism give their members. The Archidiocese has been holding its 22d biennial Congress in the Conrad Hilton Hotel here since Sunday. Sessions will end on Saturday with pastoral message by Archbishop lakovos, primate and spiritual leader of the Archdiocese. The first task of the new office will be to commission “qualified” persons to prepare “position papers” presenting the Greek Orthodox position on social and moral issues and “updating” them when necessary. The office was formally brought into being when the 1,000 delegates approved committee report citing the need “to raise the consciousness of our people regarding the implications of our orthodox Christian faith for the social issues of our time” and calling for the establishment of an agency to implement that need. The report listed 25 suggested topics for position papers. Among them were the moral crisis in the nation, abortion, contraception, venereal disease, pornography, homosexuality, prostitution and gambling. A section of the report that opposed gambling in all forms when used to raise church funds was approved, but only after considerable debate. A number of delegates wanted specific mention of bingo, card games, raffles and “Las Vegas Nights” instead of gambling in general but were voted down. In his keynote address on Monday, Archbishop Iakovos said that the decline of religion, the inability of the institutionalized church to cope with the problems of contemporary society and what he called the vanity and emptiness of reforms in both the organized church and its clergy all stemmed from the loss of the soul of Christianity. “There is nothing wrong with Christianity,” he said. “Christianity has failed no one. The institutional church may have failed many. Those who claim that the church has failed would do a great service to their souls if they could re‐examine who has failed whom. There are no substitutes for Christianity as there is no substitute for truth.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The death of ethical and political argument was only temporary,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/07/archives/philosophers-are-back-on-the-job-the-death-of-ethical-and-political.html,"While watching Tom Stoppard's play “Jumpers”—recently performed on Broadway—I wondered what the audience, consisting predominantly of people outside professional philosophy, were making of it. They were surely missing a few philosophical “in” jokes, but that did not matter. might be more perplexing, I thought, to be unable to judge how close to reality Stoppard's portrayal of philosophers in a modern university had come. The play's central character, George Moore, is professor of moral philosophy who spends most of the play trying to write a lecture he must deliver on the topic: “Man—good, bad or indifferent?” the lecture, which we hear him dictate to his patient secretary, as wild a parody of academic philosophy as the vice chancellor's team of gymnasts from which the play takes its name? Many of those in the audience, had they pondered this, would have had to admit that they know less about philosophy than they know about almost any other academic discipline. We all studied history and physics in high school, and although we might not have the faintest idea of the kind of work that is being done by researchers in these fields now, their general aim straightforward enough. But what is the aim of philosophy? The origin of the word suggests that the philosopher is one who loves wisdom—but doesn't everybody? And what does the philosopher do to manifest his special love of wisdom? Some think that today philosophy is a study of the wisdom of the past. Philosophers, according to this conception of the subject, are all long dead, except perhaps for rare specimens to be found in Parisian cafes or among the Yaqui Indians. Those who teach philosophy in the universities are not philosophers themselves. They try merely (merely?) to pass on the wisdom of the philosophers to each new generation of students. Maybe “Jumpers” will do something to dispel this fallacy. George Moore is trying to solve philosophical problems, and it is clear that he must answer them himself, by constructing an argument that leads to a conclusion one way or the other, rather than by reporting what someone else said about the matter long ago. This is the central philosophical activity: attempting to construct solution to a problem (although the title of Moore's lecture poses a broader issue, and one more closely tied in with matters of fact, than most of the problems philosophers discuss). Of course, the central philosophical problems are ancient, and many of the philosophical “greats” have had something to say about them. This something may be worth discussing, if only to see why it is inadequate. Courses on Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume and Kant still make up a large part of what is taught in university philosophy departments; but the primary concern is with unsolved problems, and the history of philosophy important to most philosophers not for its own sake, but because it may help us with these problems. Why is it that ancient philosophical problems remain unsolved? Why is it that what Aristotle wrote about ethics is still of interest to the student of moral philosophy, while the budding zoologist, say, can safely ignore the same author's writings on animals. And why is it that the much‐vaunted “revolutions” in English‐speaking philosophy that have occurred in the present century have been unable to clear up the old problems finally? A brief answer to the first of these queries is that philosophical problems are just those residual problems that we are left with when we have answered all the problems that can be answered by the discovery of new facts. Physics, for example, was a branch of philosophy (“natural philosophy”) until it became possible to solve its problems by experiment and observation. Philosophical problems require reasoned argument, not the assembling of new information. Our knowledge has expanded greatly since Aristotle, but our reasoning powers have not. How can there be problems that would still be unsolved even if we knew all the relevant facts? Perhaps any problems that seemed to persist would not be real problems, but some kind of misconception or illusion? The two aforementioned “revolutions”—logical positivism and linguistic analysis—are variations on this theme. The logical positivists thought that any utterance that could not, even in principle, be verified by some observation was meaningless. The task of philosophy was to expose the unverifiable gibberish of the traditional metaphysicians for what it is, extract anything that could be verified and hand that over to the scientists to test, discarding all the rest on the garbage heap of history. As A. Ayer wrote in “Language, Truth and Logic,” a book that served as a kind of manifesto for logical positivism, all the philosopher can do is provide definitions. Presumably, though, this could only be done for a limited time before we had all the definitions we were likely to need. No doubt philosophers would then find something other than philosophy to occupy themselves with. Logical positivism was a hard‐headed movement that looked to physics as a model of clarity and progress and wished to imitate its methods. Its attitude to the concepts embedded in ordinary language was uncompromising: They had to become scientific, or go. After a time it became clear that ordinary concepts would not vanish at the invocation of the verification principle; and philosophers, led by Ludwig Wittgenstein, whom the positivists had previously regarded as one of their guiding spirits, began to accept that there are areas in which statements may be meaningful even if they are not verifiable. This the positivists could hardly deny, since it was now a commonplace that the verification principle was itself unverifiable. The next major philosophical movement, linguistic analysis or “ordinary‐language philosophy,” grew out of this objection to logical positivism. The problem with which it started was: If the meaning of an utterance is not to be found in the observable states of affairs that would verify or falsify it, where is meaning to be found? Ordinarylanguage philosophy took its answer from Wittgenstein's view that the meaning of a term is to be found in the way it is used in a language, and the role that language plays in what Wittgenstein called a “form of life.” (Wittgenstein himself, however, became contemptuous of the method of doing philosophy that he had inspired. Yet his influence has survived its demise. Since his death in 1951, his work has been subject to a fresh examination and his ideas are still influential, particularly such areas as philosophy of the social sciences and philosophy of religion.) So philosophers began to pay more attention to how words are used. In its moderate form, all this movement claimed was that such attention would enable us to understand what was really problematical and what was a mere linguistic confusion in philosophical discussions. Soon, though, a more extreme position became influential. Once we understood how ordinary language functioned, some philosophers said, we could see that, far from needing the ruthless reform the logical positivists had wanted to impose on it, ordinary language was perfectly all right as it was. All that was needed was a careful analysis that would reveal the subtle nuances of concepts like knowledge, truth, goodness, freedom, God and so on. Everything that earlier philosophers had thought to be a philosophical problem was now seen by this new school of philosophy to be no more than a confusion resulting from the misuse of ordinary language. For instance, the ancient controversy over whether we have free will was “dissolved” by the observation that we may properly say of the smiling bridegroom embracing his sweetheart that he marries “of his own free will.” Since there is a proper use for the term (a “paradigm case,') as it was called), to deny that there is free will must be to misuse the term; and since meaning was held to depend on use, anyone who misused a term was changing its meaning, and perhaps emptying it of any meaning at all. Philosophical problems, it was held, arose when words with clear meanings in their ordinary contexts were used outside their normal habitat. By now it is apparent to most philoiophers that the standard philosophical problems have not been dissolved by the linguistic analysts. After we have distinguished, as Moore does in “Jumpers” and real‐life philosophers have done in articles and books, between knowledge in the sense of havingexperience‐of, and knowledge in the sense of beingacquainted‐with, and knowledge in the sense of comprehending truths, there still remains the skeptic's old question: Since we might always be mistaken, can we ever rightly claim to know anything? And however much a bridegroom may smile, if we discover a complete causal explanation of his behavior on the basis of which we could have predicted his decision to marry, we will not be able to think of that decision as decision made “of his own free will” in the way we did formerly. The failure of ordinary‐language philosophy to dissolve major philosophical problems, coupled with growing unease about accounting for the meaning of an expression in terms of its use, led philosophers to look elsewhere for solutions to their problems. Abused by leftists like Marcuse, who regarded it as a bourgeois ideology that protected the status quo from criticism, and deserted by others who simply thought it trivial by comparison with the momentous events of the sixties, ordinary‐language philosophy passed away unmourned, although no clear solution had been found to the basic problem of meaning which had given it its impetus. The departure of linguistic analysis brought number of changes in the philosophical world. Most striking is the change of style. In this respect “Jumpers” is already out of date. In the heyday of linguistic analysis, philosophy was, for those who had acquired the taste, something to be savored, like a wine that was pleasing only to the trained palate of the connoisseur. A satisfying discussion might consist of a few people puzzling away at what we mean when we say of someone, “He is in pain,” and offering each other new tidbits like, “If I have a toothache after the pain‐killer wears off, can I say that it is the same toothache I had before?” The center of the philosophical world at this time was undoubtedly Oxford, and the philosophical mannerisms that were carried by Oxford graduates to America and the British Commonwealth reflected the urbane discussions that took place over dinner at Oxford high tables, where wit and style are highly prized. Today Oxford has changed. Although the ripples it sent out a few years ago have not quite died away on distant shores, Oxford philosophers are again grappling with philosophical issues directly, rather than via the subtleties of ordinary language. In any case, Oxford no longer sets the style for other philosophers. There are now a number of important philosophy departments rather than a single leading university. If the philosophical world has a center at all, it is in the northeastern United States, somewhere between Harvard and Princeton; but the pre‐eminence of this region lies mainly in its high density of fine philosophers, and equally talented figures can be found more widely dispersed elsewhere. Because there are more philosophers in America than anywhere else, Oxford's loss of pre‐eminence means that for the first time in the history of the subject, there is more important new work being done here than anywhere else in the world. It is the American journals —like Columbia University's Journal of Philosophy, and Cornell's Philosophical Review — that are setting the trends, and not the British journal Mind, which used to be the place to be published in the golden age of linguistic philosophy. So the Old Oxford elegance has given way to a characteristic American bluntness. It is a refreshing change. There is far more hard argument than there used to be. There is also, however, far more specialization, and one result of attempts to make philosophy more exact is that large areas of it now assume a level of knowledge of technical terms, definitions and methods of notation that can be acquired only by an extensive reading of the related literature. Moreover, there is a tendency for a new approach to develop its own terminology and its own literature, based on the work of some leading figure, who will be a professor at one of the major universities. Adherents of the same approach have no difficulty in understanding each other, but it becomes difficult to keep up with several of these “schools” simultaneously, and so communication problems arise. The effect of this is to make a good deal of recent work in philosophy inaccessible not only to the general public, but to undergraduates studying philosophy So it is difficult, if not impossible, to give a short, simple account of the work that is now being done in subdivisions like philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind and many of the other areas in which philosophers are actively pursuing solutions to old and new problems. Fortunately, however, this technical style does not dominate all philosophy. For those who want the subject to have something to say to people outside academic life, there is ample compensation for the inaccessibility of some areas in the resurgence of interest in the side of philosophy most closely connected with problems that nonphilosophers also face: moral philosophy, or ethics, and political philosophy. In reviving these subjects, philosophers have not, by and large, succumbed to the temptation of making their work appear more profound by developing an esoteric terminology or incorporating superfluous logical formulas. Today it already seems strange that such obviously important subjects as ethics and political philosophy should recently have been in need of revival. Yet 20 years ago these subjects were more or less dead. The logical positivists had delivered a stunning blow: Since moral judgments could not be verified, it was thought that they could not be true or false; at most, they were expressions of emotional attitudes. This view, known as “emotivism,” tended to discount the value of serious reasoning about ethical questions. Building on earlier arguments that we cannot derive judgments of value from judgments of fact, the emotivists claimed that we can reason only about the latter, and that once disagreements over matters of fact have been cleared away, any ethical disagreement that remains depends on attitudes which, like matters of taste, are personal and not based on considerations that can properly be reasoned or argued about. Since, then, fundamental ethical disagreements would not yield to the charac‐ teristic philosophical methods of analysis, reason and argument, all the moral philosopher could do was to discuss the meaning of moral terms and the nature of moral language. This, at least, was supposedly a morally neutral activity. To get involved in any other questions in ethics or political philosophy, one would have had to introduce value judgments, and since these were merely expressions of one's own emotional attitudes, it was thought improper to allow them to intrude into a respectable academic discipline. For a time it became a platitude that “the job of the moral philosopher is not that of the moralist.” C. D. Broad expressed a widely accepted view when he wrote in “Ethics and the History of Philosophy”: “Moral philosophers, as such, have no special information not available to the general public about what is right and what is wrong; nor have they any call to undertake those hortatory functions which are so adequately performed by clergymen, politicians, leaderwriters…” Even a man as committed to moral and po litical debate as Bertrand Russell felt constrained to say that when he wrote on these questions he was writing as an ordinary citizen and not as a philosopher. By denying themselves the most stimulating sections of ethics in this way, moral philosophers turned their field into a minor province of ordinary‐language philosophy. Political philosophy, too, seemed headed for extinction. What had formerly been thought to be political philosophy could now be divided, it was held, into two subjects, neither suitable for philosophers: moral judgments applied to the political arena (excluded for the same reason that value judgments were excluded from moral philosophy); and questions of fact about the consequences of various social and political arrangements (suitable topics for political scientists, sociologists and futurologists generally, but not for philosophers). Again, all that was left for the philosopher was the analysis of political terms like “authority,” “obligation,” “legitimate government” and so on. As Peter Laslett wrote in an introduction to an influential collection of articles that appeared in 1956: “For the moment, anyway, political philosophy The first sign that death might be temporary came with the decline of emotivism, a decline which paralleled that of the over‐all positivism that had made emotivism so popular. Emotivism was not overthrown suddenly, and it still has some adherents today, but a steadily growing number of books and articles suggesting that there is more to morality than the expression of emotional attitudes began to appear. There were strong grounds for discontent with the idea that morality is just a matter of taste, or nonrational attitude. If I say that it is wrong for those with plenty to allow others short of food to starve, I am not merely expressing my dislike of allowing people to starve, as I might express my dislike of gin. Maybe moral judgments are not verifiable; maybe they are not even true or false as statements of fact are; nevertheless, they are still based on reason, and we can argue about them in a way in which it would be pointless to argue about whether we like the taste of gin. Recognizing this, philosophers began to reconsider the structure of ethical argument and the part that logic and reason play in it. Of particular importance in this reconsideration was the revival of an idea that goes back to Kant and ultimately to the Biblical Golden Rule—the idea that an ethical judgment should be universal in form, so that if I claim that I'm morally justified in my actions toward you, I must be prepared to allow that you would be similarly justified if our positions were reversed. Although the significance and interpretation of this idea are still controversial, it was a first step away from the position that when we discuss moral Issues “anything goes” and no one's opinion is any better than anyone else's. Moral philosophers do not agree on the role of reason in moral argument, but there is now a general consensus for a view of ethics that, while in no sense a return to traditional ideas of absolute moral laws written up in heaven for all to see, does make a distinction between sound and unsound argument, and so allows us to claim that in discussing moral questions we are doing more than ex pressing arbitrary preferences. By going beyond emotivism, philosophers made it possible for themselves to bring the scrutiny of real moral issues within the scope of moral philosophy. The impetus that actually brought them to do this on a large scale, however, came from outside the profession. Suddenly issues like racial equality, human rights, the morality of war and the justifiability of disobeying the law became matters of public concern. This and the related pressure of student demands for “relevant” courses seem to have been decisive in breaking down the earlier, more restricted view of moral and political philosophy. Many teachers of philosophy, especially the younger ones, were more than willing to go along with the students. They were bored with analyzing moral terms. They were inclined to be politically radical, and they wanted to connect their professional activities with broader social goals. Traditionally, moral and political philosophers had written about the issues now in the public spotlight. The obvious for to do, therefore, was to drop their neutral stance and see if they had anything useful to say about these issues. Old habits die hard, and for a time it looked as if philosophy did not have much to contribute after all. Lengthy articles began to appear on civil disobedience, for instance, but the articles rarely got beyond discussing how the concept should be defined. Only gradually did assessments of the moral arguments on this and other controversial issues gain acceptability in the learned journals. Once this happened, however, interest grew quickly. By 1971 it had become so keen that a new journal, “Philosophy and Public Affairs,” was created to promote the philosophical discussion of matters of public concern, and to bridge the gap that exists between philosophers and those in other disciplines, or in no academic discipline at all, who are working on questions that raise philosophical issues. The journal has maintained a high level of discussion from the start, publishing articles on such topics as the morality of war and responsibility for war crimes, civil disobedience, the obligations of the affluent to the starving, preferential hiring and compensatory discrimination for disadvantaged groups, freedom of expression, the nature of justice, the problem of “getting your hands dirty” in politics, and a whole spate of articles and replies on the morality of abortion (with some provocative sidelights on infanticide as well). All this has shown that many problems that have been well worked over have by no means been worked out. One might think, for example, that so much has been said about equality that nothing new could possibly turn up; but the discussions of preferential hiring and compensatory discrimination show that there are still implications of our ideas of equality waiting to be unraveled and discussed. The same is true of many other issues, especially the heated question of abortion, a question about which only a few philosophers have appreciated that the crucial issue is not, as many people assume, “When does the fetus become a human being?” but rather, “What are the characteristics of a being that make it wrong to kill that being?” It is by no means obvious that being a member of the species homo sapiens is what counts in the answer to this second question. Sentience, or even a certain measure of self‐awareness, might be more appropriate characteristics to choose. In any case, this deeper approach to the question opens that has been substantially overlooked by both philosophers and nonphilosophers until quite recently. Another indication of the new strength of moral and political philosophy is the extraordinary reception that greeted the publication of John Rawls's new book, “A Theory of Justice,” in 1971. The book immediately became the most discussed single item on the philosophical scene, a position it continues to hold. Of course, by the standards of philosophical publishing there had been unusual advance publicity. The author is a Harvard professor„ and many of his former students are now in philosophy departments throughout the country. The core of the theory the book proposes had already appeared in articles in the journals and had been widely argued about. Early versions of the book had been circulated in mimeographed form to friends and critics. None of this, however, would have been enough to make the book the philosophical best seller it has been, had there not been great interest in the and major new work prior to “A Theory of Justice” on which that interest could focus. The early rave reviews that appeared in magazines and newspapers when the book first appeared have now given way to more sober and much more critical studies in the journals, but there is no doubt that the merits of Rawis's theory will be debated for some time to come. There is already a long bibliography for the Rawls scholar to keep up with and it is growing fast. In some respects all this is unfortunate, since the book does not represent moral and political philosophy at its best. It has many good things in it, but it is so long, and tho basic themes are so often repeated and qualified in so many different ways, that it is difficult to grasp as a whole, and consequently difficult to teach to undergraduates. A more serious objection is that the book embodies a questionable view of the nature of moral philosophy. Rawls sees the aim of the subject as, at least in part, the systematizing of our moral intuitions. We all possess, Rawls says, the capacity to make moral judgments on a number of particular matters —we can say: “That would be unjust …This would be just and so on in particular circumstances. Rawls thinks moral philosophy should take the firmest of these particular judgments as data, and try to produce a plausible general moral theory that will yield the same judgments in those particular situations. Thus Rawls's theory of justice seeks to unify our particular intuitions about justice in much the same way as a scientific theory seeks to unify the data of particular observations. This approach leads Rawls to rely heavily on moral intuitions that he thinks the reader accepts and to avoid subjecting common intuitions to rigorous criticism. The basic idea of Rawls's theory is that we can discover what principles and institutions are just by asking what principles and institutions rational selfinterested people would agree to under certain hypothetical conditions which eliminate personal biases and inequality of bargaining power. We might expect that this method, with its egalitarian starting point, would lead to a conception of justice that was radically different from the usual one (for instance, in respect of the disparity that the commonly accepted view of justice tolerates between the standard of living in affluent nations and elsewhere in the world). Rawls, however, in this and other instances, blunts the radical implications of his own starting point and so arrives at a theory of justice that justifies a kind of society apparently not so very different from our own liberaldemocrat free‐enterprise system, and says almost nothing in distribution between nationstates. So justice is made to accord with most of the moral intuitions most people already accept. Admittedly, Rawls's conception of the subject is compatible with a certain amount of criticism of common moral intuitions, but the extent to which he himself, in the book, is prepared to tinker with the basic theory in order to make it conform to these intuitions could set a trend which would take moral philosophy in the same direction as the kind of ordinary‐language philosophy that refused to challenge our ordinary preconceptions. This tendency would be particularly regrettable in moral and political philosophy, since these areas of the subject have practical consequences if they are taken seriously. No conclusions about what we ought to do can validly be drawn from a description of what most people in our society think we ought to do. If we have a soundly based moral theory we ought to be prepared to accept its implications even if they force us to change our moral views on major issues. this point is forgotten, moral philosophy loses its capacity to generate radical criticism of prevailing moral standards, and serves only to preserve the status quo. As long as moral philosophy avoids this danger, I do not think the renewed interest in substantive questions will be a temporary phenomenon. It shows no signs of ebbing now that students have become less insistent—and much less intimidating—in their demands for relevance. Thoughtful discussions of ethical issues meet a need that is felt outside academic circles. Although Mr, Nixon has said that the President is the moral leader of the nation, no one else would now describe the provision of moral guidance, as Broad did, as a task “so adequately performed” by politicians. Clergymen, too, do not make entirely satisfactory moralists. When controversial moral issues arise, religious leaders are routinely asked their opinions; but since only a minority of the population regularly attends church or synagogue, the result is a distorted impression of moral attitudes in the community. Clerical pronouncements on moral issues give undue importance to sexual morality, so much so that terms like “loose morals” are now automatically taken to refer to sexual conduct rather than, say, tax evasion, although the latter may be the more serious offense. To restore balance, secular moralists should be consulted as often as religious moralists—and who is better qualified as a secular moralist than a moral philosopher? This suggestion is not meant to imply that moral philosophers should pontificate from their professorial chairs while the masses dutifully obey. Moral positions should be discussed and argued about, not accepted on the authority of God or godprofessor. The moral philosopher does not present his views as derivations from authority or from ancient books. The philosopher's aim is to show that reasoning and argument favor one position rather than another. It may not always be possible to achieve this aim. Sometimes moral arguments do break down in a disagreement that reason seems unable to resolve. But at other times quite rigorous argument against certain views will be possible. Philosophers may be able to locate an inconsistency between two positions that someone wants to hold simultaneously. By using their understanding of the Philosophical problems are just those residual problems we are left with when we have answered all the problems that can be answered by the discovery of new facts.’ Nature of moral concepts and, above all, by probing more deeply and taking less for granted than others do, philosophers may be able to raise the standard of moral discussion from its present depressingly low level. Some of the best examples of debates about moral issues that are in need of the clarification and rigor that a philosopher can provide occur in the field of medical ethics. New medical procedures and changing attitudes have produced a growing number of ethical problems that some medical practitioners must face daily. Doctors, however, are uncomfortable making these decisions. Many prefer to see themselves as technicians, plumbers of the human body happy to repair a fault but not equipped to set policy. Indeed, it is true that doctors are no better qualified to make ethical decisions than most other people. Yet the American Medical Association is extremely influential in setting ethical standards. The results can be confusing and even incoherent. It is worth looking at an example, both for the intrinsic interest of the issue raised, and as an illustration of how collaboration with moral philosophers might avoid mistakes. Last year, the House of Delegates of the A.M.A. approved a policy statement condemning “the intentional termination of the life of one human being by another”—as in mercy killing—as “contrary to that for which the medical profession stands.” The same statement goes on, however, to condone “the cessation of the employment of extraordinary means to prolong the life of the body….” The implication is that these are different actions; but if a doctor turns off a machine that is keeping a patient alive, knowing that this will result in the patient's death, what is he doing if it is not “the intentional termination of the life of one human being by another”? No competent philosopher could have written this statemeat without noticing its inconsistency. Perhaps the distinction between killing a patient with an incurable, painful disease, and letting the same patient die can be drawn in some other way, but it is. clear that the House of Delegates did not formulate its view coherently. If the delegates had struggled with the problem of finding a coherent formulation, they might have begun to question whether, even if the distinction can be properly drawn, much moral weight should be given to it, The topic is one that philosophers have been discussing recently and their discussions have shown that when we get down to particular cases that embody a distinction between killing and letting die, without any other irrelevant considerations to influence our judgment, it becomes implausible to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
say that there is a great moral difference between the act and the omission. Either way, we must take responsibility for what we do. We cannot claim that we are “playing God” in one case but not in the other, since a decision not to do something is as much a decision as one to do something, and we cannot wash our hands of the responsibility for that decision. This is a conclusion that challenges many people's beliefs. We feel intuitively that it is worse to kill directly than to allow to die. But if upon reflection and after discussion of possible cases most people agree that this intuitive feeling is unreliable (and this has been my experience when discussing the issue with both students and nonphilosophers) then it seems that philosophical methods can help to resolve practical dilemmas. Granted, in the example I have chosen the issue is not settled by what I have said so far. If we decide to abandon the distinction between killing and letting die, we must still decide whether we now accept direct mercy killing, or go to the other extreme and treat the withdrawal of any life‐sustaining support from any patient as equivalent to murder. There is a lot more to be said on this topic, more than it would be appropriate to say here, since I am using the topic only as an example. Briefly, though, I think the avoidance of pointless suffering must take precedence over a rigid adherence to a prohibition on killing. If a doctor accepted the argument against attributing great moral weight to the distinction between killing and allowing to die, he would, when faced with a patient in pain, dying slowly and wanting to be put out of pain, use whatever method involved less suffering for his patient. Sometimes that would mean direct killing rather than “allowing to die.” At present, of course, this is illegal, but it might not remain illegal long if doctors were to This is only one example of a discussion to which philosophers can usefully contribute. Whatever conclusion one reaches on the particular issue, it is absurd to leave the moral philosopher out of the debate. His training makes him more than ordinarily competent in assessing arguments and detecting fallacies. He has studied the nature of moral concepts and the logic of moral argument. His views are tested by his colleagues at seminars, conferences and in the learned journals. Most important of all, he has the precious advantage of ample time to reflect on and discuss ethical issues," since this is his occupation and not a hobby that must always yield to more pressing commitments. This is why I believe that the entry of philosophers into areas of ethical concern from which they have hitherto excluded themselves is the most stimulating and potentially fruitful of all the recent developments in philosophy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most Priceless Asset,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/08/archives/most-priceless-asset-abroad-at-home.html,"WASHINGTON, July 7—When President Nixon chose Warren E. Burger to be Chief Justice of the United States, on May 21, 1969, he announced the choice at a televised White House ceremony. The nomination was the most important a President could make, he said. He explained in these words: “Respect for law in a nation is the most priceless asset a free people can have, and the Chief Justice and his Associates are the ultimate custodians and guardians of that priceless asset.” Neither the President nor anyone else could have dreamt then that the justices of the Supreme Court would one day sit in judgment on a case that could determine the fate of his Presidency. But that one sentence of his, explaining the importance of the Court, well and strangely captures in its two clauses what the case of United States v. Richard M. Nixon is about. Respect for law has all along been the issue, the connecting theme, in the series of events called Watergate. More particularly, the issue has been the duty of those who enforce the law to obey it themselves —the duty especially of the President, sworn as he is to execute the nation's laws faithfully. The public has understood that theme and followed it through all the evasions and distractions: The efforts of the President's lawyers to weave between the criminal process and impeachment, the dawdling and faintheartedness of Congress. Most Americans have recognized the danger to freedom in official defiance of the law. The case now before the Supreme Court sounds the theme of duty to law, but it naturally cannot be resolved in terms of a generality. It bristles with specific issues, among them the role of the Court itself. And here we come to the second part of Mr. Nixon's prescient 1969 sentence. There are those who object philosophically to the idea of Supreme Court Justices as “ultimate custodians” of anything. Prof. Philip B. Kurland of the University of Chicago Law School has recently denounced “the dogma of the cult of the robe” —the belief that the judiciary should be “the ultimate forum for resolution of every major political, economic or social question.” It is fair enough criticism that Americans, including judges, have often taken too grandiose a view of the judicial function. Biit the argument is stretched beyond history and common sense when used to attack the Supreme Court's role in the case of the President's tapes. In so using it Professor Kurland has strayed from the teachings of his mentor, Justice Frankfurter. ABROAD AT HOME Justice Frankfurter, and before him Justices Holmes and Brandeis, thought the Court most grievously abused its power in the first third of this century when it substituted its judgment for that of legislatures on social and economic matters — striking down a law against child labor, for example. They might have felt the same.way in the recent abortion cases, for there again the justices dealt with an issue outside their own special competence and experience. But the context of U.S. v. Nixon is nothing like that. The demand for White House tapes for use by prosecution and defense at a criminal trial raises, initially, questions of evidence and privilege and procedure—the stuff of familiar judicial business, not legislative policy decisions on matters remote from the courts. Of course there is a more profound constitutional dimension to this case. Its novel questions of executive privilege really ask the Supreme Court to define one boundary of Presidential power. That is indeed an awesome thing to put to judges, but hardly unusual for this Court. The Constitution might have created a system of totally independent governmental powers, settling disputes among themselves by contention, but from the beginningat was not so understbod. The branches exercised overlapping power. And the Supreme Court often resolved jurisdictional disputes, even ones of great political content, between the states and the Federal Government or two branches of the latter. U.S. v. Nixon does involve politics, in the grand sense of the word. There is no denying that, or the subtlety of some of its prbblems. But more deeply the case'concems law—the high place of law in our society. Justice Robert H. Jackson, himself a skeptic about judicial power, wrote that; whatever the Supreme Court's defects, Americans persisted in regarding it as “the most detached, dis‐passionate and trustworthy custodian that our system affords for the trans; lation of abstract into concrete constitutional commands.” The public is right to look to the Supreme Court still as the ultimate custodian of the priceless asset, respect for law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HIGH COURT RULES AGAINST A MARINF,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/09/archives/high-court-rules-against-a-marine-war-foes-conviction-uphelg-no.html,"WASHINGTON, July 8 (AP)—The Supreme Court upheld to day the conviction of a marine who prepared a statement critical of United States involvement in Vietnam. In a 6‐to‐3 ruling the Court said it was hound by its earlier decision in the case of Howard Levy, a former Army captain, who refused to give medical training to members of the Army's Special Forces. The ruling was one of a number of actions by the Court. It also issued a number of orders, in which it accepts or rejects cases for review. No Detroit Ruling But the Court again failed to rule on a school busing case from Detroit, one of the major cases before the Court in the 1973–74 term. That meant a decision in the Detroit case, which includes the issue of whether schoolchildren must be bused across city and suburban boundaries to achieve racial integration, will probably not come before next fall. The military dissent case decided today involved Mark Avrech, who was court‐martialed in June, 1969, on charges of violating Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which makes punishable “all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.” Captain Levy was convicted under the same article. Mr. Avrech, an enlisted man, was stationed at Marble Mountain air facility at Da Nang, South Vietnam, when he prepared a stencil criticizing United States involvement in Vietnam and calling for withdrawal of United States troops. He was convicted by a courtmartial. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against him, but the Court of Appeals ruled that the article under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. The Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court. Dissenting were Justices William 0. Douglas, Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. In other action the Court agreed to review the constitutionality of a Virginia law prohibiting the advertising of abortion services. It also left standing a lower court order allowing an Illinois man to be present when prison officials opened mail addressed to him in prison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
State Acts Against 2 Services Making Abortion Referrals,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/10/archives/state-acts-against-2-services-making-abortion-referrals.html,"Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz announced yesterday that the state had acted against two abortion referral agericies that had been accused of using “bait” advertising and of charging fees for abortion referrals, which is specifically forbidden by state law. The services are Medico Stat and Medico International Abortion Information and Counseling, Inc., both of 18 East 41st Street. Nicholas Fanczi of 3120 Buhre Avenue, the Bronx,‐ was named by the state as the president of both. The Medico telephone did not answer and no listing could be found for Mr. Fanczi. Stephen Mindell, deputy head of the Attorney General's Consumer Frauds Bureau, said Medico Stat had collected $39,070 in referral fees in the last two years. He said the fee for referral ran from $25 to $50. Medico Stat was also said to have advertised abortions for $85 but actually charged $110. A consent judgment dissolved Medico Stat as a corporation and enjoined Medico International from charging a fee for referral service. The Attorney General's announcement came as the city's Department of Consumer Affairs prepared for hearings to day into allegations of imnroper medical care and incorrect diagnoses in some abortion clinics here. In announcing its investigation last month, the Consumer Affairs Department said it had received reports that some women who were not pregnant were told that they were being given abortions.

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/11/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-zoning-saints-and-a-ploy-of-piffle-regents.html,"To the Editor: In his June 29 letter, Alan K. Scouten, regional architect of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, presents an argument that implicates “the affluent” as culprits responsible for “exclusionary one‐five‐ and twenty‐acre zoning” that is keeping people out of the “municipalities” he would like to see developed to provide “an uncrowded, substantial environment for all.” As a spokesthan for the Urban Development Corporation, Mr. Scouten neglects to mention the profits that are to be made by developers, planners and architects, Hence the emphasis upon the myth, strategically useful, that the less‐privileged citizens are doomed to huddled vastaldom by the surrounding “fiefdoms of the affluent.” I, an artist who lives in Connecticut, am far, far from affluent. As a resident of a country town where I've been for twelve years, I am surrounded by many hundreds of citizens who aren't affluent either, We have what we have because we worked hard to get it. Democratic Democrats To the Editor: Your recent editorial on the New York State Democratic Convention was strangely ambiguous. The facts do not back you up. Your theory sounds Machiavellian. On Friday, the bosses did not lose all semblance of control but rather the delegates participated in the democratic process. We, Democrats, acted not in a sterile manner but rather in a frank, open discussion. Our supposed display of Democratic disunity is not a fault. Once again in history, the Democratic party is leading the way to represent the people with a broad array of intelligent, caring candidates. The ultimate Democratic slate will be freely chosen end not an artificially contrived slate to exploit the people of New York State. JOSEPH F. SCHEHR Burdett, N. Y., June 27, 1974 Brinegar vs. Straphangers To the Editor: Transportation Secretary Claude S. Brinegar's words as presented in a July 2 news story give a graphic measure of the enormous gap between those in power and those in need: “The bills [for mass‐transit money] re far beyond what we think could be used by the cities intelligently. They are not justified by the needs.” As a Subway Sardine ‘here in New York City, all I ask is that Secretary Brinegar be placed in a Lexington Avenue local going uptown at 5:30 P.M. on a ninety‐degree weekday. If he survives an hour of it, he may modify his pat dismissal of the cities’ “needs.” ALMA DENNY New York, July 2, 1974 A Grisly Message Repeated To the Editor: Port Chester was the scene of a disastrous basement fire this morning. Why has the grisly message of the catastrophic Boston nightclub fire of 1942 been forgotten? Why are drink‐and‐dine and drinkand‐dance establishments permitted in basements? Exits are limited, at best, and because of stairs invite disaster in a panic. Moreover, when attendance is highest, some exits are almost certain to be locked to avoid loss of revenue. Why are stores — supermarkets, “dime” stores, discount houses and department stores—permitted to have fewer exits unlocked during their busiest periods, holiday weekends, Easter and Christmas shopping? Is there anyone reading this who cannot think of one or more public establishments that present fire hazards with the possibility of a disaster? It is time the welfare and safety of the public be placed ahead of profit. Let us have forward‐looking fire regulations and let us have them vigorously enforced. RUTH H. HARRIS Rye, N. Y., June 30, 1974 Our town is sanely zoned, not to force the exclusion of deserving souls but only to maintain “an uncrowded, substantial and beautiful environment for us all,” an environment which, however, is being menaced more and more by the maneuvering of urban developers. They come marching in on us like a passel of saints, a boodle of elevated bodies traveling around to befriend everyone but themselves. Recently, they came, all robed and haloed, out to New Fairfield, an adjoining town, to give us “affluent” citizens a big deal known as “Watersedge,” a lakeside development bonanza. But the missionaries found themselves with a hell of a fight on their hands. Of the many persons who opposed their scheme, a large percientage make less, much less per annum than the individual urban developers and architects. Hence, let it be said, as a matter of record, that, all the talk that identifies the privileged as persons in league against the underprivileged is talk that amounts to a ploy of piffle. CHARLES CZAP Sherman, Conn., July 1, 1974 Anti‐Abortionist's Omission To the Editor: On July 3, The Times published a most eloquent letter by the Rev. Daniel S. Hamilton, arguing the case against abortion. His conclusion, however, left me somewhat puzzled. He asserts that supporters of a “human life amendment” do not advocate double standards whereby the rich could obtain abortions while the poor would suffer. On the contrary, antiabortion activists, according to Hamilton, “advocate a single standard which would … encourage responsible parenthood and premarital chastity and assure adequate social services for the [pregnant] poor.” Conspicuously absent from Hamilton's single standard is any mention of family planning. If, in addition to encouraging responsibility, chastity and social service, he were to advocate birth control, it might be easier to take him seriously lawin S. LEVINE Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N. Y., July 3, 1974 West Side Highway Thoughts To the Editor: I urge you to reconsider your editorial position (June 20) on the outboard version of the West Side Highway. An expanded highway allowing for creation of new land by landfill, as well as projects such as the Convention Center and Battery Park City, all encourage increased motor‐vehicle traffic in New York City. Increased traffic means increased air pollution. The city's air pollution already substantially exceeds Federal clean‐air standards. What is this doing to our health? According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's report “Cost of Air Pollution Damage,” dated February, 1973, air pollution is the cause of 50 per cent of the illness and death due to bronchitis, 25 per cent of all lung cancers, 25 per cent of all lung diseases other than bronchitis and 10 per cent of the cardiovascular diseases. Isn't The Times concerned about what is doing to New Yorkers? New York City is under Federal mandate through the Clean Air Act of 1970 to implement and enforce Transportation Control Plan. The state and city administrations have shown little interest in complying with this law, but they both have, shown great interest in increasing the traffic in the city with huge projects. I urge The Times to place its considerable weight and influence in support of all efforts to clean up our air. How can you support jobs for construction workers at the cost of anintolerable health burden? Each nail a construction worker pounds into such a project is another nail in the coffin of a hapless New Yorker. BARBARA JOHNSON Asst. Prof. of Biological Sciences N.Y.C. Community College Brooklyn, June 21, 1974 To the Editor: The Times has editorially raised questions of cost, size and form regarding the reconstruction of the West Side Highway. It further asks: How will the city control increased traffic around exit areas? How will the newly created land be used? Will it create a commercial or high‐rent wall to the river or new parkland accessible to the river? Concerning the cost, it is not just a highway that needs rejuvenation; it is most of the derelict lower West Side. The “outboard” plan will add 243 acres of reclaimed land, worth about $500 million. It will create eighty waterfront park acres, crucial to the revitalization of the West Side. Regents and Rights To the Editor: The Times’ editorial recommendation of a “voluntary Regents examination system” [June 29] is a blow in defense of individual rights and should be followed by a recommendation of the right of the individual not to attend school at all if he so desires. Then The Times might go on to recommend the right to refuse to pay taxes, to ignore speed limits and to forgo vaccination. The public be damned. The main objective of Regents examinations is not the awarding of state scholarships but the standarditation of requirements for knowledge. The claim that such standards “inhibit good teachers and tend to make poor teachers worse” reveals ignorance of good teaching methods, which include objective evaluation of student accomplishment, which is the right of each individual student and of each individual taxpayer who contributes to public education. “Stimulating and wide‐ranging instruction” is an excellent goal, but it is valueless if the recipients of such instruction do not make the effort to master what has been presented in class. To this end, study is unfortunately unavoidable. What the editorial overlooks is that Regents examinations are, and have always been, voluntary to the extent that no one is forced to take them. If one desires a Regents diploma, one takes Regents examinations, thereby establishing one's mastery of a minimum of the subjects so tested. If one does not desire to establish such a claim, he does not have to take the tests. He can be graduated and attend college nonetheless. Thus the examinations are voluntary, to the same extent at least as examination for a driver's license is voluntary. The re‐evaluation and updating of curriculum areas in which Regents examinations are offered would be an end worthy of the endorsement of The Times; the use of the examinations only for the improvement of earned grades, and the elimination of statewide standards for quality education, would be destructive of education for effective community membership. RENA GARTER Bellerose, N. Y., June 29, 1974 The remaining acreage must conic under control of the city's Planning Commission, which should preclude “walls” erected between present reoidential communities and the river front. The outboard package is the least expensive in terms of total value received. There is no way financially that the city can adequately replace this highway. Even repairing would burden its budget. Part of the high cost is due to new concern for environment. The outboard alternative will make most of the new highway almost soundproof. Vehicles will be out of sight, below grade and hidden by the parkside recreational front. The ventilation system will most effectively dissipate vehicles’ exhausts. The business community is not resisting the higher outboard cost of protecting the environment; in fact, is urging it. The 90 per cent Federal, 10 per cent state funding available incorporates prepaid tax funding by the New York highway users. These contributions would be diverted to other states if not now utilized. The proposed six‐lane width is basically no greater than the present cross‐town arteries at 14th, 34th and 42d Streets. Mixed traffic cannot be safely handled on a four‐lane configuration. Those who suggest lilliputianizing this highway do not appreciate the unseen cost this would impose on the future commerce of this city. More to the point, Federal funds would not be available for such substandard road‐building. The volume of traffic entering the central business district is controllable at tunnel and bridgeheads and by city controls on parking. The new highway will not allow one more car to get into or out of Manhattan than present controllable entrances and exits allow and will reduce the pressure for new auto trips by virtue of its inclusive, parallel planned subway or bus transit way. Finally, the long‐term impact of this major improvement on future city employment opportunities should not be overlooked. The New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, after thorough study, urges the outboard plan as the all‐round best buy. THOMAS N. STAINBACK President, New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry New York, July 5, 1974 To the Editor: Whin The Times calls for a “virtual rebuilding of the city's West Side” [editorial June 20], I worry that any such plan could easily result in the same kind of characterlessness rapidly overtaking the city's East Side. The West Side has become an increasingly refreshing sight for these tired‐ofthe‐East‐Side‐monotony eyes. Isn't restoration really what's needed? I suggest we need a kind of Landmarks Preservation Commission that would preserve not only very distinguished architecture and tiny enclaves but entire neighborhoods and areas that have some gentleness, humanity and history. Winston Churchill said, “We shape, our environments and then our environments shape us.” Think seriously on that.

Abuses at Abortion Clinics Charged at a City Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/11/archives/abuses-at-abortion-clinics-charged-at-a-city-hearing.html,"Sworn statements by women patients, substantiated investigators who pretended to believe themselves pregnant, have uncovered “illegal, abusive or medically dangerous” practices here by some abortion clinics and supposedly not‐for‐profit referral services, a Department of Consumer Affairs hearing was told yesterday. In one case, a pregnancy test was pronounced positive after urine sample from a male was submitted. Clinics performed menstrual extraction or later abortion procedures on menopausal or other nonpregnant women in the absence of a positive test—or of any test at all. Commissioner Elinor Guggenheimer said that the investigation, conducted with the cooperation of the Board of Health, began with a check of possible deception in advertisements that “failed to disclose the full range of prices for an abortion or extra charges for anesthetics or other drugs.” But she said the situation was found to be “a lot more serious.” Mrs. Guggenheimer said: “An investigator who called to check on the price of a pregnancy test was told that none was necessary. ‘Stop hoping that it's something else,’ she was told. ‘Of course you're pregnant—just come down here with $150.” Several of the affidavits from women patients and the findlings of Consumer Affairs inIvestigators concerned the Cent2ral Women's Clinic, 333 East 9th Street, which advertises regularly in some publications. Some Examples One woman told the department that for $160 Dr. Eliezer Shkolnik, who operates the clinic, had given her an abortion and fitted her with an intrauterine device on March 6. When she was not feeling well two and a half months later, she said, Dr. Shkolnik told her she was about seven or eight weeks into a new pregnancy. Examination by another doctor revealed that the abortion had been incomplete and that she was then three and a half months pregnant. Ellen Odoner, a Consumer Affairs investigator, told the hearing that for a “free” pregnancy test advertised by the clinic she had substituted a urine sample from a male lawyer for the department and had been told the test was positive. Women who said they had had positive pregnancy test reports from Controlled Parenthood, 200 West 72d Street—which hands out leaflets on the city's streets—and from Dr. Ata Mehrtash, 64 University Place, said that, instead of proceeding with the scheduled abortions, they had had from one to three additional tests that proved negative. Consumer Affairs investigators cited the Medical Foundation for Women, also at 64 University Place, and Advice for Women, 301 39th Street, Brooklyn, as examples of supposedly “independent” or not‐for‐profit referral services — commercial referral‐services are illegal where women are given the name of only one doctor or clinic. The only employe of the “foundation” told the department that Dr. Mehrtash “donates office space” to it. Advice for Women shares the same building and phone operator with OBGYN Associates clinic, although the latter lists its address as 999 Third Avenue, Brooklyn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/12/archives/new-jersey-briefs-millstone-mayor-seized-on-drug-count.html,"Mayor Gail Anglada of Millstone, and her husband, Elgin, were arrested Wednesday by Somerset County detectives on drug charges after the police found marijuana the living room and in a bedroom and a marijuana plant growing outside the house. Mrs. Anglada, an instructor Rutgers University, and her husband, a‐Rutgers professor, were arraigned on charges of possession of more than 25 grams of marijuana and were released in their own recognizance. The offense is a high misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $15,000 fine. County Prosecutor Stephen Champi said the couple came under suspicion “quite by accident” last Tuesday when two county investigators, wanting to examine property‐tax records, found the Municipal Building closed and went to the Mayor's home. There, Mr. Champi said, the conversation turned to marijuana use in the borough and some of the couple's comments made the detectives suspicious. The Mayor was elected in 1972 to fill an unexpired term and has announced her candidacy for reelection in November. 3 Somerset Company Aides Indicted The president and two other officers of Power‐Flow, Inc., a Somerset County construction company, have been indicted on charges of overestimating the value of their business to defraud a Newark bank and the State of New Jersey. The two indictments were handed up by a Union County grand jury against Edward L. Krogstad, 57 years old, of Annandale, the president of the company, and Thomas J. Siggia of Somerset and Joseph S. Veters of Fanwood, the vice president and accountant, respectively. The indictments charged that the value was inflated by $200,000 to get a $1.5‐million contract from the State Department of Education and to get a loan from the Fidelity Union Trust Company of Newark. Need for 8 Abortion Clinics Seen State health oficials announced yesterday that New Jersey would need eight abortion clinics to handle an anticipated demand for more than 41,000 abortions next year. The State Comprehensive Health Planning Agency, an advisory arm of the Health Department, based the projected need on the number of legal abortions performed in New York City in a 12‐month period ended in June, 1971, when the operations were first sanctioned by law there. A Health Department spokesman said he expected that the department would act within the next 90 days approve abortion regulations to permit the private abortion clinics to open. The state has given preliminary approval to seven clinics and is expected, in light of yesterday's report, to permit an eighth facility to open. Atlantic City Firemen Disciplined Four Atlantic City firemen were suspended for five days and fined five days’ pay on charges ranging from smoking marijuana at their firehouse to stealing alcohol from the scene of a fire. The firemen were identified Greg Palmisano and Thomas Par, charged with larceny alcohol from the Unicorn Bar; Dan Riley, charged with possession of marijuana, and Lawrence Skey, charged with consuming alcohol and smoking marijuana in a firehouse. The suspensions and fines were handed down by a departmental disciplinary board. Three other city firemen, including a fire captain, were suspended Wednesday after they were indicted by a county grand jury on similar charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet Francis Nicholas Zullo, the former Mayor of Norwalk, has been pretty much the forgotten man in his long campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Governor of Connecticut. “I know I am a long shot,” he said last February when he formally announced his candidacy. By then, he had been traveling around the state for a year, explaining his stand to party workers, pleading with the likely convention delegates to keep their options open.

Killian of Hartford, defeated in a primary election for delegates in his home town on May 23, has joined Mrs. Grasso's tickets as the candidate for Lieutenant Governor. Homer Babbidge of New Haven, a former president of the University of Connecticut, gave up the campaign when he ran out of money last March and now is working in Mrs. Grasso's camp. Mr. Zullo aimed from the beginning not for a majority at the convention but for 243 of the 1,213 delegate votes— to give him the 20 per cent he needs to challenge the choice in a statewide primary election in September. “We'll be 1 to 1 then,” he said. “We'll get the same exposure. I'm taking my story and my message to the registered Democrats of this state and after that to all the people of this state.” Faint Promises Noted The things Democrats say to him now are often disappointing. But, in a way, when Mr. Zullo thinks beyond the convention to the primary, the same discouraging remarks have a faint ring of promise. “I'd like to give you my vote,” a delegate in Stratford said to Mr. Zullo the other night in a corner of the sweltering room where he had talked to the Democratic town committee. “You're the only one who discusses the issues. “But you know how it is,” the delegate continued, lowering his voice almost to a whisper. “We're committed to Ella.” “Stay loose,” the candidate replied, wiping his forehead and arching his big eyebrows. “I know it's tough, but stay loose. It's all I ask.” Mr. Zullo thinks he has about half the votes he needs to win the right to a primary. There are only about 300 votes still uncommitted at the convention. Most of his endorsements have come from the fringes of party power, or from beyond it. Bowles Endorses Zullo Chester Bowles, the former Governor and Congressman who served in President John F. F. Kennedy's Administrationand Kennedy's Administration and as Ambassador to India, endorsed Mr. Zullo as “an innovative, courageous and highly effective leader.” It was not a vote, but it counted, especially among the party's liberals. The Caucus of Connecticut Democrats, a liberal group in the party, was unable in two ballots, because of lingering support for Mr. Zullo, to produce the 60 per cent majority needed to endorse Mrs. Grasso. Mr. Zullo's father lost a variety shop in the Depression, got pneumonia working with a lumbering crew in New Hampshire and then died when Frank Zullo was 4 years old. His mother, also an immigrant from Italy, took a job at a sewingmachine factory in South Norwalk until her three children had finished school. Frank Zullo, the youngest, helped pay his way through Fordham Law School by playing the trumpet and working weekend engagements with makeshift bands. He was in politics soon after law school, serving as prosecutor of the Norwalk City Court and then minority leader on the Norwalk Common Council. City's Youngest Mayor In 1965 he was elected Mayor — at 33, the youngest in the city's history. He started a $30‐million redevelopment program in the center of town. He got a high school, two elementary schools and housing for the elderly built. He won approval of a city subsidy for the bus services. Then, after three terms, he decided to retire from politics. “Having done that, I found I missed it,” he said. “So here I am, back in up to my ears.” He seems to cover more ground than the other candidatees, most of it in an unwashed blue 1967 Cadillac, with clean shirts hanging on one side in the back, the rumpled ones and the campaign literature strewn across the other. He offers his views on anything asked of him, most of them the predictable views of a party liberal. He would enforce some halfignored state laws for the protection of consumers and give bargaining rights to state employes. He would not seek to change the Supreme Court's liberal ruling on abortion, regarding abortion as a matter of conscience. He contends that the Democratic party makes it difficult for new people to break into any kind of prominence. He expects that the Watergate experience will make voters suspicious and resentful of a ticket that appears to have been put together by a few party leaders rather than by some more democratic process, He thinks the party would be wise to take notice. “There's a different drum beating out there,” Mr. Zullo said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Region In Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/14/archives/the-region-abortions-unlimited-an-integration-plan-with-ambition.html,"The proposals that have been offered to integrate a Coney Island junior high school go considerably beyond the school itself—they include ideas for reversing neighborhood housing patterns. The recommendations by the “special master” appointed by Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein for integrating Mark Twain Junior High School are aimed at stabilizing a “changing neighborhood,” which in recent years has had a heavy influx of blacks and Puerto Ricans. The report recommended that Mark Twain bt turned into a “magnet school,” offering a range of courses that would drew middle‐class white students frpm other areas in the school district. Other key proposals concerned ha:using: One suggested that many of the 1,000 public‐housing units scheduled to be rented go to middle‐income fairdlies at $220 monthly for a threebedroom apartment; another that 1,000 dilapidated units be replaced by new buildings, some of which would be reserved for displaced families. One problem with the proposals concerns the selection process that will reserve apartments for middleincome families, though poorer families will presumably also seek the ???‐rent units. Equally sensitive is dm problem of relocation if many fainilies choose to stay in the neighborhood, but in the new, replacement housing. Judge Weinstein may modify the pnbosals on the basis of criticism voiced at public hearings last week. A consultant for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People attacked as “racist” a feature recommending voluntary enrollment of white students and mandatory assignment of minority children. The special master denied the charge of racism. One More Futile Bottle Bill A bill before the New York City Cojnicil that would ban cans and noreturn bottles and replace them with more environmentally acceptable returnable bottle has only a small chance of passing, although many Council members say they believe in it. The bat will probably be, lobbied to death. The steel and aluminum industry, can and bottle makers and their unions haie united in attacking all such legislative proposals that would curtail no return container manufacturing. Their past successful efforts have stymied “bottle bills” across the country. The beverage lobbyists’ strongest argunuiht here is that “returnables” would min their business, force them to leaie town, create more unemployme and hurt the city's economy they also say that returnable bottles woilld make beer and soft drinks more expensive because of greater manufacturing and distribution costs. Supporters of bottle bills say re‐used bottles save money in the long run because they are recycled. They also contend that where returnable systems are being tried, such as in Oregon and Vermont, beverage costs have risen becituse of the increased cost of raw materials and, more important, because bottlers have raised prices arbitrarily tot support their own premise. ‘The city's first bottle bill was rejected in 1971. In 1972, similar legislation was introduced for the state and it died. In May a bottle bill was killed in. Connecticut. In New Jersey a similar bill is in an Assembly committee, though chance of passage is slim. Abortions Unlimited A three‐month official investigation of abortion clinics in New York City has uncovered allegedly “illegal, abusiie or medically dangerous” practices. In one case, an investigator for the Department of Consumer Affairs said she was diagnosed as pregnant by clinic although the urine sample she submitted was from a man. In another, an investigator who asked the price of a pregnancy test was told that no test was necessary. Elinor Guggenheimer, Consumer Affairs Commissioner, said at a public hearing last week that this investigator was advised: “Stop hoping that it's scijnething else. Of course you're pregnant—just come down with $150.” Mrs. Guggenheimer said the investigation, which her department has ben conducting in cooperation with the Board of Health, began with an examination of advertisements that “failed to disclose the full range of prices for an abortion.” But a situation “a lot more serious” was found, she said. The public hearing was held, Mrs. Guggenheimer said, “to give people an opportunity to provide information.” It was noted at the hearing that the improper practices described concerned only a small percentage of the city's abortions, which totaled 172,985 last year. The Sludge Oozes Closer To Long Island Sewage sludge that metropolitan area waste‐treatment plants have been dumping into the Atlantic Ocean for more than 40 years is coming closer than ever to beaches on Long Island's South Shore, one of the region's prime vacation areas. Last week, Dr. William H. Harris, a Brooklyn College marine scientist who has been studying the effects of sludge dumping off the South Shore, discovered isolated pockets a quarter mile off Atlantic Beach. Last December, he had found sludge no nearer than a half‐mile from shore, hence, the black, oozy substance appears to be moving closer and closer. Further, Dr. Harris said, sludge from the main dumping ground, ten miles offshore, has spread to within three miles of the beach. The scientist said that swimming waters would be cos taminated by the sludge by the summer of 1976. The following summer, he added, sludge would be on the beaches. Sludge that contains disease‐carrying micro‐organisms, including those causing hepatitis and encephalitis, is a potential threat to swimmers. Further, toxic heavy metals in sludge that enter the food chains through clams and fish can also cause serious illness in humans. No one knows yet whether the sludge pockets off the South Shore have a dangerous viral content or have endangered seafood. Challenging Dr. Harris, officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency said they have found no evidence that sludge is threatening the beaches. A Smoking Law, Just Barely Legislation intended to protect nonsmokers from being “smoked out” in elevators has been passed by the New York City Council. But even the bill's supporters know it won't be very effective because enforcement will be difficult. The bill, if signed by Mayor Beanie, would supersede a similarly quixotic regulation of the city Health Department. City Inspectors would make spot checks and signs would be posted in lobbies and elevators. Officials are hoping that public censure will provoke compliance, because thorough inspection of tens of thousands of eleVetor buildings is scarcely possible. Though maximum penalties under the law are 15 days in prison and $50 fines, smokers in elevators are unlikely to be deterred. It's been illegal to smoke in the subways for years, but some riders regularly light up. 1 Man's Choice The decision by Howard J. Samuels, front‐runner in the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor, to endorse Mario M. Cuomo as his running mate has been sharply criticized by feminists and reform Democrats and has apparently cost Mr. Samuels some support. Fourteen women, most of them connected with feminist organizations, said they would leave the Samuels campaign because he did not back their candidate for Lieutenant Governor, State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, or remain neutral. Mr. Samuels, the Democratic State Committee's designee for Governor, had been under pressure to support Mr. Cuomo because he too Is a committee designee.

Abortion‐Aid Curb Faces Long Tie‐up,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/14/archives/abortionaid-curb-faces-long-tieup.html,"TRENTON—The chairman of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee said last week that it would be “very difficult” to get a controversial measure barring Medicaid payments for abortions to the Assembly flopr. The bill was approved by the Senate on June 17, and at a news conference two days later, Governor Byrne said he would sign the measure into law if it won final approval in the Assembly. However, Assemblyman Eldridge Hawkins, an Essex County Democrat and the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he doubted whether the bill would be considered by the committee until this fall, at the earliest. And Mr. Hawkins, an outspoken opponent of the measure, said he doubted whether there were enough votes in his committee to get it released for a vote. The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Senator Joseph P. Merlino, a Mercer County Democrat, after State Attorney General George K. Kugler Jr. ruled last November that the Department of Institutions and Agencies was required under the Federal Medicaid law to pay for abortions “whenever they were medically indicated.” Mr. Kugler's ruling followed a United States Supreme Court decision last year that a state court not interfere with a woman's clt► cision to have an abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Despite the High Court's ruling, a number of states have attempted to restrict abortions and in virtually every case the Federal courts have struck down such restrictions. For example, a Federa court reversed a similar decision in Connecticut to bar Medicaid payments for abortions. When he said he would sign the Merlino measure, Governor Byrne, a Roman Catholic with a strong moral and religious aversion to aborlion, said that “some queslions were better left to the courts to decide.” His decision to support the Merlino measure follows simfilar positions taken by his two predecessors, Richard J. Hughes, a Democrat, and William T. Cahill, a Republican, both also Roman Catholics governing a state where the majority of the voters are Catholics, too. There is one indication, however, that the Governor might not be unhappy if he never got the Merlino bill to sign. That is the decision by Assembly Speaker S. Howard Woodson, a Mercer County Democrat and a black Baptist minister here, to assign the bill to Mr. Hawkins's committee rather than to the Committee on Institutions, Health and Welfare. The latter committee recently released a measure, also approved by the Senate, that would allow hospitals the discretion not to perform abortions if they violated moral or religious principles. However, Mr. Hawkins contends that such discretionary power is already accorded to religiously affiliated hospitals and physicians who oppose abortions on moral grounds. As a result, Mr. Hawkins intends to push for Assembly consideration of a substitute measure that would apply only to hospitals and healthcare facilities with religious ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An Original All‐Island Musical Opens in Hauppauge,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/14/archives/an-original-allisland-musical-opens-in-hauppauge-impressed-with.html,"HAUPPAUGE — When it comes to Broadway, this mid ‐ Suffolk community is certainly “off” geographically. The Long Island Expressway is not exactly 42d Street. Yet, last night, Hauppauge was the scene of the world premiere of “Forever Saturday,” an original musical composed by a five‐time Academy Award winner, written by a veteran teleplay scriptwriter and performed by a spirited group of would‐he professionals who hope that their debut in a catering hall here will be just the first stop in a transcontinental tour that will eventually end up on Broadway. “It was written for Broadway,” said Mark E. Taylor, the librettist‐producer. “But then I thought, it's about a suburban high school, so why not open in the suburbs and get the kinks out on tour, in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. Besides, so much of the real theater in this country today isn't happening on Broadway necessarily, but in places like this.” In the works for more than two years, this first attempt at a book‐musical by Mr. Taylor, whose theatrical career began 27 years ago in the chorus of the first edition of “West Side Story” and most recently has centered on television, where he has written for Doris Day and “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” is an outgrowth of work the Lake Grove resident has done in local schools. Impressed With Youths “I was asked to conduct improvisational workshops and give some lectures at high schools in the Smithtown area,” he said. “And I got to know the kids and was really impressed. Adults have the wrong opinion of them; the had apple syndrome, you know. “Actually, they're really something else. The intelligence I've seen makes me feel dumb compared to them. They're so free and intelligent. I wanted to show what they are like, do their story.” Proximity, Mr. Taylor said, bred a play about life in a “typical” suburban high school that “is so honest, it's way‐out.” Dope, lesbianism, Jesus freaks, jocks, teen‐age pregnancy, abortion, Women's lib and teachers’ strikes — along with a reverse “Abie's Irish Rose” romance — figure prominently in what the author hopes will be considered a “contemporary rock opera,” “another ‘West Side Story',” according to most of the people connected with it. Honest or not, apparently school officials agreed with Mr. Taylor on the play's “way‐out” qualities. Despite an umbrella offered by the Smithtown Arts Council, which was to receive a percentage of the profits, “Forever Saturday” found the stages in area school auditoriums closed to it. Only a last‐minute deal with the Colonie Hill complex here for its 800 ‐ seat Empire State Room kept Mr. Taylor from transferring the production to Connecticut. If it is about the “local” scene, the play is also a product of the same milieu. Save for several of the 22 union musicians who were imported from as far away as the City Center Opera Company orchestra, the more than 50 people involved are from Long Island. Werner Janssen, the composer, whose Academy Awards include the scores for “The African Queen” and “Casablanca,” is a neighbor and friend of Mr. Taylor's. Bruce Lockerie, who collaborated with Michael Dyne, another television playwright on the lyrics, teaches at the Stony Brook School. Robert 0.

U.S. COURT ANNULS AN ABORTION CURB,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/15/archives/us-court-annuls-an-abortion-curb-new-orleans-clinic-may-be-allowed.html,"NEW ORLEANS, July 14 —A decision by a three‐judge Federal panel has knocked down Louisiana's anti‐abortion statute and will apparently block efforts by the state to close its only abortion clinic, which opened July 3. In August, 1970, the same panel upheld the statute, which provides for the disbarring of any doctor who performs an abortion in this heavily Roman Catholic Gulf state except to save the life of the expectant woman. But as the result of an appeal by I. I. Rosen, the doctor who challenged the state law after he was called before the ‐State Board of Medical Examiners for performing the operation, the United States Supreme Court in May, 1973, ordered the judges to reconsider their decision in light of an earlier ruling by the high court that held that only the pregnant woman and her doctor should decide on an abortion. Although the landmark decision in January, 1973, in effect nullified virtually every antiabortion law in the nation, a woman who sought the operation in Louisiana less than a month later was prohibited from having one on the ground that it violated state law. 10 Abortions a Day The Delta Women's Clinic, the state's first abortion facility, opened in a building on St. Charles Avenue, one of the city's more elegant thoroughfares. Personnel at the clinic have said that as many as 10 abortions are performed there each day. Two days after the opening, the Louisiana Legislature passed a resolution urginn') the State Attorney General to enforce the state civil and criminal laws against abortions, which provides for prison sentences for doctors found guilty of performing the operation. Last Tuesday the Attorney General, William Guste Jr., filed a pe.ition in the state civil district court asking for an injunction to stop operations at the clinic, saying: “I think it's abominable that they have opened the clinic in violation of the law as it stands on the books of Louisiana.” ‘Wrong Decision’ Mr. Guste, who is Catholic, said he thought the Supreme Court's ruling was “a wrong decision and should be reversed because basically what it says is that the right to privacy is more important than the right to life.” Mr. Guste's decision to follow the Legislature's recommendation to enforce the state prohibition on abortions seemed to represent a change from the position he took in a letter March 12, 1973, to state law enforcement officials. This let‐ter declared that in his opinion and despite his strong personal objections to abortions, “the [state] law was unconstitutional and unenforcible.” Last Wednesday Judge Lansing Mitchell of the Civil District Court here issued a temporary restraining order halting operations at the clinic. However, he withdrew the order after it was stayed on Thursday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Atlanta, A hearing before Judge Mitchell is scheduled Friday. Mr. Guste said he would defend Louisiana's anti‐abortion statutes “all the way to the Supreme Court,” and his defiance of the Court's decision seems aimed at forcing a hearing before the high court. An attorney for the clinic, which is owned by Melvin Soli, a Philadelphia lawyer who has interests in three other abortion clinics in Philadelphia, Miami and Cleveland, accused the state of maintaining laws that were opposed to Federal laws when the state did not agree with the Federal laws. “Louisiana still has miscegenation and other racial laws on its books that have been illegal for years,” the attorney said. Meanwhile, anti‐abortion forces here continued to come to the support of the Attorney General while the clinic's operators said they would try to keep it open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BELLAMY SEEKING TO SWAY VOTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/18/archives/bellamy-seeking-to-sway-voters-displaced-state-senator-out-to.html,"On paper, at ‘least, State Senator Carol Bellamy's brief political career should have ended os May 29 when the Republican‐led Legislature dismembered her Brooklyn district and scattered its remains among five others. And on paper, at least, Senator Paul P. E. Bookson's chance for re‐election to his sixth term, already excellent, was virtually assured when the Legislature kept the Lower East Side part of his district intact and added 2,000 Hasidic Jews, strong supporters of the Orthodox Jewish Senator, to his district's Brooklyn half. But eight weeks later, things do not look quite so simple, Senator Bellamy has challenged Senator Bookson in the Democratic primary, and she appears to have at least a fair chance of capturing his seat in a campaign that has drawn the interest of women and reform Democrats from far outside the district. Breakdown of Representation The redrawn 25th Senate District includes both Senator Bellamy's apartment on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights and Chatham Green, the cooperative apartment near City Hall where Senator Bookson lives with his wife and three daughters. About a third of the area is in Senator Bellamy's present district; Stnator Bookson now represents the remaining two‐thirds. After the reapportionment, done to comply with a Federal order to increase minority representation, Senator Bellamy decided almost immediately that she would run again somewhere. She chose Senator Bookson's district, she said the other day in her unfurnished headquarters at Allen and Grand Streets, “because I had, no place else to run.” A former Wall Street lawyer and a Peace Corps volunteer before that, Carol Bellamy is one of three women in the Senate and, at age 32, one of the state's youngest legislators. Two years ago, in her! first try for elective office, she beat Senator William Giordano in a primary by 323 votes and went on to win the general election by 28,000. Combing Streets for Voters For weeks now, she has been shaking hands at subway stops every morning and combing the deserted summer streets for voters, aided by volunteers including members of the New York State Women's Political Caucus. Ross Graham, coordinator of the caucus, is an unpaid consultant. By contrast, Senator Bookson a 41 ‘z year ‐old lawyer with luxuriant, prematurety. white hair, has done little campaigning so far. His roots on the lower East Side, he says, go back three generations, when his grandfather arrived there from Russia to found this country's first Hebrew bookstore, and he will rely on friend and family rather than “outside hucksters, con men and gypsies” to do his campaigning. A third candidate, Ernesto Martinez, said in an interview that he had entered the race to defeat Senator Bookson and would withdraw if he became convinced that his candidacy would hurt Senator Bellamy, whose record he described as “unquestionably excellent.” Senator Bellamy is not well known on the Manhattan side of the district, where some vot‐11 ers indicated to her workers that they thought she was black. In fact, she is one of the few WASPs in a white polyglot district where the large!, Jewish vote — about 30 per cent — has formed the base of !Senator Bookson's support. But she hopes that her intensive campaigning will make inroads in areas she says her opponent has taken for granted, Senator Bookson has the nominal support of the district's regular Democratic clubs, as Senator Bellamy does of the reform clubs. But his relations with the regular organization, never especially warm, cooled even further this spring when he was the only city Democrat to break the Senate's united front and vote against the New York City sales tax. He also angered women by voting for the bill that placed new restrictions on the state's liberal abortion law. ‘Empathy With Communities’ Senator Bookson, who describes hi?hseif as a “consistently inconsistent independent” and seems to know most of his East Side constituents by name, says his “empathy with communities,” including his longtime support of parochial school aid, will win support in the new ethnic areas of his district. “Reformers will talk about who's stopped eating lettuce, but they don't pass bills,” he said. One of the imponderables is how Senator Bellamy's sex will affect the race. Either of two truisms — that this is a good year for women, or that white ethnic voters are slower than others to accept women in positions of power — could apply. Senator Bellamy projects an image of fresh‐scrubbed wholesomeness that some voters apparently find hard to reconcile with their idea of a State Senator. “How nice, your husband's ;running for the Senate,” they ;tell her. “I keep saying, ‘That's me. I'm a State Senator, I real;11y am,'” she said. “It's not that people are stupid, they just assume it can't be me. Well, the assumptions of the past just may not apply this year.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTIONS BACKED BY APPEALS COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/18/archives/abortions-backed-by-appeals-court.html,"BOSTON, July 17 (AP) — The United States Court of Appeals’ for the First Circuit has upheld a ruling affirming women's rights to have elective abortions in public hospital in the first three months of pregnancy. Hospital employes and staff members, however, may indivirually refuse to help administer abortions iif they personally object to doing so. The ruling affects Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Puerto Rico. It affirms a 1973 permanent injunction by Chief United States District Judge Andrew A.

CONGRESS PASSE LEGAL D TO POOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/19/archives/congress-passes-legal-aid-to-poor-bill-to-create-a-permanent-system.html,"WASHINGTON, July 18—Overriding conservative opposition, the Senate gave final Congressional approval today to legislation that would create a permanent system of Federal legal assistance for the poor. The Measure was sent to the White House: Sponsors of the program, who won a 77‐to‐19 vote, maintained that President Nixon was committed to signing the bill in its final form, after the deletion this week of one controversial provision by both houses of Congress. The stricken provision would have authorized the new Legal Services Corporation to make contracts or award grants to “back‐up centers” at a dozen law schools around the country, to finance research in support of lawsuits on behalf of the poor as a class. Senate opponents of the1 measure insisted today that it would still be possible for the corporation to conduct the same sort of legal research by putting law school professors and students directly on its payroll, rather than by funding the centers. Before final passage, the Senate defeated; 61 to 4, an amendment by Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina, that would have barred legal research by the corporation itsel and prohibited grants to law firms engaged in any public interest practice. If President Nixon approves the legislation, the legal sereices program, until now a tunetion of the Office of Economic Opportunity will be operated by a new corporation with board of 11 directors, all appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. Backers of the program, ineluding the American Bar Association, had been fearful that it would vanish with the Congressional dismantling of O.E.O. that is now in progress. Some supporters of the broad concept of legal services believe, however, that the measure passed by the Senate today is so full of restrictive compromises that it would limit lawyers working’ for the poor to attacking in the courts surface symptoms rather than basic causes of poverty. “This is better than no bill at all, but only barely,” one legal services lobbyist; said. Senator Rehns said during debate‐that the back‐up centers had generated “a wholesale attack on the very structure of our social and legal system” that the corporation would continue if it were allowed to.conduct legal research. The centers, he declared, had helped “organize strategy” leading to the Supreme Court decision authorizing all but endof‐term abortions, had urged the Court to integrate black city schools systems with these of white suburbs and had defended racial quotas in admissions to professional schools. “There is nd reason why the taxpayers would be’ forced against their’ will to support activity that is opposed to the prevailing social system,” Senafor Helms argued. Senator Jacob K. Davits, Republican of New York and supporter of the compromise, said that, the Legal Services Corporation could not provide adequate counsel without some research capacity. Senator Robert Taft. Jr., Republican of Ohio, and other,sponsor, called, it “pure baloney” to, predict that the corporation would undertake projects, with which the Nixon Administration was in strong disagreement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Board of Supervisors has scrapped six laws that they said were no longer enforced, including one that forbids people to wear clothes of the opposite sex with intent to deceive. The board also struck down a law against advertising abortions, lewd literature and cures for venereal disease.

"Italian Civil‐Rights Leader Uses, Hunger Strike to Spur Causes",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/22/archives/italian-civilrights-leader-uses-hunger-strike-to-spur-causes.html,"ROME, JULY 21—The leader of a small civil‐rights group whose hunger strike four years ago helped bring a debate on divorce to the Italian Parliament, is using the same strategy these days to persuade the assembly to consider several other important civil‐rights issues. Two months after victory in a referendum confirming divorce in Italy, Marco Pannella suspended a 78‐day‐old fast yesterday—but only until Tuesday—to give Parliament time to commit itself to legal abortion and other reforms. “We are not claiming that anyone must agree with us,” said the 44‐year‐old Mr. Pannella, who heads the small but influential Radical party, at heavily attended press conference yesterday. “We are merely asking for the chance to present our case.” party, which is not represented in Parliament, is involved in a drive to call political attention to issues also embraced by the Women's Liberation Movement, Mr. Pannella—whose daily nourishment until yesterday was limited to three cups of coffee and vitamins—has lost 60 pounds since he began his hunger strike to force Parliameat to take a stand on some ‘thorny issues that have been discreetly shelved, sometimes for years, by politicians preferring to deal with less controversial subjects. One of Mr. Pannella's present objectives is getting controversial figures television time on the state‐controlled Italian network. Others include voting rights for 18‐year‐olds, revision of Italy's archaic family code, and legalized abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Single Parents and Their Adopted Children Gather for a Picnic,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/22/archives/single-parents-and-their-adopted-children-gather-for-a-picnic.html,"A rather unusual family picnic was held at the foot of Dog Hill in Central Park yesterday. Oh, there were the usual Frisbees, fried chicken and fresh fruit. It's just that none of the parents were married, or ever have been. And their children didn't resemble them at all. Most of the parents, with one exception, were white. And their children were either black or racially mixed, There is an explanation, of course. The parents are members of a group called Single Adoptive Parents, formed this spring for unmarried persons who have somehow managed, despite all of the agency, social and legal hurdles, to adopt children. Yesterday, the parents beamed with parental pride as their children raced around the park together, climbed trees, tossed Frisbees to one another and watched the actors at the nearby Off‐Center Theatre, “The kids are more comfortable here than anywhere else,” said Kathy Kelleher, 32 years old, of Yonkers, N. Y., the group's president. “Here, they don't have to hear questions like ‘Who's your mother?’ or ‘Where's your father?’ or ‘How come you're a different color?’ “ Monthly Meetings Held Miss Kelleher, a social worker at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, is the mother of a 6½‐year‐old black boy named Sean, whom she adopted in 1972 through the Catholic Home Bureau. She said the Single Adoptive Parents group holds monthly meetings not only so the kids can mingle with each other, but also so the parents can have a forum to talk over their mutual problems. “It's still very difficult for society to accept single adoptive parents,” she said, as she sat on a blanket while Sean romped with the other children, “For example, when I want to leave work early so I can meet Sean's day camp bus, there's always some rigidity about it, whereas a natural parent wouldn't get the same hassle. It's almost like I'm an out‐of‐wedlock mother.” Even though single people have been adopting children in New York since 1968, the practice has never really caught on. (“When you're single, you're at the bottom of everybody's list,” one parent at the picnic said.) Child welfare and adoption agency officials estimate that there are perhaps fewer than 50 single adoptive parents in the New York area. Of these, about 20 belong to the Single Adoptive Parents, which is an affiliate or the Council on Adoptable Children, at 61 Gramercy Park. The main reason there have not been more adoptions by unmarried persons is that the agencies are, still reluctant to place, a child in a home where both a father and a mother are not presen. The increasing shortage of adoptable children, due mainly to legalized abortion and the widespread use of birth control, has also resulted in fewer adoptions by unmarried persons, as married couples get priority for the few available children. And the recent statements by the powerful National Association of Black Social Workers that black children should be placed with black adoptive families has also cut down on the number of potential single parent adoptions. (Most single adoptive parents are white, while the children available to them are generally black or of mixed race.) “Neal, don't eat fruit! Wait until you've put some other food into your stomach,” screamed Roger Gatke, a 38‐year‐old school teacher from Jamaica, Queens, who was the only single parent at the picnic to have adopted twp children. They are Thomas, 11, and Neal, 9, both of whom had black fathers and white mothers. “The second child was easier to get than the first,” Mr. Gatke said, anticipating the question. “As Sister Mary Mercedes at the Angel Guardian Home told me, ‘You proved you could do it with the first.’ “ (Mr. Gatke, a Roman Catholic, adopted his first son through the city's adoption agency, the Bureau of Child Welfare's Division of Adoption Services, and his second through the. Angel Guardian Home.) Jealousy Develops He said that although Thomas had originally asked him for a brother, some jealousy had developed between the two. “Tommy doesn't like the fact that Neal takes a lot of my time,” Mr. Gatke said. “He goes through 101 moods now that Neal is here. He'll say to Neal, ‘I'm lighter than you.’ And then Neal says, ‘Yeah, but I've got the better hair.'” Three single people (two women, one man) were at the picnic because they were thinking about adopting a child. One of them, Edna Engesser of the Bronx, junior high school teacher, said: I see nothing wrong with a child growing up with only one parent. Thousands of them do. In my building in the Bronx, five women are bringing up children without ‘a husband, and their kids are the best adjusted kids I've ever seen.” The picnic included a birthday cake for Wayne Alexander Green, 8 years old, the son of James Elton Green of Manhattan, a 34‐year‐old manufacturer of photographic products. Wayne came to Mr. Green's East 23d Street apartment last Thursday from the city's adoption agency. “I decided to adopt a child when I was in the Army in Germany,” said Mr. Green, who, like his son, is black. “Nearby was an orphanage, and I organized a group of soldiers so those kids could have gifts and Christmas trees at Christmas. I said to myself, ‘I can't do anything for all of them, but one day I'm going to take one or two of them. “ Not all of the children of the Single Adoptive Parents were obtained through adop tion agencies. One member, an assistant school principal, adopted her two children through a lawyer in a pro cedure that is known as private adoption, or “the gray market.” Another woman, who is the public relations director of a publishing company, went to Korea for her two children. And a third member, a child psychiatrist, went with her ex‐husband to Bogota, where they posed as a married couple in order to get a child. Almost all of the parents at the picnic said that either their parents, relatives or friends had objected to their decision to adopt a child, mainly because the child was of a different race. “I haven't seen my mother since the day I adopted Tommy,” Mr. Gatke said, a bit bitterly. “She was worried about what her friends might say because he is black. And then, of course, I did not follow the norm. My mother is married for the third time and my father for the fourth, but outside of marriage, you're not supposed to have children, right?” The parents also generally agreed that it is nice to have a member of the opposite sex around the house, mainly for the good of the child. “You do appreciate someone around,” said Deborah Shapiro, 50, of Manhattan, a research associate of the Child Welfare League of America, whose 8½‐year‐old daughter, Sharon, was off on another picnic. “It's not easy to have a child whose entire emotional investment is in you. But like any other life problem, you learn to deal with it.” Mr. Gatke said that being a single adoptive father had made him realize “the beauty of marriage.” “It would be nice to have someone you could share your child with,” he said. “I went to see Tommy in a glee club performance, and it was very, very nice, but who could I share it with?” But as Tommy, a former foster child, sees it, things couldn't be much better than they are now. “Finally I have a legal father,” he said, beaming, “and that means it's forever.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/23/archives/letters-to-the-editor-energy-blueprint-for-independence-bill-of.html,"To the Editor: I wholeheartedly agree with your recommendation that the United States needs an objective and fully publicized energy policy developed by experts in various disciplines [editorial July 6], but your characterization of Federal energy policy as being in chaos, with little knowledge brought to bear on the problem, is not true. Since the President's first energy message, in June 1971, and through other Presidential energy statements and initiatives, this Administration has pursued a consistent, wide‐ranging policy that has included legislative and administrative measures to increase energy supply, reduce demand and balance these programs with national security, environmental and other social and economic priorities. In addition, the recently created Federal Energy Administration is now, in response to the President's goal of Project Independence, coordinating a large Federal effort to prepare blueprint for energy independence. This blueprint, or energy plan, will be completed Nov. 1 and will address the goals of our national energy policy, analyze potential future energy supply and demand strategies and recommend policy actions. It will consider the extent to which we should expand domestic production of energy, reduce demand through conservation, reduce imports and develop stand‐by emergency programs, and the meani for accomplishing such actions. To obtain the broadest possible in put from the American public on thh blueprint, F.E.A. will hold public hear ings on Project Independence arounc the nation this summer and fall A high‐level National Advisory Com mittee on Project Independence, corn posed of representatives of state anc local government, energy industry banking, business, labor, environment al and consumer interests, will advise F.E,A. Its first meeting was held or July 10, and all its meetings will be open to the public and meeting tram scripts are available for review. The development of an energy plan for the United States involves complex questions which affect every American. Energy policies impact our economy, our environment, our international posture and our way of life. I am fully committed to insuring that the development of future energy policies is the result of objective analysis of the facts and informed, open public debate. Energy policy is not in chaos but is undergoing the most concentrated and far‐reaching analysis ever undertaken. This effort will culminate in what The Times calls for, and what the nation needs — a comprehensive energy policy. JOHN C. SAWHILL Administrator Federal Energy Administration Washington, July 16, 1974 Bill of Impeachment: The Sixth Ground To the Editor: What many of us have been waiting to hear said with authorjty, at last was said by Henry Steele Commager on the June 28 Op‐Ed page under the title “Five Grounds for Impeaching the President”: Impeachment is not a loophole provided to the President by the Constitution to enable him to escape ordinary criminal trial but rather a provision to insure the nation that he can be brought to trial for issues which bear on his moral fitness to hold the office. But should not Dr. Commager's bill of impeachment have included a sixth ground: the flouting of the requirement in Article II Section 3 of the Constitution that the President “take care that the, laws be faithfully executed""? (This requirement follows, in the same article; his oath to “preserve protect and defend the Constitution” and is itself followed, in the very next sentence; by the impeachment provision.) Dr. Commager has urged impeachment on grounds of acts committed by the President himself and of complicity in acts of others. The Constitution, I believe, entitles us to expect that even knowledge or foreknowledge of illegal acts of others would be considered failure to “take care” and that such failure would be grounds for, impeachment. Examples abound: promises of favors like diplomatic appointments, F.B.I. directorship, favored treatment before regulatory commissions; accept ance of illegal contributions by CREEP; interference with civil rights; obtaining, by his Attorney General, conviction of 600 criminals by improper means; filing of tax returns based on illegally prepared documents. These are all clearly illegal acts of others known to him wliere the President failed to “take care” that the laws be faithfully executed. It should not be necessary to prove that he himself was the one by whom the law was broken. As Dr. Commager implies, if the Judiciary Committee rejects grounds like these for impeachment, its rejection may become a precedent for making them unenforceable in the future. This is an issue at least as important as the removal of President Nixon. ROBERT F. ROTHSCHILD New York, July 10, 1974  Mankind's Choice To the Editor: The July 14 Op‐Ed piece by Paul Leventhal was fair warning of what plutonium in “peaceful” power plants can do to the human race. Perhaps The Times should repeat its own magnificent warning, in an editorial of June 28, 1965: “Whether this world becomes the near‐paradise scientific knowledge permits or a radioactive hulk desolate in space.” A ball of plutonium the size of a grapefruit, scientists tell us, is sufficiently lethal to kill every one on earth. STUART CHASE Georgetown, Conn., July 16, 1974 Of Buses and Numbers To the Editor: The M.T.A. recently announced that it is renumbering about one‐third of the bus routes it operates in Manhattan to end confusion caused by thirteen bus routes sharing six route numbers. Forgetting for ‘a minute that these changes should have been made twelve years ago when the city first took over operation of the buses in Manhattan, the M.T.A. does deserve credit for finally making these changes now. Under the plan, for example, one of the number 15 buses (23d Street bus) will be changed to M26, another number 15 will become M32 and the third 15 will remain M15. Similarly, the number 20 (57th Street bus) will be changed to M28, etc. While some of the confusion is eliminated, the prospective bus rider must still face the formidable task of trying to remember which route number operates on which street, since route names are no longer carried on the newer sign markers. If the declining ridership on buses is to be reversed, riding them must be made less of an exercise in memory. What would have been so difficult to change the 23d Street bus to M23, the 57th Street bus to M57, the 72d Street bus to M72, and so on, as long as these routes are being renumbered anyhow? The numbers M23 though M96 are presently vacant, making it possible to renumber logically every cross‐town route, if the T.A. desired to do so, without changing the number of any north‐south route. (The 14th Street bus is already call M14.) At some future date, even north‐south routes could be logically renumbered Ml for First Avenue, M2 for Second Avenue, M3 for Third Avenue, etc. Sometimes there is no substitute for plain common sense. ALLAN ROSEN Brooklyn, July 11, 1974 Abortion and Medicaid To the Editor: I fear you have prematurely credited the “anti‐abortion forces” with a “victory” not yet received. “Medicaid payments for abortion are denied to the poor under the Social Security Act,” your June 17 editorial “Aborting an Amendment” states. However, although the Senate amended H.R. 3153 to prohibit Medicaid payments for abortion, no further action has been taken on it. Thus, there is currently no statute to bar Federal contributions to state Medicaid programs to pay for abortions for Medicaid‐eligible individuals. JAMES S. DWIGHT Jr. Administrator Social and Rehabilitation Service Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare Washington, July 11, 1974 Détente and the Faith Of Averell Harriman To the Editor: W. Averell Harriman's unquestioning faith in the sincerity of the humanitarianism and love of peace professed by Leonid Brezhnev (“The Summit Meeting: Support for Nixon...,” Op‐Ed June 28) strikes this reader as an astonishing lapse of judgment for a man whose decades of diplomatic experience should surely have cured him of naive trustfulness. To justify his advocacy of support for détente with the Soviet Union, Mr. Harriman assures us that he has had a three‐hour talk with Mr. Brezhnev and that the Soviet leader “speaks with emotion” of his love for peace and hatred of the human suffering war, adding that Brezhnev “has publicly committed himself to the policy of détente.” Not only is it highly unprofessional for a man of diplomatic training to rely so heavily upon personal impressions (one remembers that at Berchtesgaden in 1938 Chamberlain met Hitler and “got the impression that here was a man who could be relied upon when he had given his word”)' but it is doubly foolhardy to ignore that Brezhnev's professed dedication to détente and love for peace have been repeatedly belied by the reality of Soviet policy. The world knows that the Soviet Union instigated the recent bloody war in the Middle East, fueling the conflict with massive supplies of weaponry and unilaterally threatening to send Soviet troops, and also exhorts ing Arab states to embargo oil shipments to the United States and West em Europe. As for the sincerity of Mr. Brezhnev's caring for human suffering, one need only consider continuing Russian supplies for Arab terrorists, who perpetrate atrocities. against helpless civilians and, within the Soviet Union itself, persistent brutal repression of political dissidents. Such are the true colors of a per sonality and policy Mr. Harriman so confidently finds worthy of trust. JOEL M. MARTEL Falls Church, Va., July 13, 1974  As Art Continues To the Editor: The July 13 Op‐Ed article on conceptual art fanned my creative urge. At exactly 9:03 A.M., same day, borrowing a pair of pinking shears from my wife, I made a casual cut of the “Billy Apple, 3 Blisters on Too Soft Hands” piece. My cutting also included a snip of “A Man of Property"" by W. V. Shannon and for weight the entire C. S. Sulzberger column with selected paragraphs from R. Arnheim. Spread out on the floor before me, 9:10 A.M., the array of jutting paper was now a piece of life, but needed, demanded and cried out for something more. Now inspired, 9:13 A.M., I snatched pages from the classifiessections, tearing them vertically, horizontally and in some instances diagonally; 9:14—suffered a slight paper cut. 9:15, Band‐Aid on thumb, I clenched the entire mass of torn, cut newspaper into a roundness, a ball, an earthmoon symbol, life and art. All day I have been kicking it from one room to the other. My cats join in on occasion, and my wife kicked it once. Art continues. WILLIAM D. GORMAN Bayonne, N. J., July 13, 1974 The Fertilizer Crisis To the Editor: Your July 6 news article “Poor Lands Face Barrier of Food Cost"" reports that the world use of fertilizer is now about 70 million metric tons a year. Recent data will also show that the U.S., with 6 per cent of the world population, will use about 45 million tons of fertilizer this year, although it needs closer to 50 million tons. India, with around 580 million, people, cornpared with our 210 million, used about 3,5 million tons of fertilizer in 1973 but is faced with a million‐ton shortage of fertilizer this year, which could plunge it into a disastrous famine. In order to meet the 250 million tons of fertilizer needed by the year 2000 (per Lester R. Brown), we must immediately give serious attention to recycling our food waste and sewage. sludge, which can be made into valuable organic fertilizer. Around 50 million tons of food waste is thrown out in the annual U.S. trash of 250 million tons, and ‘a similar amount of food waste is disposed of through overloaded sewage treatment plants. In his Jan. 7 coluinn, “Energy and Food,” Anthony Lewis advised: “Think again about the Green Revolution and dependence on chemical fertilizer; consider new ways of using natural fertilizer.” HENRY RITTER Jr., Nashville, July 11, 1974",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Birth‐Control Drive Focuses on Teen‐Agers,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/23/archives/birth-controldrive-focuses-on-teenagers.html,"Planned Parenthood of New York City announced yesterday that it had started an ambitious birth control campaign focusing for the first time on teen‐agers. The two‐year, $4‐million program will aim to make available to every teen‐ager in the city contraceptive information, counseling and services. “There are few health or social. problems more critical,” Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of the nonprofit ageney, said at a news conference. People have become very concerned about venereal disease in recent years, he said, but have not shown comparable concern about pregnacies among teen‐agers. Yet the pregnancy rate for teen‐agers is eight times higher than the gonorrhea rate, he noted. Highest Risk Group Speaking at the agency's offices at 380 Second Avenue, Mr. Moran said arolescents were the “highest risk group” for unwanted pregnancies. He estimated that at least 140,000 adolescent girls in the city were seivally active and not using effeetive birth control. About half of the city's 850,000 teenagers are female, he noted, and more than half are sexually active before age 20, The organization, which is the largest affiliate of Planned Parenthood Federa. tion of America, began some services for teen‐agers in 1968. “We kept a relatively low profile,” Mr. Moran said. “Now we're moving ahead much more aggressively,” One reason for the campaign is an expected increase in the number of teen‐agers in the city, one millon in 980. The rate of pregnancies among ten‐agers has not appeared to change in recent years—30,000 were reported in 1972—but the expected rise in the teen‐age population it is felt, would significantly increase the number of pregnancies. Failure to Inform In addition, Mr. Moran said, a recent, survey of 480 teen‐agers using Planned Parenthood services here showed that 56 per cent were seeking prognancy detection or abortiOn. He called this “a stunning indication that we are failing to reach youngsters with the information and services they need to prevent first pregnancies.” Planned Parenthood of New York will extend its own services for teen‐agers and start an education campaign in the hope that health care centers and private physicians will take up the cause and end requirements of parental consent for the services. Mr. Moran said staff members encouraged youngsters to tell their parents they were seeking contraception sery ices, but that most youngsters did not wish to. He said he did not anticipate any legal difficulties. In fact, he asserted, the state‐licensed agency could he legally liable if it declined service to people because of their age. On the other hand, he said he wished state law were clearer on the matter. The new program includes a special phone number, 677‐3320, providing inforinadon, counseling and referral for medical services to teen agers. Walk‐in services will be offered at all five of the agency's medical facilities and at special teen ‐age offices in neighborhoods with high rates of adolescent pregnancies. Two of these offices are in operation at 160‐16 Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, and 2286 Seventh Avenue in Harlem. Others are planned in the South Bronx, southern Queens and downtown Brooklyn. Also scheduled are intensified programs within the school system; heavy use of mass media, especially radio, work with community agencies and guidance for parents of teen‐agers: Condoms will be available at cost (10 cents each) at all agency facilities. The agency is encouraging their use, partly because they reduce the risk of venereal disease and because they will increase a sense of responsibility for male youngsters, Mr. Moran said. “Our goal is to help all New York City youngsters to comprehend more fully and cope more effectively with their sexual activity and to assist them in obtaining the services needed to prevent premature, hazardous and unwanted first pregnancies.” Agency spokesmen said maternal mortality rates for teen‐agers were about 30 per cent higher than for mothers between the ages of 20 and 24, and that a teen‐ager's baby had a 30 per cent higher chance of dying before its first birthday than do babies of older mothers. Mr. Moran said that the agency alone could not fulfill its goal but that he hoped to stimulate broader action by being in touch with health and welfare personnel, state and city legislators, educators, medical societies and various public agencies. Most of the $4Z‐million has been given by foundations and individuals; $280,000 is still being sought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Voice for Women: Neither a Shout Nor a Whisper,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/24/archives/a-voice-for-women-neither-a-shout-nor-a-whisper-no-one-else-to-rely.html,"PARIS, July 23—As the first woman Secretary for the Condition of Women in the first country in the world to create such a post, Francoise Giroud says, “I will certainly upset some people. If you want to do things, you upset people.” Her appointment, announced last week, provoked a few snickers. Former Foreign Minister Michel Jobert sniffed and said, “If it's discrimination, then why not a Secretary for the Condition of Men?” But Miss Giroud is not ruffled, “It's the human condition,” she said in an interview. “To paraphrase Richard Wright when he said it's not a black problem, it's a white problem. Well, it's not a problem of women, it's a problem of men.” Although she took office immediately on being named and attended last week's Cabinet meeting, Miss Giroud has not moved out of her large office, furnished with huge, soft white leather chairs at L'Express, a newsweekly she helped found and has edited for more than 20 years. It is something of a wrench for her to give up the job, and she said she would certainly return to journalism. “I have no intention of starting a political career,” she said. “That's partly why I was chosen, I have no voters to worry about, I'm independent and it will give me more authority.” While she has lots of ideas, Miss Giroud said she has not yet worked up a specific program for her new post. She will report to the Premier with reform projects that will then be put through other responsible ministries, such health, education or labor. But the first thing, she said, is to “get started on changing attitudes, things that don't cost money but mean a lot. “Like when men say to their wives at table, ‘shut up and be beautiful', or the fact that only the head of the family signs the income tax return, so the wife doesn't know what her husband's income is if he doesn't want her to, but he knows hers. Many Legal Restraints “If you don't get the little things done, you won't get the big ones, but you have to do them too.” Although there are many legal straints on the status of women France and the women's liberation movement is still a fringe group, Miss Giroud does not find it surprising that France should be the first country to create a Government department devoted “There is a deep, underlying egalitarian tradition in France,” she said, “going back to the Middle Ages. It's tradition of early Catholicism too. And then there's the fact that France industrialized so much later. On the farm, women work alongside men. The mistress of the farm is somebody of importance. “The problems were overlaid on this background in the 19th century, with Napoleon and the factories,” she continued. “Napoleon was a Corsican, an Ital ian mentality. He despised women, said they were only good for making children. The laws, the discrimination in the great schools are from Napoleon. And then, in the factories, you were paid for brawn, not dexterity, so women lost out.” The 58‐year‐old Miss Giroud is equally interested in the psychological and the practical side of women's problems. “It's fine to stay at home and keep house if you have a nice husband who brings home enough money,” she said. “But then if you're abandoned at 45, and have nothing, it's tragic. Men stand on two legs, their home life and their life in the world. If women stand on only one, then it's dramatic if that collapses.” @Miss Giroud herself began “life in the world” early. Her well‐to‐do family was ruined when her father died early in the Depression, and at 14 she started work to help ‘support her mother and sister. No One Else to Rely On’ Her first job was in a bookstore, then as a movie script girl, then a script writer, and lyricist. During the Occupation, she made ends meet as best she could and wound up,in prison for Resistance work. Shortly after the war, she was introduced to Helene Lazareff, the founder of Elle, a highly successful women's magazine, and she edited that until she left to help Jean‐Jacque Servan‐Schreiber found L'Express. Both her working and her private life make Miss Giroud feel it is wrong to compare her with Simone de Beauvoir, author of “The Second Sex.” “I was never protected, by an education or by a man. I had no one else to rely on,” she said. The fall of France in 1940 prevented her marrying the father of her first child. She was unable to get either an abortion or, after a wretched pregnancy, ration cards to feed and clothe her son because he was illegitimate. Later, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in divorce and not long ago her son, always sickly, died in a skiing accident. “My only diploma,” Miss Giroud wrote in a farewell column in L'Express, “would be the degree of Master of Life. I have learned.” “Why has the American women's movement gone sour?” she asked. “What is this about hating men? That means that you want to be a man, to humiliate him, It's neurotic. I don't understand this idea about making men wash dishes. That isn't a problem of life.” To the question always asked of working women, how do you reconcile your career and your family life, Miss Giroud answers with a laugh, “I always say that nobody's life is reconciled. The human condition is contradiction. And the worst contradiction is not to live the life for which one is made. “Then you get rich and have to frequent the psychoanalyst,” she added. “I don't know that the lives of women who have never worked is so much more successful, but it's also true that money helps a lot.” “Why has the American women's movement gone sour? What is this about hating men? I don't understand this idea about making men wash dishes. That isn't a problem of life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giscard Now Sees Need for More Reform Than He Did at Election,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/26/archives/giscard-now-sees-need-for-more-reform-than-he-did-at-election-no.html,"PARIS, July 25—Valery Giscard d'Estaing said at his first presidential press conference here today that two months in office had convinced him change in France must go much further and deeper than seemed needed when he was elected. He said that although he had already begun a number of reforms, France should wait and judge the scope of what he had done after his first 500 days, not merely after the first 100. In keeping with his effort to modernize the style as well as the decisions of the presidency, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's news conference was businesslike, direct, and specific. He answered all questions except one about Jacques Chaban‐Delmas, his Gaullist rival in the elections. Asked his reaction to suggestions that he is a “man of the right,” he smiled and said he should be judged by what he did. He added: “I'm a traditionalist who likes change.” He looked the part in a wellcut gray business suit, blue shirt and plain royal‐blue tie. Mr, Giscard d'Estaing said he wanted to make changes in the followng areas: ABORTION—Prosecution of women for undergoing abortions should be halted until the existing law could be liberalized. PRISON REFORM — The President said: “Detention is the punishment. There should be no further punishment in the conditions of detention.” He planned both physical, changes in the prison system, modernizing buildings and improving staff, and policy changes. If people work in jail, he said, it should be a “normal kind of work for normal pay,” and there should be educational facilitied. TELEVISION — Under the new decentralized organization for the state‐owned monopoly, which was voted by the French Parliament late last night, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he would establish a quality review panel. Its job would be to make sure France has “one of the best TV's in the world, in terms of quality and cultural level,” he said. DEFENSE—A full strategic review has been ordered, because “French strategy is based on 1960, when our situation was quite different and we hadn't even completed decolonization.” CAMPAIGN FINANCE —The President said he has ordered studies made for a law that would provide for control of expenditures and government financing of political campaigns. There are no such laws in France now. TAX REFORM — A new levy is to be added to the income tax as part of the Presid dent's program to force the well‐sheltered rich to contribute more substantially to public revenues. EDUCATION — Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he had sent proposal on reform back to the Education Minister for much broader study, He said France needed an education policy not i just for the next few years, “but for the rest of the century.” No Less Authority The insistence on simplicity and banishment of pompous ceremony does not mean that he intends to diminish presidential authority, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing made clear. But he hinted that he might later seek constitutional reforms that would more clearly define the President's rights and powers. For the time being, the President said, he will limit initiatives for constitutional reform to expanding the powers of the Constitutional Council, a high court. But he said change would not copy the United! States Supreme Court. But what many see as the most significant departure from tradition today was his gesture of amity to the opposition, not! often described as loyal by French politicians. The President said he would invite’ the Socialist leader, Francois Mitterrand, and the Communist leader, Georges Marchais, to confer with him—”and I hope they'll come,” he added with a twinkle in his eye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NIXON SIGNS A BILL ON LEGAL AID TO POOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/26/archives/nixon-signs-a-bill-on-legal-aid-to-poor.html,"WASHINGTON, July 25 (AP) —The White House announced today that President Nixon had signed into law a bill creating an independent corporation providing legal aid to the poor. Under the act, Legal Serv‐I ices lawyers will no longer be able to file actions in connection with desegregation, labor and abortion cases. They will still be able to represent the poor in civil cases involving rent, child custody, property, housing and welfare rights. Legal Services had been under the Office of Economic Opportunity since 1966. Legislation to create the corporation was stalled for three years by disputes between liberals anft, conservatives in both houses. Both houses passed new bills this year, but the President indicated he would veto the measure unless 15 legal research back‐up centers were dropped from the final product. In a compromise bill, the centors were eliminated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Transport Bond Issue Bills Await Legislature Monday,",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/27/archives/transport-bond-issue-bills-a-wait-legislature-monday-the-measures.html,"TRENTON, July 26—The New Jersey Legislature will return on Monday for its final meeting of the special session, and will then urgently consider a number of pending major bills, including two new transportation bond issues totaling $300million. The Assembly has the more ambitious schedule, with several important measures scheduled for either initial passage or final approval. The Senate is expected to spend most of its day dealing with proposed constitutional amendments that could be necessary for implementation of tax plans to replace Governor Byrne's rejected income‐tax program. Assemblymen were advised yesterday by the Speaker, S. Howard Woodson Jr., a Mercer County Democrat, to be prepared to vote on 18 measures, not including the 1 1 thhour addition of the two transportation bond issues. However, it is unlikely that all of the proposals will be considered. The Measures Among the other more important bills are a $200‐million “Green Acres and recreation opportunities” bond issue for preserving the state's dwindling natural areas and developing recreational facilities, an abortion bill embodying what is known as the “conscience clause,” two measures designed to benefit New Jersey's migrant farm workers and a bill creating a Division of Consumer Health Services in the Department of Health. Both the Green Acres and the transportation bond issues that are coming before the Assembly would have to be submitted to a public referendum at the time of the Nov. 5 general election. To meet a ruleof‐thumb deadline requiring that questions for the ballot be in the hands of the county clerks at least 34 days before the election, both the Assembly and the Senate would have to approve the bond issues and the Governor sign them by the end of September. That consideration, as well as preparation of a tax program the Legislature must produce to meet the Dec. 31 schoolfinancing deadline set by the State Supreme Court, virtually requires the Legislature to return to work by the middle of September, The transportation bond issues are covered by two separate measures — one seeking authorization for $200‐million for highway safety, and the other, $100‐Million for the preservation of railroad rightsof‐way that may be threatened by discontinuance of certain rail lines under the proposed railroad ‐reorganization plan. The highway safety money would be spent to relieve dangerous traffic congestion, rel build unsafe bridges, eliminate: highway hazards and build $10‐million worth at “bike: ways,” The $200‐million proposed for the Green Acres program,. would provide $100‐million fors state and local acquisition of “lands for recreation and conservation purposes” and 5100 million for the development of the lands with improvefflents such as access roads, corking, areas and comfort facilities, A matter of greater contrpoversy will be the abortion bill Already approved by the State Senate, that would permit hospitals or individuals to refuse to perform or assist in an ?? tion or sterilization procedure, without fear of legal or dis ciplinary action. Sponsored by State Senator, Joseph L. McGahn, Atlantic County Democrat, and favored by antiabortion groups, tie. measure is in effect ?? a legal test in State Superior, Court at the present dole. Suit Filed A suit filed by the state chap ter of the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two unidentified women seeks to compel the Bridgeton Hospital Association, Salem Hospital and Newcomb Hospital to perform elective abortions.

New Health Chief Is Acting on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/28/archives/new-health-chief-is-acting-on-abortions-concern-on-hospitals-took.html,"TRENTON—The new State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Joanne E. Finley, says she is determined that her department, which has been criticized for “foot‐dragging” abortion issues, will seek resolution of ‘ the abortion problem during the next month. The department has been charged by pro‐abortion groups with deliberately delaying licenses for seven abortion clinics ‐throughout the state that will be needed to aid hospitals in performing the 41,324 abortions that the state's health planning council estimates will be needed in New Jersey 1975. Dr. Finley is aware that majority of the state's residents are Roman Catholics and that many of them are opposed to abortion. But she says she has cut the red tape that tied up the licensing of clinics and that she expects the Attorney General's office will soon issue the final health regulations that the clinics must meet before being licensed. Moreover, the Commissioner, in an interview, indicated a determination to take positive action to keep the lid on rising hospital costs in the state's public and private hospitals. Took Over in June Dr. Finley, who assumed her post on June 10 after she served as director for Public Health for the city, of New Haven, said she was determined to make her department, which has a budget of $60‐million, move forward on major issues. “All the tools we need to nudge and bend public health policy are here, but it's like finding a lot of beads—they need to be strung together.” the Commissioner said She is a medical doctor and holds a master's degree in public health. The appointment of Dr. Finley, who is 50 years old, filled a vacancy that was created when the former Commissioner, Dr. James. R. Cowan, resigned in 1973 to accept ,a position with The Department of Defense ‘in Washington. A great many of the health agency's problems over the years have been attributed to a’ lack of strong leadership, first under the administration of former Gov. Richard J. Hughes and then under the administration of former Gov. William T. Citi, hill. Dr William J. Dougherty served as acting commissioner after Dr. Cowan's departure. Concern on Hospitals Dr. Finley said her top priority would be to implement fully the Health Care Facilities Act of 1971, a comprehensive law regulating hospital care in the state's public and private hospitals. Only eight other states in the nation have the strong state authority that New Jersey has to regulate its hospitals, and thus provide health care that is both accessible and obtainable at reasonable cost. Dr. Finley said one of the main reasons she came to New Jersey was that the state had already enacted the Health Care Facilities Act. Under the law, the state has the authority not only to review hospital budgets and set rates, but also to approve hospital expansions, make decisions on the addition of new services to avoid duplication, and to set standards and issue licenses for all health and facilities in the state. Nevertheless, the Health Department came in for sewere criticism earlier this year. A consumer research organization — the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton—charged that budget review had become a rubber‐stamp process run largely by hospital‐oriented members, thus allowing hospital costs to soar, The result for New Jerseyans, the report said, is higher Blue Cross insurance premiums. On abortion, Dr. Finley noted that the Supreme Court ruling that states must not interfere with abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was “a fact of life.” “The department's motives are to protect the health and pocketbooks of abortion patients,” Dr. Finley said. Pro‐abortion organizations, such as a Right to Life group, the National Organization of Women and others, have charged the Health Department with “foot‐dragging” in licensing abortion clinics throughout the state. While abortions are available in about half the state's hospitals, they are unneces sarily expensive (usually about $350) for a routine operation, the organizations charge. Backs Legislation However, Dr. Finley supports as a “right of conscience” legislation pending before the State Assembly that would allow hospitals and physicians to refuse to perform abortions for any reason, not just religious conviction. Overall, Dr. Finley said, “abortion is a constitutional issue, and like school desegregation and other major complex issues, it will be up to the courts to further refine the many interpretations of the Supreme Court's original ruling.” As for a long‐range plan, the Commissioner reported that the state's system of awarding grants‐in‐aid to regional health projects around the state required a new approach, one tied to regional health plans that reflect the needs of residents. At the same time, she said the Federal Government has substantially reduced its funds for health and urban centers. While the state cannot take over all the Federal responsibilities, she says, it may nevertheless have to assume a much larger role to prevent the increasing deterioration in urban health care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rape Study Details the How, the Why and the Who",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/29/archives/rape-study-details-the-how-the-why-and-the-who-rape-study-here.html,"A 30‐year‐old. unmarried woman was returning to her first‐floor apartment on the Upper East Side after spend ing an evening with friends a few blocks away. As she put her key into the lock, she was suddenly seized by the neck. Her attacker was tall, blond and muscular. “I'm going to kill you,” he said, They were words he would use again and again—the soundtrack to a nightmare that the woman said she Would never forget. “In my mind I thought I'd let him do whatever he wanted rather than kill me,” ‘She said, describing the moment, “so when he threw me down on the steps of the lobby, pulled off my clothes and raped me, I thought if it diminishes his violence it's O.K. with me.” When it was over and she had persuaded him to leave the building, at 89th Street and First Avenue, she called the police and was taken to ‘Metropolitan Hospital for treatment. After a two‐hour wait, she was examined for physical evidence of rape. She received no treatment for bruises until she specifi cally asked. The following day, her own doctor, who had known her for several years, refused to see her at all for fear she would get him involved in a court case. “This thing had happened to me,” she said, “and there was no one to talk to, no one to help me or care. I felt so alone.” A month later, the woman —who worked as a personnel manager for a computer firm in the city—learned she was pregnant and paid $250 for an abortion. Her attacker has never been caught. She worries that he will find out where she has moved — he had said he would see her again. If the estimate by the police that the number of rapes reported to them represents only a 10th of those that occur, this story of fear and attack is just one of 100 that take place in New York every day. And while recent statistics on violent crime say that murder, assault and robbery are on the decline, there has been more than a 15 per cent rise in the number of forcible rapes reported so far this year. Through the work of the sex crimes analysis unit, which was a five‐person squad when it was formed in December, 1972, and which now has a staff of 125, the patterns behind rape statistics are beginning to emerge, bringing with them a warning and a new picture of how and why rape occurs and who the victims are. For the first time, with the help of detectives trained to investigate sex crimes, the police are making a full‐scale attempt to collect data in a consistent and meaningful way to pinpoint the problems and to debunk myths about rape that have hampered attempts to confront it. An independent study, paid for by the Police Foundation and based on interviews with victims, is currently attempting to evaluate how women feel about the treatment they receive from the police following a rape. The three‐month proiect, which will cost $123,000 and ends in September, is being carried out by a psychologist, Lida Orzeck, and a team of 24 graduate students — including male, female, black and Spanish‐speaking interviewers. They sit in on initial police interviews with the victims and then conduct second interviews at which no officers are present. Through inter views of 350 women, the study aims to come up with ways to improve the quality of assistance provided by the police—both in responding to the scene and in subsequent attempts to elicit facts and evidence. Heightened efforts to examine rape cases have thus resulted in new challenges to old assumptions. For exampie, Lieut. Mary Keefe, who heads the sex crimes analysis unit, says it is important to realize that rape is not simply a “sex crime,” a sexual assault provoked’ in some way by the victim or by liberal censorship standards today, but a crime of aggression toward women, marked by the need to degrade and abuse. For the rapist, sexual gratification is rarely the only object. A lengthy list of perversions culled from the thousands of cases the rape unit handles includes rapes of a nun, an 87‐year‐old woman and a 2‐month‐old baby. Answers to 120 multiplechoice questions, which the rape unit began requiring of all investigating officers a few months ago and will computerize soon, indicate that “target selection""’ and modus operandl <are much more variable than previously believed. The tips to avoid rape Which, the unit provides are easily summarized with one basic rule: Never relax your defenses. “Rape is’ not simply.a case of being knocked on the head and dragged into an alley,” Lieutenant Keefe said. “Rapists are not full‐time rapists, and when they're not be Ing rapists, thtere people. There's no ready way to tell which man ‘he might be. In New York City, our big problem comes with single girls living alone in apartments. They're just too ,trusting—much too naive."" Policemen at the rape unit sound like radical spokesmen for women's rights groups when they speak about what makes women so vulnerable to rape. “Women are too compliant,. too nice,” said Sgt. Harry O'Reilly, assistant to Lieutenant Keefe. “Women are acclimated to the idea of man as the devastator, woman as the healer, This is why women who are service oriented—nurses, teachers, waitresses, social workers—are particularly susceptible to becoming victims. Their first , instinct is to obey and to help. But you have to be uncivil, because there's nothing, more uncivilized than a rapist. Be rude, not raped.” ‘White Collar Rapist’ To the extent that a woman is nice, she opens the door to the rapist who uses not force, but the con—a ruse to lower her defenses and make her an easy ‘prey for attack. Rapists ‘masquerading as delivery men, repairmen or mailmen are masters at this sort of game, as are neatly dressed men who want to leave something for a friend in the building who never seems to be home. As the police see it, men..who ask for a drink of water, men who ask to use the phone, men who stop a woman for a match or for directions on the street !mist all be viewed as dangerous and should promptly be rebuffed, or better still, ignored. “Once you're seen talking to someone dn the street, Sergeant O'Reilly said, “no one will think anything about it when he whispers that he has a gun and takes you to a nearby car.” Officers bemoan the, fact that even women who are cautious on the street become naive at home: They relax their guard because they feel secure. It is here, however, that the so‐called “white collar rapist” (emerging as ,a greater problem through more detailed study of rape in general) prefers to. operate. If the rapist knows his victim, there is a significam chance that even if she presses charges, her story would not be believed. The ‘Singles’ Bars “Until I ‘was raped, thought rapists looked menacing, that they didn't look like other people,” said one 24‐year‐old victim. “But was raped by someone I'd known for about a month. regarded him as a friend. Then he raped me in my apartment.’ He copped a plea, jumped bail and is still at large.” According to the police, many white‐collar rapists frequent East Side singles’ bars, where they Meet a woman, buy her drinks and take her home. Jeffrey Rovins, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, tells of one such rapist who has been unsuccessfully brought up on charges twice and who is known to have bragged of having raped 100 women. “He's a freak whose hobby is raping people,” Mr. Rovins said, “and so far, he's been successful. He's a neo‐Nazi, very careful in his selection of victims [usually Jewish women he asks out on dates], and he's not a guy who grabs them in the bushes. Under the circumstances, it's very difficult to win conviction, especially because we can't mention prior acts that he committed in our argument to a jury. It's insane, because the defense attorney can bring in every man the victim's ever had sexual relations with to suggest that she's experienced and may not have been unwilling.” Poverty and Rape To avoid this humiliation, victims of this kind of, rape tend to keep the story to themselves. Statistics on its frequency, the police admit, are therefore very sketchy. Current data thus, suggest that most victims are unknown to their assailants and that, in the words of Sergeant O'Reilly “a direct relationship exists between poverty, and rape.” Maps of New York City hang on the wall of the sex crimes analysis unit's office on the 13th floor of the new Police Headquarters building near City Hall. Small circles, of a different color for every month, pinpoint the scene of'every rape reported. From 59th Street to 102d Street, from Fifth Avenue to Park Avenue, not a single circle mars the image of this fashionable part of town. But on maps of the Smith Bronx or of the ,East Village, for example, the tiny colored circles fight for space and speak of rape, on almost every single street, Statistics on reported rape indicate that 55 per cent of the, perpetrators are black men and that they rape in their own neighborhoods. ‘Most Rape Intraracial’ “What emerges here is a picture of black men raping black women,” Sergeant 0% Reilly said. “Most rape is intraracial, but when a black rapes a white, it's more brutal.” Racial hatred is added to the sexual aggression, he said. What makes combating rape so difficult, however, is that such statistics do not encompass the variety and the dimensions of the crime., Unexpected situations defy attempts to forearm women with advice. According to police reports, for example, 51 taxicab drivers raped their female passengers last year. Thirty‐two cases Involved unlicensed “gypsy cab” drivers, but 19 were related to drivers of yellow cabs, men who had been checked by the police and licensed by the city. While the police refused to release the names of drivers who were.charged with rape and awaiting trial, it was acknowledged that some might well have gone on driving cabs—free to pickup more female passengers who are likely to believe that, in taking cabs, they are escaping from the dangers of the subways and the streets. “There's always an obvious assumption that a person Is innocent until proven guilty,” said Ira Glidk, director of licensing for the New York Taxi and Limousine Commisiion, when asked for comment. “It is conceivable that a man could be back on the street,” agreed First Deputy. Commissioner Joseph A. Cerl bone. “If you’ want to be democratic and give everyone,, their constitutional, rights, you can't do what you would like to do—which might be to take away their licenses without a hearing‐, or a trial.” It is ‘not unusual, however, for ‘the period between arrest and trial to extend beyond a year, which according to Lieutenant Keefe, works to the advantage of the defendant. Advice on what to do when actually confronted by a rapist ‘is no more clear‐cut than are attempts to catalogue the’ variety of situations involving risk. The problem, Lieutenant Keefe suggests, may actually be a moral one. “The best advice is to submit and live through it, brit many women feel that their consciences will not permit them to,” she said. “Don't fight, unless you're 100 per cent sure that you can devastate him—unless you're ready to poke your nails straight Into his eyes.” “We've had guys get shot 28 or 30 times,” Lieutenant Keefe continued, “and they still keep on fighting. Even a gun is no real protection. In all likelihood, it will only. make the.man more angry; he'll get it away from you and then he'll use It. A woman's violent response brings the latent violence of the rapist to the surface. It is possible to survive rape without being beaten. But in immediate threat of death, well, do anything you can.” How Women React Some women faced with rape have chosen to comply; others have resisted. Many have been beaten brutally; others have been murdered, One woman jumped out a fifth‐floor window to escape and was hospitalized for. months with a broken back and legs. Still other women, thinking quickly through a deadly confrontation, have come up with ruses that miraculously worked and saved them from attack, Lieutenant Keefe tells of one woman who, accosted on the street by a man intending rape, greeted him with warmth and invited him to come to her apartment. They'd be more comfortable, she said. She took him Into the building, but instead of going to her own apartment, she rang a neighbor's bell. The would‐be rapist fled. What makes rape so difficult to define, prevent and prosecute seems inextricably bound up with the very personal nature of the crime. Just what constitutes a rape? When is sex illiegal? “Rape is a crime against the person,” said Sergeant O'Reilly offering a definition. “It is the ultimate vio ati on of the self, short of homicide. Or perhaps It's worse, for in homicide, the self ceases to exist and cannot suffer.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grand Jury Exonerates L.I. Legislator 2d Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/grand-jury-exonerates-li-legislator-2d-time-state-closes-abortion.html,"MINEOLA, L. I., July For the second time in five days, Assemblyman Arthur Kremer has been cleared by a Nassau County grand jury of allegations of wrongdoing. Milian Cahn, the Nassau District Attorney, announced today that the grand jury had voted to close its investigation into charges that the legislator had promised the Long Beach city police a pay raise in return for their support of Democratic candidates in last year's elec. tions. The Long Beach police scale is 4 per cent below the scale of county policemen. Mr. Kremer, who is also the Democratic leader of Long t3‐ach, was exonerated because of a lack of evidence after test;mony by 15 witnesses, including members of the local Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and members of the City Council. The 39‐year‐old Assemblyman, who testified before the grand jury after having waived immunity, said he had met with the members of the’ P.B.A. last !September, but he denied he ;told them he would see to that they would receive ‐pay ;parity with the county police if they supported Democratic ‘candidates. Reporter Testifies Brian Donovan, a reporter for ‘Newsday who wrote the story about the allegations of the pay raises, also testified. The state election law forbids any public official from making promises or threats in jexchange for political activity by other government employes. The Democrats won the elec tion in the city last year, but the police did not receive pay raise. However, under an agreement with the previous Republican administration, they will achieve pay parity the county police July 1. Mr. Krerner,tommented: “I'm delighted that this! closes the books and my six( weeks of ordeal is now finished’ and of course that I can get back to the job of an elected official taking care of my own district.” Last Thursday, the same grand jury found there was no basis to a charge that a client, of Mr. Kremer's law firm had received two false court de; c,sions from the firm, as a story in Newsday had alleged. The complainant was indicted’ on perjury and bribery charges. State Closes Abortion Clinic On East Side as Unsanitary An East Side clinic that formed almost 3,700 abortions in the last year has been closed becaus of dirt sur conditions Attorneyy Genegralical Louis J. Lefkowitz announced yesterday. The clinic, Central Women's Center of 333 East 29th Street, consented to a judgment in, State Superior Court in Ma nhattan that closed the facility until health and fire violations, have been corrected. Mr. Lefkowitz said a State Department of Health inspection had found flies in the operating suite, surgical procedures not performed under aseptic conditions, anaesthesia administered without adequate supervision, soiled and stained equipment in the operating room, unclean oxygen masks, unclean laboratory and recovery room and inaccurate medi‐cal records. Mr. Lefkowitz said the clinic was run by Dr. Eliezer Shkolnick, “who performed the vast majority of the abortions,” and ??

A bortion Rights Bill Voted,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/abortion-rights-bill-voted-legislature-ends-session-protects-the.html,"TRENTON, July 29 — The Assembly gave final legislative approval tonight, after a long and often emotional debate, to a bill that would give hospitals and individuals the right to refuse to perform or assist in abortions without fear of legal or disciplinary action. The action was taken before both houses of the Legislature ended their special session amid charges by the Assembly Republican leader that the Democratic majority was torn by dissention. The highly controversial abortion measure was passed by a 54.12 vote after a brief uproar in the chamber touched off by Assemblyman Herman Gladstone, a Bergen County Democrat, who described himself as “a non‐Catholic in den of Catholics” and declared, “This abortion bill is for Catholics and against everybody else.” The bill, already passed by the Senate, will now go to Governor Byrne, who is expected to sign it, despite his earlier efforts to seek some amendments that would make it more palatable to pro‐abortion forces. The measure, sponsored by State Senator Joseph L. McGahn, Democrat of Atlantic County, is known among its supporters as the “conscience bill,” because it establishes by law the right of persons not to participate in abortions or sterilization procedures on the grounds of their conscience or religion. It has had the strong support of the Right to Life anti‐abortion movement, which opposes any relaxation or traditional restrictions against abortion. Protects the Rights’ Opponents of the bill tonight argued principally that the measure was unconstitutional in the light of the United States Supreme Court decision of Jan. 22, 1973, which bars any state interference with or prohibition of abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mrs. Betty Wilson, Democrat’ of Union County and the majority whip, termed the measire “blatantly unconstitutional” and said it “flagrantly” infringed on the individual rights of doctors to practice medicine. In a debate that disregarded oarty lines, supporters of the neasure contended not only hat the measure did not reitrict abortions, but also that he complex Supreme Court ruing on abortion might one day be superseded or reversed. A court test of the principle of the measure—that hospitals or other health‐care facilities nay refuse to have abortions performed on their premises—is already under way. The New Jersey chapter of the Americar Civil Liberties Union.hat, brought suit on behalf of twc unidentified women to compe, the Bridgeton Hospital Associa tion, the Salem Hospital ant the Newcomb Hospital to per form elective abortions. Judge Herbert Horn of Su. perior Court, who has heart arguments on the case and ha; ordered additional briefs fron both sides, is expected to rulu early next fall.. To Return in September The action on the abortioi bill was the last piece of major legislation passed by the As sembly before it adjourned a’ 8:25 P.M. The. Senate had fin ished hours earlier, after ap proving a resolution calling for a referendum on a statewide property tax that would require a constitutional amendment. The Senate is scheduled to return Sept. 19 and the Assent bly at a day in September stil to be announced. Both chambers ended their special session, which had beet called to produce a tax‐reforn program for. financing Nets Jersey's public educational sys tern, amid charges by the As sembly Republican leader tha the Democratic majority war torn by dissension and was putting the party's interna problems “ahead of the orderly conduct of the business of government.” The accusation was made by Assemblyman Thomas J. Kean Republican of Essex Count) and the Assembly's minority leader, after a long secret cau. cus by the Democrats that re. portedly included a reprimand of one of their members and a decision not to reconsider several pieces of legislatior that had been scheduled for a vote. The reported censure follow. ed charges on the Assembly floors that Governor Byrne and his administration were “retaliating” against Democrats who voted against the incometax bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Court Bars Move to Close Outpatient Abortion Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/01/archives/court-bars-move-to-close-outpatient-abortion-clinic-provisional.html,"JERSEY CITY, July 31 —Judge Sidney M. Schreiber today permitted the state's first full‐fledged outpatient abortion clinic to continue to operate here without a license. At the same time, the clinic and six others were notified that they would receive provisional state licenses. In a hearing in State Superior Court, Judge Schreiber let stand a restraining order, issued by him on July 19, permitting the continued operation of the Hudson Health Center, which was opened on July 19 by the Planned Parenthood Association of Hudson County. Richard M. Conley, a Deputy State Attorney General, representing State Health Commissioner Joan E. Finley, had sought to have the original restraint overturned. He argued that the state had the right to regulate abortion clinics, as it regulated other medical facilities. The state had been attempting to close the clinic because it was unlicensed. But Joel A, Leyner, lawyer for Planned Parenthood, contended the state was slow in processing license applications. Provisional Licenses Set Meanwhile, Dr. William E. Neiman, deputy state health commissioner, said that the state had been legally advised that it could issue provisional licenses to the Hudson Health Center and six other yet‐toopen clinics, all of which have applied for state licenses. The step was considered a major breakthrough in the battle to make available low‐cost abortions for women in their first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The licenses had been delayed for more than 18 months by what pro‐abortion groups described as bureaucratic stalling by the state. Antiabortion forces in the state have fought long and hard over the highly charged issue, despite a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are legal. In his ruling, Judge Schreiber said there was a “serious question” as to whether the state could require the licensing of clinics giving abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, in view of the Supreme Court decision. Planned Parenthood had argued that state approval was not required for the group's clinic, even though it had applied for a license or if the license is revoked. Interference Barred The judge's order restrained the state from interfering with the Hudson County clinic until either provisional licenses are issued or state regulations, now being formulated on abortion clinics, are promulgated. The order provides for a return hearing if the Hudson County clinic does not receive a license. The judge also ruled that the state would have the right to close the facility if it failed a sanitary inspection. The facility, situated at 706 Bergen Aveme, Jersey City, though specifically designed for abortions, also performs other medical functions, including cancerscreening and venereal‐disease detection, according to the clinic's administrator, Norman Harris. In an interview, Mr. Harris accused the state of having made a “political and controversial issue” of a medical matter. One of the seven clinic applicants was Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood Cliffs, who has been openly challenging the state abortion restrictions, performing 150 abortions a week in his office since March, 1972. His fees have averaged $100, in contrast to hospital fees running as high as $375 for each abortion. The Hudson County clinic, expecting by next week to perform 12 abortions a day, charges about $125. That fee is the “lowest in New Jersey or New York,” Mr. Harris said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dime‐store way to make movies and money,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/04/archives/the-dimestore-way-to-make-moviesand-money-if-what-aip-peddles-is.html,"Samuel Z. Arkoff is not feeling well. Last night he tried acupuncture, allowing seven needles to be inserted into his face. “Shingles is such an awful name for a painful disease. I feel like Camille. She died of consumption—a passe disease. For the young people to identify with her or me, we should make it a social disease.” It is not beyond the realm of possibility that, in Arkoff's projected version of “Camille,” the lady of the camellias will have traded tuberculosis for syphilis. After all, in Arkoff's version of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Hyde was a woman. Arkoff's movie company— merican International Pictures—has roughly the same status in Hollywood as the man hired to sweep behind the elephants in the circus parade. There is a rich aroma to AIP pictures, from 1957's “I Was a Teen‐age Werewolf,” which featured healthy high school athlete Michael Landon wolfing down a fellow student in the gym; to 1969's “Three in the Attic,” which demonstrated how college stud Christopher Jones was undone by the three girls with whom he had been carrying on simultaneous affairs; to 1971's “Bloody Mama,” which showed a fat but indefatigable Shelley Winters hauling herself into bed with one or another of her grown sons. “Garbage!” sniffs a producer at a major studio. “Trash,” adds the inheritor of a tastefully decorated executive suite at a different studio. But there is garbage and garbage, and, if what Sam Arkoff peddles is trash, it is trash that finds an eager market. In the 20 years of its existence, AIP has never lost money. Between 1954—when it was founded by Arkoff and the late James Nicholson—and 1960, AIP never even made a picture that lost money. For the fiscal year ended March 2, 1974, AIP had a profit of $931,400 on sales of $32.5 million. The highest profits in its history thus coincided with its 20th anniversary. “I will be condemned for saying this,” says Arkoff with a sigh, rubbing at his scalp. The sigh may be part pain, part acknowledgment that the “arty” movie aristocrats regard him as a barbarian. “I look upon my movies as being merchandise, just as Woolworth's has a line of merchandise. The fact that many of my acquaintances wouldn't buy Woolworth's merchandise doesn't keep it from being perfectly good merchandise. Many people in this business feel that merchandise not aimed at them must‐be shoddy. They wouldn't feel that way about overshoes.” Arkoff's merchandise has always been aimed at the pizza‐eating, acne‐pitted, Coke‐drinking 19‐year‐old inhabitant of the drive‐in theaters. As such, it has changed dramatically over the last 10 years to match a changing audience. In the early sixties, “Beach Party,” “Pajama Party,” “Ski Party” were all tease and froth. Frankie Avalon never did get to attain what Annette Funicello so tantalizingly promised in bubble‐gum songs. A few years later, APP was presenting teen‐agers quite differently. Teen‐age President of the United States Christopher Jones put his mother in a concentration camp in “Wild in the Streets” in 1968. Two years after that, Jones was triple‐raped in “Three in the Attic.” (With a theatrical film rental $5,500,000 in the United States, “Three in the Attic” is, so far, AIP's highest‐grossing film.) “Our pictures in the sixties mirrored the teenagers as they went from high‐spirited to rebellious but not sullen to rebellious and sullen,” says Arkoff. “Kent State was the turning point. It was no longer fun and games to call policemen pigs. You could get shot. The big body of teen‐agers turned off into nothingness by 1970. That's why the nostalgia pictures are successful today. Because those who want to believe can only believe if story is set in the forties or fifties. Today a 16‐year‐old boy doesn't believe in virgins. Plenty of 16‐year‐old boys are virgins, but it's not credible to them except in ‘Summer of '42’ or ‘The Last Picture Show.’” In 1974, AIP is, as usual., trying to fathom what its audience—no longer the archetypal 19‐year‐old boy or girl—will buy. “There's no way to sell the young today that's as clearcut as in the past,” Arkoff says. “I don't think our audience is the same audience any more for any two different pictures. Each picture must be attractive to some segment of youth, to some part of the audience under 30. But you can't buckshot any more. You must aim dead center a what you consider your audience for a specific picture and hope what you have will also attract a peripheral audience. Falling between two stools is not my idea of comfort.” As an example, he offers one of AIP's two films for Christmas—“Cooley High,” a black “American Graffiti” about black writer Eric Monte's bittersweet high‐school experience. Arkoff is taking a $750,000 chance that he is correct in his estimate that the black teen‐age audience is ready for more subtle reflections of itself, that whites are ready for subtle reflections about blacks and that “the hard‐action black film is coming to an end. Not that anything was wrong with them. We did very well with ‘Slaughter,’ ‘Black Caesar,’ ‘Coffy.’ But they're no novelty any more. “What are kids looking for today? They'll buy everything and nothing. They will not buy the political picture at all. Kids are less idealists today, bigger pragmatists. They're no less innocent, but they are more jaundiced. You need to be first and good today, rather than second and better. A more fickle audience wants something to tickle their carnival spirit. ‘The Exorcist’ is simply a super AIP horror picture.” It would be easier to mock Arkoff's dime‐store approach to moviemaking if it were not for two facts: (1) In the last half‐dozen years, while AIP was basking in the sunshine of modest but respectable profits, the old‐line movie companies were losing half‐a‐billion dollars. (2) Much of that $500‐million was lost not on seriously intended movies that happened to be commercial failures but on attempts to turn a trendy buck. “The Strawberry Statement.” “The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,” “Pretty Maids All in a Row,” “Born to Win” and Dennis Hopper's “The Last Movie” were among the two dozen major studio films that failed capture the magic drug‐cum‐sex‐cum‐youth market captured by AIP's “The Trip,” “The Wild Angels,” and “Wild in the Streets.” Arkoff cannot guess which of AIP's 24 or 30 pictures for 1974 will make money. “ ‘Truck Turner’ I'm pretty sure of, but I wouldn't want to be one‐picture producer because on one picture you can go wrong. I would never predict the success of one picture or despair if one is a failure.” What he is absolutely confident of is that “flying by the seat of my pants on 20 pictures, I'll come out O.K.” He is convinced that AIP's inelegant but shrewd blend of horror (“Madhouse,” “The Bat People”), melodrama (“Truck Stop Women,” “Macon County Line”), black supermen and women (“Truck Turner,” “Foxy Brown”), and audacious animation (“Heavy Traffic” re‐released in an R version and “The 9 Lives of Fritz the Cat”) will be commercially viable. And it is a shrewd blend. AIP has an almost dazzling record for guessing what will tickle the public's fancy in any given year (e.g., sandy teen‐age romance, motorcycle gangs, classic horror tales), and for making new genres by mixing old ones (e.g. Black + Horror = “Blacula”; Teenage + Horror = “I Was a Teen‐age Frankenstein”). AIP was one of the few studios not to lose money on drug pictures because it didn't make any except one carefully constructed drug experience, “The Trip.” Says Arkoff, “‘The Trip’ didn't say drugs were morally wrong or criminally wrong. If you're making a picture for a certain audience, you can't insult them. Those studios had drug pictures where everybody came to a bad end. How the hell could they expect the marijuana fanatics to come? And the antidrug parents would never come to any drug picture, no matter how moral.” Although AIP has distributed a dozen or more Kung Fu movies (“Shanghai Killers,” “Bamboo Gods and Iron Men,” “Screaming Tiger,” “Deep Thrust”) during the last year, there are no Kung Fu movies on its summer and fall slate. “The standard Kung Fu feature will be dead by summer,” says Arkoff. “To be successful, Kung Fu will have to be grafted onto other genres.” Sitting in his office on the fourth floor of the five‐story building that his company owns in Beverly Hills—a rolypoly, 55‐year‐old man with a black eye‐patch over one eye —Arkoff is no accidental tycoon, no garment manufacturer or insurance salesman who stumbled into Hollywood gold. Nor is he a barbarian. Even with the eye‐patch (a temporary memento of the shingles), he looks less like a buccaneer than like the winged leprechaun, Mr. O'Malley, in the “Barnaby” comic strip—a comparison made more apt by the cigars that he chainsmokes. He is, in paradoxical actuality, a ferociously intelligent man who has chosen to use his intelligence to anticipate what a youthful, unsophisticated audience will buy for an evening's pleasure. In this pursuit, he has given a toehold on the often unscalable Hollywood wall to actors Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, Mike Connors and Woody Allen, directors Bob Kaufman (“I Love My Wife”), Richard Rush (“Freebie and the Bean”), Monte Hellman (“Two Lane Blacktop”), Menahem Golan (“Kazablan”) and Martin Scorsese (“Mean Streets”), writers John Milius (“Jeremiah John son”) and Willard Huyck (“American Graffiti”) and a score of others. Arkoff is frank to admit that nurturing talent is in AIP's self‐interest. “But it's not a one‐way, street. We're not exploiting anybody. When these young people come to us, they have a lot to learn.” John Milius worked for two years for $75 a week doing odd jobs at AIP before he became a high‐priced writer with an itch to be a director. “Milius got $300,000 from First Artists for ‘Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean,’ “ says Arkoff. “Because they wouldn't let him direct it. He would have taken $150,000 if they had let him direct. So we came to him with the idea for ‘Dillinger’ and got him—as writer and director—for a fraction of his usual price.” ‘What are kids looking for today? They'll buy everything and nothing. ... Kids are less idealists today, bigger pragmatists.’ Arkoff rubs his head again. Besides adding 20 pounds to his already ample figure, the shingles has slowed him down to an eight‐hour working day. He usually works a 9:30 A.M. to 8 P.M. day, including lunch. (“This is a business of communication. You have to talk to people, reach for the hints they may not even realize they're giving.”) Each Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening, he sees movies. On no weekend does he see less than six movies, and he may see as many as nine. His 24‐year‐old son, his 22‐year‐old daughter (wife of Mike Pindar of the Moody Blues), and 30 or 40 nieces and nephews (“My wife is one of 10 children; I am the oldest of five”) and their friends sprawl on the floor of the big living room of the San Fernando Valley house he built in 1957, and watch the movies with him. “I have always utilized the opinions of young people. No matter how good I think I am, after a certain age you don't react the same. One of the great fallacies in our business is exhibitors in their fifties and sixties telling distributors in their forties and fifties what audiences want to see.” (If an evening's film comes from AIP Arkoff's wife of 27 years usually watches one or two reels and then goes to bed. Hilda Arkoff, a sculptress, is proud of her husband as “a man, a human being, a successful father and husband,” but she rarely likes his films. When she did like “Heavy Traffic” enough to see it four times, Arkoff was terrified. The last Al? film she had really liked was “Angel, Angel, Down We Go,” an unmitigated financial disaster starring Jennifer Jones.) “How do you come to the conclusion the timing is right for something? If it's a subject the public is aware of, if it seems different, and if you can put it into an action vein —by that I don't mean gunplay, I mean dramatic—then you have to experiment. We made ‘Wild Angels’ because three different people threw on my desk the Life magazine that had the Hell's Angels on the cover.” With AIP's successful series of beach pictures, “I simply listened to my 17‐ and 20‐year‐old nephews talking. Such ‐ and ‐ such, a friend, wasn't living at home any more. So‐and‐so had withdrawn from his parents. sensed kids were ready for pictures totally about them as a tribe, unconnected to the adult generation. Arkoff is equally attuned to poor timing. AIP's spring horror film, “The Bat People,” did poorly. And “Madhouse” is doing less business than is normal for an ATP Vincent Price film. To Arkoff, the figures augur the reality of something he has been halfanticipating. “What we call ‘Horror’ and they call ‘Suspense’ is all over TV. You cannot sell what is being given away.” The horror film, a staple of ATP since 1960, may vanish. Arkoff freely admits his own errors of competence. “‘De Sade!’ An abortion. ‘Bunny O'Hare!’ Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine on a motorcycle. I knew it was a bad project. Too cutesy. And not inexpensive for us ($900,000). But it was on our schedule, and the sales department had sold it. So we went ahead.” But nothing Arkoff says is to be misinterpreted as a complaint. Says Marge Carr, his secretary for the last 15 years, whose job includes (1) making duplicates of the car keys Arkoff loses “by the millions”; and (2) reminding him whom he is telephoning since he often forgets between the time he dials and the time his call is answered, “Sam is a man who loves his business. Few people are that lucky.” Even during the two‐and‐ahalf years Arkoff spent at Los Angeles's Loyola law school just after World War II, he never saw “less than one double‐feature a day.” It Was as a lawyer that Arkoff first met James Nicholson in 1953. Nicholson—who left AIP in June, 1972, to produce pictures on his own and died of a brain tumor six months later—often recalled admiringly how Arkoff managed to separate Nicholson's tightwad boss from $500 in an affair of title infringement when Nicholson was convinced Arkoff had absolutely no case. It was a moment in Hollywood history when the major studios were fighting the inroads of television with massive, wide‐screen, bigbudget movies (“The Robe,” “Knights of the Round Table,” “Demetrius and the Gladiators”). Nicholson and Arkoff pooled $3,000 in 1954 (Arkoff's salary is now $106,000 per year) and went into business. They were convinced that there was money to be made supplying the country's 4,152 drive‐in theaters (in 1946, there had been 100 drive‐ins) with cheap, 70‐minute features that could be changed twice a week. Cheap, in those early years, meant cheap. Roger Corman made “The Beast With 1,000,000 Eyes” in eight days for $35,000. “I Was a Teen‐age Werewolf” cost $123,000 and brought back $2,000,000. “She Gods of the Shark Reef,” “The Undead,” “Dragstrip Riot,” “Night of the Blood Beast,” “Sorority Girl” and 50 others ranged in cost from $50,000 to $150,000. If a picture threatened to go one day over its 10‐day shooting schedule or $1,000 over its budget, Arkoff appeared on the set. “Jim loved being on the set,” Arkoff recalls. “He was the nice guy, the guy in the white car. I was the guy in the black car. I only went on the set when there was trouble. I'd say, ‘If you're not caught up by tomorrow night, I'm tearing five pages out of the script.’ Generally that had a satisfactory effect. If not, I did it.” (In real life, the black car‐white car roles were more ambiguous. Says screenwriter Robert Thom, “Sam was the Jewish papa who adored his kids and took every script home to them. Jim lived in high style. New yachts. New houses. He was always in debt and borrowing money from the company.”) The end of 1958 brought trouble. The cleverness of Arkoff and Nicholson lay in their ability to recognize that trouble was trouble and to recognize it immediately. “Our black‐and‐white, double‐bill combinations were dead. Everyone was starting to imitate us. And the public was beginning to sense that if two pictures were advertised equally in splashy ads, both of them must be dogs.” The decision was made “to go with bigger pictures. Color. $400,000 budgets. Putting more into the one picture than we used to put into two.” Looking for cheap stories to make into salable color pictures, Arkoff and Nicholson chose Edgar Allan Poe. Poe was in the public domain. Equally important, the great Hollywood horror stars were underpriced. “There are actors in this town who haven't been in a successful picture for years who are grotesquely overpriced. Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Lon Chaney Jr. were underpriced.” For “Fall of the House of Usher” in 1960, AIP paid Vincent Price “more than he ever had been paid before, but we frugally deferred payment over years and years.” Seven more Poe pictures followed. The stylishly acted, stylishly directed (by Roger Corman) Poe pictures brought AIP a trifle closer to respectability. “At a cocktail party,” says Arkoff, “a dozen people came up to me and said, ‘You're so faithful to the book.’ I hate pious talk and there's so much pious talk in our business. For God's sake, no Poe story is over six pages long!” AIP's successful beach‐party pictures of the early sixties started with the same sort of careful appraisal. Disney's exclusive contract with mouseketeer Annette Funicello had lapsed. Why not jump in on a Disney star? The beach‐party pictures (“Beach Blanket Bingo,” “Bikini Beach,” “How to Stuff a Wild Bikini,” etc.) were artistically dreadful but philosophically brilliant. “We never showed parents,” says Arkoff. Alot has changed at AIP since the bloody Poes and barefoot teen ‐ agers of the nineteen‐sixties. In the parking lot of Los Angeles's Ambassador Hotel in the spring of 1974, 30 members of the cast (Elizabeth Ashley, Joe Don Baker, Burgess Meredith, Ann Sothern) and crew of AIP's “Golden Needles” eat fried steak and apple pie. “Golden Needles” is an example of how much has changed at AIP in the last few years—and of how much has stayed the same. In the early years, all of AIP's pictures were house productions. (“To make them topical, we had to make them ourselves,” says Arkoff.) In 1974, approximately 10 pictures will be house productions, 12 will be co‐productions and eight will be pickups of finished pictures that lack a distributor. (AIP's pickups are sometimes surprising. In 1973, AIP released Brian de Palma's “Sisters” and Jane Fonda's anti‐Vietnam‐war polemic, “FTA.”) “Golden Needles”—a crosspollination of the Kung Fu genre with the Maltese Falcon genre—is a co‐production. Financed by AIP, it is being produced by Fred Weintraub and Paul Heller who produced the startling Kung Fu success, “Enter the Dragon,” starring Bruce tee. The deal was made over a two‐hour lunch. “At the end of an hour‐and‐a‐half, I told them I'd go with the project despite the fact they had no written material,” says Arkoff. “They were offering not only themselves but Robert Clouse who directed ‘Enter the Dragon,’ and it was obvious that that picture was very much helped by its director. And while I was sure the standard Kung Fu would be dead by summer, I had a hunch this blend of the oriental martial arts with a Maltese Falcon‐type search might well be successsful.” Weintraub and Heller has been to another studio first. (AIP is rarely the first choice of producers because of its ferocious cost‐consciousness.) The other studio would have given them a larger budget for the film, but it offered only a development deal which meant the studio could back out after any of a number of steps. Arkoff promised less money but a firm commit. ment. Weintraub and Heller accepted. (AIP likes to go in lean, but, according to producers who have made pictures there, it pays off honestly on its profit percentages —“not like some major studios.”) “Golden Needles” — which was penciled in on AIP's release schedule to open July 12, before it was even finished—had a 34‐day shooting schedule and a budget slightly under $1,000,000. In the past decade, AIP's budgets have crept up from $400,000 to $600,000 to $900,000. “There was a change in philosophy a few years ago,” says Arkoff, “just as we made a major step in 1959 based on the problems of 1958. The times call for different things.” Chief among “the times'” for AIP is “the greater and greater competition from television movies. There are more and more movies being made for television. TV mimics theatrical. Anything safe and successful TV apes. You hardly have time to follow up a successful picture before TV is there with a series or a movie of the week, with PG versions of R films. You cannot sell what is being given away. The industry's needs call for the expenditure of more money, and have the money.” Arkoff hastily adds that he is speaking about “the judicious use of money,” and launches into a long anecdote about the director of the sequel to “Dr. Phibes” who spent good money to build sets so high that they would not even be seen on the screen. “If anybody tells you we've relaxed cost‐consciousness, and they're right, then I ought to be deposed!” “Every nickel we have up on the screen,” as production manager Elliot Schick phrases it, is a litany at AIP. “I feed my crews good lunches on location,” says Schick. “We give everybody the best single room the Holiday Inn has to offer.” Yet money‐saving incident after money‐saving incident pours from Schick's unending store. “We shot 18 days in the mansion in ‘Frogs’ for $1. The state of Florida gave it to us. We showed them it would be worth it because of the money we would spend in the area. For ‘Sugar Hill,’ a restaurant owner allowed us to shoot free for three days and even use their voodoo dancers because we were willing to order dinner for the crew. The dinners cost $5 per person, and we had to feed the crew somewhere. We bought all our old cars for ‘Dillinger’ as close to the Oklahoma la cation as possible. When the picture was finished, we sold them for a profit. People really paid extra to get the cars into which we'd put bullet holes.” ‘I will be condemned for saying this. I look upon movies as being merchandise, just as Woolworth's has a line of merchandise....’ Pennies are pinched in every conceivable way. AIP has no studio facilities of its own, and during the last five years none of the films it has made in the United States have been shot within studio walls. Says Robert Clouse, director of “Golden Needles,” “The Ambassador Hotel is costing us $500. And it would take thousands to duplicate the fading elegance of the Ambassador on a set.” Nor does AIP's penuriousness end when a movie is finished. “We never take a picture out of release,” says Arkoff. “Even after they've been on television, we continue to play them, something most studios won't do. When the prints start to go, we cannibalize them—a reel salvaged here, another reel there.” The hundreds and thousands of dollars AIP saves from never shooting inside a studio and never paying for anything it can get free, from combinations and cannibalizing of prints, are all pennyante games to the major studios, just as the satisfying $1,000,000 profits from “Dr. Phibes” or “Frogs” are laughable when placed besides the profits from an “Exorcist” or “Poseidon Adventure” or “French Connection.” AIP retaliates with disgust at the extravagances it does not allow. Unprompted, employe after employe expresses outrage at the excesses of “Darling Lili” (“Blake Edwards used to wait days for the proper cloud formations”) and at the $8,000,000 cost of Mike Nichols's “Day of the Dolphin.” “Nichols sent an airplane from the island on which they were shooting to Miami to pick up 21 copies of The New York Times,” says production manager Schick. The heart of AIP's operation is not on the streets or parking lots of Los Angeles where most of its pictures are filmed but in the Beverly Hills building where the production and sales departments scream at each other across the halls. “We are the only company that brings sales into a picture before production,” says Arkoff. Bringing the sales department in is a necessary evil. “The sales people think like exhibitors. If I have a new idea, they're negative. What did business before? Make another ‘Exorcist.’ But there's no sense making a picture if our sales department can't think how to merchandise it. “The word ‘exploitation’ has an evil connotation, but everything has to, be exploited. Even something presented with extreme dignity—‘Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams’ —must be exploited. You must be able to let people know about it, know why they should come to see it. We are a merchandising company. That may sound inele gant. But when you are, not dependent on the geniuses—the Fellinis—you're dependent on competent people. Producers and directors with a big hit think of themselves as geniuses. They take on the trappings of royalty. In Hollywood, 90 per cent of the people consider themselves geniuses. In actuality, 10 per cent are brightly creative, and the other 90 per cent do a competent, workmanlike job. ‘The standard Kung Fu feature will be dead by summer. To be successful, Kung Fu will have to be grafted onto other genres.’ “To make money, you must sell your pictures. If you have a picture that's not based on a presold book and doesn't have big stars, you obviously need more and different exploitation in relation to its cost. We got Ray Milland for ‘Frogs’ because ‘Love Story’ had brought him back to public attention. His price was reasonable, and his name gave the picture a kind of solidity, took it out of the category of something which only had 15 cents spent on it.” (Respectable actors such as Milland, Bette Davis, Shelley Winters, Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn have been showing up in AIP pictures recently in ever‐increasing frequency.) Some pictures have specific problems. Arkoff and his sales department went round and round over the title of “Golden Needles.” The golden needles refer to acupuncture needles. Will the public ‐misinterpret and think the film is a dope picture? The decision was made to stick with the title and write extremely explicit advertising copy. “But,” says Arkoff, “if we've guessed wrong, we can't undo it. You can change the style of an ad, but you can't change a title in midstream.” Almost of equal importance to selling is buying. Arkoff does his market research at the Cannes Film Festival. He sat “in the outside bar of the Carlton Hotel for hours.” Listening. Talking to distributors from Greece to Thailand to find out what films do well and where. “At my hotel,” he sighs, “there was also the president of a major American film company. He played tennis every day and went to parties.” Arkoff lights another cigar and ponders his company's 21st year. Although he is not willing to renege on his Woolworth's line, he is, he admits, “going to add a higher line.” AIP has already picked up “a wildly artistic film,” James Ivory's fictionalized version of the Fatty Arbuckle scandal, “The Wild Party,” starring Raquel Welch and James Coco. And the studio is involved with Warner Brothers in the $1,500,000 “The Destructors,” starring Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn and James Mason. But, still, the long hot summer will bring to the theater or drive‐in of your choice: “Foxy Brown” (Don't mess aroun’ with FOXY BROWN. She's the meanest chick in town) extracting a black superwoman's revenge from the white world; Isaac Hayes as a black skip‐tracer in “Truck Turner” (the last of the bounty hunters); “Madhouse” (If stark terror were ecstasy, living here would be sheer bliss). And “Golden Needles.” (From the mansions of Beverly Hills to the teeming waters of the China Seas, she sought the forbidden golden needles of Pleasure or Pain. For the one who owns them rules the world.) ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City's Birth Rate Slips To a Low in 6 Months,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/07/archives/citys-birth-rate-slips-to-a-low-in-6-months.html,"Extensive family‐planning services and the liberalized abortion program were credited yesterday with giving New York City its lowest birth rate in 75 years of record‐keeping. The rate for the first six months of this year was 13.5 per 1,000 population, according to the records of the City Health Department's Bureau of Vital Statistics. In that period, 53,336 live births were recorded. Dr. Jean Pakter, director of the department's Bureau of Maternity Services, said that in the last 10 years there had been a decline in birth rates here.

Licensing Rules Issued For Abortion Facilities,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/07/archives/licensing-rules-issued-for-abortion-facilities.html,"TRENTON, Aug. 6 (AP) —The State Department of Health issued emergency interim regulations today for abortion facilities receiving temporary state licenses. The regulations, which set the minimum standards required to operate an abortion facility, follow a decision made by the department last Wednesday to issue provisional licenses to the seven independent abortion clinics that have certificates of need for performance of abortions. The issuance of the interim rules was expected to end some of the confusion and legal fighting caused by delays in formulating state abortion regulations. Among the regulations are requirements that all staff members be licensed or registered, than all abortions be reported on special forms within 10 days and that facilities have a governing authority, a full‐time qualified administrator and a medical director.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's Far More to Abortion Than Finding the Best Price,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/10/archives/theres-far-more-to-abortion-than-finding-the-best-price-while.html,"Once a perilous, illegal and demeaning procedure, an abortion, while still having a deep psychological effect on many women, has become an operation where safety, legality and respectability have made immeasurable gains. Whileabortions are now legal and are performed by most physicians, some women insist on shopping around, “looking for a bargain” as if it were a supermarket special. Despite the fact that abortion, legalized by the Supreme Court in January, 1973, is now performed by most physicians, horror stories still surface often enough to keep government agencies on the trail of unqualified and unscrupulous practitioners. Medical and government experts agree that violators of law and ethics are rare black sheep in a large and honorable family, but that does not lessen the dangers they pose. Because abortion inevitably involves a degree of tension, some women are still vulnerable to deceptive advertising at best and malpractice at worst. For example, about 3,700 abortions were performed in the last year at the Central Women's Center, 333 East 29th Street. The clinic consented recently to a State Superior Court judgment obtained by State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz ordering the facility closed for a range of violations that included charges of unsanitary conditions, inadequate supervision and inaccurate record‐keeping. Why do women still seek treatment outside the medical mainstream? Why do they select an abortion service from newspaper advertisements as if it were a supermarket special? Some say it is the desire for secrecy; others, the pressure of time “And some women are looking for bargains,” said Dr. Jean Pakter, director of the New York City Department of Health Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning, whose jurisdiction includes surveillance of abortion facilities. “I can't understand why a woman who is discriminating about the clothes she buys thinks that for $40 she can get something worth $175,” Dr. Pakter added. The $175 to which she referred falls in the range of the $125 to $200 a woman can reasonably expect to pay a freestanding clinic for an abortion in the first 12 weeks or trimester. (A freestanding clinic is a facility independent of a hospital complex; some hospitals have clinics, too.) Fees can escalate if she has the Abortion done by a private gynecologist, if she has general anesthesia instead of local, and if she stays overnight in a hospital. For an abortion done in the second 12 weeks of pregnancy, rates normally run from about $300 to $400, plus hospital costs. A first trimester abortion is generally conducted by vacuum aspiration in which the uterus is emptied by suction. The second trimester abortion is most commonly a saline infusion that stimulates labor. Physicians and agencies surveyed on the ways to assure receiving a quality abortion agreed that price is hot the only criterion. In fact, before the decision to abort is reached, it is the responsibility of the clinic or hospital to establish that the patient is indeed pregnant, a step that the more careless services skimp on with inadequate tests—or skip altogether. “We find that we see approximately 20 women a week who aren't pregnant, and since we do 300 abortions a week, they represent 6 or 7 per cent of our caseload,” said Dr. Milton Danon, administrator of Parkmed, 475, Park Avenue South, one of the few proprietary clinics to gain respect and referrals from the medical establishment. Planned Parenthood of New York City, which performs 12,000 abortions a year in two facilities, conducts both a urine test and a pelvic examination. “The pelvic examination allows the physician not only to review the laboratory test but to evaluate if the uterus has begun to change, “ said Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of the group. “it also allows him to detect tubal pregnancies and to judge the length of pregnancy, which is critical since the simplest and safest procedure is performed in the first trimester.” Once the first trimester pregnancy has been confirmed, a woman may have the abortion done in a variety of facilities: a freestanding clinic, which may be nonprofit or proprietary; or a municipal, voluntary or proprietary hospital. By law, after 12 weeks, an abortion must be performed in a hospital. If a woman already has a private gynecologist, or is acquiring one, she is obviously advised to consult him or her. But no matter her situation, doctors and government agencies generally agree that most referral services, especially those that charge fees, should be avoided; authorities say they may be fronts for disreputable practitioners. There are, of course, acceptable referral services. Two recommended Should a woman go to a clinic or to a hospital? The choice is mainly a matter of budget, doctor—and the patient, by city officials are the Clearinghouse for Abortion Appointments of the Infant Care‐Family Planning Projects of the Department of Health (233‐3100) and the Family Planning Information Service of Planned Parenthood of New York City (677‐3040). Should a woman go to a clinic or to a hospital? Each has its proponents, and it appears that, barring complications, the choice is mainly a matter of the budget, the doctor and the patient's preference. Some people maintain that hospitals are better equipped to cope with emergencies and are more likely to offer one‐to‐one rapport between doctor and patient. Partisans of the clinics cite their generally lower fees, more flexible schedules and less formidable atmosphere. Although he is director of the outpatient service of Mount Sinai Hospital's gynecology department. Dr. Thomas Kerenyi approves the alternative of the freestanding clinics. “They fill a gap in, the medical deliliery system,” he said. “Even if money were no object, I wouldn't necessarily always recommend the hospital. It would depend on the patient's needs.” Dr. Pakter saw it differently. “All things being equal, the hospital offers a greater margin of safety,” she said. There are, of course, gradations of quality in all categories of hospitals, but many authorities advocate use of the municipal or voluntary hospital. Whatever the facility, the authorities agreed there are certain services a woman has the right to expect and certain questions she should ask. ACCREDITATION: The credentials of the physician can be checked with the New York State Registry of Physicians or with the county medical society. In addition, a patient might check to see if doctors are certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which means they have completed a three‐or four‐year residency in the speciality. Hospitals and clinics must be licensed by the State Department of Health. (Licenses can be checked with the Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning, 566–7076). The issue of licensing freestanding clinics is blurred by the lack of distinction between group practice and the clinic. A physician in group practice is not required to obtain licensing beyond his original accreditation from the State Department of Education, Thus a group practice need not be licensed even if it is indistinguishable in function from a clinic. Dr. Pakter suggests finding a clinic that is not only licensed but eligible for Medicaid. TESTS: A physical examination and complete blood workup are necessary. Patients with anemia, for example, must have the abortion done in a hospital. And if a woman with the Rh factor aborts, the conception still counts as a pregnancy and endangers any baby born of subsequent pregnancy. Problems can be averted with the administration of an Rh immune globulin at the time of the abortion. COUNSELING: It should be provided at all stages of the procedure to offer understanding of the abortion method, emotional support and sound contraceptive aid. “You should expect to be treated as an individual, not just another uterus passing by,” Dr. Danon of Parkmed said. FEES: Discussion of costs should be straightforward and such questions as, “Is anethesia included?” and “What is the coverage for emergency treatment?” answered. ANESTHESIA: Many physicians advocate that in the first trimester the choice of a general or local anesthesia be left to the individual. In the second trimester, because of the nature of the abortion at that period local anesthetics (usually a saline procedure) are routine. FACILITIES AND STAFF: While conceding that a nonprofessional would have difficulty judging a treatment room, Dr. Kerenyi advised, “Look around. Does it seem well set up, does it look clean and have good lighting? Will there be a doctor and nurse on hand, not only during the abortion but after? In the case of a freestanding clinic, what sort of backup affiliation does it have with a hospital.” POSTOPERATIVE SERVICES: What are the recovery room facilities? Two hours is considered the minmum a woman should remain for observation. Will she be given a phone number of a physician for inquiries or emergencies? A checkup within two to three weeks is considered mandatory. And If she chooses her doctor or her facility wisely, a woman runs only the smallest risk. As Dr. Karlis Adamsons, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Mount Sinai Medical School, put it: “During 1973, 177,000 abortions were performed without a single mortality. I don't know of any medical procedure of comparable complexity that can compete with that track record.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary and Index SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1974",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/10/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-presidency.html,"The Presidency Gerald Rudolph Ford assumed the Presidency at 11:35 A.M. yesterday, the moment that former President Nixon's letter of resignation was handed to Secretary of State Kissinger. Twenty‐eight minutes later, at 12:03 P.M. the 38th President of the United States took the oath of office administered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in the East Room of the White House. Friends, Cabinet members and Congressional colleagues from both parties crowded the room, where barely two hours earlier Mr. Nixon bade an emotional good‐by to his Cabinet and top aides. [1:7–8.] Immediately after the swearing‐in ceremony, Mr. Ford took control of the Presidency and moved to give it a character and shape different from that of his predecessor. He named a four‐member committee of former elected officials to oversee the transition from the Nixon Administration and to make recommendations for staff changes. The four are William W. Scranton, Donald M. Rumsfeld, Rogers C. B. Morton and John O. Marsh. All four had served with Mr. Ford in the House. [1:6.] Mr. Nixon, with tears in his eyes, bade an emotional good‐by in the White House to the remaining members of his Administration. He urged them to be proud of their record in Government, and warned them against bitterness, self‐pity and revenge. He and members of his family then flew to the Nixon estate in San Clemente, Calif. They were greeted by more than 5,000 people when the plane landed at El Toro Marine Air Base. [1:1.] Mr. Nixon's prospects for escaping prosecution in the Watergate case remained in doubt. He lost what immunity from prosecution that he may have had when he resigned, and the office of the special Watergate prosecutor said that a decision on whether to prosecute him had not been made. The new White House press secretary, J. F. terHorst, said that President Ford was not likely to grant a pardon to Mr. Nixon. He recalled that last fall Mr. Ford at his Senate confirmation hearings on his nomination as Vice President, said that the public probably would “not stand for such a pardon. [1:5–6.] The disposition and even ownership of the vast amount of Presidential records left behind by Mr. Nixon in the White House and the National Archives, some of which could be used as evidence in the forthcoming Watergate trials, was a recurring question in Washington. Some members of Congress urged impoundment of the documents, and others demanded that the Watergate investigation be continued. [1:4.] Two hours after he was sworn in as President, Mr. Ford, assisted by Secretary of State Kissinger, advised envoys of foreign governments that despite his inexperience in international affairs, he would pursue the same foreign policy objectives that brought worldwide respect to Mr. Nixon. He held brief meetings in the White House with about 60 envoys, either in groups or individually. The meetings went on into the early evening. [1:5–6.] International The change in United States leadership was greeted around the world with expressions of hope that American policies would be unchanged, and words of relief that the long turmoil in Washington was ending. President Ford's announcement that he would keep Henry A. Kissinger as Secretary of State was taken as an indication that there would be continuity in American foreign policy. [6:1.2.] National The General Motors Corporation announced an average price increase of $480, or 9.5 per cent, in the average price of its 1975 automobiles and trucks that will go on sale in September. The increase will include $130 for the cost of Government‐required pollution control equipment, and $350 for increased labor and material costs. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation also said that their 1975 models will be more expensive. Ford estimates a general increase of 8 per cent over its 1974 prices and Chrysler indicated that its 1975 prices will be similar to those of Ford and General Motors. [1:2–3.] Metropolitan The Taxi Drivers Union rejected a new contract offer of the city's fleet owners, which had projected increases of $3,75 to $4.60 a day for drivers and $10 weekly pay increases in each year of a three‐year contract for inside employes.

Rules on Abortion Clinics Filed,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/11/archives/rules-on-abortion-clinics-filed-the-conscience-clause.html,"TRENTON — The longawaited breakthrough in the fight to make abortions easily available and inexpensive for New Jersey women took place last week. The action simply amounted to Dr. Joanne E. Finley, the State's new Health Commissioner, filing with the office of the Secretary of State health regulations governing abortion clinics. Dr. Finley's action was significant in that it will allow temporary licenses to be issued to the seven clinics that have been waiting for months to begin performing the controversial operations. The regulations apply to abortions performed in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, the first 24 weeks. According to Dr. Watson E. Neiman, the state's Deputy Commissioner of Health, the Atlantic Abortion Clinic in Atlantic City already has received its license. Other clinics awaiting licenses are the Pilgrim Medical Group in Montclair and Union, the Englewood Medicenter, Alternatives, Inc., of Atlantic City, the Palisades Medical Group in Englewood Cliffs and the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Jersey City. The ‘Conscience Clause’ The licenses will cover an interim period of several months while Attorney General William F. Hyland determines whether some of the regulations, particularly those pertaining to the “conscience clause,” are constitutional. The clause allows hospitals to refuse to perform abortions. The Health Department's action is seen as a response to the need for abortions all over the state. The state's Health Planning Council estimates that more than 41,000 women in the state will seek abortions in 1975. A survey conducted earlier this year revealed that half of New Jersey's 90 hospitals are refusing to perform abortions. Furthermore, while the hospital cost for such operations average about $350, the fee in clinics is expected to be about $125. Most physicians describe a routine abortion as a simple medical procedure. The move to issue temporary licenses to clinics will not immediately help one of the earliest challenges of the state's abortion policies, Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood Cliffs. He and his associates are awaiting a clinic license for their Palisades Medical Group. Fees on Sliding Scale For months, the group's doctors had been performing an average of 150 abortions a week without a license. Their fee, an average of $100, was based on a sliding scale related to the financial need of the patient; the top price was $135. The state has never challenged Dr. Livingston and his associates, reportedly because it feared it would lose in court. “The Health Department licenses cannot be obtained until all zoning, building‐code requirements and police and fire laws have been met,” Dr. Livingston said the other day. “We are planning to build on a new site when we have a clinic license, and we won't have the zoning and other requirements settled for months.” The temporary regulations issued last week are “more lenient” than those promulgated earlier. Dr. Neiman said. For instance, a controversial regulation that 48 hours elapse between the time of diagnosis and the time of the operation has been reduced to 24 hours; also, the patient can have the pregnancy test done at the office of her private physician and then go to a clinic for the operation 24 hours later. Although the clinics are still required to be affiliated with a nearby hospital, they will not be required to operate their own blood banks or X‐ray laboratories. Omitting those regulations is intended to save money for the clinics and aid them in supplying low‐cost abortions, particularly for Medicaid patients. In January, 1973, the United States Supreme Court ruled that states could not interfere with abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and also could not restrict a woman's right to abortion in the second trimester, or 13th through 24th weeks of pregnancy. For the last trimester, the court said, the state must proscribe health standards for abortions, except where the life of the mother is involved. Proabortionists believe that women have an inherent right to choose whether or not they wish to have an abortion, and they see any laws restricting such operations as infringing on personal rights. Antabortionists view the operation as murder of the innocent. The State Legislature approved last month a “right of conscience” bill, which permits hospitals and individuals to refuse to perform abortions as a matter of conscience. Although Governor Bryne is expected to sign the measure, the right of hospitals to refuse to perform the operations is being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ford Seeks Suggestions For a New Vice President,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/11/archives/ford-seeks-suggestions-for-a-new-vice-president-asks-gop.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 10—President Ford asked for VicePresidential suggestions today from Republicans in Congress, in governors' offices and on his party's national committee. He has asked that preferences be listed in one–two–three order, sealed in envelopes for his eyes only, and presented to the White House by next Wednesday. J. F. terHorst, the White House press secretary, who made the announcement today. said Mr. Ford would also consult Democratic leaders in Congress, House Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma and the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, as well as his personal staff and advisers before making his choice. Mr. Ford offered no specifications for the job that he occupied for eight months and three days before succeeding to the Presidency yesterday. “I have not heard any qualifications specified with respect to geography, politics or ideological coloration,” Mr. terHorst said. In outlining a consultation process that could involve as many as 300 or more ballots, Mr. terHorst emphasized that President Ford of course retained the power of decision. No ‘Beauty Contest’ “I'm sure the President is not going to run a beauty contest,” his spokesman said, “and do it on the basis of the most votes.” The balloting, however, is another gesture at the sort of openness. Mr. Ford has emphasized in his first days in office, and it also creates an interval for his own deliberation. Mr. Ford told Congressional leaders yesterday he would send them a nomination within about 10 days. Mr. terHorst said President Ford would use “essentially the same procedure President Nixon did” in choosing him to succeed former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew last fall. Yet other Republicans have been recalling this week that President Nixon, having solicited advice on the Agnew vacancy, went ahead and nominated Mr. Ford before many suggestions could have been weighed. And by one widely published account, Mr. Nixon chose Mr. Ford largely on the advice of his then‐counselor, Melvin R. Laird, an old Ford ally who remains a central figure in the Vice‐Presidential discussions today. Mr. Laird, the Secretary of Defense in the first Nixon term and a member of the House before that, has been mentioned as a Vice‐Presidentia?? possibility himself, But he has let it be known all week that he thinks the job should go to Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former New York Governor?? who again today was the central figure in speculation and sparring among Republican politicians. Mr. Rockefeller canceled a long‐scheduled news conference in Bangor, Me last night to avoid adding to the speculation. But at a Maine Republican fund‐raising dinner he was introduced anyway as “soonto‐be Vice President Rockefeller” by Stanley Tupper, a former Representative who knew President Ford in the House. Foes of Rockefeller Meanwhile, in Albany, the New York State Right to Life committee said it had wired President Ford “not to select former Governor Rockefeler on the basis of his stanch support for abortion and other forms of social killing.” Conservative Republicans in Congress, led by Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina, have rallied behind Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona as one means of countering the Rockefeller boomlet. Yet it has also become clear that Mr. Rockefeller, if chosen, would face no serious political resistance from the conservatives. Clarke Reed of Mississippi, the influential leader of the Republican state chairmen in the South, has pronounced Mr. Rockefeller “acceptable,” and Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina said he could approve the New Yorker though he wasn't Mr. Thurmond's first choice.” Senator John G. Tower of Texas, another conservative, said, “I think that Nelson Rockefeller is not as unpopular with conservative Republicans as some might imagine.” Senator Bill Brock of Tennessee said that it was “difficult to challenge” Mr. Rockefeller's credentials. “He'll be readily acceptable by a great majority” of the Republican party, Mr. Brock said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Legal Abortion Clinic Opens in an Aging Hotel,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/12/archives/legal-abortion-clinic-opens-in-an-aging-hotel.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, Aug. 11—South Jersey's first legal abortio nclinic — the second in the state — began operations here yesterday with its doctor performing 12 abortions. The price of an abortion is $200. Michael Land of Margate, a lawyer and president of Atlantic Abortion Clinic, Inc., said he expected that 1,000 abortions would be performed during the clinic's first year of service. When the clinic, off the lobby of the President Towers, 13‐story aging apartment‐hotel at Albany Avenue and the Boardwalk, opened in the morning seven patients were on hand in the waiting room. One young patiet read Modern Screen, a film magazine, as she waited her turn. A middle‐aged graying woman read The Ladies Home Journal. Outside, on the Boardwalk and along Albany Avenue, 50 anti‐abortion pickets paraded in disorganized fashion. They carried signs bearing slogans, such as “Never to Laugh or Love, nor taste the Summertime . . Fight Abortion!” and “Abortion means $ $ $ to a few doctors. Money over life.” The straggling picket line was made up mostly of young mothers, two husbands, and sprinkling of teen‐agers. Mr. Land said the clinic staff was comprised of a doctor, a nurse, five other employes and himself. Mr. Land said his corporation had waited 17 months for the issuance of the state license, which limits abortions to the first trimester 18 weeks of pregnancy. Some anti‐abortion pickets yesterday said the clinic was licensed to perform therapeutic abortions on second and third trimester fetuses, but Mr. Land denied this. A therapeutic abortion is one performed When a physician rules that the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. Such abortions have been routinely and legally performed for years in New Jersey hospitals prior to the United States Supreme Court's ruling January, 1973, which opened the way for Creation of abortion clinics. Mr. Land indicated that his clinic's state license forbade therapeutic abortions of fetuses in the last two trimesters, and that those pregnant women would have to go to Atlantic City Medical Center or some other hospital for their abortion.

WOMAN TO OPPOSE OREGON SENATOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/12/archives/woman-to-oppose-oregon-senator-democratic-state-legislator-runs.html,"BAKER, Ore., Aug. 11—The Oregon Democratic Central Committee nominated State Senator Betty Roberts today to run against the Republican incumbent, Robert W. Packwood, Sor the United States Senate race this fall. Senator Roberts, who is 51 years old, replaces former Senator Wayne Morse, who was. nominated in the May primary but who died of a kidney failure on July 22. The committee's 72 members, two from each county voting on the basis of Demotratic registration in their counties, gave Senator Roberts 400,310 votes out of nearly 700,000 possible votes. Trailing her were the State Senate President, Jason Boe, who was defeated by Mr. Morse in the primary, and Raoul P. Smith, a former District Attorney in an eastern Oregon county who ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General two years ago. Committee members, meeting in this livestock and logging region of northeastern Oregon, selected Senator Roberts after four ballots. Most of her support came from representatives of urban counties. After the vote, Senator Roberts said she believed Mr. Packwood “has not earned a reputation in the Senate for being a person who has contributed a great deal. He has not established any significant position.” The Democratic State Convention, which preceded the committee meeting, passed a resolution urging the House of Representatives to continue the impeachment process against former President Richard M. Nixon. “The United States Government must make an official judgment on his conduct of the Presidency in order that clear standards may be set for all future Presidents,” the resolution stated. Senator Roberts said she would not support such a move. Senator Roberts has served three terms in the House of Representatives and two in the State Senate. She ran second In the May Democratic primary for Governor. She is a lawyer in the Portland firm of her husband, former State Representative Keith Skelton. For Abortions The most important issues in a Senate race, in her view, are the environment, inflation and curbing military spending. Considered a liberal, she favors antipollution measures, energy conservation, land planning and the right of women to have abortions freely. She has called for more careful study of nuclear power plants because of potential environmental hazards. In 1971, Senator Roberts fought for passage of Oregon's “bottle bill” that now requires beer and soft drinks to be packaged in returnable bottles and bans pull‐tabs on aluminum cans. Born on Feb. 5, 1923, she grew up in Texas and moved to Oregon in 1945. She has degrees in education, political science and law, and she teaches part time at a community college. Senator Roberts has been married three times and has four children and three grandchildren.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ford Gets Recommendations for a Vice President,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/14/archives/ford-gets-recommendations-for-a-vice-president-wide-backing-in.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 —George Bush of Texas and Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York were the talk of the Capitol today as House and Senate Republicans submitted their Vice‐Presidential recommendations for President Ford's consideration tomorrow. But Mr. Bush, chairman of the Republican National Committee and former Governor Rockefeller were among the millions waiting for the first hint of Mr. Ford's choice. The President is expected to nominate his successor in the VicePresidency later this week, after considering the views he solicited from party leaders in Congress and the states. Mr. Bush, a former Representative and United Nations ambassador who preserved a “nice guy” reputation as party chairman through the long Watergate affair, was described today as “everybody's second choice,” “And that's sometimes a good place to be” said Senator John G. Tower of Texas, who joined Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona and the two Republican Senators from Oklahoma in declaring Mr. Bush his own favorite. Wide Backing in House Mr. Bush also had wide support in the House: Representative John J. Rhodes of Arizona, the Republican leader, said that Mr. Bush had “a leg up” for the job. Mr. Bush has unusually broad assets, as one of Mr. Rhodes's aides viewed them today: impeccable Eastern credentials through his family (his father was a Senator from Connecticut) and his education (Milton Academy and Yale) and 25 years of business and political connections in Houston, where he settled after Navy service in World War II and made a fortune in his own oil drilling business. At 50 years of age, he has had practical experience in Congress, diplomacy and politics. He also has a boyish profile, a handsome wife and five children. Representatives Alan Steelman, Republican of Texas, and C. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, were both wearing “Bush” campaign buttons today to suggest the breadth of his support. But the buttons were also reminders of the big Senate races Mr. Bush lost in Texas in 1964 and 1970. Attractive Campaigner Influential Republicans in the Senate and in President Ford's inherited Cabinet suggested that the Bush boom was only a means for politicians to duck controversy. In their view, he is a muted partisan and an attractive campaigner but still unqualified for major responsibility. Still others suggested that President Ford wanted nothing more than that. “He certainly doesn't convey the impressionthat he desperately needs anybody's support,” a Republican leader in the Senate said. New endorsements for Mr. Rockefeller came today from Representative Delbert L. Latta, an Ohio Republican and a vocal defender of the Nixon Administration until its last days, and Gov. Christopher Bond of Missouri, among others. Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina, who has organized conservative Republicans in both branches of Congress to promote Senator Barry Goldwater for the Vice‐Presidency, said today, “We've had a bushel basket full of telegrams from Republicans around the country who are behind Goldwater; at least half of them say Rockefeller won't do.” Many raise objection to Mr. Rockefeller's second marriage, Senator Helms said, and also to the abortion law that Mr. Rockfeller signed in New York. “The President is bound to realize he'll alienate a lot of conservative Republicans if he does nominate Rockefeller,” he said. Yet the question involving Mr. Rockefeller was viewed as less a matter of liberal or conservative politics than as a puzzle about whether Mr. Ford wanted a strong or a weak Vice President. Mr. Rockefeller, four times elected Governor of New York, a world‐famous multimillionaire with long experience in foreign affairs and government bureaucracy, would bring more political power to the Vice‐Presidency than anyone since Lyndon B. Johnson, who as the Democratic leader in the Senate, joined John. F. Kennedy's ticket in 1960. But even old friends of Mr. Ford are not sure whether he wants that much strength in the Vice‐Presidency, or indeed what he is looking for. J. F. terHorst, the President's press secretary, said today that Mr. Ford was reserving the Vice‐Presidential decision to himself. He dismissed the speculation that consideration had already been narrowed down to Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bush and Senator Howard H. Baker of Tennessee. Democrats in the House said today that confirmation hearings on Mr. Rockefeller could take months if investigators made a complete audit of the Rockefeller fortune. Hugh Morrow, a spokesman for Mr. Rockefeller, said, “We haven't discussed that in any detail.” In the past, he said, before Watergate and before politicians came under public pressure to disclose tax returns and assets, Mr. Rockefeller stated simply that “He has paid income taxes in seven figures” — that is, more than a million dollars—“every year for the last 35 years.

Population Boom and Food Shortage: World Losing Fight for Vital Balance,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/14/archives/population-boomandfood-shortage-worldlosing-fight-for-vital-balance.html,"A world fragmented by differences in race, religion and social and economic conditions is at last taking cognizance of one of its most fundamental common problems: population. The worsening world food situation, long regarded mainly as a problem of production, has become one also of consumption: How many mouths have to be fed? Recent shortages of oil and other commodities likewise have elevated to uncomfortable urgency the long‐avoided issue of how long the inhabitants of a finite planet —only 8,000 miles in diameter — can keep on multiplying. This is another in a series of articles, which will appear from time to time, examining the world food situation. The earth's surface, experts say, has the potential of producing adequate nutrition for far more people than there are now. But realization of that potential seems further away than are addi tional billions of hungry people. In recent months other shortages, imminent or incipient, have been highlighted—energy, fertilizers, chemicals and minerals. In the last generation, social and economic pressures have impelled many nations, from China and India to Mexico, to institute fertilityreduction programs, usually under the title of “family planning.” But any worldwide effort to slow humanity's proliferation was so controversial that government leaders sedulously ignored the problem until recent years. By 1972, concern had crystallized sufficiently for the U.N's General Assembly to designate 1974 as World Population Year, a period for concerted international attention to the problem, and to convoke the first global population conference at the governmental level. It will be held at Bucharest, Aug. 19–30. There is no expectation that the conference will produce any miraculous global plan for quickly defusing the “population bomb.” What is hoped for is a consensus on the problems of unbridled population growth, recognition of the manifold options for mitigating those threats, and agreement, at least in principle, on remedial efforts. Anthropplogists have deduced that once there were only a few hundred thousand humans on earth. Their rate of multiplication was insignificant in relation to the space and resources available. Indeed, proliferation was the prime objective—to offset the attrition of disease and other calamities, to furnish more hands for a civilization depending upon manual labor for its physical accomplishments. The Trend of Growth By A.D. 1000—after a million years of unwritten human history—there were not many more people on earth than there are in the United States today, about 275 million. By 1800 there were still less than one billion. By 1900 there were only 1.6 billion. Then modern medicine began making inroads against the maladies that had kept Population down. People began living longer and producing more children, who survived to become adults and produce more children. Between 1900 and 1970, the world's population more than doubled; according to United Nations demographers, from 1.6 billion to 3.6 billion. Today the total is approaching four billion. It is compounding at a rate of 2 per cent a Year—a deceptively small, number that actually means two more persons each second, 200,000 more a day, over six million more a month and about 74 million a year. Each additional person pushes all of these numbers a little higher. Unless that rate is reduced, in less than 35 years—within the lifetime of many of today's adults—there will be twice as many people on earth as there are now. And, unless the supportive elements of the meager standards of living now endured by much of humanity are augmented as population increases, living standards inevitably will decline, aggra vating deprivation, discontent and disorder. The Government of India, for instance, has observed that adequately serving its annual population increase of 12 million calls for 2.5‐million more homes, 400,000 teachers and four million jobs —four new homes a minute, 1,000 new teachers a day, 11,000 new jobs a day. “India makes no contention that the quotas are achieved. Brazil would have to double its food production in the next 18 years to :keep up with its, population. A classic case of the losing race is that of the Aswan Dam in Egypt. In the decade that it was under construction, population growth more than offset the additional agriculture and energy it provided. The same situation exists, in various degrees, in many countries. Globally, the prospects are dim that supportive elements can keep pace with population growth. Limitations on world resources, or on man's ingenuity in distributing them, have become all too obvious. World population long since outstripped food supplies. The estimates are that as many as half the world's people are chronically undernourished, and that weekly, more than 10,000 people die of starvation. The global population growth rate of 2 per cent annually derives from national growth rates ranging from slightly less than zero in the case of East Germany to 3.4 per cent in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Paraguay. The figures are from the authoritative Population Reference Bureau, a research organization in Washington. A 3.5 per cent growth rate would double the population in 20 years. Principal Growth Areas The world's population growth comes principally from the “developing” or underdeveloped countries of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The underdeveloped countries have about two‐thirds of the world's population and the highest birth rates. For every birth in the developed countries, there are five in the underdeveloped countries. Of the earth's 71 million new inhabitants in 1972, according to the United States Agency for International Development, more than 13.3 million were produced by the 800 million people of Communist China (although its growth rate is a relatively modest 1.7 per cent); and 12.8 million by the 600 million people of India, which has a growth rate of 2.5 per cent. The third largest source was Indonesia, with an annual increase of about 3.5 million people. The fourth largest contributor was Brazil, whose 2.8 million additional people exceeded the Soviet Union's 2.2 million. Mexico added more people to the world (1.8 million) than Japan (1.4 million), a contribution met by Nigeria and slightly exceeded by the United States (1.3 million). Responsibility for Growth Although numerically, the responsibility for population growth rests chiefly with the developing countries, demographers and economists point out that population in itself is virtually an abstraction. Its meaning lies chiefly in its relation to resources and the consumption of them. From this standpoint, the responsibility is that of the advanced nations. A person in a developing country may be lucky to get a pound of grain, or its equivalent, a day. In the advanced nations, per capita consumption is five times that. While the developed countries have only about a third of the world's population, they consume about 60 per cent of world energy production. The distribution of other basic commodities is similarly disproportionate. Accordingly, in terms of world resources—the crux of the population question—rich and poor nations face the same thicket of issues, together. An Oversimplification A notion has long been widespread that population conof was largely a matter of teaching “backward” peoples about birth control, particularly in countries where the Roman Catholic Church was dominant. Recent studies and experience have convinced leading demographers that that is an oversimplification. Birth rates are as high in many non‐Catholic countries as in Catholic ones. While papal dogma forbids “artificial” contraception and abortion, the church has been a strong advocate of “family planning” — through such means as the rhythm method of contraception—and has participated prominently in worldwide efforts to curb excessive reproduction. There is mounting evidence that birth rates around the world are linked to other factors than religion. The annual birth rates in two Catholic countries, Italy and France, are respectively 16.8 and 16.9 per 1,000 population—close to the United State's 15.6 and less than the Soviet Union's 17.8. The first nation to institute family planning services was the Soviet Union, in 1920—although not with any avowed aim of lessening population growth. The first “developing” nation to implement a growthreduction policy, with an extensive family planning campaign, was India, in 1952. Today, according to the Population Council, a research organization in New York, of 120 developing nations, about 30 have official policies aimed at reducing their population growth rates About 30 others, including most of the Latin American countries, have “family planning” programs aimed at public welfare rather than population limitation. These two categories cover 87 per cent of the population of the “under‐developed” world. Some 60 developing nations are classified as indifferent or opposed to the idea of reducing population growth. Disappointing Results While national birth‐control efforts — including the large‐scale distribution of contraceptives and voluntary sterilizations—have had observable results, they have largely been disappointing. India hoped to reduce its 1968 birth rate of 41 per 1,000 population to 25 by 1976. It has come down only to 37; the target date has been deferred to 1980; and India cut back on its birth control program last fall to save money, as “non‐essential.” “The only populous less developed country which appears largely to have overcome the logistical and economic obstacles through providing family planning services is the People's Republic of China,” according to Lester Robert Brown, a demographer associated with the Overseas Development Council. Studying the paradox of why high birth rates are associated with underdeveloped countries, where people can least afford to have children, demographers have concluded that a prime reason is people's instinct for security: Children are the main protection against the buffets of life. “Even where a policy dis couraging large families is followed, and birth control means are offered,” said a recent United Nations study, “the effects are minimal if couples are not motivated to limit the number of children. Motivation for limiting family size oftens seems to be related to economic and social improvements in the society at large.” “Where security is provided, in terms of governmental stability, health care, education and economic improvement, birth rates tend to drop spontaneously, as they have in the advanced nations fthe West.” “Birth rates db not usually decline voluntarily,” said Mr. Brown. [without] an assured food supply, literacy and at least rudimentary health services.” Sharp Drops Noted Conversely, he added, “There is now striking evidence that in an increasing number of poor countries, birth rates have dropped sharply despite relatively low per‐capita income and despite the absence or relative newness of family planning programs. “Examination of societies as different as China, Barbados, Sri Lanka, Uruguay, Taiwan, the Indian Punjab, Cuba and South Korea suggests a common factor. “In all of these countries,” he continued, “a large portion of the population has gained access to modern social and economic services—such as education, health, employment and credit systems—to a far greater degree than in most poor countries.” The professional conclusion from all this is that slowed, population growth and socio‐economic betterment are interacting that one depends on the other, and that, aaordingly, both objectives must be pursued simultaneously. “Population policies cannot be considered separately from broader questions of development,” a recent U.N. report said. “A high level of social and economic development is generally accompanied by a reduction in fertility. “Without reduction in the rate of population growth, however, economic development may be severely jeopardized. At the same time, without economic development and without radical transformation in the structures of society, reduction in the rate of population growth will be hard to achieve. Moreover, reducing the growth rate will not be enough to solve the problems of poverty,” the report said. The science—or art—of effectively coupling international population‐reduction efforts' with economic development assistance is still in its infancy, and is one of the main subjects to be explored at the Bucharest conference. The principal governmental effort aimed at stemming the world's population increase is the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, established in 1967. With the task of providing financial and informational assistance for population management programs, its current budget is only about $50‐million. A major nongovernmental effort is the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which is helping family planning organizations in 80 countries, on a far smaller budget. Mr. Brown, of the Overseas Development Council, estimates that throughout the world, about $3‐billion a year is being spent on population control — contrasted with $200‐billion in military appropriations. “There is probably no expenditure of funds which can approach the effectiveness of family planning services in breaking the self‐reinforcing cycle of poverty and high fertility,” he said. But, he added that reaching the approximately two billion people who need such services, exclusive of Communist China, at a nominal. annual cost of 41 per person, calls for the additional expenditure of $2‐billion a year. At least half of that would have to come from the international community. Given present growth trends and the scope of current population reproduction efforts, many experts do not foresee that human proliferation will even start to taper off significantly before the year 2,000, when the world's population has approached eight billion and there has already been an inestimable amount of human misery. Speaking for a more hopeful school of social scientists, Mr. Brown, in his new book, “In the Human Interest,” written as a sort of handbook for the World Population Year, outlines ways in which, by massive national and international efforts, world population growth might be slowed down and stabilized at less than six billion “early in the 21st century.” A prognostication on which experts of all stripes find themselves in agreement was voiced by the president of the World Bank, Robert McNamara: “The population problem will be solved one way or another. Our only option is whether it is to be solved rationally and humanely or irrationally and inhumanely.” THE FRESH AIR FUND: FRESH IDEA: GIVE TO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Television/Radio,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/18/archives/what-sort-of-behavior-control-should-tv-impose-on-children-violence.html,"BEHAVIOR Control Through Media” was the title of a conference held last spring, and it caused one network news executive to blow his stack. The executive, replying to an invitation to participate in the conference, called the whole thing a waste of time. The very title of the conference, he fumed, was an insult. His reaction to the idea of such a conference, which took place at the headquarters of its sponsor, the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences in Hastings, N.Y., was predictable: Nobody in television likes to think of himself as a controller of behavior. There is an Orwellian ring to that sort of self‐image — too much like Big Brother coming onto the TV screen to inform the citizenry that, peace is war and freedom is slavery. But in plain fact, it is foolhardy to maintain that the media, and TV in particular, do not influence our behavior. The statistics prove that we Americans devote more time to watching television than we do to studying, playing tennis,, eating, making love or even spending money. And in the process, we are subjected to a constant barrage of “messages.” Surely those messages enter our intellectual blood stream, in much the same way that the food we eat becomes an integral part of our bodies. Althotigh we may vigorously resist the idea that we are being “controlled,” our behavior nonetheless is influenced. All of which raises the question: Are we in fact free agents, able to accept or reject what we see, or are many of our attitudes molded without our consent, and perhaps without our even being aware of the process? Most people like to think of themselves as free agents. Certainly the participants at the conference possessed that view of themselves. We Were all professionals — journalists, psychologists, political scientists, psychiatrists, scholars. All of us were chary of the term “behavior control”—no one more so than a certain advertising executive whose very job is to influence behavior. He kept issuing disclaimers about the power of advertising, to the point where one began to suspect that the. Madison Avenue boys are only a hair more effective than the hucksters who used to peddle snake oil from the tailgate of a wagon. The group's aversion to the idea of “control” surfaced in the surprisingly vehement reaction to a report by Dr. Robert M. Liebert, a child psychologist on the faculty at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, on Long Island. He told of experiments that indicated that sensitivity to real‐life violence may be dulled by exposure to “entertainment” violence on TV. For example, one such experiment demonstrated conclusively that children who had just seen a violent TV flim were less likely to summon an adult to quell a subsequent pushing‐and‐shoving squabble among their peers. Dr. Liebert is so convinced of the harmful effects of televised violence on children that he is now making 30‐second spots for TV to demonstrate to children that there are non‐violent, nonaggressive alternative for solving problems. For example, in one spot (distributed as a public service by the Broadcasting and Film Commission of the National Council of Churches and already shown on all three networks) two children are running toward the one empty swing in a playground. They arrive at the same time, and each child grabs an end of the swing. Impasse. The kids must either fight or find some other way to resolve the situation. Finally they decide to take turns. Both kids are winners; nobody loses. The outburst that followed Liebert's presentation flashed around the conference table. Did he believe he had a right to deliberately try to impose values on children? Whose values were they? Should children indeed be taught cooperation? Did ghetto kids perhaps need to be taught to slug it out in order to survive in this society? Was it not, in fact, immoral to create a TV advertisement the prime function of which was to influence kids' behavior? Liebert was accused of hubris, manipulation and even brainwashing. One would have thought he had proposed setting up Hitler Youth Camps on Sesame Street. He was nonplussed. He had not expected that a 30‐second spot about cooperativeness in sharing a swing would have raised such a furor. However, I understood why the hackles had gone up around that conference table. I am one of those people who is terrified of manipulation. A Skinnerian world filled with conditioned people scares the daylights out of me — even if those people do hate war and do love their fellow man. I agree with Nobel Prize‐winner George Wald that we reduce our unpredictability at our grave risk. “Our technology, he says, “has given us dependable machines and livestock. We shall now have to choose whether to turn it to giving us more reliable, convenient and efficient men, at the cost of our freedom.” And yet I was acutely aware, as the discussion swirled around me, that perhaps we are already being subjected to more influence than we wish to admit. We assume that there is an attitude of laissez‐faire now operating in the television system, that ideas compete in the marketplace for acceptance and that the result is a healthy diversity. Except for a minority of individuals given to conspiracy theories, most people do not really believe that the men in the executive suites want to knead us like lumps of clay. The presidents of ABC and CBS and NBC care little if we chant the thoughts of Mao or of Robert Welch, as long as we snap on the dial, The sponsors want us to buy their products; they don't care a fig for what we think about impeachment or detente or national health insurance or the highway fund. Accordingly, this should lead to a halthy diversity. But, in fact, does it? I believe that it does not. Television is indeed a marketplace, and the values of the marketplace prevail. If it sells, it's good. The sponsors are the base on which the entire structure of commercial TV rests. The sponsors advertise on television because it helps to sell their products. The commercials are anything but value‐free. They are loaded with values. They deliberately encourage traits that increase consumption. Acquisitiveness is one; the commercials tell us that it is important to possess things because status can be gained through consumption. Cleanliness bordering on the antiseptic is another; women are told they can win approval by using all sorts of household aids to keep the house and the laundry shining. And then, of course, there's the whole area of selfindulgence: Desires should be instantly gratified. (“You only go around once, so you've got to grab for all the gusto you can get!”) Maybe nobody in those ad agencies is sitting around thinking about how he can manipulate my kids. What he wants is to sell his product. Manipulation may not be his prime function. But does that make the manipulation any less real? Of course, it is not only in the commercials that marketplace values reign supreme. Programing is affected as well. When the ad executive was trying to prove that TV advertising is not all that powerful, he noted that a TV commercial may change the buying patterns of only one person in 5,000. That being so, sponsors have to reach a huge market — in the multiple millions —to get results that will show up on the Sales sheets. It soon becomes obvious that if you are going to program for the widest possible mass audience, blandness is your safest beta You can't afford to offend people, or make them unhappy or ask them to think about things that are unpleasant. You'd best not give them “Hamlet” or documentaries. Controversy sits like an undigested lump in the stomach of television. Maude's abortion, and the cancellation of “Sticks and Bones” and the flap over the mild political comedy of the Smothers brothers attest to that. Certainly there are exceptions, like the barbed comedy of “All in the Family,” the irreverence of Dan Rather and such informative documentaries as those on the workings of the Pentagon and on pension funds. But when you consider the hours of bilge pumped onto the screen every day, you realize that the exceptions few indeed. The programs watched by children—the most vulnerable segment of the population — hustle products with the oozy charm of the con man, My four‐year‐old daughter knows all the brand names and the lingo. As I was cooking breakfast one morning recently, she came in and announced: “You make better French toast than any other leading mommy!” My seven‐year‐old Steven is already cynical. He realizes that the TV lies: that the lady telling him that Gleem is the best toothpaste is just an actress getting paid to say it. I can tell him that. But how do I counter the more subtle value influences? How do I get him to understand that happiness is not having things, that sometimes it is better to defer gratification than to grab for it? The violence that disturbs psychologists like Bob Liebert is another marketplace device. Children's programs are geared for a disparate group — the 2‐to 11‐year‐old market, as it is called in the trade. The best way to attract the attention of a group that is so widely varied in age is to give them action — usually translated ss violence. If the kids don't watch, they don't:see the ad. If they don't see the ad, they won't nudge their parents to buy the product. Violence ensures that those young eyes are riveted to the set. Nobody at the networks or the ad agencies wants kids to learn violence. But it sells. So, I ask myself, what are my alternatives? Do I accept the so‐called laissezfaire status quo, in which values are dictated solely by an economic system that demands voracious consumers? Or should I take a chance on letting people like Bob Liebert deliberately choose a value like cooperation and beam it across the airways to, my son, and daughter? I guess the problem comes down to those old questions of control and access. Who will be molding the images sent across the airwaves to my children? I don't want them to be all male, all white, all child psychologists, all anything. America is a diverse society. Its people hold many values, some of them contradictory. The cynical humor, the basic humanity, the physical closeness of the ghetto can offer antidotes to the alienation and plastic materialism of so much of America; the supportive, nonviolent values of feminism are needed to offset the Corporate America in which a man spends years on the treadmill to get his name on the door and a Bigelow on the floor—plus an ulcer or a coronary. There are regional and class values that are the opposite of instant gratification. For instance, the rest of us could learn much from the American Indian about for planet. I don't want my children to be fodder for a bunch of behavorial scientists intent on reshaping society in their own image. I want a lot of hands on the switches — and on the cameras and the videotape recorders and the Movieola film editing machines. It seems to me that we as a society must seek out every device, every regulation, every carrot‐and‐stick tactic to make sure the airways are open to all segments of the public — and that does not mean a half hour tossed to a minority group at 6:30 A.M. on Sunday. It means more diversity in the executive suites, in the news staffs, in the management cadre. It means an independent regulatory agency that will not let itself be used for political vendettas but that will keep tabs on the extent to which stations attempt to offer meaningful programing that reflects the diversity of the community. It means a vital public television network funded in such a way that is it free of retaliation from the executive or the legislative branch. It probably means more people like Bob Liebert — lots more making films about the values they want to teach children and being able to get those messages on the air.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U. N. Population Talks to Open in Bucharest,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/18/archives/u-n-population-talks-to-open-in-bucharest-major-us-role-foreseen.html,"BUCHAREST, Aug. 17—The first World Population Conference, a government‐level meeting convoked by the United Nations, opens here Monday with 100 nations due to participate. There is no expectation that it will produce any miraculous global program for controlling the increasingly alarming growth of the world's population, now approaching four billion. At the present rate of 2 per cent a year, it would double in less than 35 years. What is hoped for instead is that the 10‐day conference will (produce a global consensus on the problem and on the range of available remedies, as well as concurrence on what is described as a “plan of action” aimed primarily at getting naItions to fashion their own remedial programs. “Excessive global population growth,” a recent State Department policy memorandum said, “widens the gap between rich and poor nations; distorts international trade; increases the likelihood of famine in the relatively near future; adds to environmental, problems; produces unemployment; enlarges the danger of civil unrest, and promotes aggressions endangering peace.” Major U.S. Role Foreseen The United States, which is expected to play a major role at the conference, is sending a five‐member delegation headed by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Caspar W. Weinberger, and including Russel H. Peterson, chairman of the Federal Council on Environmental Quality. Among other principal participants are to be the Soviet Union, China, India and the Vatican. While the Vatican is doctrinally opposed to artificial contraception and to abortion, it has encouraged widespread Roman Catholic activities in other phases of family planning. There have been several international conferences on population in recent years, but all have been academic rather than on the level of governmental action. The Bucharest conference, voted by the General Assembly in 1972, was preceded by three international symposiums focused on special aspects of the population problem and by Preparatory sessions at the United Nations at which “a draft “plan of action” was hammered out. Invitations went to 140 nations. Some 60 affiliated organizations of the United Nadons and nongovernmental or ganizations were invited as observers. Explicit refusals to attend—with no reason given,” according to the United Nations—have been received from South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Niger, Malawi, Malta, Tonga and Laos. The secretary general and chief organizer of the conference is Dr. Antonio Carrillo, Flores, a lawyer, former Mexican Ambassador to the United States and Mexico's Foreign Minister from 1964 to 1970. The draft plan of action says, that with suitable programs, “population growth in the, less developed countries would de cline from the present annual, rate of 2.4 per cent to about 2 per cent by 1985. In the more developed, countries, it says, the growth rate would remain largely unchanged at les than 0.9 per cent. It would therefore decline in the world as a whole from 2 per cent to about 1.7 per cent, the draft adds. Sketchy Results So Far It recommends the broadest distribution of “family‐planning. information, the establishment of minimum ages, for marriage, the abolition of child labor, the full integration of women into social, economic and political life, and the institution of social security and old‐age, benefits throughout the world. The, absence of these is felt to be a prime factor in excessive production of children as “insurance” in many countries. Of 120 developing nations about 30 have policies aimed at limiting population; another 30 have family‐planning programs nominally aimed only at social welfare and 50. nations are classified. as either “neutral” or hostile to ideas of popula tion limitation. Opposition to the idea stems from a belief that, at least in certain national situations, more population is needed for economic growth. There also are long‐standing feelings among poorer nations that the affluent countries are trying to limit world population for their benefit. Among dissenting nations that may shun the conference are Brazil and Chile. The 60‐odd countries that have population‐limitation or family‐planning programs em brace about 70 per cent of the population of the developing world. The results of their efforts have been sketchy. International efforts to limit population have been small in scope. In 1967 the United Nations established its Fund for Population Activities to help nations develop control programs. Its current budget is $50‐million. The State Department estimates that $180‐million a year is available from external sources to assist developing countries with population programs; more than $100‐million comes from the United States. Demographers estimate that a comprehensive worldwide family‐planning program would raquire $1‐billion in international assistance, with matching expenditures by the nations concerned. The United States Agency for International Development helps finance population programs in 36 countries. Its outlays grew. from $74‐million in 1970 to $125‐million in 1973 but dropped this year to $104.million. It supplies about 40 pers cent of the money for the Fundi for Population Activities and a similar proportion for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, a nongovernmental organization operating in 80 nations. The five ‐ member United! States delegation also includes Patricia Hutar of Chicago, representative of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women; William H. Draper Jr., representative on the. United Nations Population Commission and Philander P. Claxton Jr., special assistant to the Secretary of State for population matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Baptism Issue Reflects Massachusetts Abortion Split,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/19/archives/baptism-issue-reflects-massachusetts-abortion-split-political.html,"MARLBORO, Mass., Aug. 18 —John P. Grasso figured he was ready. At 42, he had spent six years on the City Council. Now, redistricting had made this central Massachusetts manufacturing city of 30,000 the biggest population center and thus the key to the new Worcester‐Middlesex state senatorial district. As he opened his campaign headquarters for the Senate seat in this heavily Roman Catholic town—up to 80 per cent by most estimates—he announced that he had filed a bill in the City Council to prohibit abortion clinics. Mr. Grasso's bill set in motion a chain of events in a controversy over the refusal of the priests at a local parish to baptize the infant son of a 20‐year‐old woman because she supported the right of a woman to, have an abortion. The controversy highlights many of the elements of the emotional abortion issue. Among those are the efforts of the Catholic Church to fight what it considers pro‐abortion legislation; a perception on the part of politicians of the power of the church; changing attitudes, particularly a mong women, toward abortion, and strains within the church itself. The abortion issue was “one of the main reasons” he entered the race, Mr. Grasso told the crowd at the headquarters opening last June. Charging that his opponent had voted for abortion, he said: “I for one cannot condone this trend any longer.” He added: “We must not bend to the wishes of those who ignore the Fifth Commandment—‘Thou shalt not kill.’” Political Capital Mr. Grasso is not alone in his estimate of the political power of the abortion issue. Last spring, for example, the legislature overrode Gov. Francis W. Sargent's veto of a law restricting abortions, and officials throughout the country have felt the pressure of the Roman Catholic Church and of “right to life” groups who regard abortion as immoral. When the Rev. John J. Roussin read of Mr. Grasso's bill it got two preliminary articles and nearly six inches on page 1 of The Marlboro Enterprise the day it was to come up—he wrote a letter of support. But when Robert A Somers, a 26‐year‐old electrical engineer, read about the bill, he said, it was “the last straw.” He had grown resentful of the power of what he termed the “old‐fashioned, narrow type of Catholic” in the four years he had lived here, so he telephoned William Baird, the abortion activist. Mr. Baird, who is not adverse to publicity, said he would not only fight the bill, but would also come to Marlboro and open a clinic. Mr. Baird, the director of the Parents Aid Society, which operates abortion clinics on Long Island and in Boston, has been jailed a number of times for dramatically opposing laws against birth control and abortion. At the end of June, Mr. Baird came to this blue‐collar city, where the French, Italian and Irish ethnic ties are still strong, and picketed the Church of the Immaculate Conception. With 3,000 families, it is the largest of the city's four Catholic parishes and is the church where Father Roussin serves. Black Flag Flown Father Roussin was away at a wedding, but the day before he raised a black flag on the church's flagpole to protest Mr. Baird's visit and put out a sign calling him a “peddler of death.” In mid July David P. Gadbois, the city solicitor, issued a 20‐page opinion that Mr. based the argument on the Grasso's proposed ordinance would be unconstitutional. He Supreme Court's ruling in 1973 striking down state laws restricting or prohibiting a wornan's right to an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. The solicitor's brother, Edgar C. Gadbois, is the Mayor of Marlboro, and their father, Romeo, is a former Mayor who is still regarded as one of the town's major powers. Father Roussin says that he “and others managed to get the Mayor” to introduce a resolution substituting for Mr. Grasso's bill. The Mayor's resolution, passed without dissenting votes, called on the state to enforce its licensing and health inspection regulations on any clinic that might open here Its importance was mainly symbolic. Meanwhile, Mrs, Nancy Howe—whose house is a cheerful chaos of children, pets, visitors, ringing telephones and crowded, scribbled scheduler of meetings of her many organizations—had become Mr. Baird's local coordinator. She had not heard of Mr. Baird before, but had driven some of her friends to New York for abortions when they were illegal here. Offer of Help And she received a note from one of her neighbors, Mrs. Dorothy Rio, a Roman Catholic who has nine children, who said that she and her husband, John, would like to help out. Mrs. Rio brought her daughter, Mrs. Carole Morreale, to the crowded, emotional meeting at which the Mayor's resolution was passed. Mr. Baird stood on the steps of the city hall saying that no one would publicly back him. But Mrs. Rio and Mrs. Morreale told Tom Lizotte, a 20‐year‐old reporter for The Enterprise, that they would support Mr. Baird, and the reporter put their names in his account the next day. The issue simmered until last Sunday, the day that Mrs. Morreale and her 23‐year‐old husband, Daniel, had scheduled for the baptism of their 3‐month‐old son, Nathaniel Ryan, at Immaculate Conception. Recognizing the name, Father Roussin asked Mrs. Morreale to come to the rectory early. He and the church's pastor, Msgr. Francis X. Meehan, told her that her support for the “abortion movement” and Mr. Baird was in conflict with church doctrine and that unless she reflounced it, the baby could not be baptized. Mrs. Morreale refused. Church Denounced Mr. Baird held two crowded press conferences in his clinic here, lined with clippings recounting his past controversies, and denounced the Catholic church, He called for a nationwide search to find a priest to baptize the baby. On Friday, Mr. Baird announced that the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, a New York‐based Jesuit priest affiliated with an organization called Catholics for a Free Choice, would baptize the child. Father O'Rourke, an antiwar activist, is one of a number of younger priests who are challenging traditional church ways. After demonstrating in front of the church today, Mr. Baird said that the baptism would take place on the church steps on Tuesday. Monsignor Meehan, who taught philosophy for 23 years at St. John's Seminary, a training ground for parish priests in this area, was asked how he justified the church's efforts to enact into law its attitude toward abortion. “We feel it's not, a matter of the Catholic faith alone, it's a matter of morality,” he said. “It's a basic attitude toward life that is universal in scope, that applies to man because he is a man. Even pagans recognize the value and dignity of human life,” he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anti.Abortionists Step Up Drive Against Court Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/19/archives/antia-abortionists-step-up-drive-against-court-ruling-right-to-life.html,"VERONA—Bouncing her 9‐month‐old baby on her hr while her 2‐year‐old napped upstairs, Sarina Reeves sat on a wrought‐iron patio chair the other day and talked optimistically about the stepped‐up efforts in this heavily Roman Catholic state to prevent abortion and to “overturn” the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision permitting it. Handing a visitor a large envelope stuffed with bumper stickers (“Adoption, Not Abortion”), posters and pamphlets (“The Facts of Death”), Mrs. Reeves said that despite such recent developments as the state's issuance of interim regulations for abortion clinics and the opening of two clinics, the anti‐abortion movement, far from being discouraged, is now more determined than ever. As a county chairman, a regional director and a member of the policy making state board of directors of the Right to Life Committee of New Jersey, Mrs. Reeves is one of several hundred activists getting ready for the next round in their fight to stop what they see as the destruction of human life. At the same time, the major pro‐abortion organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women, say they will fight the abortion issue in the courts. They add that they will continue to defend women who are denied abortions and to challenge any new state legislation that they feel is restrictive, discriminatory or in any way appears to violate the Supreme Court ruling. That ruling held that an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy was not subject to state interference. New Jsersey at present has no laws on abortion, and according to pro‐abortion groups, thatis the way it should be. Two years ago, a 123‐year‐old state statute was struck doyen by Federal courts on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague and invaded a woman's right to privacy. “We should just leave things alone and not legislate in this area,” said Dorothy Schoenweld, legislative director for the New Jersey chapter of the A.C.L.U. Unity Is Sought Mrs, Reeves said the Right to Life Committee would continue working for state legislation restricting abortions and, at the national level, would join with organizations from other states to push for the adoption of a “human life amendment” to the Federal Constitution. Such an amendment, she said, would nullify the Supreme Court decision. The committee, which says it has about 400 active members, plans to continue its “walks for life,” economic boycotts, protests and picketing of hospitals and clinics that perform “elective” abortions. It also plans to continue a public‐information campaign that utilizes materials such as full‐color photographs of damaged, aborted fetuses. The pro‐abortion forces, preferring to wage their battle in the courts, are expected to focus on two measures—if and when they are enacted into state law—that would limit the availability of “elective” abortions. One is the “conscience” bill, Senate Bill 503, which has passed both houses of the Legislature and awaits Governor Byrne's signature. The bill, which most observers expect the Governor to sign, says that no individual can be required to perform an abortion, or to assist in doing so. It also says that no hospital can be required to perform abortions. “The A.C.L.Y. certainly has no quarrel with the part of the bill pertaining to individuals,” said an A.C.L.U. attorney, “but we are very disturbed by the part pertaining to hospitals.” In a pending case involving this same issue—the right of a hospital to refuse to perform abortions—the A.C.L.U. sued three south Jersey hospitals that denied women abortions on the grounds that they were “private” rather than “public” institutions. The A.C.L.U. argued that the hospitals, the only ones serving the area, are in fact “public” institutions, in part because they provide an essential community service and are partly supported by Federal funds. A decision on that case is expected in October or November. Another measure that is like. ly to face a court challenge it becomes law is Senate Bill 528, which would rule out Medicaid payments for abortions. “This would be out and out illegal,” said Nadine Taub, an A.C.L.U. attorney and director of the Women's Rights Litigation Clinic in Newark. She noted that in four states laws with very similar language were found unconstitutional by ed it may remain for a while. doubt at all that we could win this one,” she said. The bill has passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, where Eldridge Hawkins, the committee chairman, has hinted it may remain for a while. Mr. Hawkins, an Essex County Democrat, favors‐abortion. For the New Jersey Department of Health, the abortion controversy is “a no‐win,” according to Dr. Watson E. Neiman, the department's deputy commissioner. “There is just no way you can ever reconcile the views of those who say ‘abortion is murder’ with those who say ‘this is my body and I can do what I want with it.’” he said. He said the Health Department's responsibility was to comply with the Supreme Court ruling and to insure that the mother's health was protected. Regulations Not Ready The Health Department has not yet issued its final regulations governing the operation of abortion clinics and, according to Dr. Neiman, cannot possibly do so, before December. “Interim” regulations issued Aug. 5 are in force now, he noted, and would‐be clinic operators “can no longer say they are being held up by the Health Department.” Pro‐abortionists, noting that the Supreme Court decision was handed down more than a year and a half ago, have suggested that the Health Department had been “dragging its feet” in bowing to pressures from the state's Catholic citizens. Dr. Neiman said the delays were inevitable, given the fact that any proposed regulations must be submitted to the state Medical Society, the state Board of Medical Examiners, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Society and other interested organizations. Also, he said, “a number of constitutional questions remain to be decided by the state's attorney general. “We have been trying for 19 months to get something that would satisfy everybody,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/19/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"MONDAY, AUGUST 19, 1974 International Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger warned Turkey against using her military superiority to drive the new Greek Government “into a corner.” In the toughest diplomatic language used thus far by Washington in the Cyprus crisis, he said that Turkey had gone beyond what any of her friends or sympathizers were prepared to accept in the military advance in Cyprus. His comments also seemed intended to undercut widespread charges that the United States was “tilting” toward Turkey. [1:8.] The Greek Cypriote Government estimates that the Turkish army now controls 40 per cent of Cyprus, and that 200,000 Greek Cypriotes have been driven from their homes by the war. Despite the cease‐fire declared last Friday evening, fighting has continued well south of the line that was assumed would mark the Turkish area. [1:6–7.] The Soviet Communist party newspaper Pravda printed new denunciations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and accused it of “open aggression” in Cyprus. It was the bluntest charge yet in a Soviet press campaign to depict the war in Cyprus as a result of intervention by NATO. [3:1–3.] The Israeli police arrested Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, head of the Greek Catholic Church in Jerusalem, and charged him with smuggling weapons and explosives to Palestinian guerrillas operating on the occupied West Bank. The Archbishop, who reportedly had been under police surveillance since last year, was said to be the undercover liaison between Al Fatah, the largest of the Palestinian guerrilla organizations, and West Bank guerrilla cells. [2:4–8.] National President Ford told reporters on his way to the golf course that he will choose a Vice President tomorrow. He said that he would have “good advisers” on the golf course on that decision. This was taken as a clue by politicians and others. One of Mr. Ford's golfing partners was Melvin R. Laird, an old friend, who has been supporting Nelson A. Rockefeller. [1:5.] President Ford's intimate friends include several of Washington's most powerful corporate lobbyists, some of whom are helping to shape his Administration. One of his friends is Rodney W. Markley Jr., the Ford Motor Company's chief Washington lobbyist. Among others are Bryce N. Harlow, Procter & Gamble's chief Washington representative, and William G. Whyte, vice president of the United States Steel Corporation and its top man in Washington. Another friend is L. William Seidman, an accounting‐firm executive, who is assisting in the President's economic planning. [1:3–4.] American Indians, encouraged by a promise of self‐government made in a 1970 policy statement on Indians by former President Nixon, are stepping up demands that their reservations be given commonwealth status, but they expect the United States to continue to pay for most of the maintenance costs. [1:3–4.] Metropolitan “It's good to be back in the world's greatest city,” John V. Lindsay said as he returned from an eight‐month vacation abroad for “decompression” from the rigors of being Mayor for eight years.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/19/archives/news-summary-an-d-in-dex-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"MONDAY, AUGUST 19, 1974 International Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger warned Turkey against using her military superiority to drive the new Greek Government “into a corner.” In the toughest diplomatic language used thus far by Washington in the Cyprus crisis, he said that Turkey had gone beyond what any of her friends or sympathizers were prepared to accept in the military advance in Cyprus. His comments also seemed intended to undercut widespread charges that the United States was “tilting” toward Turkey. [1:8.] The Greek Cypriote Government estimates that the Turkish army now controls 40 per cent of Cyprus, and that 200,000 Greek Cypriotes have been driven from their homes by the war. Despite the cease‐fire declared last Friday evening, fighting has continued well south of the line that was assumed would mark the Turkish area. [1:6–7.] The Soviet Communist party newspaper. Pravda printed new denunciations of the North Atlaretic Treaty Organization and accussed it of “open aggression” in Cyprus. It was the bluntest charge yet in a Soviet press campaign to depict the, vial in Cyprus as a result of intervention by. NATO. [3:1–3.] The Israeli police arrested Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, head of the Greek Catholic Church in Jerusalem, and charged him with smuggling weapons and explosives to Palestinian guerrillas operating on the occupied West Bank. The Archbishop, who reportedly had been under police surveillance since last year, was said to be the undercover liaison between Al Fatah, the largest of the Palestinian guerrilla organizations, and West Bank guerrilla cells. [2:4–8.] National President Ford told reporters on his way to the golf course that he will choose a Vice President tomorrow. He said that he would have “good advisers” on the golf course on that decision. This was taken as a clue by politicians and others. One of Mr. Ford's golfing partners was Melvin R. Laird, an old friend, who has been supporting Nelson A. Rockefeller. [1:5.] President Ford's intimate friends include several of Washington's most powerful corporate lobbyists, some of whom are helping to shape his Administration. One of his friends is Rodney W. Markley Jr., the Ford Motor Company's chief Washington lobbyist. Among others are Bryce N. Harlow, Procter & Gamble's. chief Washington representative, and William G. Whyte, vice president of the United States Steel Corporation and its top man in Washington. Another friend is L. William Seidman, an accounting‐firm executive, who is assisting in the President's economic planning. [1:3–4.] American Indians, encouraged by a promise of self‐government made in a 1970 policy statement on Indians by former President Nixon, are stepping up demands that their reservations be given commonwealth status, but they expect the United States to continue to pay for most of the maintenance costs. [1:3–4.] Metropolitan “It's good to be back in the world's greatest city,” John V. Lindsay said as he returned from an eight‐month vacation abroad for “decompression” from the rigors of being Mayor for eight years. He left little doubt that he is prepared to consider running again for elective office. Mayor Beame sent a limousine to Kennedy International Airport to take Mr. Lindsay, his wife, and his son, John, home. [ 1:1.] Alcoholism, alcohol abuse and the combined use of alcohol and drugs has become an “alarming” problem among the city's youth, according to the New York Council on Alcoholism.

Connecticut Bishops Admonish Doctors Who Do Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/20/archives/connecticut-bishops-admonisk-doctors-who-do-abortions.html,"Connecticut's three Roman Catholic Bishops spoke out against abortion yesterday, charging that physicians who performed abortions violated the Hippocratic Oath and noting that Catholic health workers who participated in them faced excommunication. The Bishops—the Most Rev. John F. Whealon of Hartford, the Most Rev. Walter W. Curtis of Bridgeport and the Most Rev. Vincent J. Hines of Norwich—addressed themselves to the abortion issue in a news conference called to discuss a new 16‐page pamphlet advising Catholics to refuse to participate in abortions. Bishop Hines read a portion of the Hippocratic Oath, which says: “. . . and especially I will not aid a woman to procure abortion.” He said that, since the United States Supreme Court ruling in January, 1973, overturning laws against abortion, some have called the plefge the “hypocritic oath.” Dr. William R. Richards, executive director of the Connecticut State Medical Society, said in an interview later that the ancient oath was not “read literally”, by most doctors today, but was “somewhat ceremonial in terms of the facts of life.” The oath, he said, is administered to many—but not all—medical school graduates, and is not a legal or licensing requirement for physicians. The Connecticut State Medical Society and the American Medical Association have taken the position that abortions may be performed under the proper medical conditions, though doctors, nurses and other health personnel may decline to participate for “Personally held moral principles.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Child Is Baptized In Church Clash,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/child-is-baptized-in-church-clash.html,"MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Aug. 20—A Jesuit priest from New York baptized 3‐months‐old Nathaniel Ryan Morreale on the front steps of Immaculate Conception Church here today after the church's priests had refused to perform the sacrament because of the views of the mother on abortion. Four hundred persons stood outside the brick church under the intense noonday sun to watch the 20‐minute ceremony and express their views on the moral issues involved. Many of those near enough to hear the words clapped and cheered when the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, who flew in this morning from New York to conduct the rite, turned to them during the ritual and declared: “You have heard the promises and the faith of these parents and godparents, Do you all make the same promises and profess the same faith and accept this child, Nathaniel Ryan, into the community of Jesus Christ?” Others, however, displayed bumper stickers reading “Abortion is Murder” and shouted critical remarks. Much of the criticism was directed at William Baird, the birth control and abortion crusader who was an honorary godparent. During the ceremony, Mr. Baird, who declined to disclose his religious convictions, was called upon to make the sign of the cross on the infant's forehead. The controversy began recently when John P. Grasso, a local politician who is running for the State Senate, announced that he had filed a bill in the City Council that would prohibit abortion clinics in this heavily Roman Catholic town of 30,000. Opponents of the measure got in touch with Mr. Baird, the director of the Parents Aid Society, which operates abortion clinics on Long Island and in Boston, and he announced that he would open one here. Among those quoted in a local newspaper article as supporting him was Carol Morreale, a 20‐year‐old member of Immaculate Conception parish. Nine days ago, Mrs. Morreale and her 22‐year‐old busband, Daniel, a petroleum company supervisor, were scheduled to have their son, Nathaniel, baptized. Shortly before the ceremony was to begin, the Rev. John J. Rodssin, one of the church's four priests, remembered the article. When Mrs. Morreale confirmed its accuracy, he informed her that the baptism would have to be postponed pending further discussion of her beliefs. Mrs. Morreale confirmed today in an interview her belief in freedom of choice regarding abortion but said that this did not mean that she believed in abortion. According to church law, a pastor has the authority to refuse to baptize an infant if there are doubts about whether the parents intend to bring the child up in the Catholic faith. Although there is no disagreement among, theologians on the principle, there is wide disagreement over how it is to be applied and whether disagreement with the church's position on a moral issue such as abortion constitutes rejection of a fundamental teaching. Father Roussin took the position that accepting the church's opposition to abortion is “fundamental” to the faith. “To say that a woman has the right to choose whether to have an abortion is to say that she has a right to choose whether to keep the Fifth Commandment Thou shalt not kill',” he said in an interview this morning. Others, however, disagreed. The Rev. Charles Curran, moral theologian at Catholic University in Washington, said in an interview yesterday: “There is going to be more pluralism in Roman Catholicism on particular moral questions. I disagree with the position of abortion on demand, but I can't say that the teaching on abortion is a matter of faith and a reason to refuse baptism.” Father O'Rourke is a director of Catholics for a Free Choice, a New York‐based organization committed to giving women the right to decide for themselves whether abortion is permissible. He was asked by friends of Mrs. Morreale to come here to conduct the sacrament. Father O'Rourke, who is also a member of the staff of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility in Manhattan, said, “Freedom of choice is currently a valid opinion that is held by many respectable Catholic thinkers.” Msgr. Francis X. Meehan, pastor of the church, refused permission this morning for Father O'Rourke to conduct the ritual inside the church but offered no resistance to his holding the ceremony on the steps. He said afterward that he recognized the baptism as “valid” in the same sense that the Catholic Church recognizes the validity of a Protestant baptism. “It seems clear, however,” he continued, “that the child is not baptized into ecclesial community of the faith that we call the [Romani Catholic church.” The action of the parish priests was supported by officials of the Archdiocese of Boston. The Rev. Eamon Taylor, regional supervisor for the Jesuit Province of New York, said yesterday afternoon that Father O'Rourke had been “expressly forbidden” by his superiors to conduct the rite. He said that any “discipline or other consequences will be resolved in the personal relations between Father O'Rourke and his superiors.” Among those gathered outside the church today were some who said that they agreed with the parish clergymen on the abortion issue but thought that the baby, for his own sake, should be baptized. During the ceremony, the infant sat quietly in his mother's arms, fascinated by the activity that surrounded him. He sneezed when Father O'Rourke pronounced the formula of baptism. After the ceremony, the participants lingered on the steps to answer reporters' questions. They dispersed when a policeman commanded, “O.K., people, lets back up and get the baby out of the sun.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Sampling of Statements by Rockefeller on a Variety of Subjects,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/a-sampling-of-statements-by-rockefeller-on-a-variety-of-subjects.html,"Following is a selection of statements of Nelson A. Rockefeller, drawn from his speeches, writings and interviews in recent years, on various subjects: Richard M. Nixon and Watergate We need this man of action, this man of accomplishment, this man of experience, this man of courage. We need this man of faith in America. (Nominating President Nixon for a second term, Aug. 22, 1972.) Maybe this is like the Old Testament. It was visited upon us and maybe we're going to benefit from it. (July 17, 1973.) These scandals are not the scandals of a party, they're scandals relating to individuals. (Sept. 28, 1973.) Let's face it, Watergate is a tragedy. But everyone is entitled to a fair trial, and that applies to the President of the United States. Those who would push him out office or force his resignation would be circumventing the constitutional process. (March 30, 1974.) There is evidence of a really serious situation as far as the moral tone of the Administration is concerned. (May 10, 1974.) The tragedy of the past two years has ended, tragedy that overshadowed the positive achievements the Nixon Administration, particularly those achievements in pursuit of world peace, which undeniably attained greatness. (Aug. 9, 1974.) The Press I'm convinced that if reporters should ever lose the right to protect the confidentiality of their sources, then serious investigative reporting will simply dry up. The kind of resourceful, probing journalism that first exposed most of the serious scandals, corruption and injustices in our nation's history would simply disappear. Government has an obligation not to inhibit the collection and dissemination of news. And let me tell you, reading about one's failings in the daily papers is one of the privileges of high office in this free country of ours. (Nov. 29, 1972.) National Life There is nothing wrong with America that courage, dedication and love cannot conquer. There is nothing wrong with America that we don't have the human and natural resources to overcome. (Jan. 6, 1971.) We are living in one of the most exciting periods the history of the world. I am tremendously optimistic about the future and the possibilities growing out of these new circumstances. (Feb. 21, 1974.) National Priorities The most fundamental task before us is to make our communities places where family stability and strengthened family life and family ties can be realized in this period of social instability. (Jan. 1, 1971.) There is no doubt that many expensive national projects may add to our prestige or serve science. But none of them must take precedence over human needs. As long as Congress does not revise its priorities, our crisis not just material, it is a crisis of the spirit. (April 24, 1971.) We know so much today as a nation, that the ideal is way beyond the realistic grasp of our society. Therefore, what the Government's got to do is to combine the ideal with the realistically do‐able or possible and balance one sector out against another. (Feb. 11, 1974.) Foreign Policy American foreign policy has become identified with military power—yet, in reality, we no longer have the absolute strategic power we had after World War II... We might as well be frank about it. We are overcommitted. (June 28, 1968.) The United States must move to a far greater extent. from unilateral action to a policy of multilateral decisionmaking with her European allies. (Dec. 10, 1969.) In the enthusiasm to encourage detente—and I'm for it—I have a feeling that some of the longer‐range security problems are being ignored. (Feb. 26, 1974.) Middle East The United States must make it clear beyond doubt to the nations of the world that we will not permit Israel to be vanquished. We shall be at her side as long as we are needed. (Sept. 3, 1970.) The cause of lasting peace—not only in the Middle East but throughout the world—requires that the United States continue to stand firm and fast with Israel in this hour of peril. (Oct. 21, 1973.) Latin America The fundamental question for the United States how it can cooperate to help meet the basic needs of the people of the hemisphere despite the philosophical disagreements it may have with the nature of particular regimes. It must seek pragmatic ways to help people without necessarily embracing their governments. It should recognize that diplomatic relations are merely practical convenience and not measures of moral judgment. (Report to President Nixon on Latin‐American mission, 1969.) Southeast Asia The Communist Vietcong guerrillas must be defeated. Winning the fight for freedom in Vietnam is essential to the survival of all Asia. (1964.) There can be no purely military solution, (May 1, 1968.) To put it simply, we are involved in a war that no one wants, that no one understands, and that everyone prays can be ended. Our goal as a people is to get out of Cambodia as rapidly as possible, to achieve a negotiated peace, and to get American boys back home. (May 12, 1970.) The Economy We should recognize more clearly that the private sector is of crucial importance to the process of successful economic development in democratic societies. (Godkin Lectures, Harvard University, 1962.) Perhaps the most significant feature of the President's actions and recommendations is his extraordinary comprehensive approach in facing the problems of our times. Not since the early days of President Franklin D. Roosevelt has anything comparable been undertaken. (On President Nixon's imposition of wage and price controls, Aug. 16, 1971.) How are the people to be protected from profiteering? I personally feel very strongly that the answer is a United States' excess profits tax on all energy company earnings that are not used for exploration, research, development, refineries, transportation, storage, marketing. (Jan. 31, 1974.) Federal‐State Relations Those Congressmen are our representatives and they're where the money is. If they haven't got the Money, they've got to get the money. There isn't any other chance. I'm not going to be presumptuous and tell Congress how do it. They are voting on these big pork barrel deals for states in the South and the West, dredging operations and so forth—well, we've got a survival problem here. We're right up against the wall. (Nov. 19, 1970.) The problems of urbanism have outrun individual local government boundaries, legal powers and fiscal resources. And the national government is too remote to sense and to act responsively on the widely varying local or regional concerns and aspirations. The states ... can and should serve as the leaders in planning, and the catalysts developing cooperative action at the local‐state‐Federal levels. (Godkin Lectures, Harvard University, 1962.) Blacks We've got to change people's point of view. We're all children of God, and we've got to reach out a hand to give positive help to people who have been discriminated against for a hundred years. (On resigning from a private club that did not accept black members, July 19, 1968.) The Environment Industry has to reject the kind of merchandising that brags about a car going from 0 to 60 miles an hour 4.5 seconds and says nothing about the cloud of poisoned air it leaves behind. (June 6, 1970.) Women The old concept of women tied to the home represents a hopeless misunderstanding of the American way of life. .... I want to turn women loose on the environmental crisis—and I think they can solve it better than men can —because they care more, because they are closer to Nobody knows more about pollution when detergents back up in the kitchen sink. (“Unity, Freedom, and Peace,” published in 1968.) I can see no justification now for repealing this reform and thus condemning hundreds of thousands of women to the dark age onde again. I do not believe it right for one group to impose its vision of morality on an entire society. Neither is it:practical for the state to attempt to dictate the innermost personal beliefs and conduct of its citizens. (In vetoing a bill repealing. New York's liberal abortion law, May 13, 1972.) Other Public Figures Barry Goldwater: The symbol of integrity and the soul of frankness. (Oct. 25, 1973.) Henry A. Kissinger: He's never let me down and he's never let the country down. (Nov. 1, 1973.) Gerald R. Ford: A dedicated public servant. (June 1974.) Himself I speak as one who has taken himself out of national contention, completely and forever, without reservation. (Following declaration in 1965 of his candidacy for a third term as Governor.) My basic posture is one of keeping my options open. (Sept. 28, 1973.) I'm not moving to the right. I'm just dealing with problems as they come up. I'm proud to be a politician. (Oct. 30, 1973.) You know, I'm not basically a politician.

Expert Says Word Has 27 Days' Food,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/expert-says-world-has-27-days-food-asia-seen-as-exporter-meetings.html,"BUCHAREST Aug. 20 — An inattentive and factious session on population was told today that the world had reserves of food for only 27 days at the moment, a level considered too low to insure against sudden calamity. The warning came from Lester R. Brown, an American analyst, who spoke at a population forum of nongovernmental organization. The forum is meeting in conjunction with the United Nations World Population Conference, which is being held at the governmental level. Mr. Brown, the main speaker on the subject of “threats of disaster,” said the world grain harvest this year would almost certainly fall below that of 1973, and it was possible that a world catastrophe could be taking form. He said that two areas most affected by poor yields were likely to be Asia, where energy shortages have resulted in a lack of fertilizer and fuel to run irrigation pumps, and in North America, where adverse weather has been a factor. The American wheat crop may be 10 per cent smaller than last year, Mr. Brown said. He is associated with the Overseas Development Council of Washington, a research organization. Asia Seen as Exporter Since Asia and North America are the two main food‐exporting regions of the world, food shortages may develop in the coming year in areas dependent on Asian and American exports, he said, and such shortages are likely to grow worse each year. The development of highyield food grains, known as the Green Revolution, was achieved about all that could be expected, Mr. Brown said, partly because fertilizers are now in short supply and partly because population growth has outpaced even the highest food production rates. Despite the gravity of Mr. Brown's theme, the hall in which he spoke was only partly filled, and listeners wandered in and out. At the end of his lecture, conference participants lined up by the dozen before a microphone, mainly to make speeches on unrelated subjects or to heckle Mr. Brown. Meetings Contentious An African woman delegate, said: “You in the developed countries have the paper, and we have to read what you put, on it. You want us to go back to our villages and take your pills. You over‐intellectualize everything. Why don't you listen to us for a change?” She was applauded as she stalked out of the hall. With temperatures often, in the nineties and no air‐conditioning, “discussions at the Bucharest meetings have become contentious and angry. Much time is spent by official and nongovernmental groups caucusing and lobbying in opposition to other groups. A particularly bitter quarrel has developed on the issue of abortion. An antiabortion group has threatened to close one of its meetings to keep out supporters of abortion. The proabortion group has been handing out buttons reading “My body belongs to me,” and the antiabortionists have countered with handbills illustrated with gruesome photographs of well developed aborted fetuses. The “threats of disaster” meeting was the only One of its kind scheduled by any of the bodies meeting here for two weeks. At the session, Mr. Brown asserted that if world food reserves fall significantly below a 50‐day supply, prices begin to rise, affecting the nutrition of millions. At the present 27‐day level, starvation in parts of the world becomes likely, he said. He added that the United. States, as the main exporter of food, might soon become the arbiter in decisions as to which nations starve and which survive—a prospect, he said, he viewed with repugnance. Soon American surpluses, if any, will be insufficient to feed all those demanding food, he added. Making matters worse, he said, there is growing support in the United States for restriction of food exports to conserve domestic supplies. Most of the delegates from developing nations and the Soviet bloc hold that priority should go to development and that population pressures will then take care of themselves. They contend that attempts to persuade governments to adopt population policies are often self‐serving “imperialist” positions on the part of rich nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Child Is Baptized In Church Clash,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/child-is-baptized-in-church-clash-a-child-is-baptized-after-church.html,"MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Aug. 20—A Jesuit priest from New York baptized 3‐months‐old Nathaniel Ryan Morreale on the front steps of Immaculate Conception Church here today after the church's priests had refused to perform the sacrament because of the views of the mother on abortion. Four hundred persons stood outside the brick church under the intense noonday sun to watch the 20‐minute ceremony and express their views on the moral issues involved. Many of those near enough to hear the words clapped and cheered when the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, who flew in this morning from New York to conduct the rite, turned to them during the ritual and declared: “You have heard the promises and the faith of these parents and godparents. Do you all make the same promises and profess the same faith and accept this child, Nathaniel Ryan, into the community of Jesus Christ?” Others, however, displayed bumper stickers reading “Abortion is Murder” and shouted critical remarks. Much of the criticism was directed at William Baird, the birth control and abortion crusader who was an honorary godparent. During the ceremony, Mr. Baird, who declined to disclose his religious convictions, was called upon to make the sign of the cross on the infant's forehead. The controversy began recently when John P. Grasso, A local politician who is running for the State Senate, announced that he had filed a bill in the City Council that would prohibit abortion clinics in this heavily Roman Catholic town of 30,000. Opponents of the measure got in touch with Mr. Baird, the director of the Parents Aid Society, which operates abortion clinics on Long Island and in Boston, and he announced that he would open one here. Among those quoted in a local newspaper article as supporting him was Carol Morreale, a 20‐year‐old member of Immaculate Conception parish. Nine days ago, Mrs. Morreale and her 22‐year‐old husband, Daniel, a petroleum company supervisor, were scheduled to have their son, Nathaniel, baptized. Shortly before the ceremony was to begin, the Rev. John J. Rodssin, one of the church's four priests, remembered the article. When Mrs. Morreale confirmed its accuracy, he informed her that the baptism would have to be postponed pending further discussion of her beliefs. Church Law Cited Mrs. Morreale confirmed today in an interview her belief in freedom of choice regarding abortion but said that this did not mean that she believed in abortion. According to church law, a pastor has the authority to refuse to baptize an infant if there are doubts about whether the parents intend to bring the child up in the Catholic faith. Although there is no disagreement among, theologians on the principle, there is wide disagreement over how it is to be applied and whether disagreement with the church's position on a moral issue such as abortion constitutes rejection of a fundamental teaching. Father Roussin took the position that accepting the church's opposition to abortion is “fundamental” to the faith. “To say that a woman has the right to choose whether to have an abortion is to say that she has a right to choose whether to keep the Fifth Commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’,” he said in an interview this morning. Others, however, disagreed. The Rev. Charles Curran, moral theologian at Catholic University in Washington, said in an interview yesterday: “There is going to be more pluralism in Roman Catholicism on particular moral questions. I disagree with the position of abortion on demand, but I can't say that the teaching on abortion is a matter of faith and a reason to refuse baptism.” ‘A Valid Opinion’ Father O'Rourke is a director of Catholics for a Free Choice, a New York‐based organization committed to giving women the right to decide for themselves whether abortion is permissible. He was asked by friends of Mrs. Morreale to come here to conduct the sacrament. Father O'Rourke, who is also a member of the staff of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility in Manhattan, said, “Freedom of choice is currently a valid opinion that is held by many respectable Catholic thinkers.” Msgr. Francis X. Meehan, pastor of the church, refused permission this morning for Father O'Rourke to conduct the ritual inside the church but offered no resistance to his holding the ceremony on the steps. He said afterward that he recognized the baptism as “valid” in the same sense that the Catholic Church recognizes the validity of a Protestant baptism. “It seems clear, however,” he continued, “that the child is not baptized into ecclesial community of the faith that we call the [Roman] Catholic church.” The action of the parish priests was supported by officials of the Archdiocese of Boston. The Rev. Eamon Taylor, regional supervisor for the Jesuit Province of New York, said yesterday afternoon that Father O'Rourke had been “expressly forbidden” by his superiors to conduct the rite. He said that any “discipline or other consequences will be resolved in the personal relations between Father O'Rourke and his superiors.” Among those gathered outside the church today were some who said that they agreed with the parish clergymen on the abortion issue but thought that the baby, for his own sake, should be baptized. During the ceremony, the infant sat quietly in his mother's arms, fascinated by the activity that surrounded him. He sneezed when Father O'Rourke pronounced the formula of baptism. After the ceremony, the participants lingered on the steps to answer reporters' questions. They dispersed when a policeman commanded, “O.K., people, lets back up and get the baby out of the sun.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leaders in State Parties Praise Choice of Rockefeller,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/leaders-in-state-parties-praise-choice-of-rockefeller-see-gain-in.html,"The choice of former Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller as the new Vice President drew praise from politicians of both major parties in the state yesterday, along with an estimate from Democrats involved in the gubernatorial campaign that Governor Wilson would benefit at the polls in November. Representative Hugh L. Carey, one of the candidates in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, said “the Ford‐Rockefeller team in Washington will strengthen Malcolm Wilson here in New York.” He made the observation in arguing for himself as the stronger candidate. Howard J. Samuels, the other Democratic candidate, issued cautious, brief statement, saying, “I'm sure the President had good reasons for his selection,” and wishing Mr. Rockefeller well. Privately, some Democrats active in the Samuels campaign estimated Mr. Wilson might benefit from the general goodwill being extended toward the new White House Administration if Mr. Rockefeller campaigned here for Mr. Wilson, his close friend and early political mentor. Wilson Welcomes Help Governor Wilson was among the first of a bipartisan group of officials to extend warm praise to Mr. Rockefeller. The Governor's office noted in responge to questions that Mr. Wilson previously had said he would welcome whatever camto do in the Rockefeller gubernatorial drive. “He is a man of impeccable honesty, unquestioned Integrity, deep compassion, proven ability and acknowledged qualities of mind and heart,” Mr. Wilson said in his statement of praise. Joseph F. Crangle, the state Democratic chairman, disagreed with the view that Mr. Rockefeller would now have more of a statesman's mantle and therefore be viewed more favorably. He said Mr. Rockefeller symbolized “arrogance of wealth and power and concern for special interests.” The new role for Mr. Rockefeller will only draw attention tö a weak Rockefeller‐Wilson record, Mr. Crangle contended. “I'm exuberant about the choice,” he declared. Beanie Sees Benefits Mayor Beame expressed “the warmest congratulations” of the city to Mr. Rockefeller in a telegram. He said the nomination “brings to the nation's second highest office a man of proven administrative skill who is intimately familiar with the urban‐problems that are of urgent concern to the people of this city and cities throughout the nation.” Even politicians with memories of some harsh encounters with the former governor sent their congratulations, including former Mayor John V. Lindsay and Republican Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea. Mr. Lindsay, who was a rival of the governor before the mayor left the Republican party, sent a message of “best wishes” to the Vice Presidentdesignate. He held a brief news conference, declining to say whether he thought Mr. Rockefeller would make a good Vice President. “That remains to be seen,” Mr. Lindsay said. “I think it's too early to judge anything in the present Administration. One has to wait to see if the country can be put back together again.” “Our personal relationship was always good,” he added. “We had our political differences.” Duryea Cites Soundness Speaker Duryea, a Republican who had aspired to succeed Mr. Rockefeller but was cut short by an alleged vote‐fraud scandal last year, said the President had made “a very sound choice.” Aides of Mr. Duryea and, last week, even his own wife, have accused Mr. Rockefeller of encpuraging a baseless scandal inquiry as a device to destroy the Speaker's gubernatorial possibilities and favoring Mr, Wilson. Asked about this, Mr. Duryea said he did not always agree with his wife, Bettie, who had denounced Mr. Rockefeller as unfit to serve as “dog catcher.” “I have to compliment President Ford for nominating man of great executive ability,” Mr. Duryea said. Not all Democrats were willing to concede an edge to Governor Wilson because of the new Rockefeller post. “I wish Mr. Rockefeller well,” Assembly Democratic minority leader Stanley Steingut said “He certainly ought to understand state and city problems. But he wasn't very popular when he left office, and nobody can run from his record.” Record Is Backed Richard Rosenbaum, the state Republican chairman, said the party was more than willing to run on the Rockefeller‐Wilson record and that this latest honor for Mr. Rockefeller only added to the appreciation of his service. “This is a tremendous lift for all Republicans of the nation and of the state,” Mr. Rosen baum commented. “I've alway said Malcolm Wilson will be elected in his own right, with out any question.” Mr. Rockefeller's elevation only adds to the Democrat problem, Mr. Rosenbaum added Manhattan Borough Presiden Percy E. Sutton said the forme governor was a man of “great ability” who could help end till “hostilities and alienations that abound in America following Mr. Nixon's attempt at being King Richard.” “Mr. Rockefeller is a man of good instincts whose politica needs have not always permit ted him to act out his good in stints,” Mr. Sutton said. “Nov may be his chance.” “Unique Knowledge’ Seen City Council. President Pau O'Dwyer praised the Vice Presi dent‐designate for his “unique knowledge” of urban problems which, he said, have reached “frightening proportions.” “May we urge your immedi ate attention,” he said in a tele?? gram to Mr. Rockefeller. Senator Jacob K. Javits said the nomination meant, “We have now fielded our first tean?? at home and abroad.” A telegram denouncing the choice of Mr. Rockefeller was sent to President Ford by loca?? members of the Diocesar Union of Holy Name Societies a group of Roman Catholic laymen upset that Governor Rockefeller signed the liberalizer abortion law. “This is not the time for the G.O.P. to alienate the Catholic voters of the nation,” said the telegram, sent in the name of Frank J. Davidson of Little Keck, Queens, president of the group. Zionist Group Pleased The Zionist Organization of America expressed high praise in a message to the formes governor. “We recall with profound appreciation your lifelong support for the cause of Zionism,” said Rabbi Joseph P. Sternstein, president of the organization, who added a hope chat relations with Israel would be strengthened. Some Democrats who had fought the governor on various state issues privately expressed a good feeling that he had finally made success in his party on the national level. chose who praised the choice included: ¶ Former Gov.

U.S. Calls on Population Parley To Agree on World Growth Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/us-calls-on-population-parley-to-agree-on-world-growth-curb-sweden.html,"BUCHAREST, Aug. 20 —The United States called today for concerted effort to curb global population growth, with a goal of averting billions of births in the next 75 years. The proposal was one of a variety of approaches offered by a dozen nations during the first day at the United Nations World Population Conference. Foremost among the views was that of India, which has one of the most severe population problems of any nation. An Indian spokesman declared that fertility‐control efforts were doomed to failure, as long as affluent countries indulged in “superconsumerism” entailing a waste of resources. Argentina, reflecting sentiment among the Latin‐American nations, challenged the view, that declining birth rates went hand in hand with economic progress, and, like India, called for more just relations between rich and poor countries. Sweden Urges Control At the other extreme Sweden, which is approaching zero population growth, not only urged general retardation of growth but suggested that all nations had a responsibility to collaborate to this end. The same theme was voiced by Maurice Strong, director of the United Nation's Environmental Program. “Of compelling importance, of course, is the right of, each nation to determine its own optimum population level,” he said. “But equally important is the need for each nation to accept the corollary responsibility to assure that the demands of its population on resources and environment beyond its national boundaries do not impair the rights and interests of others.” The United States proposal was delineated by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Caspar W. Weinberger, who is head of the American delegation. He spoke to an audience of delegates from 131 nations in the main auditorium of Rumania's Palace of the Republic. He called for strengthening of the conference's draft plan of action, a compromise” document calling for only a small reduction in the world's, population growth rate of 2 per cent a year. Mr. Weinberger continued: “We believe the plan should be the commencement of a serious effort by both developed and developing countries to consider the various means of arriving at chosen goals. “According to the United Nations medium projection, the world's population [now nearly 4 billion] will reach about 6.4 billion by 2000 and over 11 billion by 2050. “If, however, delegates agree at this conference and are able to persuade their countries to endeavor to attain the practicable goal of a replacement level of fertility—an average of two children per family—by 2000, the world's population in that year will be approximately 5.9 billion.” Secretary Weinberger did not go into any details about how nations might reduce their growth rates. The conference is studying a broad array of methods ranging from voluntary sterilization and abortion to freeing women from purely a childbearing role and national tax policies designed not to encourage large families. Dr. Karan Singh, India's Minister of Health and Family Planning, said the widening gap between the affluent and developing nations made it “seem inescapable that affluent countries will have to take a searching look at their own economies. “It Will be difficult for many countries to Accept family limitation as a goal in itself unless it is clearly linked to a more equitable distribution of world resources,” he said.

Events From the Personal Life And the Career of Rockefeller,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/21/archives/events-from-the-personal-life-and-the-career-of-rockefeller.html,"In 1908, the year that Nelson A. Rockefeller was born as a grandson of the nation's first billionaire, he inherited huge wealth and privilege, and a problem in political imagery. That year President Theodore Roosevelt was barking denunciations of the Rockefeller family as “malefactors of great wealth” as he moved on a wave of popular support in his trust‐busting campaign against the Rockefeller oil conglomerate. Man in the News But 66 years later, after the application of decades of family philanthropy and his own special industry and ambition, Nelson A. Rockefeller has arrived, on the strength of popular support and political opportunity, just one step short of his heart's desire. The former Governor of New York has accepted the offer to be Vice President, showing an eagerness he never had for the office in the past, when he had more years to invest in a Presidential strategy. Many predecessors have found the job a bittersweet consolation that withers a politician. But almost the moment Mr. Rockefeller was called on by President Ford, the speculation began whether the drive of this wealthiest of all politicians could be channeled into the loyalty of a Throttlebottom, or whether he might succumb for the fourth time to the. temptation of a Presidential attempt, in 1976. Several years ago, as he flew low over Washington at night in one of the family jets, Mr. Rockefeller, gazing at the floodlit White House below, was asked when he first thought of being President. “Ever since I was a kid,” he replied. “After all, when you think of what I had, what else was there to aspire to?” Exceptional Experience Mr. Rockefeller will take to his new post a depth of executive experience rarely if ever equaled by predecessors. It includes appointive service for every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt, ranging from foreign policy formulation to the creation of Government agencies. And it includes the 15‐year history as Governor, in which Mr. Rockefeller loosed in grand style his instinct as a master builder on both social programs and construction projects. It was in this last period, which ended with his resignation last December. that he built his familiar image as “Rocky,” the tactile, jubilant campaigner, and used the Governor's post as a Presidential springboard that always proved out of sync with his three hesitationmarred bids for the White House. Many politicians felt that Mr. Rockefeller resigned because he had come to view the governorship as more a hindrance than a help in his 1976 Presidential yearnings. Some saw a heavy risk of defeat for him if he had sought a fifth term in New York State this year. But Mr. Rockefeller, denying any Presidential planning, said he felt he had done all he could as Governor and needed to devote hiniself to a new study group he created, the Commission‐ on Critical Choices for Americans. In his political career, Mr. Rockefeller set a multi‐million‐dollar record for gubernatorial campaign spending that can never be topped under the new spending restrictions enacted this year in New York, He also became a master pragmatist, reversing his own position at times, admitting he was wrong but denying critics' charges that he was cynically seeking broader support. In his final years as Governor, he switched from more liberal approaches to the welfare and narcotics problems. He drew national attention with his demand for life imprisonment for illicit drug dealers, and he openly apologized for not having come sooner to a welfare policy more watchful of “cheats and chiselers.” Last year, audiences of, Goldwater Republicans approvingly laughed and applauded as the Governor recanted on these problems during an Arizona visit. He denied accusations of Democrats that he was bent on wooing the same Republican right that had jeered him as he spoke against extremism at the 1964 Republican Presidential convention. “What I have done is a reflection not of shift in my political spectrum,” he said Iasi October, “but it is shift in public thinking in relation to their concerns.” A Battle of Millionaires Mr. Rockefeller won four‐four‐year terms as Governor, beginning with the 1958 victory over Gov. W. Averell Harriman in the “battle of the millioniries.” It was an upset, with the man in the street discovering there was charm in a scion of wealth willing to bite into a blintz in full view of the news media. At the end of his years as Governor he, was proud that lie consistently kept his enthusiasm. Few who followed his career could be ignorant of this feat, for in addition to his wink, his slap on the back and his dominant strut into a roomful of politicians or voters, the Rocky style included the endless use of superlatives. He used “fantastic” and “terrific”‐ the way other people say simply “gocid” or “O.K.” Last year he searched for a new superlative to describe the performance of the metropolitan area's transit czar—a job the Governor created—and he said “Horrendous!” He joined in the laughter when his error was pointed out, and he went back to “terrific.” The Governor's accomplishments included the expansion of the State University from 28 campuses and 38,000 students to 4 campuses and 246,000 students—an institution with a national reputation. He consolidated management of the metropolitan area's subways, buses and commuter lines into a state authority and pressed for renovation of the lines—most notably with his 1970 election‐year effort to make the Long Island Rail Road “the finest” in the nation. His ambitious programs were usually related to the Federal level, either in pressing for new aid—as he successfully did with the creation of Federal revenue sharing—or in making full use of existing aid programs. In the latter, the Governor made such use of the initial Federal Medicaid program that the state program threateped to bankrupt the Federal authorization. Taxes Up and Up When the Governor came on the scene in New York, people were worried about nuclear fallout; he responded with a program of shelters that eventually faded from the drawing boards. Likewise, his initial pay ‐ as ‐ you ‐ go spending philosophy gave way, and eventually Democrats were criticizing his heavy reliance on borrowing —more than $10‐billion in direct and indirect borrowing when he left state office. As such programs as school aid and treatment of narcotics addiction grew under the Goyernor, the state budget and taxes rose. In eight of his. 15 years, new taxes were imposed or old ones increased. But the people re‐elected him anyway, although the disarray of the Democrats was sometimes cited as a major factor in his success. “You know, I'm not basically a politician,” the Governor said last June. “A lot of people think I am. But politics is not really my métier. My real interest is in solving people's problems.” In recent months Mr. Rockefeller has been filling his time by serving as chairman of the Commission on Critical choices for Americans, a sort of mobile think tank similar to one he created at the end of the Eisenhower years, which produced basic studies on long range issues and brought Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Rockefeller's close friend and adviser, to a national forum. Mr. Rockefeller has had to deny repeatedly that the new commission was designed as a way of maintaining a national image for him for the 1976 Presidential sweepstakes. Anyone who saw him discuss the project in private could hardly doubt his enthusiasm, as he told of reading The Federalist Papers and behavioral psychology tomes, and of plans to scrutinize other parts of the world. “I'd like to get Mao Tsetung or one of his henchmen to prepare a paper on the nature of man,” Mr. Rockefeller said last fall, popping peanuts into his mouth as his plane sped through the night sky, returning from one of his many out‐of‐state speeches. Ever since the Watergate crisis broke Mr. Rockefeller was a party stalwart in addressing Republican audiences throughout the nation. The scandal was “a tragedy of individuals,” he said repeatedly in a message that did not accuse President Nixon and that exonerated the Republican party. One of Six Children Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was born in Bar Harbor, Me., on July 8, 1908, the third of six children of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Greene Aldrich Rockefeller. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, a prominent Republican. He attended the Lincoln School in New York City and was raised in a strict Baptist manner that he recalls with fondness. As one of the Rockefeller children, he pursued small industries to earn his place in the family raising rabbits, for example. His father sought to break the left‐handed inclination of young Nelson, and even tied a tether to the hand sometimes at the dinner table. Mr. Rockefeller is somewhat ambidextrous today. The young man was grad uated from Dartmouth with an economics degree and a Phi Beta Kappa key in 1930 and a $2,500 bonus from his father for never having smoked. Even now he does not smoke, and his taste for alcohol is mild—an occasional Dubonnet on the rocks. He married Mary Todhunter Clark after graduation, and the marriage lasted more than 30 years and produced five children and 14 grandchildren. It ended with a separation, then divorce in 1962. In 1963 the Governor married Margaretta Fitler Murphy, a woman 19 years younger who five weeks earlier had divorced her first husband. While now favorably received by the public for her quiet manner and beauty, “Happy” Rockefeller and the Governor's divorce caused a furor in some party circles back then. For all the accusations that Mr. Rockefeller plans his every move for the sake of politics, some critics said he let love triumph over politics and it cost him dearly in conservative circles. Mr. Rockefeller turned to elective office after a series of appointive jobs in Washington. He served President Roosevelt as coordinator of inter‐American affairs and helped formulate the Good Neighbor policy. He helped develop the Point Four program of aid for underdeveloped nations under Pregident Truman and was chairman of the International Development Advisory Board. A Government study for President Eisenhower led to the creation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and his appointment as the undersecretary. This career in public service followed jobs related to the family fortune: with the Chase Manhattan Bank, Rockefeller Center, and the Creole Petroleum Corpora(the Exxon Corporation's affiliate in Venezuela). Campaigned for Nixon McRockefeller established his credentials as a national Republican politician with his surprising gubernatorial victory in 1958. Two years later he made some overtures toward a presidential bid, talking of a “draft,” but withdrew in favor of Richard M. Nixon. He upset some politicians in the process with criticism of the EisenhowerNixon years, but campaigned busily for Mr. Nixon. The 1964 Republican convention, with its loud, televised repudiation of Mr. Rockefeller by the strongly pro‐Goldwater audience, was in the view of some liberals, Mr. Rockefeller's finest hour: But bedrock resistance in the party to “Eastern liberal” figures was laid bare, and until the Vice‐Presidential announcement yesterday there were many politicians who felt Mr. Rockefeller, who refused to campaign for Senator Barry Goldwater, could never win wide acceptance in his party. In 1968, Mr. Rockefeller further damaged his political reputation by going to the brink of a presidential announcement, saying no, then reversing himself. All the while, Mr. Nixon solidified his position and prevailed. Mr. Rockefeller again campaigned heavily for him, although with a heavy heart, in the view of some politicians who recalled Mr. Rockefeller's asperity toward Mr. Nixon in earlier years. If he was more morose in private, he was the good soldier in public, increasing his praise of President Nixon in recent years. Along the way there was rumor of a possible Cabinet post, but it never materialized. Aside from politics and public service, Mr. Rockefeller's next great passion is for art collecting. His mother was one of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art, and Nelson Rockefeller's collection of 20th century pahiting and sculpture and his primitive art collection are worldfamous. He brought the state into sizable subsidization of the arts and sought an architectural monument for the Capital in the conception of the huge South Mall renewal project in Albany, with all its marble and controversy. ‘Look at That, Louie’ A quiet moment that captured many of the Rockefeller facets — builder, art patron, political crony and jest plain enthusiast — occurred last December in the lobby of the mall's Justice Building. The Governor put his arm around Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz, a politician who has made a career of Lower East Side plainness, and had him study a modernistic metal sculpture resembling giant ice tongs stuck together. “Look at that, Louie!” the Governor enthused. Mr. Lefkowitz looked, hesitantly, doubtfully. “Imagine it grabbing you!” Mr. Rockefeller said with a pinching motion. Mr. Lefkowitz turned and grinned his appreciation, and the Gov/ ernor smiled In satisfaction. For all his public recognition, Mr. Rockefeller is basically a private person. The public May call him “Roeky,” but respectful confidants call him “Nelson,” and a few have been heard to call him “Fang,” out of his hearing, in allusion to his occasional piques. He plays golf in private—a picture of him with a golf club in hand is rare. Just recently he played tennis in Maine with his two sons of his second marriage, Nelson Jr., 10, and Mark, 7, while political circles buzzed about his future. He will not have to househunt in Washington. The family residences include a townhouse in Washington at 2400 Foxhall Road, a summer home at Seal Harbor, Me., a six‐square‐mile family estate —Pocantico Hills—in Westchester, a duplex apartment at 810 Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park, and a 5,000‐acre working ranch, called Monte Sacro, in Venezuela, where. horses, alfalfa and potatoes are raised. Good Counterpuneher If Mr. Rockefeller is called upon for heavy speechmaking duty — and if he follows scripts closely—he will likely show his usual somewhat wooden style. But if he goes extemporaneous — moreover, if he is forced into counterpunching with hecklers—he will show a real speaking talent. This was put to use in freewheeling “town meetings” the Governor instituted to hear public complaints throughout the state. Since 1971, a major topic of coinplaiht has been his handling of the Attica prison uprising, in which he declined to go to the scene and finally ordered a trooper raid, after a period of negotiation, that left 39 inmates and hostages dead from state gunfire. “There was more at stake even than saving lives,” Mr. Rockefeller has said. “There was the whole rule of law to consider. The whole fabric of in fact.” For some liberals, this affair was the nadir of Mr. Rockefeller's public service, and some observers have predicted a pressing Congressional inquiry into the Rockefeller nomination now, given his critics on both ends of the political spectrum. The Rockefeller family wealth, with its international lines of power, has never been adequately traced, in the few of some critics, and they think be the time. Rough estimates of the family worth are $6‐billion to $10‐billion, and each of the Rockefellers is said to have several hundred million dollars in personal fortune. Nelson Rockefeller has said only that he pays an nual taxes in seven figures —or at least $1‐million. The Vice President‐designate's brothers are John D. 3d, who heads the Rockefeller Foundation; Laurance S., who is interested in conservation and runs the family's resort spa business; David, the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and the late Winthrop, who was Governor of Arkansas. A sister, Abby Rockefeller Mauze, wife of a New York banker, resides on Long Island, and reportedly contributed to a fund used to successfully oppose one or her brother Nelson's pet projects—his plan for a new bridge across Long Island Sound. Shooting for 100 The recent speculation about Kr. Rockefeller's new role has made much of his age—he will be 68 at about the time of the Republican convention in 1976. He has, not commented directly on the age matter, but in recent years he has repeatedly reminded questioners that his father lived to be 86 and his paternal grandfather lived to be 97. He says he wants to make 100. He has already left a considerable fabric of public accomplishment in New York State — one of the first extensive antipollution programs in the nation; tens of thousands of new state‐sponsored housing units; reform of the divorce and abortion laws; introduction of comprehensive zoning into huge Adirondack Park; public employe union laws. His feuds with former Mayor Lindsay, once a glamorous Republican rival, became legendary, to some even tiresome, in the state. Through it all, his public service has been marked by enthusiasm and an ability to rebound in controversy.

Links Rise in Deaths to Birth Device,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/22/archives/fda-links-rise-in-deaths-to-birth-device-an-assessment-sought-tells.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 (AP) —The Food and Drug Administration reported today a sharp increase in the number of deaths and uterine infections among women who used the intrauterine contraceptive device known as the Dalkon Shield. The agency told an audience of about 200 scientists, physicians and industry representatives attending a special meeting that the Dalkon Shield had been associated with 11 deaths and 209 cases of septic abortions in women who had been wearing the device. As late as last June 28, when the A. H. Robins Company of Richmond agreed to halt the sale and distribution of the shield, the manufacturer said it knew of seven deaths and slightly more than 100 cases of uterine infections associated with miscarriages among users. An Assessment Sought The updated information, assembled for the special gathering by the drug agency's Bureau of Medical Devices, also showed that another intrauterine device, the Lippes Loop, was associated with five deaths and 21 septic abortions and another, the Saf‐T‐Coil, with one death and eight miscarriages, following uterine infection. The F.D.A. said the new injury and death figures had come from a variety of sources following the Government's nationwide appeal to medical professionals for information on intrauterine devices. Dr. John Jennings of the F.D.A. told the gathering that the agency hoped to get an assessment of whether the devices were safe and reliable, whether current labeling was adequate, whether any brand should be singled out for special attention and how to treat patients who become pregnant while using an intrauterine device. The F.D.A. said that 8.8 milF.D.A. told the gathering that marketed since 1966, including 205,274 discontinued models and 83,920 involved in clinical studies but not yet available to the general public The agency said that only three brands are now being sold to patients, all on a prescription basis: Lippes Loop, Saf‐T‐Coil and CU‐7, the latter the first to be classified as drug because it leaches minute amounts of copper into the wearer's uterus. The drug administration said that seven other models were undergoing clinical studies and nine others had been discontinued. Among the discontinued brands was the Mazlin Spring, which the F.D.A. seized from the manufacturer after doctors reported hundreds of cases of the device becoming imbedded in uterine tissue, sometimes requiring surgical removal. FRESH IDEA: GIVE TO THE FRESH AIR. FUND. Tells Scientists and Doctors That Use of Dalkon Shield Also Led to Abortions In the ease of the Dalkon Shield, which prompted the Federal review, the Government has said it could find no reason for doctors to remove the shield from patients who have been wearing them successfully. In June, however, Federal Drug Administration Commissioner, Alexander M. Schmidt, and the Robins Company advised doctors to consider therapeutic abortions if shield users became pregnant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barley Gives Bucharest a Taste of Overpopulation,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/24/archives/parley-gives-bucharest-a-taste-of-overpopulation-talk-of-bucharest.html,"SUCHAREST, Aug. 23 —There was Margaret Mead, the intrepid anthropologist, tapping her way along the corridors with a Y‐shaped wooded wand almost as tall as her short, square self and saying that far too much nonsense was being talked in Bucharest. Towering Germaine Greer, her head a mass of wet ringlets from the heat, an intense Betty Friedan and the “Non‐Malthusian Coalition” from the third world also weighed in this week at the Population Tribune. Talk of Bucharest They and thousands of others converged on the Rumanian capital for the United Nations World Population Conference and its sideshow, the Tribune, or forum, at the University Law School in another part of town. The Tribune, a gathering of about 1,200 representatives from nongovernmental agencies around the world, was more messy, more lively and in many ways a lot more fun than the goings‐on in the center ring. At times, the United Nations conference seemed to be suffering distinctly from underpopulation, with deserted balconies at the Palace of the Republic and glassy‐eyed delegates gradually drifting from the scene. Some thought even the Tribune was too formal, with set programs and panels, and needed more “creative disaffection.” This has happened, with all kinds of free wheeling debates unrolling in the law faculty's classrooms. Among them are rambling, day‐long discussions on the status of women, some more or l??ss led by Betty Friedan. One disgruntled young woman called her dialogues nothing more than “chic international consciousnessraising sessions.” Tribune participants include abortion activists, particularly from the United States and Britain; right of lifers; family planners and the “O.I. Committee International,” a third‐world lobby against systematic birth control. “O.I.” was formed in 1971 at the International Youth Conference on the Human Environment. The initials stand for the Swahili words “ote iwapo,” meaning “all that is, must be considered.” Its members argue that the Western world's emphasis on curbing births works against the developing world's economic and social growth. • Bucharest has gone all out for its foreign visitors. They are met at the airport by pretty girls waving blue and white World Population Conference placards and are ferried about the city in special, color‐coordinated baby‐blue taxis. But the crush of arrivals has overtaxed the capital's resources. The several thousand delegates and observers have been swelled by hundreds more, including a 135‐member dance troupe from Gabon, taking part in a folkarts festival. Hotels bulge, elevators stall, air‐conditioning whines to a halt in the sweltering weather. Germaine Greer, the women's liberation crusader, stomps wrathfully up and down 10 flights of stairs at her hotel, where the single elevator gave up the ghost days ago and each room has a telephone, but it doesn't work. The Rumanians continue to try harder. At the Athenée Palace Hotel, a wondrous mix of stained‐glass ceilings, potted balms and a swirling, Folies‐Bergère staircase that curls up through eight floors, a miniskirted girl at the information counter put on a combative button. It read: “My body belongs to me.” Rumania outlawed abortion eight years ago and is encouraging population growth. A Telex operator at the press center, installed in the Conservatory of Music, took both sides. She wore the same button, in French, as well as an English button that said: “Abortion kills.” She simply giggled when the contradiction was pointed out. The press center still retains its flavor as a conservatory. Baby grands without legs and an occasional upright piano lean against the walls of virtually everyroom. The confusion of several conferences going on at once has been sorted out by a little publishing miracle called Ilanet, an eight‐page daily newspaper that is slipped under hotel‐room doors every morning. It contains the only coherent, quite complete account of what has been happening where and what will happen on that day. It has a press run of 5,000. John Rowley, a former deputy foreign news editor for The Times of London, directs the operation with a staff of 10. To get the paper out, he had to work out complicated deals with Rumanian printers, publishers and distributors. It will roll off the presses of a small Bucharest evening newspaper until the conferences end Aug. 30. • Rumanian troops are visible everywhere on Bucharest's streets. But it was a surprise to see them stationed upstairs in the Athenée Palace Hotel. During the first days of the conference about 35 uniformed soldiers were on duty. Their main assignment was to carry portable refrigerators to the rooms of honored guests. • The ratio of women to men at the United Nations World Population. Conference is very small: fewer than 200 among the several thousand persons attending. Only seven women are heads of delegations. At the nongovernmental Population Tribune, representation is about equal. Germaine Greer said that the draft Plan of Action being considered by the United Nations conference was “incomprehensible,” in that it failed to recognize that if women were offered no alternative role to child‐bearing, they would never be motivated to contribute to society in any other way. She said the plan regarded women as baby‐factories, the only difference from other factories being that they were being asked to cease production. Margaret Mead, after cornmenting somewhat sourly on the proceedings, said that after all, people had been arguing for centuries. The United Nations and what she called the “global ethic”—the right of everyone to social justice — emerged only after World War II. That.she found encouraging. “I think the human race has a chance to survive,” she said. “We face the worst crisis of the last 100,000 years. But I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it would help.” Dr. Mead was asked whether her forked walking stick might be a Polynesian message carrier. “It's a country stick I bought in London 12 years ago,”; she replied briskly. “They grow them in Cumberland.” Then she stumped away down the hall of the law school to yet another debate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAREY TAKES TOUR ALONG 5TH AVENUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/24/archives/carey-takes-tour-along-5th-avenue-exsenator-mccarthy-joins.html,"Representative Hugh L. Carey took his gubernatorial primary campaign to the lunchtime crowds along Fifth Avenue yesterday, joined by former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, whose familiar figure at times threatened to upstage the candidate. By deftly transferring proffered handshakes to Mr. Carey, the onetime Democratic Presidential aspirant was able to share the recognition of passes‐by without hogging it. Mr. Carey, a relaxed and energetic face‐to‐face campaigner, was accompanied by several of his 12 children as well as by the customary walking‐tour entourage moving in front to herald his approach. ?? took the group an hour and a quarter to walk up the west side of the avenue from Carey for Governor headquarters near 43d Street to 53d. From time to time one or the other of the principals was engaged in debate‐by someone whose hand had just been shaken. The longest stop, of nearly 10 minutes, occurred at the open lobby of a china shop, where a street violinist played passages from Mendelssohn's “Violin Concerto in E Minor” as Mr. Carey and Mr. McCatthy listened smilingly and in silence and scores of strollers gathered. Carey Out of Change Impatient members of the Carey retinue sought vainly to move the candidate along so as not 10 waste precious minutes of handshaking. Mr. Carey reached in his pocket but found no coins with which to show his Appreciation for the impromptu concert. Finally his campaign coordinator pressed some change into the candidate's hand and Mr Carey tossed 27 cents into the open violin case at the feet of the performer, James Graseck, a 25‐year‐old Juilliard graduate. Mr. Graseck, it turned out, was not a complete stranger to Mr. McCarthy, who often walks along Fifth Avenue without fanfare and who, the violinist said, had previously asked him on occasion to play the Mendelssohn concerto. Asked how, he intended to vote in the primary, Mr. Graseck hesitated and then said, “I figure Carey.” At another point in the camp?? walk, most of which was conducted in a light rain, a cluster of umbrellas formed around the candidate while a passer‐by challenged Mr. Carey on his recent assertion that his opponent, Howard J. Samuels, a millionaire, did not have to pay any city income tax in two years when he headed the Offtrack Betting Corporation. Mr. Samuels has said he was entitled to legal deductions that obviated the need to pay any city tax. Most of the encounters, however, were good‐natured, with reactions ranging from outspoken enthusiasm for the candidate to polite noncom‐mittal. Mr. Carey, in an uphill battle against Mr. Samuels, the Democratic party's official designee for nomination in the Sept. 10 primary, was endorsed yesterday by Representative Jonathan B. Bingham of the Bronx, a member of the party's reform wing, many of whose office‐holding members have endorsed Mr. Samuels. In another development in the Democratic primary campaign, yesterday, Mario M. Cuomo and Assemblyman Antonio Olivieri of Manhattan, two candidates for the nomination for Lieutenant Governor, taped, a television debate in Albany. Mr. Cuomo said that had he been a member of the Legislature he would have voted against the 1970 law that relaxed abortion curbs in the atite The Queens lawyer also said he would have supported laws providing state aid to nonpublic schools. Mr. Olivieri, who like his rival is a Roman Catholic, defended his vote for the more pennissive abortion law, saying he personally opposed abortion bur supported freedom of choice for others. He said he ha voted against state aid to nonpublic schools as unconstitutional, a position the courts have upheld. State Sen. Mary Anne Krupsak of Canajoharie, the third primary candidate in the field, missed the debate. She telephoned from Kingston to say that a flat tire had delayed her arrival from New York City, where she had campaigned earlier in the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Service Society and Jobs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/25/archives/the-service-society-and-jobs.html,"By now it is well‐known that service work is the most rapidly expanding field of employment. By 1980, over two‐thirds of the labor force will be employed in the services sector. And it is the human services—health, educetion and welfare‐that have grown the fastest. Within the services sphere, government and nonprofit employment have expanded most. Between 1929 and 1970, nonprofit and government employment more than quadrupled, while total employment less than doubled. Furthermore, it is at the state and local levels, where the human services are actually delivered, that the greatest increases in employment have occurred. The sizable increase in human services goes far beyond the traditional areas of health, education and welfare, however. Today we have women's counseling, hotlines, halfway houses, rape counseling, sex therapy, family planning, encounter groups, retirement counseling, special services for the dying, vocational rehabilitation, day care, marriage encounters, abortion counseling, alternative education centers, community schools, peer counseling, and self‐help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Synanon, Recovery Incorporated, Weight Watchers, humanpotential groups, and so on. And young people, according to the public‐opinion polls, are very much interested in careers in the humanservices fields. At the same time as work in the services, which takes place primarily in the public sector, has increased, has become increasingly clear that the private sector cannot provide jobs for all who wish to work. And the jobs does provide seem to be unsatisfying. Officially, the unemployed are supposed to make up somewhat over per cent of the labor force, but this figure fails to take into account the large number of people who have been too discouraged to even look for work. Estimates of the number of people who would like full‐time or part‐time jobs that are now unavailable range as high as twenty million. This includes a disproportionately large number of old people, women, minority members and youth—people who have been discriminated, against in the industrial workplace through sexism, racism or because of their age. A full‐employment program that would guarantee everyone a decent job, based On creation of jobs in the public sector, obviously has important coalition‐building potential among these groups that may well become “new majority” in America. It is with this majority in mind that Representative Augustus. F. Hawkins, Democrat of California, recently introduced a serious, comprehensive fullemployment bill, which already has attracted more than fifty House cosponsors. And Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr. together with the president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Murray H. Finley, and Leonard Woodcock, president of the United Automobile Workers, has begun a National Committee for Full Employment. Expansion of the services has coalition‐building potential in still another way. It not only provides jobs for the service workers but also potentially benefits the large number of consumers who need these services, particularly poor people, minorities, old people and others who have been deprived of effective services in our society. In this, sense, the services represent an increase in income, especially if they are rendered free or at nominal cost by Federal or state governments. Thus, the income of a poor individual is expanded to the degree that he or she can obtain higher education through open, enrollment and health services through national health insurance. This has important redistributive implications because it is the disadvantaged have‐not groups who have been most deprived of decent services such as health and education. Growth in the services must, of course, provide for truly useful and effective services that are delivered to consumers in a humane fashion. If this is not the case, not only will the taxpayers be dissatisfied, and perhaps halt the expansion of the service society, but the service workers themselves will be alienated by work that is not satisfying or enriching and does not engage their skills, training and creativity. The jobs, then, will simply provide employment, and this is not enough for an authentic service society. Another major potential of a society increasingly characterized by service work, particularly human‐service work, is that it does not typically use up natural resources and fossil energy or pollute the atmosphere, Thus, a service society should be ecologically beneficial. Various reports document the fact that continuous industrial growth is leading to unemployment and the underutilization of people; by contrast growth in the human services will lead to the fullest such utilization. A balanced ecological society does, not call for lack of growth but rather a shift in growth from the traditional industrial areas to the human services with a concomitant marked reduction of unemployment. If our human resources are used efficiently and meaningfully, the quality of our lives can be greatly improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/25/archives/the-region-inflationitis-cuts-transit-aid-in-half.html,"New York's primary contests, which for months have elicited little but yawns from both seers and voters, appear to be stirring a bit of interest for both at last. An upset is in the making in one contest, experts say, and a slugfest of sorts has begun in another. The date for decision is Sept. 10 and a light vote is forecast. Democrats will select candidates for Senator, Governor and Lieutenant Governor. In addition, both Democrats and Republicans will choose large numbers of candidates for legislative, congressional and judicial offices. This is what has been happening: For Senator. The Democratic party's official designee, Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse, has been notable chiefly for his diffidence on the campaign trail and many politicians believe his chief rival, Ramsey Clark, may now score a major upset. Mr. Alexander had done little campaigning so far, but that will shortly change. His staff says he will launch an extensive television advertising campaign this weekend, aimed principally against Mr. Clark. Abraham Hirschfeld, a wealthy builder who has never held public office, is spending heavily but seems to have made little headway in this contest. Mr. Clark, a former United States Attorney General, has run a maverick campaign, limiting contributions to $100 or less and rattling across the state in a 40‐day trek by van. The pros laughed when he began his race. Now they are talking about his chances against Senator Jacob K. Javits in November. For Governor. Name‐calling began last week between Howard J. Samtlels and Representative Hugh L. Carey, the two Democratic contenders, The personal attacks may have resulted from Mr. Carey's belief that despite the odds against him, he might win, and Mr. Samuels' fear that, despite his organization support, he might lose. Mr. Samuels charged that Mr. Carey had put himself under obligation to the oil industry by accepting $1,175,000 in campaign loans and guarantees from his brother Edward, president of a major independent oil supplier. Mr. Samuels said that “where a candidate's money comes from influences his decisions.” Mr. Carey denounced the charge as the “desperate acts of a faltering campaign.” Whether the Samuels, campaign is faltering remains to be seen, but it seems certain his early lead over Mr. Carey has decreased. That was probably inevitable, since last January only six out of every 100 New Yorkers had ever heard of the Brooklyn Congressman. He has since spent well over $1 million, much of it on generally effective television ads, to change the situation. As part of his counter attack, Mr. Carey accused Mr. Samuels, a selfmade millionaire, of moral laxity in accepting total refunds on his 1971 and 1972 New York City income taxes —refunds to which he was apparently legally entitled. “Howard Samuels will pay more taxes when I become Governor,” Mr. Carey declared. Did that mean he planned to raise taxes? Only for millithiaires, he answered quickly. For Lieutenant Governor. The Democratic contest has developed into a, close race. Assemblyman Antonio G. Olivieri of Manhattan's East Side has far outspent hls two rivals, State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak of upstate Canajoharie and Mario M. Cuomo, a lawyer from Queens. Mr. Cuomo has the support of the regular organization and competes with Mr. Olivieri for the Italian‐American vote. Senator Krupsak, a Polish Catholic, appeals to ethnic voters, upstaters, and women. Inflationitis Cuts Transit Aid In Half Preoccupation in Congress with inflation has proven too great for supporters of large‐scale Federal aid for mass transportation, and New York City's subway riders and suburban commuters may suffer as a result. A House bill calling for $20‐billion in aid over a six‐year period, primarily for nine major cities, has been reduced to $11‐billion, the figure recommended by President Ford, as part of an effort to hold down Federal spending. Most, but not all, of the consequences portend bad news. A principle establshed. One aspect of the bill represents a major victory for advocates of Federal aid: For the, first time, the Federal government would help pay for operating expenses, and not only capital spending. Alternate sources. If the Senate, as expected, also limits spending to something close to the House figure, the 35‐cent subway fare will rise unless alternate revenue sources are found. There is some hope Albany will be such a source. Governor Wilson is in an election campaign; he may conclude that helping low‐income New Yorkers is worth the risk of alienating some upstaters. The city is also studying the possibility of getting new funds by diverting money temporarily from the construction of the Second Avenue Subway. A great deal is needed, perhaps $120‐million in addition to the Federal morey, if the fare is to be saved. Officials in the region still express hope Congress will eventually vote more than the $11‐billion. More or less inflation? Mayor Beame called on the city's leading corporate executives, labor leaders and civic officials to use their influence on the Senate. Ralph G. Caso, Nassau County Executive, also expressed his disappointment over, the House action. Commuter lines in Long Island as well as northern New Jersey and Westchester County also would receive funds under the measure. Mr. Caso and others said that cutting aid to mass transit to avoid inflationary Government spending was “false economy” since transit fare increases were inflationary in themselves. Fear Magnifies A Subway Fire Fire and smoke in the subway system is bad enough, and last week it was there for the third time in a month. But to make bad much worse, hundreds of passengers had to endure it in terror as well as discomfort because they had no way of knowing how bad the problem was or how long they would have to endure it. Passengers were stranded in three IRT trains in the East River tunnel, between Brooklyn and Manhattan for two hours, and 157 needed medical treatment. Many panicked and some fainted. The temperature above ground was in the high 80's. Two of the three stalled trains lacked a working loud‐speaker system. Riders on a Brooklyn‐bound train, frightened by flames spotted midway in the tunnel and receiving no assurance of their safety, pulled the emergency cord and descended to the track. To protect them, power had to be cut off. This, say transit workers, delayed the evacuation. To close the dangerous communication gap, David L. Yunich, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, ordered that all trains, starting with IRT lines, be equipped with working loud‐speakers. What will be done about subway fire prevention apparently is more of what has been done. Mr. Yunich said that “maintenance and surveillance” of the subways must be increased. He noted that the fire, minor in itself, started in rail ties dumped illegally in the tunnel. But why they ignited is still unknown. Such fires are common. ‐The last two subway fires started in feeder cables. Many such cables, Mr. Yunich says, are old and are being checked. The Region/Continued  Light Industry Is Getting A Little Too Light The city's largest factory building, now nearly half empty, was auctioned at a foreclosure sale last week, an indication of the dismal trend in light manufacturing establishments: down, and out to the suburbs. The Starrett Lehigh loft on the block between 26th and 27th Streets and 11th and 12th Avenues, symbolized manufacturing's heyday in New York. With roughly as much floor space as the Pan Am building, it accommodated 5,000 workers, many of them Printers, in the 1940's and 50's. MI over the city, there are similar bare reminders of the manufacturers—most notably in the printing and garment trades—who have moved out, cut back or shut down. The vacancy rate is now more than 30 per cent in Manhattan's 4,200 lofts. The city has been losing manufacturing jobs since the 1950's, though until 1969 the losses were more than compensated for by gains in office work, services and government jobs. From 1970 through 1973, the city lost 227,000 jobs in total, nearly half of them in manufacturing. Manufacturers became disenchanted with the city because of high, wage scales and union policies, taxes and other costs and transportation difficulties, among other reasons. They discovered that moving to a suburb only a few miles away, from the city often meant huge savings. A new ambitious plan that could help arrest the trend is the Spring Creek development project, designed to transform 400 acres of largely vacant land on the Brooklyn‐Queens border into a housing, recreation and industrial complex over the next eight years. The estimated cost is more than $1‐billion. There is even some hope for the Starrett Lehigh building. It was bought at auction by Harry B. Helmsley, a major real estate owner, who says he intends to restore the building to its former prominence. But the present overall employment picture in the city and state is not at all encouraging. From June to July, unemployment in the city increased from 6,8 to 7.5 per cent, and in the state, from 6.1 to 6.7 per cent, according to the State Labor Department. The July figures, which some econo mists would call recessionary, continued to exceed the national unemployment rate, 5.3 per cent. The New High For Teenagers Is Not New: Alcohol Alcohol has recently become an important mood‐changing drug for the young. It is cheap in comparison to other drugs, easily obtained and, relatively, more socially acceptable than narcotics. Parents who therpselves drink often say they are relieved that their children are drinking rather than using hard drugs. But the abuse of alcohol by adolescents appears to have reached alarming proportions, especially in New York City and its suburbs. Joel Bennett, president of the New York Council on Alcoholism, says that 60 per cent of the city's youngsters between 12 and 18 years of age use alcohol, ac cording to city surveys, and that a significant number of them appear to be drinking so Much they have the early symptoms of alcoholism and alcohol abuse: Drinking in a compulsive way and to relieve anxieties. The commissioner of the city's Department of Mental Health. Dr. June Jackson Christmas, reports: “Teachers are talking to us about kids of 11 and 12 coming to school with bottles, or coming to class slightly high.” The high schools now try to educate students to the dangers of alcohol abuse; Columbus Hospital has a comprehensive alcoholism program for adolescents, including therapy, guidance and referral to psychiatric services; and Alcoholics Anonymous has six groups in the Greater New York area directed at adolescents. In Connecticut and Long Island, officials also report a notable turn to alcohol. “The kids who would have been on drugs are now using alcohol to get high at parties,” said one medical official. High schools in Westport started counseling sessions last spring on the dangers of drinking, More teenagers are being arrested on drinking charges. Some private hospitals in Nassau have begun rehabilitation programs for adolescents. Abortion View Createi Dispute On Baptism Disagreement on whether a view contrary to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church represents a fundamental breach of Catholicism has resulted in an unusual human as well as a theological controversy. The conflict arose when the Rev. John J. Roussin, a priest of the Immaculate Conception Church in Marlborough; Mass., refused to baptize a baby because of the mother's belief in freedom of choice regarding abortion. Another priest, the Rev, Joseph O'Rourke, director of Catholics for a Free Choice, a New York‐based group, agreed to conduct the sacrament. And denied the use of the Marlborough church sanctuary, he did so on its front steps before a large crowd. The refusal of the one, priest and the acceptance of the other sprang, paradoxically, from the same religious view emphasized in reformed liturgies that came out of the Second Vatican Council, 1962–1965: that a person's attitudes and beliefs toward Catholicism are an integral part of sacraments and other rituals. Father Roussin interpreted the mother's views on abortion, conservatively, as a rejection of a fundamental teaching of Catholicism and thus a cause to refuse baptism. Father O'Rourke, taking a more liberal view, held that a man or woman can believe in free choice in the matter of abortion and remain a Catholic in good standing.

The Greatest Number Served Before the Feminist Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/25/archives/not-more-but-differentwomen-will-be-in-congress-a-professional.html,"WASHINGTON—Ironically, the high‐water mark for women in Congress was reached in 1962, when two women sat in the Senate and 18 in the House of Representatives. That was several years before the feminist movement began. That record is unlikely to be matched In the next Congress, despite the efforts of such groups as the National Women's Political Caucus, the Women's Campaign Fund and the Women's Education Fund. The reason is simple: four of the 16 women‐members of Congress are retiring. “I think we'll do well to hold our own In the House and elect a woman to the Senate this fall,” said Maureen Aspin of the Campaign Fund. But if the numbers of women on Capitol Hill are unlikely to increase, a different kind of woman is likely to appear there. “There is a considerably larger number of feminists running this year than before,” said Jane McMichael of the Women's Caucus. “In the past, you tended to see, in Washington and elsewhere, women in their fifties entering politics because their children were grown and their family life had changed. Now we have women in their twenties and thirties who are not running as an afterthought, who see politics as the major career of their lifetimes.” Betsy Deardourff of the Education Fund calls the more traditional type of woman in politics, often women who succeeded their husbands, “the Queen Bees.” She says they are disappearing. Mrs. Deardourff and others hope that the change will mean more women moving up from local and state positions to the national scene. Mrs. McMichael cited as a heartening piece of evidence the fact that 2,400 women entered Texas primaries this year. “We need role models at the top and broad victories at the bottom,” Mrs. Deardourff said. One place a new role model seems especially likely is Connecticut, where Ella T. Grasso, a career politician, is favored to recapture the governorship for the Democrats. If she wins, she will be the first women elected, Governor on her own merits. The three earlier woman Governors, Miriam A. Ferguson of Tqas, Lurleen Wallace of Alabama and Nellie Taylor Ross of Wyoming, succeeded their husbands. The feminists also entertain hopes for two Democrats running for Lieutenant Governor, Marry Hitt in Alabama and Mary Anne Krupsak in New York, and for March K. Fong, a California Democrat running for Secretary of State. If she wins, Mrs. Fong would be the first woman elected statewide in the nation's most populous state. The Chances in the Senate It also appears possible that a woman will be sent to the Senate for the first time since the 1972 defeat of Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. The leading possibilities are Paula Hawkins, a Republican Public Service Commissioner in Florida, and Betty Roberts, a Democratic state Senator in Oregon. Maya Miller in Nevada and Barbara Mikulski in Maryland are given less chance of success. In the House, retirements will hurt, not only in the numerical sense but also in terms of seniority. Among those leaving are Representatives Edith Green of Oregon and Julia Butler Hanson of Washington, both influential members of the House Appropriations Committee; Martha W. Griffiths of Michigan, fourth‐ranking majority member on Ways and Means, and Mrs, Grasso. All four are Democrats, as are all but two of the women currently in the Congress. The retirements are apparently unrelated, although both Mrs. Hansen and Mrs. Griffiths said that they were tired of politics. Mrs. Hansen said “37 years is a long time to be pursued by an endless string of people who want everything from post offices to gasoline.” Five women are given good chances to win election to the House for the first time in November: Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, and Helen Meyner, a Democrat, in New Jersey; Frances Ryan, an Ohio Democrat; Nina Miglionico, an Alabama Democrat, and Gladys Spellman, a Maryland Democrat. There are intriguing long‐shots as well, including Colleen O'Connor, who is trying to oust Representative Bob Wilson, an entrenched Republican from San Diego, and Marjorie Costanza, the vice‐mayor of Rochester, who is running against Representative Barber B. Conable Jr., chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. A Professional Flavor The professionalism shown by many of the candidates is typified by Miss Miglionico, a Birmingham lawyer who has served for 11 years as a city councilwoman, and Miss Fenwick, a pipe‐smoking former state legislator. Two incumbent women appear to be in re‐election trouble: Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, and Marjorie S. Holt, Republican of Marylansi. Not all the women who seem to be making strong races can be considered feminists. Some, in fact, are uncommitted or unfriendly on such “women's issues” as abortion; Mrs. Grasso, Mrs. Hawkins and Mrs. Ryan fall into that group. But they are backed by many feminists anyway. Mrs. Anne Wexler, a longtime political activist, describes that as “a sign of maturity—a sign that we believe in women officeholders, regardless of party or ideology.” Yet the ideal of feminist solidarity has not completely taken hold. Some women activists remain reluctant to support a woman against a man whom they prefer on the basis of past performances. Such is the case this year in Miss Mikulski's race against Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr.; a popular liberal Republican. ‐R. W.

New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/26/archives/new-jersey-briefs-states-nonfarm-jobs-off-in-july.html,"The State Department of Labor and Industry reported that nonfarm wage and salary employment in New Jersey declined by more than 33,000 jobs in July. Commissioner Joseph A. Hoffman said the July employment total was 2,808,900, or 33,600 less than the June total. He attributed the decline, substantially larger during the June‐July period, to “disappointing employment trends” of continued plant closings and sluggish activity in manufacturing. Manufacturing industries accounted for slightly more than half of the monthly decline, the Commissioner said, with the sharpest decrease in the durable‐goods man ufacturing industries. Bail Reduced in Major Cocaine Case An Ocean County judge has reduced the bail for four men held in connection with one of the larger cocaine seizures in New Jersey. The judge also has threatened the Attorney General's office with a contempt‐of‐court citation if it does not produce by tomorrow the search warrant that the police used to find the drug. Defense attorneys for the suspects want the warrants because they hope to show that they were improperly obtained. The attorneys expect to file motions to suppress as evidence the 32 pounds of cocaine that the police seized in a motel in Ship Bottom, a tiny Ocean County municipality, last July 29. The Attorney General's office has failed on previous occasions to produce the warrant. Two suspects from Florida had been held in lieu $750,000 bail and two men from New York had been held in lieu of $500,000 bail. However, Judge William H. Huber set new bail in amounts ranging from $75,000 to $250,000. Police Find $50,000 Cocaine Cache Policemen who were investigating a report that a prostitute's customer had been robbed of $90 found three pounds of cocaine in a Trenton apartment and arrested three persons. The officers entered the building, at 308 Perry Street, and went to the apartment of Charles C. Cooper, 33 years old, where the alleged robbery had taken place. Inside, the cocaine, worth about $50,000 was discovered, the police said. Mr. Cooper was accused of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and with a variety of other charges, including possession of a policeman's day stick allegedly used during the robbery. Also arrested in the apartment were James Harmon, 22, and Mrs. Patricia Johnson, 25, both of Trenton. They were charged with possession of narcotics paraphernalia. The police said they were still looking for the prostitute. They declined to identify her customer. Pickets Protest Abortion Ban About 50 members of the New Jersey chapter of the National organization for Women picketed for two hours outside the Jersey, Shore Medical Center in Neptune to protest the hospital's policy of not performing abortions on demand. A spokesman of the Neptune Township Police Department said the march was “nice and peaceful” outside the hospital grounds “without obstructing patients or traffic.” The women's organization said the demonstration began its celebration of the 54th anniversary of women's suffrage, which will‐be observed today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. Health Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/27/archives/us-health-insurance-a-legislative-goal-that-has-no-foes-stalled-by.html,"WASHINGTON; Aug. 26—National health insurance doesn't seem to have an enemy in town. The President, all Congressional leaders of both parties, most Senators and Representatives and nearly every special interest group, whether conservative or liberal, support the concept. In broad outline, the notion envisions using the Federal mandate, and perhaps the public purse, to help underwrite the medical expenses of those persons who can't afford to pay for diagnosis and treatment. News Analysis Yet events here this month indicate that national health insurance is about as close to enactment as it was when the concept was first endorsed by the Bull Moose party in 1912. Seemingly, national health insurance is an issue about as apolitical as breathing and motherhood, but, as with air pollution and abortion, it is engulfed in political controversy. Six months ago, for example, President Nixon sent to Congress the Administration's new health insurance bill, a considerably liberalized version of the one he first introduced in 1971. But the Nixon Administration's resurgent interest in a program it had left dormant for three years was spurred by only one motive in the view of many observers and politicians here: It would give the voters a something‐for‐everyone pahkage to distract their attention from the Watergate scandal. Attempts by Nixon Mr. Nixon's attempt to drum up support for the Administration bill—a broadcast address to the nation, a message to Congress, speeches—fell flat, in part because of the gathering storm of impeachment, in part because it was regarded in Congress as an empty ploy. The former President resurrected health insurance on the advice of Melvin R. Laird, the former Secretary of Defense who was called into the White House as a Presidential counselor last year to direct a rescue attempt that failed. On assuming office, Mr. Ford, in his non‐State of the Union address several weeks ago, again sought Congressional support for health insurance, again on the advice of Mr. Laird and for somewhat the same reason; that is, to offer to the voters some indication that the new Administration was moving ahead in domestic affairs. One member of Mr. Ford's Kitchen Cabinet, which incudes Mr. Laird, maintains that others had advised the President to concentrate on tax issues as a better means of winning favor with the voters. One of the ironies is that Mr. Ford could hardly be called a champion of health legislation, even voting against the Medicare bill a decade ago. Thus both Mr. Nixon and Mr. Ford proclaimed national health insurance as their top domestic priority. But both got nowhere because they apparently miiscalculated the extent of conflicts within the House Ways and Means Committee and could not cajole a bill onto the House floor. Inundated With Bills The Ways and Means Commiittee has been inundated with national health insurance bills whose cost and comprehensiveness vary greatly, For example, onb bill backed by organized labor would have the Federal Government lay out as much as $100‐billion a year to pay virtually all the nation's medical bilk Under another bill drafted by, organized medicine the Federal share would drop to $32‐billion, but out‐of‐proket ex(penses would rise from $7‐billion to $30‐billion. Other major difference exist. Should the Federal Government be responsible for collecting the funds, through Social Security type taxes, and paying the bills? Isn't it the American way to let private enterprise do it through commercial insurance companies? How would the system be regulated; by the Federal Government, the states? At least 14 different health insurance bills attempt to provide the answers. Attempting a task that would test the patience of a saint, the 25 members of Ways and Means have spent almost five months weighing all the variables. As an insight into the wde range of views of the committee members, nearly all are themselves, sponsors or cosponsors of one or more of the bills before them, including the committee chairman, Representative Wilbur D. Mills, Democrat of Arkansas. Key Role of Mills Mr. Mills, who has served as committee chairman for 15 years, has both a personal interest in—and a virtual lock on —health insurance legislation, serving as an architect of Medicare and its predecessor, the Kerr‐Mills program in the early nineteen‐sixties.” When organized labor started a push for enactment, of national health insurance in 1969, Mr. Mills was wary He felt that he had been burned badly and perhaps even lied to by members of the Johnson Administration, on the finances of Medicare, which had swollen enormously in cost. The Johnson Administration had, in effect, traded off meaningful cost controls in Medicare in order to get the votes to enact the program. Mr. Mills has said repeatedly that he is not going to get burned again. But the national health insurance issue dragged on in Congress for four years, and some Democrats used the inaction in an, attempt to strip Ways and Means of some of its jurisdiction, and Mr. Mills of some of his great power. Early this year, he countered by acting as a co‐sponsor of the Nixon Administration's revised bill. Then Mr. Mills joined with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to introduce a new bill that was less liberal than organized labor's and in many ways much like the Administration proposal. Finally, two weeks ago he put before the committee yet a third version he had drafted that was a compromise of the previous two. His obvious intent was an accommodation, but it didn't work. Some committee conservatives still balked at the use of Federal payroll taxes and Treasury funds to pay even a small part of the program. For their part, the committee liberals have been playing a waiting game, figuring that the Democrats have an, excellent chance to pick up seats in the November elections, and that their ideas will stand a better chance next year, not this. Despite his public attempts at compromise, Mr. Mills, in the view of political observers, really could be siding with the liberals behind the scenes. Next year, he might be reasoning, would give more time to more fully explore the costly variables and thus put together a better, more fiscally responsible bill, regardless of the President's desire to do it now. Mr. Mills still hasn't formally thrown in the towel on enactment this year, but the White House obviously, has. J. F. terHorst, the President's press secretary, said in response to a question last Thursday that “obviously the timetable is running against” quick passage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FEMINISTS OPEN OWN CREDIT UNION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/27/archives/feminists-open-own-credit-union-slew-haven-office-for-loans-ends.html,"NEW HAVEN, Aug. 26—Symbolically “breaking the economic chains that tie us down” with a bolt‐cutter, the Connecticut Feminist Federal Credit Union opened its doors here today. Its aim is to free New Haven women from what the credit union calls discriminatory lending practices by some banks in the area. In an address at the ceremonies marking the opening which took place on Women's Equality Day, Susan Osborne, co‐manager of the union, explained its purpose, saying: “Our, answer to this continuing discrimination is to create our own credit? institution, a credit union where we can save money together and where we lend our money, to each other.” After the speeches, Daw?? Ladd, a 24‐year‐old house painter who is president of the union, stepped in front of the union's rented basement offices here, holding a bolt cutter Standing in front of the union's insignia, a fist clinched tightly around money, she snapped a 5‐foot length of steel chain. October Loans Planned The credit union is patterned after a similar feminist organization in Detroit and was set up under Federal laws that allow members of labor unions, fraternal organizations or other special interest groups to create mutual savings associations. It has already received $40,000 in deposits and plans to begin making loans of up to $1,000 by October. About 2,300 area women—and men—who are members of the National Organization for Women, the Connecticut Women's Political Caucus, the New Haven Women's Center and the Black Women United in Struggle, are eligible to join the credit union. Miss Osborne said that the union would meet the needs of women who were excluded from getting loans and other forms of credit, despite a year‐old law in the state against such discrimination. She listed them as “working women getting typically low wages, divorced women, women on welfare, women needing money for legal expenses or abortions and women denied loans because of the poor credit ratings of their spouses.” Plans for two feminist banks in the state are already under way. One, the First Women's Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut, has already filed an application for a state charter and hopes to open an office somewhere in Fairfield County soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEATH OF ANIMALS LAID TO CHEMICAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/28/archives/death-of-animals-l-laid-to-chemical-dioxin-identified-as-cause-of.html,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Aug. 27—Dioxin, the deadly chemical contained in a herbicide once used to defoliate forests in South Vietnam, has been identified as the agent that killed many horses and scores of other animals in Missouri. Two young girls, one 6 years old and the other 10, became ill because of exposure to the substance. The younger suffered such severe kidney damage that she was hospitalized for four weeks at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Identification by health scientists of the dioxin is one more step in a medical mystery that began in 1971. The exact source of the chemical, a contaminant in the herbicide 2,4,5‐T, is still unknown. More than 50 horses, 70 chickens, several dogs, a dozen cats and hundreds of wild birds were killed. Dr. Renate Kimbrough, a toxicologist at the Federal Center for Disease Control at Atlanta, said that the Missouri incident, as far as she knew, was the first in which dioxin had been identified as the cause of animal deaths and injury to humans outside of plants where the herbicide was manufactured. No Other Incidents Dr. Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Washington University in St. Louis who is a renowned environmental scientist, said that he knew of no other incident in which dioxin had been identified in deaths outside the laboratory, although it had been suspected in some field cases. A team at the laboratories In Atlanta identified the highly toxic substance—a danger even at a few parts a billion—after almost two years of analysis. The Atlanta center came into the case after the involvement of the two small girls. “We didn't know what we were looking for,” said Dr. Kimbrough. “That is why it took so long. We thought at first it might be some kind of a nerve poison and that sent us off on the wrong track. It was a needle in the hay stack.” The laboratory team found the needle, known by chemists as 2,3,7,8 ‐ tetrachlorodibenzopara‐dioxin, also known as dioxin or TCDD. That substance had been suspected by many scientists as a cause of birth defects in children born in defoliated areas of South Vietnam. Use of Herbicide Halved Laboratory tests with animals found that dioxin not only caused birth defects in guinea pigs but also killed the animals at levels as low as 0.0006 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight. Because of these findings the use of herbicide orange, which contains 2, 4, 5‐T and which is contaminated by dioxin, was suspended in September, 1971. Its use in the United States as a herbicide had been placed under restrictions in 1970. Dr. Patrick E. Phillips, a veterinarian in the Missouri Division of Health, said that the Missouri incident began in May and June of 1971. Four stable areas were sprayed with waste oil to control dust. It was this oil in which the dioxin eventually was identified. Within two days after the spraying, sparrows and barn swallows began to die at one of the stables. “There literally were bushel baskets full of those dead wild birds,” recalled Dr. Phillips. Horses began to get sick, their skin erupting in ulcers. They refused to eat. Fifty‐four horses were affected. “As of this date, 35 of these horses have died,” the state veterinarian said yesterday. “There were 12 abortions in mares of young colts.” The mares lost the colts in the summer of 1971. The horses began to die in 1972. 2 Girls Stricken Then two young girls who lived at one of the stables became ill with what was then an unidentifiable kidney disease. Their mother and the co‐owner of the stables complained of constant headaches. Soil samples taken in the area were the ones in which the dioxin was identified early this month. Preliminary data indicated that the dioxin was in concentration of 60 parts a million. Now the four stables are safe. The soil in which the waste oil contaminated by 2,4,5‐T was sprayed has been removed. “The man who sprayed the stable areas was not at fault,” Phillips said. “He simply bought the stuff. We believe he is telling the truth. The oil with the dioxin should never have gotten into the hands of the waste oil carrier. This guy bought some oil under the idea that this was all it was.” Dr. Herbert R. Domke, director of the State Division of Health, called the incident an “episode of environmental contamination with a highly toxic, chemical which should bring home the very real dangers of environmental pollution. It is remarkable that it it did not cause more human ailments.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Slow Going in Population Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/28/archives/slow-going-in-population-talks.html,"BUCHAREST, Aug. 27 — Air pollution can be just as bad for a Bombay beggar as for Boston Brahmin, so it isn't so difficult to get an international consensus on the importance of abating it. But the problem of mankind's doubling its numbers every 35 years and threatening to overload the globe is far more complex and is viewed quite differently by different nations, making agreement on any uniform response virtually impossible. New Analysis Consequently no such clearcut courses of action as emerged from the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 can be expected from the analogous United Nations World Population Conference now in its final, week here. Stockholm produced an acknowledgment by 113 nations, despite their uncontested sovereignty, of reciprocal obligations in the sphere of environmental protection. It produced an “action plan” of 100 items covering matters ranging from water pollution to wildlife preservation. It also produced a plan — quickly implemented —for a new unit within the United Nations to coordinate and stimulate national and international environmental efforts. On the subject of population, however, the scientific certainties are not there. No one is quite sure why people in the poor countries who can least afford to have children have the most or whether the decline in birth rates as nations advance is primarily related to urbanization, emancipation: of women, or some other factor. The advanced Western nations think curbs on world population growth are urgent. The less advanced Communist bloc thinks economic development is far more important. Some of the underdeveloped “third world” countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America associate population growth with progress, not with dilution‐ of resources. The only two points on which there is unanimity is that every nation has absolute sovereignty in respect to population policies and that the ultimate decisions about population manifestly are made at the level of the family, which under established United Nations doctrine should have full freedom in deciding on the “number and spacing of children.” Achieving an international consensus on environmental good works despite national sovereignties is one thing. It is something else to try to conceive of nations deciding on some suitable ceiling on the globe's population — and then dividing that total into various national quotas. Following that, of course, would be the problem of enforcing these quotas. All this without encroaching on anybody's sovereignty. These stumbling blocks—not forgetting the large groups of people throughout the world who for religious or other reasons oppose contraception and abortion—became painfully apparent in the protracted preparatory meetings that preceded the Bucharest assemblage. Another problem is that the United Nations has had since 1967 a unit working in the population‐policy field — its Fund for Population Activities, currently disbursing about $50‐million a year to help, nations develop population manage. ment programs. It doesn't do any “coordinating,” for which some statesmen have felt a need. But it could not very well be superseded by some new entity concocted here without impairing the United Nations principal foothold in global “family planning.” Consequently the Bucharest conference's pattern and agenda ended up quite different from Stockholm's—with no declaration covering international responsibilities, and with no proposal for an ongoing coordinating unit like the United Nation's Environmental Program. Also, this conference's “action plan” at most will call in generalized terms for efforts to improve health, give women equality of opportunity, and eliminate child marriages. However, neither United Nations officials nor delegates here—even from countries like Sweden with very advanced views on global population management—seem dismayed about the conference's limited goals. They point out that population problems are something the United Nations sedulously ducked until 1965—along with, many of its member nations, including the United States, which has never enunciated any domestic‐population policy. They say that the mere holding of the conference, plus the large amount of preparatory study and debate, has churned up a ferment of thought among nations that is new in population annals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/01/archives/letters-ms-and-cosmo-united-in-defense-of-kansas-city-cuisine.html,"To the Editor: Having had the experience of putting on a press conference at which both Gloria Steinem and Helen Gurley Brown appeared, I was particularly fascinated by your article, “Ms. versus Cosmo: Two faces of the same Eve” (by Stephanie Harrington, Aug. 11). At that time we at the National Abortion Rights Action League were trying to draw attention to the fact that the Supreme Court abortion decision was under attack. We were protesting the fact that so few women had been allowed to testify at Senate, Judiciary subcommittee hearings on constitutional amendments which would ban all abortions. The contrast in their styles was pointed up by Miss Brown herself in her column in the July issue of Coimopolitan when she commented on their preparations for the press conference: “Before the press conference we went to the ladies’ room where I glued on my false lashes and anchored my fall while Gloria ran a comb through her hair and put on some Chap Stick!” The unanimity of their commitment to the cause of reproductive freedom was underlined by their standing up together on this occasion. As you point out, they speak to, and for, large and basically different constituencies. When they speak together it would behoove legislators who seek to abridge these basic rights to listen to them. BEATRICE BLAIR National Abortion Rights Action League New York City In defense of Kansas City cuisine To the Editor: Although I am flattered to be mentioned in the same sentence with Roy Andries de Groot in a food article by John Hess (“The best American food is Chinese,” Aug. 18)—both men being what is known in France as primiers fressers—I should explain why Mr. Hess., failed to appreciate certain restaurants in Kansas City, which has long been acknowledged to be the culinary capital of the world and is, by extraordinary coincidence and good fortune, my home town. Ordinarily, I answer attacks on my loyalty to Winstead's hamburgers by quoting from a manual of gluttony published recently under my name: “Anyone who does not think the best hamburgers in the world are in his home town is a sissy.” However, the story about Mr. de Groot's dog turning up his nose at a Winstead's hamburger must be answered, since it is outrageous enough to have been planted by William Edgett Smith, the man with the naugahyde palate, as part of his desperate campaign to downgrade Winstead's hamburgert and promote the wretched triple‐deckers turned out by Bob's Big Boy (Glendale, Calif., branch). Mr. Hess must have been aware, since it is common knowledge in Eastern gourmet circles, that the dog owned by Roy Andries de Groot is, ironically, VEGETARIAN. I must also explain the laMentable eiperience Mr. and Mrs. Hess had at Arthur Bryant's Barbecue place, long acknowledged to be the single best restaurant in the world. At Bryant's it has always been the custom of the counterman to pick up the ribs in his right hand and, toss them on the plate he pulls toward him with his left hand—a mo. tion he has perfected in a career of some 28 years. When the counter was approached by Mr. and Mrs. Hess—a distinguished‐looking couple if ever there was one —the counterman obviously was sufficiently awed to serve the ribs with a pair of tongs that are used for special occasions and were last employed, I believe, during a visit to Kansas City in 1937 by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. Alas, what everyone in Kansas City knows and someone should certainly have thought to tell Mr. and Mrs. Hess is that the taste of the ribs is partly in the hand.

The Czechs: Still Repressed,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/01/archives/the-czechs-still-repressed.html,"LONDON—Despite indecisive intrigues at the top and Samizdat literature being spread underground, Czechs and Slovaks seem now prepared to forget about politics, and enjoy, along with their East German neighbors, the highest standard of living in the Communist bloc. The visible scars of the August, 1968, Warsaw Pact invasion have been cleared from the walls of the capital, and the new subway was opened in May, two months ahead schedule. Restoration work is being visibly speeded up on Prague's historic buildings. Shops are full and sprinkled with imports ranging from Scotch whisky to Chinese tinned pork. Cars, washing machines, TV sets and other consumer goods can be had on the installment plan. Increases in real wages have been as promised by the regime since 1970, and people's savings accounts are so fat that rumors about a government plan to deflate them through a currency reform had to be crushed with the strongest official denials earlier this summer. Fertility has increased, the result of newly restrictive abortion laws and a range of financial incentives to young couples to have, children. The recently announced 1973 birthrates were the highest for 20 years. The effects of world‐wide Inflation, though they worry foreign trade officials, have so far reached the population only in the shape of gasoline price increases. These have ranged up to 90 per cent, but they have been combined with the abolition of a road tax. And, in a country where many people use private cars mostly for weekend trips to their country cottages, the chief burden of the increase has fallen on state‐owned vehicles. Yet six years after the August, 1968, invasion which crushed the Dubcek experiment, a visitor asking whether things have turned out better or worse than had been expected when the tanks rolled in, is most likely to be told that they have been better but are now worse. There has been no repression such as that which followed the October, 1956, revolt in neighboring Hungary. In Hungary, the repercussions were swift and bloody, culminating in the execution of Imre. Nagy, the revolutionary Prenuer, in the summer of 1958. In Czechoslovakia, no one has been sentenced, let alone executed, for his part in the 1968 Prague Spring. Alexander, Dubcek himself has a desk job in the motor pool of the Forestry Administration in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia and his home town, and all the people arrested and tried since Gustav Husak took over in April, 1969, were charged with offenses committed in resistance to his regime; such as the distribution of opposition leaflets at the time of the 1971 elections. In Czechoslovakia, the Prague Spring has been crushed and the only lesson it appears to have taught the conservetives is to fight relaxation wherever they see it. The writers’ union and other artists’ organizations are mere shadows of their former selves, while the country's real talent has been given no chance for a dignified compromise with the regime. There has been talk of allowing economic experts, —the post‐1969 purges swept some 40 per cent of the managerial personnel out of their Jobs—to return again where they are badly needed. But nothing has apparently come of such Ideas, though Mr. Husak himself was said to favor them, due to the resistance of people who gained promotion during the purges and now form a whole new hardliner class. This, rather than Soviet insistence on hardline policies, is the main cause of the unrelieved pressure that politically weighs on the country. Prague has made little progreSs comparable to that of neighboring capitals or Moscow itself in befriending the West A. Czechosloyak‐West German treaty was stifled last month and agreement has been reached with the United States on mutual property claims. But Prague still remains something of an international outcast, and even such key Western Communist parties as those of Italy and France treat their Czechoslovak comrades on gingerly terms. Western reporters are often accused by CzechosloValda of machinations to blacken Prague's image. But how can anyone enthuse about an “atmosphere in which a group of young people in Bratislava could recently be given prison terms of up to 52 months for “ideological, subversion?”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women's Coalition Seeks IUD Curbs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/01/archives/womens-coalition-seeks-iud-curbs-36-known-deaths.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31 A coalition of women's organizations has announced here that it has filed a petition with the California Department of Health asking for stringent new regulations governing intrauterine contraceptive devices. Patsy Fulcher, chairman of the Coalition of Medical Rights for Women, told a news conference, “Women are tired of being used as guinea pigs for untested medical devices sold at enormous profit by large drug companies.” The petition requests the adoption of regulations that would require the manufacturer to take all steps necessary to inform women of the potential dangers in continued use of intrauterine devices, which came into wider use in 1970 after United States Senate hearings on the dangers of oral contraceptives. The coalition action comes at a time of growing national pressure for Federal rules on the devices, now used by four million to eight million American women, as against 12 million who use oral contraceptives. Over the last year potential dangers and complications associated with the devices have come to light. 36 Known Deaths At Food and Drug Administration hearings in Washington last week, 36 known deaths were reported to have resulted from use of the devices in this country. Additionally, a physician survey by the United States Center for Disease Control disclosed that. IUD use led to over 3,500 hospitalizations in the first six months of 1973. This was interpreted to mean that one of every five users risked hospitalization. In July, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare told 3,000 federally furided family‐planning clinics to stop using A. H. Robins Company's Dalkon Shield because of disclosures that 36 women using the device had suffered spontaneous septic abortions in midpregnancy and four had died of resulting blood poisoning. The petition filed here this week by two Public interest law firms asks the California Department of Health to ban the further sale, distribution or advertising of the Dalkon Shield. It also asks the banning of all intrauterine devices currently on the market until they have been thoroughly tested and evaluated; distribution of information to patients, physicians,and medical schools advising of dangers to users; requiring all IUD advertising to spell out the dangers; and requiring that all manufacturers collect data as to the effects of the devices and make this information available to the California Department of Health. At present, all intrauterine devices do not have to he cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration because they are classified as “devices” rather than “drugs” and thus the agency has no statutory authority to regulate them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giscard's Hope for France: A New Age of Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/01/archives/giscards-hope-for-france-a-new-age-of-refordmm-gilt-and-scarlet.html,"PARIS, Aug. 25—President Valery Giscard d'Estaing describes himself as an optimist. He thinks the world is a little mixed up these days but believes its problems are manageable, its people tough and adaptable and its future not too bleak. In an interview with The New York Times here three day ago, he sat on a green velvet couch in the Elysee Palace and spoke with measured confidence about the coming age, as if the contemporary perplexities were sort of a passing nuisance that could be handled, if not resolved, once people learned to live with perpetual change ad reform. Gilt and Scarlet Office He was friendly toward the United States. He spoke about a member of his family, Admiral Count d'Estaing, who led French naval forces in an attack on Savannah, Ga., during the American War of Independence and was sent to the guillo tine during the French Revolution. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing supported the concept of a united Europe, eloquently but vaguely, and talked mainly about France —with the almost, pride—as a model for the future, and about the role of women, youth and leadership in bringing about an age of reform. The interview took place in his private office, with the Paris bureau chief of The Times, Flora Lewis, and this reporter. The President seemed entirely at ease in the beautiful gilt and scarlet room overlooking a wide park bordered with chestnut trees. He was dressed in a conservative dark‐: gray suit and muted cardinal foulard tie. The 48‐year‐old President, a product of France's best schools, spoke in excellent English, but refused to release the text for publication on, the ground that his ‘English was imprecise and inelegant. As a former Finance Minister, he began by criticizing the economic and financial condition of the world. he Gaulle was condemned for trying to create. trouble, he said, but now it is obvious that the general was right in believing that the world simply could not absorb more than $100‐billion of American deficits. Since that time, President Giscard d'Estaing continued, the world has done away with the international monetary system and has just a moving, floating situation now. Maybe this is all right technically, he asserted, but psychologically and politically it is very unset tling. People did not, know, where they were or where they were going, and this could be cured only by the establishment of a new international monetary system. While on this subject, he said that in the past four or five years of widespread inflation, people of all classes had gotten in the habit of desiring a constantly higher standard of living without any consideration for where the money was. coming from, He hoped this attitude wan approaching its end. The President placed considerable emphasis on the importance of equality between France and West Germany in economic and industrial power. It was for this reason, he said, that he had insisted on a faster rate of growth for France, since she was lagging. Permanent State of Change The problem of political leadership, he said, is to help people adjust to a permanent state of change. France is al very conservative country, he observed, and the people do not like change; they are torn between two attitudes: an Intellectual desire for change and a fear of change. In the past, he explained, France went for long periods, without much change until things became intolerable, and then there were upheavals of various types: revolutions in the 19th century, serious political crises in the 20th century such as the emergence of “the Popular Front in 1936 and the fall of the Fourth. Republic in 1968. His intent, he said, is to try to have a steady, reformist policy, continuous change, with a speed that could be increased or decreased according to the needs of the situation. It is a mistake, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said, to be afraid to contest those who fight against change. For example, a large majority of the French people were against his law facilitating abortion and contraception, but once the policy had been decided, the people accepted it quite naturally. The President, who has been in office fot just over 100, days, was asked what he hoped to achieve as a result of his spectacular victory over Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist leader, in a runoff in May. Two things, he said: to create a feeling that ‘France is, again a little ahead of her time, politically and socially, and to be a member of some European community. Events, Not Concepts Pressed to define his concept of a European community, he replied that he had always believed it rather futile to discuss concepts. We are not living in a world of constitutions now, but in a world of events, he added, so what will matter is what happens, not what is written. The question of federation or confederation did not seem to him to be the key to the problem, though perhaps what he envisaged was what might be called a confederation. As soon as governments are really working closely together, really making decisions together, he explained, the question of structure is not important Still, he insisted that he meant to move toward common action in Western Europe and had talked with the West German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, about developing an attitude so that Europe will be, perceived as a whole by. Europeans and by others. But not he noted, as an additional structure like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He was asked how it was possible to reconcile all the different political and economic problems in each country with common international policies —how to reconcile all this diversity with European unity. He, replied that he did not think it was all that difficult. Nations had the right to diversity. We must not try to force them into a single mold. There were differences of language, behavior, education and standards of living. The main thing to know was whether people, despite their national differences, thought of themselves as belonging to the same unity. Matter of Leadership It is a question of leadership, he insisted: If the leaders are forceful enough and imaginative enough and bring a certain lyricism to the task of leadership, the people will begin to think in a more unified way. What the President seems to be aiming at is a peaceful revolution, a policy of perpetual change, at home and a loose confederation in Western Europe. His Cabinet is drafting a charter on the quality of life. Social security is to be extended to everyone. The Government is discussing a plan for reforming the structure of French companies. Parliament will be asked this fall to pass more liberal laws on divorce, abortion and contraception. In a way President Giscard d'Estaing, like,President Nixon in his first term, seems to be trying to cut across the rigid lines of ideology and party loyalty and create a progressive coalition. To break up the old groupings of French politics. He is appealing particularly to women and to youth. Take the situation of women in France, he said: They have limited possibilities of choice in contraception, divorce, opportunities in business. Yes, he went on, he is serious about the problems of women. The cultural change of our time, he emphasized, will probably come through women. On relations with the United States, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing stressed the importance of consultation but showed little enthusiasm for ceremonial summit meetings or formal institutions to harmonize trans‐Atlantic policies. Spots on the Sphere The best technique is direct consultation between leaders, he said. In fact, there is good consultation between French and American leaders now. ‘He added, but he was canny about discussing associations. The world should be seen as a sphere with large spots on it, he said—the American spot, the European spot, the Soviet spot, the Chinese spot, etc. You could not have the same spot for Europe and the United States; their natures were different, their problems of defense were different, so they could have good relationI ships but they could not be related in the sense of a common structure of decision. Of course, he continued, Europe and America belong to the same political philosophy, the same economic way of life, I and this creates a lot of similarities, but it does not mean association against some other part of the world. He agreed that there were common problems of populaHon, food, oil and other raw, materials, and no doubt these required common thinking. Except for a few nations, colonialism and borders were no longer problems. These other questions were the real problems, but unfortuantely they were not always seen in the same way. The United States, he ob served, believes in a world market without too many rules and the West Germans have much the same approach, but the tradition of the French, the British and the Dutch favors an organized world economy for raw materials, and for population and other major problems. Deep but Informal Accordingly, he thought there was need for a deep and complete discussion of all this, but it was important to avoid having it, in a rigid international forum, where officials tend to I maneuver against one another and fall to reach any real analysis. On a more personal level, President Giscard d'Estaing said he was interested in the 200th anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence in 1976 and thought that perhaps that would provide an opportunity for him to visit the United States. He spoke of the admiral, a career officer in the Ancien Regime who was appointed head of the French Fleet when the American Revolution started and fought at the siege of Rhode Island as well as at Savannah. Asked about his interest in Flaubert and about his own reading and writing, he replied that he had read everything written by and about Flaubert and De Maupassant. Some people like to read for the subject matter and consider language merely a supporting vehicle, he said, but he read and studied them because he liked literature. Also he was fascinated by the question whether De Maupassant was not only Flaubert's pupil but also his son. He said he always had a book under way. Last winter he was working on three novels, but now there is the matter of how they would be received in his present position. When he has trouble falling asleep, he said, he composes stories in his head—slow, low‐key stories, sufficiently articulate to keep his mind busy. Not Style, But Substance Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has sometimes been criticized for paying more attention to the style of his presidency than to the substance of his policies. To a question about this he replied that he was absolutely decided on the reforms he had proposed for the prisons, for control of wiretapping and for freedom of the press. It was unprecedented for a French President to visit prisons and shake hands with prisoners, but he had done so because he wanted to know conditions first hand. Except in exceptional circumstances of spying or when there is court approval, he said, wiretaps are to be eliminated. The press will not be troubled for denouncing him or his administration. Pornography is another matter, he said: not the publication of it so much as exposing it to children. Looking to the longer future, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing foresaw a different world, which, he said, was why he was striving for something different in his thinking and his political actions. He does not foresee major conflicts between the nuclear states in this century, but he does, expect authoritarian, oppressive regimes in large parts of the world and probably considerable tension and localized conflicts as a result of them, Referring to the late French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, he recalled that Teilhard said that the real question is not what you are looking at but where you are looking from. In the past we looked at the world from only one point of view, with the light coming only from us and everything else in shadow, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said, but in the future there will be many more lights, coming from many different places—Brazil, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia—so we will see things in a different way, in a different light. He is an optimist about this coming world, he said, for the history of mankind is a history of progress, and optimism is in order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
France: Austerity Is In the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/01/archives/france-austerity-is-in-the-future-labor-remains-uneasy-a-change-of.html,"PARIS—French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who completed his first 100 days in office last week, has started fulfilling campaign promises for a more liberal, more open, more socially conscious government to try to put France in the vanguard of reformist societies in Europe. But success in the peaceful revolution he is trying to bring about depends, perhaps more than anything else, on the way he handles an economic situation that looks like getting a good deal worse before it gets better. While he moves ahead on an ambitious social charter, there is a growing unease in the country over the price of gigot in the butcher shop, the rise in the rate of bankruptcies (up 23 per cent in a year), the possibility of greater unemployment this winter, the threat of strikes by workers angered by inflation. At the Government's initiative, the National Assembly this fall may well approve more liberal laws on divorce, abortion and contraception. Four women are in the Cabinet, including one, Frangoise Giroud, who heads a new Department for Women's Affairs. The Government has ordered more humane conditions in the state prisons, better housing and other advantages for immigrant workers, the extension of social security to all French citizens. Last week the Cabinet approved an “action program” to improve the quality of life. New administrative machinery is to be set up, to reduce noise and pollution, preserve the ecology. A Change of Attitude President Giscard d'Estaing refers to previous regimes as “governments of fear” and says pointedly his Government is not afraid of adverse criticism. Making adroit use of television, he appeals for national unity to see the country through its economic difficulties. He offers the extension of liberalism under a new social contract in which he is pledging maintenance of relatively full employment in return for acceptance by workers of moderation of wage demands and a little belt tightening. Will it work? Now that he has had his 100 days of post‐election honeymoon, now that most French families have returned from summer vacations, now that the hard economic facts are more clearly visible, the tempo of criticism is mounting. A cartoon in Le Figaro showed some of the new attitude in the country. There was Marianne, the symbol of France listening enraptured to President Giscard d'Estaing playing the accordion (a talent that he had displayed during the election campaign.), and there was the Finance Minister Jean‐Pierre Fourcade dipping surreptitiously into he pockets. The squeeze is on. To combat inflation now running a an annual rate of 14 per cent income taxes for higher wage earners have been raised by 15 per cent and corporate taxes have increased by 18 per cent, The Bank of France is exercising tight curbs over commercial bank lending and has reduced the growth of the money supply Goverrnment spending has been pared so that it about balances the receipts from taxes and other income. Small and medium‐sized companies have found it in creasingly hard to do business, and the president of the Paris Chamber of Commerce has warned that, unless conditions are eased, some 500 concerns in the Paris region will go under in October. One larger company, the Titan‐Coder Corp., which maketrailers, has just arranged a $4‐million emergency borrowing from the Government to prevent a collapse. An employer of 2,700 workers, it may be forced into a marriage with the state‐owned Renault Auto Works. Peasants have been blocking traffic and dumping food in widescale protest against the failure of farm prices to give them what they consider adequate income. Tension have risen between small shopkeepers and supermarket operators. In Rochefort on the Atlantic coast street violence between the two groups left 10 persons injured, a few days ago. Labor Remains Uneasy Along with this unrest have come warnings from union leaders that they will tolerate no reduction in purchasing power of workers. President Giscard d'Estaing's appeals for moderation in wage demands are met by declarations that “docile” trade unions are not the answer. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has pledged to maintain growth policies to keep employment running at high levels, but he has also pointed out that in view of the country's inflatia and balance of payments problems “small remedies are no good for big illnesses.” France, like most other industrial countries, was hard hit by the four‐fold increase in oil prices last year. Abruptly, a small trade surplus projected for this year has now become a deficit running at a rate of nearly $500‐million a month. The President and his financial lieutenant, Mr. Fourcade a tough, crew‐cut technocrat, are counting on cutting the inflation rate to a more reasonable 6 per cent by the end of next year and getting the accounts into rough balance with the squeeze now under way. They maintain they can do this without any sharp contraction of employment. Some critics say this is like chasing two hares at once. The French Communist party leader, Georges Marchais, puts it less subtly. “Conjuring,” he says, “has become a method of government.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carey Stresses His Experience; Vows Unity and an ‘Open Door’,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/02/archives/carey-stresses-his-experience-vows-unity-and-an-open-door-why-the.html,"“I'd hate to be ahead the way he's ahead,” Representative Hugh L. Carey of Brooklyn declared. “He better look over his shoulder because someone's going by him—with your help.” The 150 members of the Taminent Regular Democratic Club in Astbria, Queens, who presumably will be turning out the vote on primary day on Sept. 10, caught the confidence in Mr. Carey's Voice as he discussed his opponent for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Howard J. Samuels. When Mr. Carey finished, they cheered and applauded. Then their leader, Ralph DeMarco, a deputy commissioner of sanitation, fanned their enthusiasm still higher. “He doesn't have to go with his hat in his hand to Washington,” Mr. DeMarco said of Mr. Carey. “He knows his way around.” Turning to the candidate, he went on: When we go up to Albany to see you, your door is going to be open—right, Hughie?” Mr. DeMarco, a small man with a melancholy cast, smiled. “We didn't rehearse this,” he told the audience. “I'm putting him on the spot.” Mr. Carey then rose again. “Of course the door is going to be open,” he replied. “Because it's not my house, it's your house!” Why the Change? After that there were more cheers and then some of the Democrats of Part B of the 36th Assembly District crowded around the candidate. Others headed for the bar, where there were hot dogs and cans of beer and soft drinks bedded down in melting ice in metal tubs. What encouraged Mr. Carey was that the district's state committee members had supported. Mr. Samuels for the gubernatorial nomination at the state convention in June. What had happened, Mr. DeMarco, was asked, to change his mind? “At first we didn't know Hughie was in all the way,” Mr. DeMarco replied. “After the convention we began polling the community. There wasn't much enthusiasm for Howie and most people said they thought Hughie would make an exceptionally fine candidate.” Outside, shadowed by the piers and trestle of the railroad leading to the Hell Gate Bridge, Mr. Carey was Saying almost the same thing to a television interviewer. Only he, he said, with a 14‐year record of accomplishment in Congress, with broad appeal to ethnic voters and labor, with a native son's intimate knowledge of the problems faced by New York City, could heat Governor Wilson, the Republican candidate, in November. Experience Is ‘Compared’ Mr. Carey makes it clear that he regards Mr. Samuels's qualifications for the governorship as less than impressive, his most serious shortcoming, in his view, being that he has never won an election. In rebuttal, Mr. Samuels notes that Mr. Carey's previous political ventures outside the 15th Congressional District have not been notably successful. In 1969, Mr. Carey announced himself as a candidate for Mayor, was rebuffed, accepted the City Council presidency designation on the ticket headed by former Mayor Robert F. Wagner and was then defeated. He also floated another small mayoral trial balloon last year that was generally ignored and soon drifted away. As Mr. Carey sees it, Mr. Samuels's experience consists mainly of his successful operation with his brother of a plastics factory upstate with 300 employes, a brief stint in the Commerce Department in Washington at the close of the Johnson Administration and the operation of the Offtrack Betting Corporation for two years and nine months. “The White House took the National Alliance of Business Men, the only important thing he had away from him,” Mr. Carey said. “How could you miss with OTB? It's a monopoly. At that, it hasn't been all that successful.” Indeed, Mr. Carey has suggested, OTB's greatest success has been in providing political springboard for Mr. Samuels. Mr. Carey maintains that a dozen persons from OTB are working on his onponent's campaign staff. OTB patronage, he went on, had placed the city's Democratic leaders under obligation to Mr. Samuels and had been instrumental in his obtaining the state committee's designation. ‘I'm a Winner’ On the road to his next stop. City Councilman Samuel D. Wright's club in the East New York‐Brownsville section of Brooklyn, Mr. Carey said reports of switches like the Taminent Club's were coming in from all over the city. “The reason for it is there are plenty of people in the party who don't think there's anything wrong with winning an election once in a while,” he said. City Councilman Matthew J. Troy Jr., the Queens County Democratic leader and a Samuels supporter who in the past has visited quick punishment on subordinates who broke ranks, has apparently done nothing to whip his forces back into line. This has led to the suspicion that he and the other county leaders in the city are playing both ends against the middle, protecting themselves in the event of a Carey victory in the pritnary. In grooklyn, Mr. Carey shared the platform with Borough President Robert Abrams of the Bronx, a candidate for State Attorney General. After the meeting they reached an agreemnt on last Sunday's mutual endorsements that they hope will drive a wedge into Mr. Samuels's reform Democratic strength. These changing alliances, in Mr. Carey's view, reflect the growing realization that with the resignation of former President Nixon and the installation of President Ford in the White House, and with a former Republican Governor of New York awaiting confirmation as Vice President, it will take more than just any Democrat to defeat Mr. Wilson. “That was all that Samuels had going for him,” Mr. Carey said. “He has no real base of support and he can't unify the party. I can.” Mr. Carey noted that Mr. Samuels had the support of most of the leaders of the regular wing of the party—“the bosses” whom he scorned in 1970 — and of most of the reform wing, whose influence, by general agreement, has been diminishing year by year, but very little else. But these are just sour grapes, say the Samuels forces, who have dug up three earlier Carey quotes in which he welcomed the support of the Democratic party leaders. Mr. Carey says he will owe nothing to the bosses if he secures the nomination. “I don't claim I planned it that way,” he told a meeting of Democrats in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx recently, “although I do believe my record of independence over 14 years is one reason these leaders did not support me.” Cites Capitol Record Mr. Carey has also tried to turn his lack of executive experience, which is frequently noted by his opponent, into an advantage. Viewing with disdain what he calls Mr Samuels's “insistence on big‐management technieues in running government,” Mr. Carey said that “apparently because he has never won an election or served one day in any public task requiring attention to the people, Mr. Samuels believes he can run New York State as if if, were General Motors or I.T.T. or the Pentagon.” Mr. Carey said his skills in conciliation and accommodation, learned in Congress, and his experience in drafting im portant social and fiscal legislation more than made up for this asserted shortcoming. On the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation and whose Democratic members make committee assignments for members of their party, Mr. Carey is regarded as something of a protégé of the chairman the influential Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas. Representative Mills is expected to come into the state to speak on Mr. Carey's behalf. During his 10 years on the Education and Labor Committee Mr. Carey says he was the author, solely or with others, of scores of bills extending Federal assistance to education, from preschoolers to adults and the handicapped including the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. His work on the revenuesharing bill after he moved to Ways and Means in 1970‐earned him a commendation from then Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Carey has returned the compliment by publicly referring to Mr. Rockefeller as a good—if not great—Governor. In fact, Mr. Carey says, his long association in the House with President Ford, formerly the Republican Minority Leader, and his friendly relationship with Mr. Rockefeller could only help the state, in its dealings with Washington if he is elected. Gives Abortion Stand While conceding that Mr. Carey had been a modestly effective representative, the Samuels forces accuse him of exaggerating his accomplishments, of having voted against tax‐reform legislation and this year, of having virtually ceased to represent his district while running for Governor. As a Roman Catholic, Mr. Carey has been pressured considerably by people seeking an end to the state's permissive abortion laws. He has made clear his disagreement with them, however, and says that in any event the Supreme Court has ruled out for now any further governmental intervention. At the same time, he says, women are often persuaded to have abortions when another course might be preferable. As Governor, he says, he would make available counseling, medical care and other services to make a truly “free choice” possible. Mr. Carey, who is 55 years old, a few months older than Mr. Samuels, was born in south Brooklyn, one of six sons, and was brought up in the Flatbush section, where his father operated a small fuel‐oil and kerosene‐distributing business. Like his opponent, Mr. Carey served in the Army in Europe in World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in command of an infantry battalion He was also a regimental executive officer. After the war he completed law studies at St. John's University and joined the family business. In 1947‐he married Helen Owen, whose previous husband had been killed in action in the Pacific, leaving her with an infant daughter. The Careys subsequently had 13 more children. The two oldest, both boys, were killed in 1969 in an automobile accident on Shelter Island, L.I., where the Careys have a summer home: In 1960, Mr. Carey decided to undertake what was regarded as an uphill race for his Congressional seat. It had been set up by the State Legislature in 1952 to be safely Republican and wandered across the borough from Brooklyn Heights to Jamaica Bay in a classic gerrymander. Mr. Carey, running ahead of John F. Kennedy, as he has with every national Democratic candidate since, won the stanchly conservative district by a few hundred votes. He has been reelected by generally increasing pluralities since. Moving Fast Mrs. Carey died of cancer last March after a long illness marked by remissions that cruelly raised hope that the disease had been cured. Before her death, Mr. Carey said, she urged him to seek the governorship. Beginning serious campaigning only a few months before the convention, Mr. Carey found himself far behind Mr. Samuels and virtually unknown outside Brooklyn. “To make my campaign credible I had to move fast.” he said. “With Watergate and the downturn in business there were almost no political contributors around.” Mr. Carey then turned to his eldest brother, Edward M., who had left the family business, which was subsequently sold, to found the New England Petroleum Corporation This is a refining and distributing company that has headquarters here and is a major oil supplier for the Long Island Lighting Company, the Consolidated Edison Company and other New York utilities. The company is building a refinery and pipeline upstate. Since all these activities are regulated by the Public Service Commission, the possibility of a conflict of interest is foreseen by the Samuels forces if Mr. Carey is elected. Edward Carey's contributions have so far totaled $1,175,000 out of a total of $1,432,000 raised by the Representative. The initial contributions were significant in helping Mr. Carey obtain 31‐per cent of the votes at the state convention in June, permitting him a place on the primary ballot. Mr. Carey agrees that to receive so much money from a single source is a far from ideal situation He says that as far as he is concerned it will not happen again, at least if he is elected since he strongly favors legislation that would sharply limit the size of individual contributions and the total amount that candidates could receive. A Low‐Key Manner It appears that the bulk of Mr. Carey's campaign chest has gone into a series of television commercials prepared by David Garth that were designed to dispel his anonymity and emphasize his efforts on behalf of the handicapped and downtrodden. His campaign slogan, also devised by Mr. Garth, is a distillation of big‐city scepticism confronted with the airy promises of a recent arrival from upstate. “This year,” it says, “before they tell you what they want to do, make them show you what they've done.” With his low‐key manner and his pragmatism, Mr. Carey is, by general agreement, a far from vivid candidate. But that is his natural style and the way he thinks the voters want it this year. “We've cot to restore a sense of moral leadership.” he said, “so that people will say of the Governor, ‘Hey he's trying to do good things.’ “ THE FRESH AIR FUND 300 WEST 43rd STREET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Primary for Democrats,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/03/archives/primary-for-democrats-united-states-senate-house-of-representatives.html,"One clear lesson of Watergate is the need for much greater vigilance by the voters themselves in getting to know and evaluate the qualifications of aspirants for major public office. Regrettably, the reaction of many voters appears to have been a cynical revulsion against the whole political process—an attitude that makes it easier for power to be captured by politicians with overstuffed campaign coffers or entrenched machines. Apathy on the part of the electorate has been the dominant characteristic of the primary for statewide office to be conducted among Democratic voters next Tuesday. Much of that indifference can he ascribed to the normal summer doldrums, a calculation very much in the minds of Governor Wilson and the Republicancontrolled Legislature last spring when they deliberately undercut the Democrats by postponing the primary date from June to September. The Republicans, with few contests—none at the top of their slate—are in the blissful position of sideline observers while their potential rivals fight over the right to run. In outlining its preferences among the Democratic contenders, The Times acts on the basis of its assessment of their respective qualifications. These endorsements apply solely to the primary and do not represent a commitment to any candidate in the November election. Subsequent editorials will cover recommendations for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General and other offices. United States Senate Of all the candidates in this Democratic primary, the one who has responded most directly and convincingly to the challenge of Watergate is Ramsey Clark, seeking his party's nomination to oppose three‐term Republican Senator Jacob K. Javits in November. By refusing to accept contributions in excess of $100, Mr. Clark has dramatized the potentially corrupting influence of “fat cats,” whose lavish campaign gifts were a central issue in the Watergate scandals and remain a disturbing factor in some areas of New York's current campaign. The warm public response that seems to be greeting Mr. Clark's low‐cost, low‐key campaign offers encouragement that the cynicism bred by Watergate can be pierced by politicians of decency and conviction. Mr. Clark's principled stand on campaign financing, his record as United States Attorney General in the Johnson Administration and his progressive, if sometimes controversial, positions on a broad range of issues single him out as the preferred candidate. Mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse, the Democratic convention's designee, has failed to emerge as a persuasive Senatorial prospect. Though undoubtedly well versed in urban problems, at least as they apply to smaller cities, Mayor Alexander does not display the grasp of broader national and international issues that, New Yorkers are entitled to expect of their Senators. A heavily financed advertising blitz and an earthy, brashly ethnic approach have temporarily helped lift Abraham Hirschfeld, a businessman, from political obscurity. Mr. Hirschfeld may know a great deal about building garages, the source of his fortune, but he is painfully simplistic in his proposals for solving complex national problems. House of Representatives The primary choices facing Democratic voters in four of the city's Congressional districts seem significant enough to warrant comment. Since, in all four, victory in the Democratic primary is tantamount to election, the vote on Sept. 10 is in effect the only vote for Congressmen the districts will have. These are our reeommendations: •Eleventh District (Brooklyn and Queens): James H. Scheuer has been an excellent Representative in the past. Before losing out in the 1972 reapportionment of his Bronx district, he made an impressive record in, the fields of manpower, employment problems, family planning, crime and drug addiction. Running against him is Leonard E. Yoswein, former State Assemblyman:Civil Court Judge and briefly City Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance. On the basis of Mr. Scheuer's proved ability as a Congressman, we recommend a vote for him. •Thirteenth District (Brooklyn): As a member of the State Assembly, Stephen J. Solarz has shown himself to be an independent, dynamic legislator who would make a first‐rate Congressman. His chief opponent, the incumbent Representative Bertram L. Podell, has had an uninspiring record in Congress. He is under criminal indictment and faces a trial which he has succeeded in delaying until after the primary. A third candidate is Robert Chira, an impressive young attorney who., was first in the field to challenge Mr. Podell. Despite Mr. Chira's’ promise, the outstanding record Assemblyman Solarz has made in Albany, plus the importance of eliminating the incumbent, makes him much the better choice. • Fourteenth District (Brooklyn): As a reformer, Frederick W. Richmond once ran against the veteran Representative John J. Rooney in this district, only to become his campaign aide a few years later. Mr. Richmond has been a party regular ever since. Also in the field are David J. Billings, former chairman of the city's Council Against Poverty, and Cesar; A, Perales, founder of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, both men of quality. But our strong preference among the four candidates is for Donald. H. Elliott, chairman of the City Planning Commission in the Lindsay administration, an official of outstanding social imagination and liberal conviction, who would be a creative addition to Congress and would represent the district with distinction. •Fifteenth District (Booklyn): The choice here could hardly be clearer. Arthur 3. Paone, who would rather be known as a “populist” than a “reform” candidate, incomparably, referable to his organization‐backed opponent, Leo Zeferetti. President of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, Mr. Zeferetti fully reflects the values and program of the Conservative party, whose endorsement he was delighted to get. He favors capital punishment and tough anti‐abortion laws and opposes the licensing of hand guns. By contrast, Mr. Paone, a former Assistant District Attorney under Frank Hogan and an assistant professor of law, is running on a wellrounded and intelligent program that indicates his capacity to become a Congressman of caliber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Changing the Clubwoman's Image From Flowered Hats to Serious Business,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/04/archives/changing-the-clubwomans-image-from-flowered-hats-to-serious.html,"There was a time when the mere mention of the word “clubwoman” brought snickers of derision from some quarters, along with visions of flowered hats, tea and cookies, idle chatter and Canasta. Some clubwomen, of course, still do chatter idly while playing Canasta in their flowered hats, calmly sipping tea and munching cookies. But, according to the new president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, more and more clubwomen are getting involved in more serious things. Such as conservation, voter registration drives; rape prevention, justice for juveniles, fighting alcoholism and drug abuse, and reducing crime. “Clubwomen today have a greater awareness of the country's needs,” Mary Katharine Miller said the other day in an interview at the Regency Hotel. A Changing Image A lively woman with blue eyes and taffy colored hair that she wears in a bouffant style, Mrs. Miller came to New York from her headquarters in Washington armed with documents to show how the 621,580 clubwomen she has presided over since she took office in May are “changing their image.” The G.F.W.C., believed to be the largest organization of women in the world, thus joins the growing number of organizations, including the P.T.A., the Junior League and the Jaycees, who in the last few years have become anxious to inform the public that they are involved in “relevant issues.” Mrs. Miller said the two main programs of her administration, the theme of which is “Sea to Shirting Sea —Unity,” are a campaign against alcoholism and drug abuse, first, and, second, a project to familiarize women with investment and securities. She said the federation had recently received $97,000 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholisin. Part of the grant will be used to bring 200 club leaders to the nation's capital next month for a seminar On alcoholism and drug abuse. There, in meetings with experts, they will try to learn how they can fight the problems at home. “We're not in the habit of using Federal funds,” Mrs. Miller said, somewhat apologetically, “but I do think we can do a better job spending it at the grass roots level.” The investment and secur ities program Is an “education” program that is being undertaken in cooperation with the New York Stock Exchange, Mrs. Miller said. “Women handle most of the money in this country, but most of them can't even read a stock market report,” she explained. “Lots of women who are left widows don't even know what they have in the way of investments.” Federation members across the country are also working for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, Mrs. Miller said, as well as registering voters and seeking qualified women candidates to run for office. Members are also urged to let their Congressmen know of their opinions on vital issues by sending them $2 Personal Opinion Telegrams through Western Union. Seek to Help Dropouts Mrs. Miller, wearing a brightly printed blue, green and red dress and her gold president's pin, seemed especially proud of the federation's two‐year‐old justicefor‐juveniles program. Clubs in such cities as Indianapolis, Billings, Mont; Severna Park, Md., and Olathe, Kans., have established “halfway houses” and crisis centers for teenagers in trouble. Part of the juvenile program, especially in the Middle West and the Far West, she said, is trying to persuade high school dropouts to return to school. The federation's crime reduction program, she said, includes a “Brighten the Night” campaign in which members work for improved community lighting as a deterrent to crime; and a new nationwide effort by members to “put more teeth” into state rape laws. “In Indianapolis,” Mrs. Miller said proudly, “clubwonien have a program in which hundreds of women go to court whenever a rape v'ictim's case is being tried, in order to give her moral support.” The federation is a bit more conservative, however, on the issue of abortion. “We have passed a resolution favoring therapeutic abortion, but not abortion on demand,” she said. Mrs. Miller speaks so enthusiastically, so passionately, about the G.F.W.C.'s work that one forgets momentarily the old floweredhat image. Does she think such an image was ever deserved? She smiled. “I think that at one time, newspapers took more pictures of our yearly teas than of our project work, and that's what helped foster the image,” she said. “But today, newspapers are looking for something much more than tea tables.” Mrs. Miller knows about the newspaper business: For 10 years, she worked as a reporter for two dailies in Clarksburg, W. Va. In 1960, while serving as president of the West Virginia Federation of Women's Clubs, she flew to Montana to give a speech —and met her future husband, Carroll E. Miller, high school chemistry teacher. “I was adamant that I was never going to get married,” she said, smiling. “I just didn't have the time. Besides, I was over 40.” Settled in Montana Her husband, now retired, convinced her not only to walk down the aisle, but also to leave her beloved West Virginia and settle in Missoula, Mont. During the two years of her G.F.W.C. presi dancy, however, she lives at the organization's headquarters in Washington, D. C„ and the couple take’ turns visiting each other on occasional weekends. Like many other volunteer organizations, the federation has steadily lost members over the last 10 years. In 1964, the organization had 751,490 members; in 1970, 699,565, and now it is 621,580. Federation officials attribute much of the loss to the fact that many former members have gone to work. And speaking of working women, Mrs. Miller, who is unsalaried, takes a very dint viilw of the feminist argument that, because volunteers are not paid for their efforts, volunteer jobs are a waste of time for women. “Volunteer work has helped make this country the greatest country on earth,” she asserted. “When the time comes that everything we do in this country has to be paid for, and we've lost our concern for each other, then we're really in sad shape.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Ford Tells News Parley She's Busy and Happy,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/05/archives/mrs-ford-tells-news-parley-shes-busy-and-happy-surprised-by-son.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 4—“I have found it is a very busy life,” Betty Ford said. “I'm very happy. Everyone lias ben so generous and warm.” It was the kind of statement that First Lddiel are, expected to make after their first few weeks in the White House. The difference was that Mrs. Ford was seated in the formal dining room under a large portrait of Lincoln, facing kliet lights and 150 reporters and photographers, including a good portion of the foreign press. No one could remember when a President's wife had agreed before to a full‐fledged White House news conference. Her predecessors favored more informal meetings with reporters in the living quarters of the East Wing. But Mrs. Ford has let it be known that she intends to be an active First Lady with interests centering on the arts gud children, and she opened the conference with a Statement that she wanted to answer all the questions that had been piling up about her views on life and what role she would be playing in her husband's Administration. She wore a gold dress with open collar and scarf and sat on a gold upholstered chair before a mahogany table that bore a small bouquet of multicolored flowers, She seemed little nervous as reporters asked such questions as “How Would you liked to remembered?” “In a very kind way,” she replied. “As a constructive wife of the President.” But she also let it be known that she had no intention of being noncontroversial as she made the follwing remarks: ¶ She said that she would campaign for ratification of the equal rights amendment for women by the state legislatures, adding that her husband had once joked with her about “equal rights” for women but was now an advocate of the proposed constitutional amendment. ¶ Asked about Mr. Ford's plan to run in 1976 for a full four‐year term as President, she refused to commit herself as to whether she thought the plan was wise, but said, “I'll be happy to campaign — and for guess who?” ¶ On the politically sensitive issue of abortion, she was asked Whether she was closer to the views of Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, who opposes legalized abortion, or Vice‐Presidential‐nominee Nel son A. Rockefelfer, who favored legalized abortion when he was Governor of New York. “Definitely Rockefeller,” she replied. Mrs. Ford was not flustered by questions that are‐invariably asked of First. Ladies. Asked what ‘Women can do to stop future wars, she said “They can always enlist.” After the laughter died down she added, “By becoming active in politics.” Surprised by Son Asked if she agreed with the statement by her 22‐year‐old son Jack that he was “disturbed” over fhe disclosure that President Ford intended to run in 1976, Mrs. Ford said, “I was very surprised at my son's statement.” Asked to describe her family's dinner table conversations about granting amnesty to Vietnam draft evaders and deserters—the President has come out for conditional amnesty—she said, “We had a rather deep discussion, and points were made on all sides,” but she indicated that her husband had ‘already made up his mind at that point. Asked how her, family could retain its “normality” in the White House, she said that she thought that would not be very difficult, even thdugh her husband had made one change—he no longer prepares his own breakfast because of “the good service he is getting in the upstairs dining room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LEGISLATORS GET WOMEN'S RATINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/05/archives/legislators-get-womens-ratings-18-are-put-on-honor-roll-for-action.html,"Calling the 1973‐74 session of the State Legislature “a “major disappointment for the cause, of women's rights,” the New York Women's Lobby yesterday issued ratings for all incumbent legislators, including an 18‐member “honor roll” and a 29‐member “dishonor roll.” The lobby is a coalition of eight organizations, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, the National Organization for Women, and the New York State Women's Political Caucus. It based its ratings on the legislators’ votes on eight bills, and its over‐all assessment of the session on what it called four major defeats: the passage of a bill restricting access to abortions; the deletion of $15‐million for day care from the state budget; Governor Wilson's veto of bill, that would have ended the automatic jury exemption for women and the failure of the legislative leadership to allow a pregnancydisability bill to come to the floor for a vote. The lobby's report also, cited the defeat of other bills, including bills to prohibit discrimination in the sale df insurance and in membership in professional organizations, and a bill to repeal restrictions on the sale of contraceptives. By contrast, the report said, women made slight gains through the passage of “noncontroversial, corrective measures long overdue” that “do not reflect any significant change in the Legislature's resistance to advancing the status of women.” The gain were noted in the repeal of the corroboration requirement in rape cases; the new law prohibiting discrimination in credit transactions; and the first passage of a state Equal Rights Amendment. The report said that the failures of the legislative session were “directly attributable to the antiwomen leadership provided by Governor Malcolm Wilson, Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson and Assembly Speaker Perry Duryea.” The lobby's “dishonor roll” was headed by Assemblythan Harold K. Grime, Republican of Stony Point, who successfully sponsored the measure to require abortions to be performed in hospitals after the 12th week of pregnancy. The Second‐lowest rating was shared by three Republican Assemblymen, Dominick L. DiCarlo of Brooklyn, John T. Flack of Queens and Gerald B. H. Solomon of Glens Falls, as well as by Senator Fred J. Eckert, Republican of Rochester, and Senator Joseph L. Galiber, Democrat of the Bronx. On the positive side, six Senators and 12 Assemblymen received ratings of 100 per cent. This group included all three women Senators but none of the four women in the Assembly. All 18 were Democrots except for Assemblyman Benjamin P. Roosa of Hopewell Junction and Assemblyman William M. Steinfeldt of Rochester.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New President of NOW Prepares Message for Another New President,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/06/archives/new-president-of-now-prepares-message-for-another-new-president-has.html,"Notes from a feminist leader's calendar: “Friday—meet with President Ford. Tell him how to better the lot of women. Saturday—Put on Wonderwoman costume. Parade down Atlantic City boardwalk.” And that is precisely how it will be for Karen DeCrow, president of the National Organization for Women. She will meet today with President Ford and leaders of some 20 other women's organizations at the White House. Tomorrow she will lead the parade at the Eastern Regional Conferences of NQW, whose theme will be “Wonderwoman — No Myth America.” She will be carrying the same message —equality for women—ire different ways to different audiences. Has Things to Say The first president of NOW to be asked to meet with a President of the United States, Miss DeCrow said she hopes to have Mr. Ford's attention long enough to tell him the following: ¶“I want to put a buzz in his head about running with a woman [Vice Presidential candidate]. The President's been fairly straight about announcing that he will run in 1976, but he's beep equivocal about Rockefeller.” ¶“I will push for the appointment of women Federal judges, and I want a commitment that, if he has an opportunity to appoint a SuIreme Court Justice, he name a woman.” ¶“There shouldi be an affirmative action program for the White House and its staff.” ¶“It is essential that someone read all the President's speeches and White House memos to make sure that they have no sexist content.” ¶“I want a commitment that if legislation is passed by Congress to chip away at the Supreme Court abortion decision, he would veto it. I want a commitment that he support any legislation that affects women and veto any that is antiwomen.” Miss DetCrow said that if time with the President were brief, the point she would probably emphasize is “that he must recognize that one of the main reasons that the laws in all 50 states go against women is that there are no feminist judges.” In fact, Miss DeCrow said she hopes that the President himself “will end his term as a feminist” While she applauds Mr. Fords public avowal of support for the Equal Rights Amendment, she said she still thinks he has a way to go. “In one of his first speeches, he announced that he is ‘President of everyone from women's liberationists to male chauvinists and all of us in between,’” she pointed out. “Now, he would never say he is President of civil rights activists and racists. Why should this be any more kosher?” Miss DeCroW, who was the Liberal Party candidate for Mayor of Syracuse in 1969, was converted to feminism seven years ago in a most unlikely manner: watching daytime television. “I was visiting my mother in Florida; it was a rainy day and we had nothing else to do,” she recalled. “Betty Furness or someone like that was on television talking about equal pay and that's the issue I joined on. “I was married twice [she is now divorced], I kept hayto change jobs because my husbands moved, and I was always underpaid [in a number of publishing jobs].” The NOW leader got her law degree from Syracuse University in 1972. While she hasn't yet practiced, she has written about the law. Her most recent book, “Sexist Justice,” was published by Random House this year. The Movement's Future Part theoretician, part pragmatist, the 36‐year‐old Miss Decrow sees the future of feminist success in an overhaul of society rather than an absorption of women into the existing mainstream. “We're constantly debating whether NOW is into the civil rights of better jobs for women or a larger cultural revolution. Clearly, it's the latter,” she said. “We will never get better jobs for women without it, and we will never get employers to regard women employes as human beings until the culture has changed.” Denying that such a concept was too idealistic to implement, she offered specific suggestions on how to effect such a change. Instead of demanding that 50 per cent of all jobs be held by women, she suggested that the jobs themselves should be examined in light of what they've done to men. She explained that she was fearful of the risk of turning women into the same harried, driven success‐seekers that many men are. She suggested such remedies as flexible hours that would alter the lives of all jobholders, not just grant equality to women. Meanwhile, Miss Decrow has little personal concern at the moment for such issues as equal pay. “I'm doing a triple‐time job with no pay for an organization that has taken a firm stand against volunteerism,” she said with a laugh,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/06/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"News Summary and Index FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1974 The Major Events of the Day International German and American officials in Bonn said, that the United States had sought the reaction of its 14 NATO allies to the possible appointment of Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. as supreme commander of the alliance. Bonn; according to a West German Government source, has no objection. The Dutch, however, are reported trying to organize opposition to the appointment. [1:5.] An Administration official said that Pres ident Ford intended to appoint Peter M. Flanigan, a prominent member of the Nixon Administration, as Ambassador to Spain and that he has offered Senator J. William Fulbright, the Ambassadorship in Britain. Mr. Flanigan reportedly has accepted, but Mr. Fulbright has expressed misgivings. [11:1.] One of the worst droughts in years has struck northern India and, with fertilizer shortages and a lack of fuel for irrigation pumps, threatens to destroy rice and wheat crops. Tens of millions face food scarcities and perhaps famine. [1:4.] Secretary General Waldheim of the United Nations told the General Assembly in his annual report that profound economic and social problems were threatening the world with a “crisis of extraordinary dimensions.” He said there was an “almost universal sense of apprehension” about the direction in which the world might be heading, and feelings of “helplessness and fatalism which I find deeply disturbing.” Inflation and insufficient food supplies, Mr. Waldheim said, were immediate problems that had to be solved. [1:2–3.] In the first of the meetings on the nation's economy, leading economists told President Ford that the country did not face a big depression, but that its economy was likely to remain painfully sluggish. Despite their widely differing philosophies,. they approached unanimity in concluding that the, time had come for the Federal Reserve Board to ease its relentlessly tough monetary policy that has affected money, credit, interest rates and, indirectly, the stock market. [1:8.] President Ford opened the conference on inflation with an appeal for “action that is practical, possible and as rapid in its effect as we can reasonably expect.” The meeting, he said, “unites Republicans tend independents and Democrats in an election year against an enemy that doesn't recognize one political party from another.” Meanwhile, Senate Democrats resolved to stay in session for the rest of the year if necessary to act on Administration proposals dealing with inflation and other national economic problems. [1:6–7] In his first official statement as President Ford's principal economic adviser, Alan Greenspan ‘said that he foresaw a “flattened” economy in the months ahead, with some increase in unemployment. He saw no reason for extreme pessimism about the economic outlook. [1:6–7.] Florida filed charges against one of its biggest condominium developers in an effort to break recreation leases that cost condominium buyers millions of dollars a year. The state's Attorney General said the suit was “very much a test case,” and that developers who invest in recreation facilities attached to condominiums would typically have an “unconscionable” windfall profit of between $3‐million and $6‐million annually for as long as 99 years. [1:4–5.] Dr. Fred C. Ikle, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, warned that a nuclear war could destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere that protects all living things from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. The potential depletion of the ozone area by nuclear explosions is a new, accidental discovery that arms control officials believe adds an awesome new element to the destructive effects of a nuclear war.

Joan Harriman, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, levied the charges at a news conference she said had been called With the approval of the 36‐year‐old priest, the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, a member of the Jesuit community at 924‐West End Avenue. He has been a board member of the organization Since last March at its invitation, she said. An article in The Boston Globe on Wednesday said that Father O'Rourke had been dismissed from the order for disobedience of his vows in baptizing the infant son of Carol Morreale in Marlborough, Mass last Aug. 20. Father O'Rourke performed the baptism in a highly publicized ceremony after priests of Immaculate, Conception Church, the family's congregation refused because of the rnother's views. Mrs. Morrealr had been quoted in a local newspaper article as saying she believed in freedom of choice for women regarding abortion. Mrs. Harriman said, the priest had told her in a telephone conversation that he had not actually been dismissed but had been informed by the provincial supervisor, the Rev. Eamon Taylor, last Thursday that “processes for dismissal have, started.” Father Taylor, who has failed to respond to attempts to reach him over the last two days, said in an earlier interview that Father O'Rourke had been “expressly forbidden” by his superiors to perform the baptism.

Ford Is Firm for an Amendment To Let States Act on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/06/archives/ford-is-firm-for-an-amendment-to-let-states-act-on-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 5—President Ford continues to favor a constitutional amendment permitting the states to enact legislation on abortion, his spokesman said today. J. F. terHorst, the White House press secretary, said the President's “long‐held view” was that there should not be Federal laws on abortion. The secretary recalled that Mr. Ford, while a Representative, opposed a 1972 referendum in Michigan that would have permitted abortions on request up to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. terHorst, in response to questions, restated Mr. Ford's views on the politically sensitive issue a day after the President's wife, Betty, was asked at a news conference whether she was closer to the views of Senator James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, who opposes legalized abortions, or the Vice President‐designate, Nelson A. Rockefeller who favored’ legalized abortion when he was Governor of New York. “Definitely Rockefeller,” Mrs. Ford replied. Mr. terHorst said that Mrs. Ford's response had not been “a very definitive answer” and that he did not think the views of the President and his wife “are that far apart.” He added: “Mrs. Ford's concern and the President's concern are essentially that there must be a remedy where abortion becomes necessary because of serious illness or criminal attack of some kind.” The President, Mr, terHorst continued, “favors a constitutional amendment permitting the states to enact legislation in this field.” A decision of the United States Supreme Court in January, 1973, effectively overturned state restrictions on abortion. Mr. terHorst also announced that Mr. Ford would meet tomorrow with leaders of a number of major women's organizations “to discuss the President's plans for the participation of women in his Administration, to hear from them on what they feel are issues of prime concern, and to determine what the President and the Administration can do to address these concerns.” The press secretary said that Mr, Ford was still working on his plan for conditional amnesty for draft dodgers and deserters but that because of other events on the schedule, such as trips for speeches to Philadelphia tomorrow night and to Pittsburgh on Monday, the President's decision would probably not be announced before next Tuesday. Between appearances at a conference on inflation in the East Room, Mr. Ford, among other things, conferred with Claude S. Brinegar, the Secretary of Transportation, officials of the President's. Domestic Council and William W. Scranton, former Governor of Pennsylvania, who is lining up names of candidates for jobs in the new Administration. And although Mrs. Ford indicated yesterday that the President no longer fixed his own breakfast in the White House, Mr. Ford, for the benefit of photographers, began his day to day by toasting his own English muffins in the White Hotise family kitchen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Case For Not Voting,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/07/archives/the-case-for-not-voting-observer.html,"Is anybody going to vote In this year's elections? Probably. Old habits die hard and old maxims keep ringing in the ears long after their absurdity has been universally conceded. This is why citizens always vote, whether they know what they are voting for or tot. They were taught years ago that not voting was bad citizenship, and that society would approach its nearest to perfection when every eligible voter went to the polls and did his duty. We now know this to be pernicious nonsense, but it is still considered subversiye to say so. If every eligible voter went to the polls, one year, we might very well elect a Government, even worse than the one we elected in 1972 with a relatively small turnout. It seems far more sensible for people who are not Well‐infortned about the candidates to abstain Prod voting and leave it to those who are, for what will make democracy work, if anything will, is not a mass electorate but an informed electorate. The difficulty nowadays lies in becoming informed. What is called the campaign is usually an elaborate and expensive exercise in triviality, deceit and mendacity. In modern times it has become exceedingly rare for candidates to discuss the government business they would have to conduct if elected, so that there is little chance, to learn whether they have even min imal professional competence. Political campaigns are deliberately built to make judgments difficult for the voters. Commonly, they attempt to persuade the voters that the candidate is a good television performer and looks trustworthy. They also strive to show that the candidate has good teeth, a happy family and a nondescript mind. None of this information is very interesting if you are trying to decide whether the candidate believes in a regressive tax structure, subsidies for failing corperationa, expanded health care programs or any of the other dull nuts‐and‐bolts stuff he will have to deal with if elected. Instead, campaigns conicentrate on selling us the notion that the candidate is that prize American noodnik, the regular guy, and gets along well with his loved ones, none of which has anything at all to do with the case. There is no reason to believe that a sadistic wife‐beater who detests everybody at the country club may not, in spite of that, make an excellent government officer. When campaigns do come to grips with “issues,” the result is usually thundering piffle. In the Kennedy‐Nixon cainpaign of 1960, ferried for its so‐called’ “debates,” the great “issue” was what American policy should be towards Quemoy and Matsu. Anybody remember who they were? In 1972 George McGovern, spent months trying to defend himself on the “issues” of legalizing marijuana, amnesty for war evaders and abortion. None of these had much to do with whether McGovern, was qualified to deal with the foreign policy and economic problems he would have, confronted as President in 1973, big the Nixon people had successfully turned them into “issues” which voters judged important. Voters, of course, seem to prefer these bogus debates about issues that aren't, and so conspire to keep themselves in the dark. The explanation may be that campaign “issues” are deliberately chosen by candidates for entertainment value, the politicians having an eye on the necessity for keeping the voters awake. Arguing about whether, marijuana should be legalized is, after all, a lot more fun than listening to somebody explain how unemployment might be cut to 4 per cent. It doesn't have anything to do with the Preeidency, but it will keep emotions aroused sufficiently to get people to the polls on Election Day. If it is almost impossible any longer to become adequately informed, about Presidential candidates to risk a vote for one or the other, imagine how hard it is to learn enough about state and local office‐seekers to justify voting for anybody. Making” choices between people about whom you know nothing, ex cept that they possess good teeth and talk about “bold new departures,” is something like firing a shotgun blindfolded, and the notion that everybody ought to do so as a civic duty is dangerous. The more sensible act is to withhold one's vote in any contest about which the voter feels poorly informed. In some cases, this would result in nobody getting any votes at all, which would not be disastrous. In Presidential elections, we might get men elected by only two or three hundred voters, which would be a positive gain, since it would put an end to the habit these birds have of sitting around the White House telling themselves they are “the President of all the people.” ???

JESUIT DISMISSED ON ABORTION ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/07/archives/jesuit-dismissed-on-a-bortion-issue-had-baptized-son-of-woman-who.html,"The Jesuit order has dismissed a priest who baptized the son of a Massachusetts mother who advocated a woman's right to choose abbrtion. The dismissal of the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, a member of the West Side community of the Society of Jesus, was announced yesterday by the pro vincial supervisor of New York. The action followed several days of silence on’ the priest's status after the removal was first reported in The Boston Globe. The 36‐year‐old priest, at a news conference after the announcement, charged that the dismissal had been effected by “regressive forces in the Church” for the sake of “an indefensible social strategy.” Father O'Rourke, who has been active in antiwar causes since before his ordination, baptized the three‐month‐old son of Carol Morreale last month on the steps of Immaculate Conception Church in Marlborough, Mass. Local priests had refused to perform the rite after Mrs. Morreale had been quoted in a newspaper article as believing in the right of women to choose to have an abortion. Tradition Cited In announcing the dismissal, the Very Rev. Eamon G. Taylor, the New York provincial, said the decision “does not speak to the controversy that existed among the people of Marlborough about abortion and about the Catholic tradition on baptism”’ He attributed the removal to “differences of understanding and judgment” between the priest and his superiors regarding “the nature of a Jesuits commitment to the society and of the society's service to the Church.” Father O'R'Ourke, who said his behavior had been under close scrutiny for some time, I insisted he had not been told that to baptize the child would violate his oath of obedience. He acknowledged, however, that he was “told not to go.” Father Taylor has said that the priest was “expressly forbidden” to perform the baptism. Father O'Rourke said that he had been subjected to “trial by Telex” between his superiors and the provincial general in Rome, without formal charges being brought against him or a chance to state a defense in writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary and Index SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1974",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/07/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"Portugal and the guerrilla movement of Mozambique will sign an independence agreement today. It will end Portugal's 400‐year‐old sovereignty over the East African territory and will mark the end of a 10‐year guerrilla war against the Portuguese. [1:8.] Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have joined other Arab countries seeking investments for the rapidly growing accumulation of funds arising from the recent quadrupling of oil prices. Kuwait offered to pay the equivalent of $246‐million for a British commercial real estate company in what may be the largest Arab investment disclosed so far in the West. It proposes to buy all of the shares of the St. Martin's Property Corporation's real estate holdings, which are concentrated in London's financial district and extend to Europe and Australia. [1:7.] Saudi Arabia has decided to purchase several billion dollars of a special bond issue of the United States Treasury. Government financial sources said. An American diplomatic source speculated that the amount and timing of the bond purchase would be geared to progress toward a political settlement between the Arabs and Israel. [1:6.] Colombia, Costa Rica and Venezuela have joined the growing Latin American movement against political and economic sanctions against Cuba. They proposed to the Organization of American States that the sanctions imposed 10 years ago be removed. The sanctions were sought by the United States in response to what it saw as subversive activities in O.A.S. countries, sponsored by Havana. [1:6.] Because of “the increasingly repressive measures” of ‘President Park Chung Hee's Government, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposed that American military aid to South Korea be sharply reduced now and cut off completely by 1977. If upheld by the full Senate and the House, the committee's proposal would set back severely the planned modernization program for the South Korean armed forces. [1:6–7.] National The Labor Department reported that unemployment rose slightly in August and that the increase, combined with a similarly small one in July, left little doubt that unemployment had moved to a higher level than the one that prevailed during the first six months of 1974. The jobless rate in August Was 5.4 per cent of the total work force, and was the highest since October, 1972, when the rate was 5.5 per cent. [1:1.] The Ford Administration's two top economic officials expressed opposition yesterday to suggestions made by some economists at the White House meeting on inflation Thursday that the nation's money supply should be expanded. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told newsmen that easing of the tight money policy would not, help fight inflation. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon said he supported continued restraints on the money supply. [1:2.3] Governors and lottery officials of the 13‐states that run lotteries were assured by Attorney General William B. Saxbe, who believes that lotteries violate Federal antigambling laws, that there was no present danger of prosecution of lottery ticket buyers, state agencies or private concerns involved in lotteries. Mr. Saxbe said, however, that he would seek an injunction against lotteries if Congress did not clarify the gambling laws within 90 days. The state officials unanimously protested the Attorney General's proposed action. [1:1–2.] Metropolitan Assemblyman Antonio G. Olivieri, one of the Democratic aspirants for Lieutenant Governor, asked his campaign manager, Matt Shipman, to step down, following disclosures that Mr. Shipman had given $1,500‐last June to a state committeeman two days before the State Democratic Committee met in Niagara Falls on endorsements. Mr. Olivieri appeared before an executive session of the New York State Select Committee on Crime to explain his version of the check transaction, which has been under investigation by the state panel. [16:6.] Acting to ease New Jersey's housing and real estate crisis, the Byrne administration raised the state ceiling on Conventional mortgage loans to a maximum of 9.5 per cent. The new ceiling puts the interest rate on conventional mortgages at the same level as home loans guaranteed by the Veterans Administration and the Federal‐Housing Administration.

A TYPICAL PRIMARY IN MASSACHUSETTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/08/archives/a-typical-primary-in-massachusetts-dullest-race-ever-poor-business.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 7—It is the kind of primary that could happen only in Massachusetts. The two Democratic rivals for the governorship—having agreed not to speak ill of each other—are calling the Republican incumbent bad for business. Meanwhile, the Republican Governor is denouncing party regularity and has been disowned by his state chairman. Voters in the party primaries here this Tuesday face contests at nearly every level of office, but the major attention has been focused on the two races for the gubernatorial nomination. The Democratic primary. pits Michael S. Dukakis, a New Politics‐style reformer, against Attorney General Robert H. Quinn, a party regular. In the Republican primarS?, Gov. Francis W. Sargent is being challenged by Carroll F. Sheehan, representing resentful conservatives in the party. ‘Dullest Race Ever The contests, however, do not appear to have generated widespread excitement among the electorate. “It's the slowest, dullest race ever,” said one politician, “the worst I've ever seen.” Along with other politicians, he said that one side effect of the Watergate scandals was a sharp drop in the amount of money available for political campaigns, particularly for the lower offices, and apparent disillusionment with politicians among the voters. The normally fractious Democrats agreed not to attack each other personally for the sake of party unity in the hope of winning the governorship in November. The calm broke this week, however, when Mr. Quinn's campaigners distributed leaflets saying that he had always opposed “forted busing” in the white neighborhoods where emotions are running high over a court‐ordered school integration plan that is to begin next Thursday. Mr. Quinn also took out advertisements in neighborhood weekly newspapers, contending that Mr. Dukakis favored abortion. Poor Business Climate Previously, both men had said the main issue of the campaign was what they described as a poor business climate created by Governor Sargent. Mr. Quinn, in his television spots, and Mr. Dukakis, In his position papers, both Contended that the Governor was responsible for the closing of factories and the rising unemployment rates here. Beneath that surface agreement is a contrast of new and old politics. As a somewhat maverick State Representative from suburban Brookline, Mr. Dukakis was responsible for the passage of the nation's first no‐fault automobile insurance law. He was nominated for Lieutenant Governor in 1970, but lost and became the moderator of the public television program “The Advocates.” He has stressed disclosure of his personal and campaign finances. Mr. Dukakis has spent more than a year building his own statewide organization of local activists. But many observers here believe he has been badly hurt in his own liberal constituency by annduncing a school plan that’ he said favored “local control,” but which seemed to others to be an abandonment of integration. The Traditional Mold Mr. Quinn is out of the more traditional mold of Boston politics — Irish Dorchester, Boston College and service in the state legislature, rising to House Speaker. He has labor endorsement and is regarded in political circles as a fast learner. His primary day strategy centers on careful targeting of voters in traditionally Democratic areas who have participated in the last two or three primaries. Beyond the primaries, however, lies the central fact of Massachusetts’ political life: the existence of more than a million independent voters. Mr. Sargent won the governorship in 1970 because of his appeal to independents, and his current strategy appears to be to emphasize this with an eye to avoiding anti‐Republican Watergate backlash in the general election. Thus, he took out a full‐page newspaper ad portraying himself as struggling against those who would insist on party loyalty. And, in a debate last week touched off by the ad, the Governor blithely told the state Republican Committee that he had appointed 70 Democrats to judgeships. His opponent, Mr. Sheehan, a real estate man and former state Commissioner of Commerce, contends that Governor Sargent has made Massachusetts “the laughing stock of the nation with the help of ultra liberal advisers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parent and Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/08/archives/will-my-baby-be-normal-parent-and-child-genetic-counselors-are.html,"Each day, roughly 700 sets of parents throughout the United States are cruelly reminded that medicine has not yet conquered genetic disease. About one in 14 babies is born with a genetic disorder; the afflicted range from the diabetic who may become a tennis champion to the hopeless cripple who may live only a few days. Genetic mistakes, according to the National Foundation‐March of Dimes, afflict some 2.9’ million Americans with mental retardation, 4 million with diabetes, 1 million with congenital bone, muscle or joint disease, 500,000 with complete or partial blindness, 750,000 with impaired hearing and some 6 million others with imperfect organ systems. While these mistakes cannot be corrected, the curse of genetic disease is slowly being lifted. new kind of specialist called the genetic counselor can now detect more than 60 disorders in unaffected “carriers” and, equally important, within the developing fetus itself. As recently as 10 years ago, doctors faced the complexity of human deformity armed with little more than 19th‐century peas‐andflowers genetics. Today, genetic counselors, who are usually M.D.'s with extensive training in genetics, can call upon a growing arsenal of sophisticated tools to probe within the cell and even among the invisible genes themselves. Perhaps more important, they can now offer parents considerably more than guesswork when asked the heavy question: “Will my baby be normal?” Alan Anderson Jr. is a freelance writer who specializes in scientific and medical subjects. Even the most optimistic counselors are quick to admit that genetic diseases will never be eliminated; natural mutations constantly replenish the stock of defective genes. But they are quickly learning to identify high risk women most likely to need help: Those over the age of 35; those with deformed children or a family history of genetic trouble; those with diabetes, hyperthyroidism or some 125 other metabolic diseases; those plagued by miscarriages or stillborn infants; and those of a few susceptible ethnic groups. Greeks and Italians of Mediterranean origin, for example, should he tested for thalassemia (a rare type of anemia), Eastern European Jews for Tay‐Sachs disease and blacks for sickle‐cell trait. Close relatives are counseled against having children. First cousins, for example, have one‐eighth of their genes in common. Thus a man carrying the gene for cystic fibrosis has one chance in 400 of marrying another carrier if she is unrelated—but one in eight if she is a first cousin. Parents who fall in a high‐risk category will find a session with a genetic counselor an intensive experience. In one Manhattan clinic, typical of bigcity facilities, a counselor first talks with parents by phone, explaining the procedure and requesting complete family medical records. Next, the parents come in for a morning or afternoon session. They begin by spending an hour or two with a counselor who draws a detailed “pedigree,” a scheinatized medical geneology essential for tracing inheritance patterns. If the parents are accompanied by a child with an ailment suspected to be genetic, the child is given a thorough physical exam. (A counselor's medical training is important at this point, since enables him to screen out nongenetic disorders.) The family then is asked to wait while the counselor enters a closed‐door session with a group specialists. This group discusses the case, deciding whether enough is known for a diagnosis or if further tests are needed. ‘If the parents have lost a child to cystic fibrosis, for example, the counselors can quickly tell them that they are both unaffected carriers of the gene and that each succeeding child will have one chance in four of inheriting the disease. If biochemical or chromosomal tests must be done, the counselor explains why and makes another appointment. Such tests may take from three to six weeks and are designed to indicate whether crucial genes are functioning normally. A gene is simply a portion of a ladderlike molecule of DNA—a substance present in the nucleus of every cell. The structures of various genes will set the patterns of cell growth and so determine such inherited traits as hair, skin and eye color, body structure and the like. In addition, gene structures determine how normal chemical reactions will occur within the cell, and how body functions that depend on those reactions will take place. Although no one has ever seen a gene; the proper functioning of tens of thousands of them is essential to producing and maintaining a normal human body. To test this functioning, researchers grow large numbers of similar cells from samples of blood skin, in much the same way “cultures” of bacteria are grown from small colonies. This has made feasible to discover cell irregularities that could not be determined from the examination of a single cell. For example, the culture of cells can be assayed biochemically for signs of trouble such as the ineffectiveness or lack of an essential enzyme, This could well indicate a genetic error, since if any of the dozens of genes thought to order the production of an enzyme are not formed properly, that enzyme could be disorganized and useless. The enzyme galactase, for example, is essential to digestion of milk sugar; if the enzyme is defective, a child who drinks milk will develop a disorder known as galactosemia, causing cataracts, cirrhosis of the liver, mental retardation and even death within the first month. If galactosemia is detected in prenatal testing for genetic problems, milk can be withheld from the newborn infant's diet before damage can begin. By cell culturing, a scientist can also produce good samples for chromosome analysis. The chromosomes (really long chains of genes) are visible only when they divide, an event that occurs as the cell and its nucleus are reproduced. Scientists have learned how to use chemical processes to “freeze” them in the act of dividing so that they may be scanned for missing sections or irregularities. A counselor may, for example, be asked to determine what is wrong with an adolescent girl with infantile sex organs, drooping eyelids, a webbed neck, and ‘short stature. Seeing these symptoms, an experienced counselor will immediately suspect Turner's syndrome and order a chromosome scan. If each of the girl's cells lacks one female sex chromosome (the x’ chromosome), the counselor must confirm his suspicions to the parents: The girl will never be able to bear children. At the same time, knowing why usually comes These new tests can also be used to detect genetic mistakes early in a pregnant woman who has reason to expect trouble (one who belongs to a high‐risk group, or who has been exposed during pregnancy to X‐rays, German measles or some drugs). Doctors have developed a relatively painless procedure called amniocentesis, usually performed after the 13th week of pregnancy, in which a small amount of fluid is drawn from the amniotic sac in a hollow needle passed through the abdomen. Because the baby moves actively and even breathes in this fluid, it carries fetal cells. Like the blood or skin samples, these cells can be cultured and then scanned for chromosome irregularities, or broken down for biochemical tests. Requests for amniocentesis come most frequently from doctors of older women concerned about having a child with Dowh's syndrome, or Mongolism. The counselor will explain to the woman that the chances of bearing a Mongoloid child increase rapidly toward middle age: Before age 30, they are about one in 3,000; from age 30 to 34, they rise to one in 600; from 35 to 39, one in 280; from 40 to 44, one in 100, and after 45, one in 50. Because a woman's lifetime supply of egg cells is formed even before she is born, the odds of “over‐ripeness” or environmental damage increase as she grows older. Thanks to amniocentesis and cell‐culturing, it is now easy to pick out the telltale irregularity of Down's syndrome—an extra chromosome No. 21. Then comes the hard part. The counselor will probably tell the parents that if mental retardation is severe, the child may have to spend life in an institution. He will also point out that advances in heart surgery and antibiotic use have extended the lifespan of many Mongoloids far past the old limit of childhood. Then it is up to the parents whether to have the child and hope that its symptoms will be mild, or to end the pregnancy by abortion and try again. The choice is a cruel one, but most parents would prefer the option to a fait accompli in the delivery room. Both Turner's and Down's syndromes belong to the class of defects caused by chromosome mistakes. Such a mistake occurs when any one of the 46 chromosomes present in every normal cell is missing, duplicated or broken. These errors occur either in the egg or sperm before conception, or in the embryo after, and are passed on to many or all of the subsequent cell divisions. Each chromosome may be composed of hundreds of genes, so such a mistake will disrupt a vast number of genetic instructions. Of these mistakes, those affecting the two sex chromosomes, x and y, are thought to be the mildest; individuals with Turner's syndrome do, at least, survive. When a de of the 44 autosomes (nonsex chromosomes), the damage is far more severe. As many as 65 symptoms have been described in Mongoloids, and all this disruption is caused by merely an extra copy of one of the smallest autosomes. Children lacking any autosome, even the smallest, are never born alive. Chromosome mistakes are so gross that they are usually visible under a microscope. Most of the 2,000 or so known genetic defects, however, are caused by only one or a few invisible genes. Since the popularization of Mendel's laws of genetic behavior after the turn of the century, geneticists have been tracing and classifying these heritable errors. The three best‐known are dominant, recessive and sex‐linked. The names are strictly behavioral; presumably, a dominant gene would look just like a recessive gene if they were visible. Mendel discovered that all genes are inherited in pairs—one from the male parent and one from the female. If a defect is caused by a dominant gene, that gene will “mask” the efforts Of its normal partner, producing the defect. In the case of some chronic glaucomas, Huntington's chorea, achondroplastic‐dwarfism, polydactyly (too many fingers or toes) and nearly 1,000 other ailments, the defective gene is dominant to its normal matching gene. If a person with one of these traits has children, each of them stands a chance of one in two of picking up the bad gene. (Just as a coin may come up heads three or four times in a row, however, such odds do not guarantee that a healthy child will follow an abnormal child; gamblers and geneticists agree that “chance has no memory.”) A recessive disorder is one caused by genes whose possible effects are usually masked by dominant normal genes. For a child to inherit any of about, 800 recessive diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, galactosemia, sickle‐cell disease, or Tay‐Sachs disease, he must receive the defective gene from each parent, and the defective genes must be paired together. Thus, even if both parents carry the defective recessive gene, the child has only a one‐in‐four chance of being afflicted, a two‐infour chance of being a healthy carrier, and a one‐in‐four chance of being neither a carrier nor a sufferer. Another 150 or so diseases are also recessive, but sexlinked as well. That is, the gene appears only on the x, or female, sex chromosome. (The y, or male, sex chromosome carries no known genetic information except male reproductive orders.) Because females have two x chromosomes, the normal dominant usually masks the recessive that causes such traits as color blindness, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and agammaglobulinemia (lack of normal defense against disease). Males, on the other hand, have only one x chromosome to go with their y. If that x is defective, there is no other x to mask it, Queen Victoria was perhaps history's bestknown carrier of a sex‐linked disease, hemophilia; unaffected herself, she passed it on to several royal sons and grandsons. When such a female carrier marries, each son has one chance in two of inheriting the trait; each daughter has a one‐in‐two chance of being a carrier. Affected men who bear children will produce only carrier daughters; sons, who inherit his y chromosome, cannot get his Less understood, and less predictable, are malformations caused by combinations of genes, such as hydrocephaly, clubfoot, cleft lip and/or palate, and spina bifida. Something like 20 seperate genes are thought to cause anencephaly, or incomplete brain and skull formation. The mother may have’ 15 of these genes, the father 10; neither would be affected, but in combination they may produce an affected offspring. In the population as a whole, about one in 1,000 newborns is anencephalic. If parents have one child with such a disease, most genetic counselors predict that the odds of having another are about one in 20; if two children, about one in 10. Fortunately, these usually fatal spinal and cranial distortions can be detected in utero by a sonarlike ultrasound profiler (now used routinely with amniocentesis) or by protein tests on amniotic fluid. The ettectiveness of these new tests in averting years of suffering is illustrated in the case of Rachel R., whose sister had lost two infants to Tay‐Sachs disease. When Rachel married, she and her husband John feared the same fate for their children: Both were descendents of Ashkenazic Jews, one in 30 of whom carry, this recessive gene. Tay‐Sachs babies seem normal at birth, and are often exceptionally beautiful. But at the age of six months, development begins to slow because of an error in body chemistry. Nerve cells rupture and die, responses slow gradually, and the brain deteriorates. Before Rachel became pregnant, she and John were both tested by a genetic counselor and told the bad news that both of them, although healthy themselves, were car” riers of the Tay‐Sachs gene. Each child of theirs would stand a 1‐in‐4 chance of inheriting the fatal disorder. But after their counselor told them that Tay‐Sachs can now be picked up by amniocentesis, they decided to try for a child. Rachel was tested during her 14th week of pregnancy and, to her delight, the results were negative. Their baby would be born free of the disease, and she coin(’ look forward to the rest of pregnancy with peace of mind. On the other hand, the child would have to be tested again after birth: It would have a 2‐in‐3 chance of being an unaffected carrier, and would want to know with certainty before having children. The big challenge to genetics, of course, is not simply to identify early the genetic mistakes that cause Tay‐Sachs babies, but to correct them. Already a few halting steps have been taken in this direction. One young boy with agammaglobulinemia, the sexlinked inability to stave off disease and infection, was rescued by injection of about a billion bone‐marrow cells from his sister. Even more ambitious are plans to implant slow‐dissolving microcapsules of enzymes to supplement a faulty metabolic system, or even to inject bits of genetic material to replace or correct faulty genes. Such genetic wizardry is not yet part of the counselor's repertoire. In fact, some counselors complain that popularization of amniocentesis has led to impossible requests by women who want a “beautiful baby” or a “perfect child.” Counselors also spend much of their time dealing with false alarms. Dr. Laurence Karp of the University of Washington reports a case of a pregnant woman whose doctor thought amniocentesis should be performed as “last resort,” because her brother was mentally retarded. The brother's problem could not be assigned to a known genetic syndrome, however, and Dr. Karp had to explain that amniocentesis would not help. Another physician requested Karp's group to “check the chromosomes” of a patient known to be a TaySachs carrier. The counselors explained that a chromosome check would be useless; to detect Tay‐Sachs disease, cells of the fetus must be grown in a test tube and then analyzed and the would take several weeks. The woman declined the tests, saying that by then she would be feeling the baby move and could not consider abortion. Although most patients are still referred by their private physicians, many now seek genetic advice on their own. “People are becoming more sophisticated,” says a counselor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “More than a third of our patients are calling us direct.” Most counselors work at large medical centers where they combine clinical sessions with community screening programs. An in‐clinic counseling session typically costs $25, a Tay‐Sachs test $10 per couple, a chromosome analysis 575, and amniocentesis, including culture and analysis, $100 to $150. The procedures are usually covered by medical insurance; for those without coverage who cannot pay, there is usually no charge. “The last thing we want,” says ‘ Lynn Godmilow of Mount Sinai Medical Center, “is for people to stay away because they think they can't The training of the counselors themselves has barely begun. As recently as 10 years ago, only a handful of medical schools offered courses in genetics; now most do. Thus, of the few hundred counselors in the entire country, most have entered the field within the last few years. If every patient in a high‐risk category were to seek help, their ranks would be overwhelmed. Yet to these hardy pioneers, every new patient may bring the cause of another genetic disease, and with the cause the hope of a new cure. “Hardly a week goes by when we don't discover something new,” says a busy counselor between sessions. “If anyone has any questions about genetics, they should call us.” Where to Write Genetic counseling and related services have nearly tripled over the last six years. In the United States, there are now 389 laboratories offering various genetic services, according to the International Directory Genetic Services published in March by the National Foundation. Of these, 272 offer genetic counseling. Further information is available from: The National Genetics Foundation, 250 West 57th St., New York, N.Y. 10019. The National Foundation‐March of Dimes, P.O.

Can Feminists Upstage Miss America?,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/08/archives/can-feminists-upstage-miss-america-friendly-heckling-confrontation.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, Sept. 7 —Two thousand feminists, some dressed in costumes and all led by 20 “Wonder Wornen,” marched down a raindrenched boardwalk today in a parade they hoped might upstage the nearby Miss America pageant a little bit. The feminists were here for a three‐day convention that they called “Wonder Women Conference: No Myth, America.” It is sponsored by the 10‐state eastern region of the National Organization for Wohten. Many of the paradeis were dressed to portray women's accomplishments down through the years. Members of the Essex County, N.J., chapter of NOW, who filed the lawsuit that resulted in girls being able to join the Little League, wore baseball uniforms and carried signs that said, “Diamonds are a girl's best friend.” Members of the Monmouth County, N.J., NOW, who recently integrated the once male‐only county ambulance corps, were dressed as ambulance attendants. Women from Maine were dressed as sufragettes, and women from Ocean City, N. J., wore oldfashioned bathing suits and carried signs reading, “Ocean City NOW makes waves.” ‘Sex Objects’ Compete A few blocks away, at Convention Hall, 50 contestants —“sex objects” to the feminists—competed for the title of Miss America of 1975. The contestants had been invited to take part in the parade and other feminist activities, but if any did, they kept their identities to them. selves. It was no coincidence that the two opposites were attracting attention: The feminists had deliberately picked their convention dates to coincide with the annual beauty pageant. “We want to provide the country with an alternative view of women,” said Judy Murphy of Teaneck, N. J., the NOW conference coordinator. “We want to show woman as a full human being—a provider, creator and thinker, not just as an object or a mythical creature as exemplified by the bathing suitclad Miss America.” Albert A. Marks Jr., an Atlantic City stockbroker who is chairman of the Miss America pageant, said without referring to NOW by name: They can do their thing. We will do our thing and never the twain shall meet.” To some feminists, the whole affair brought back memories of September, 1968, when about 100 members of the then fledgling women's liberation movement picketed the pageant on the boardwalk outside of Convention Hall. The women carried posters then deploring “the degrading, mindless ‐ boob ‐ girlie symbol,” and tossed girdles, bras, hair‐curlers and false eyelashes into a “freedom trash can.” Although the contents of the can were never burned, the incident was widely reported, and out of it grew the perjorative term “bra‐burners” used in reference to militant feminists. The Wonder Women conference seemed much less grim and humorless than the 1968 gathering, perhaps because of the feminists’ greater numbers and greater confidence. The conference is being held as much for fun as anything, and the only real business scheduled is the election of two eastern regional directors of NOW. The two evenings of the conference have been given over to such things as a “splash party” in the hotel swimming pool and a dance. The “Wonder Women Parade,” as today's parade was called, was led by “The Holy Child Marching 100,” a boys’ and girls’ drum and bugle corps from a church in Staten Island who wore red, white and black satin uniforms. Other marchers sang “We shall not be moved” and carried such signs as “Philadelphia: City of Sisterly Love” and “Every woman is beautiful” and “If men had babies, abortion would be a sacrament.” Friendly Heckling Unlike the vicious taunts of 1968, most of the heckling seemed good ‐ natured and came usually from middleaged men standing on the boardwalk beside their wives. “Who's cleaning the house?” one man yelled at a group of women marchers. “Why don't you join the WACS?” another asked. When a group of New York City marchers passed by, chanting “What do we want — equality!”, a whitehaired man from Philadelphia shouted at them, “Why?” The No. 1 “wonder woman” was Karen DeCrow, president of the National Organization for Women, who marched at the head of the parade. She had just come from a Friday meeting at the White House with President Ford and the heads of 16 other women's organizations. She and the other “wonder women,” who headed the state contingent throughout the parade, dressed much the same: blue headbands with one gold star on the front, gold T‐shirts that said “NOW Wonder Women” in navy‐blue letters; knee ‐ length navy wraparound skirts with white stars on them, and black boots. Miss De Crow, a Syracuse lawyer, told the women before the parade began that the White House was “very comfortable, a nice place. Those of us who will be occupying it someday will find it very comfortable.” She also said she had asked President Ford to campaign for the equal rights amendment in those states that had not yet ratified it, and that he had said he would think about it. And how were the Wonder Women chosen? Did they have to compete against each other? “They volunteered,” Mrs. Murphy said. “There was no competition. It didn't matter if they were young or old, fat or thin. The shirts come in small, medium and large.” Confrontation Avoided The parade stretched for eight blocks in a drizzling rain, from the ChalfonteHaddon Hall Hotel, headquarters for the NOW convention, to Indiana Avenue, and back. It stopped five blocks short of Convention Hall, a decision of the feminists, Mrs. Murphy said, not of Atlantic City officials. “We didn't want any confrontation,” she said. “We felt we were making enough of a statement. We didn't want to upset the Miss America contestants because, after all, they are our sisters.” Many of the stars of the feminist movement turned out for the convention, including Miss DeCrow; Florynce Kennedy, lawyer and founder of the Feminist Party; Wilma Scott Heide, former president of NOW; Margaret Sloan, chairperson of the National Black Feminist Organization, and Barbara Love, a lesbian who coauthored “Sappho Was a Right‐On Woman.” Betty Friedan, mother of the women's movement, was to speak at the convention but called in sick from hei home in New York. Representative Bella Abzug of New York was scheduled to have “The Last Word” at the closing session Sunday afternoon. The women at the NOW convention seemed to represent all ages, ethnic groups and walks of life. There were white‐haired women with canes, teen‐aged girls with their mothers—and even a sprinkling of men. Almost all of the feminists had samething to say about the other show in town. “I frankly hoped that the beauty pageant would go the way of the dodo bird by now,” said Shirley Schell, 49, of Wilmington, Del., a college administrator who received her bachelor of arts degree at 38 and her master's degree at 40. “I always watch ‘the Miss America pageant on television — for laughs,” said Pamela MacLeod, a 13‐year‐old high school student from. Princeton Junction, ‘N.J., who wants to be a lawyer. “It's really very funny. Those girls look so stuck‐up and unreal.” When they weren't listening to speeches or marching, the feminists were attending “wonder women workshops” on such subjects as feminist humor, belly‐dancing, feminist “herstory,” heterosexuality ty and bisexuality, auto mechanics, abortion, rape, negotiating the marriage contract and women in prison. And about the time a lot of other people in this resort city were drifting over to Convention Hall to hear Bert Parks croon “There she is, Miss America …” the feminists gathered in their hotel to hear a three‐woman rock group called “The Deadly Nightshade.” And as to whether any feminist sneaked up to her hotel room to watch the Miss America pageant on television, well, nobody will probably ever know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOUND INCREASING,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/08/archives/sexual-activity-found-increasing-hard-to-believe-abortion-a-factor.html,"A national survey has indicated that in the 1970's married couples are having sexual intercourse more often than those in the same age brackets did in the previous decade. The findings point to a general increase of about 21 per cent. The rise has occurred in varying degrees among all age groups surveyed and for all methods of contraception, as well as for none at all. An analysis of the survey findings by Dr. Charles F. Westoff, professor of demographic studies and sociology at Princeton University, suggests that several factors are responsible. A major factor, Dr. Westoff reports, is the more widespread use of new contraceptive methods—the pill, the intrauterine device and vasectomy. These methods are highly effective, reducing anxiety about unwanted pregnancy, and their use is separated from the sex act, encouraging spontaneity. However, Dr. Westoff said, since women using older forms of contraceptives, as well as none at all, also reported more frequent sexual activity, other factors must also be involved. One of these, the analysis indicated, is the growing liberation and changing expectations of women. Coital frequency “was reported to be higher among women with some college education and those who had careers, as well as among women who expressed support for goals of the women's movement. Abortion a Factor In addition, Dr. Westoff said, he believes that the greater availability of legal abortion probably reduced anxiety about pregnancy and “the increasing societal permissiveness and widespread discussion of sex has undoubtedly reduced inhibitions and changed people's behavior.” The continuing survey—the National Fertility Studies of 1965 and 1970—was conducted among national random sampies of some 5,000 married women under age 45. In extensive interviews, the women were asked, among many questions, how often during the previous four weeks they had had sexual intercourse. The question was intended mainly to elicit what effect the various contraceptive methods had on coital frequency‘ Results of the current analysis, based on married, women living with their husbands, will be published this week in Family Planning Perspectives, the journal of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The study found that reported coital frequency was highest among couples using such contraceptive techniques as the pill, the IUD and vasectomy, and that considerably more couples were using such methods in 1970 than in 1965. However, even if the 1970 group had the same contraceptive practices as the 1965 group, as well as the same age distribution, there would still be a 14 per cent increase in coital frequenty, Dr. Westoff reports. Hard to Believe The sociologist, who is associate director of Princeton's Office of Population Research and was executive director of the National Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, said that when the data on coital frequency first came out of the computer. “I didn't believe the whole thing and bent over backwards to show that the increase reflected a greater willingness of women to talk about their sexual behavior rather than an actual change in behavior.” ‘ However, every test Dr. Westoff applied to the data indicated that the phenomenon was real, not apparent. In one such test, he showed that in 1970 it took women desiring pregnancy less time to conceive, which would be true if they had intercourse more frequently. Although Dr. Westoff believes that the numerical data gathered in the surveys are imprecise (“Most women seem to have answered the question by taking a typical week and multiplying by four”), the trend seems to be real. According to the data, the average coita frequency rose from 6.8 for the four‐week period in 1965 to 8.2 in 1970. For women using the pill, the average of 10 sexual acts in the four‐week period was 25 per cent higher than the average for women using other contraceptive methods.

For Miss America ’75 the Questions Get Tougher,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/09/archives/for-miss-america75-the-questions-get-tougher-masters-degree.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, Sept. 8—Miss America of 1975, clutching her chaperone's hand, walked nervously today through the lobby of a hotel that was also housing 2,000‐feminists. Finally, she found the meeting room with the wooden throne. Then, 21‐year‐old Shirley Cothran, “Chigger” to her friends back home in Denton, Texas, sat down and revealed at her, traditional breakfast press conference that she is a traditional Miss America with most of the traditional values. She doesn't smoke, she said. Alcohol has never touched her lips, and she has never tried marijuana. “I'm a Christian and I believe that my body is the temple of God,” Miss Cothran said in the Chalfonte‐Haddon Hall Hotel here. She frowned, scrunched up her nose and added shyly, “I don't even like the smell of alcohol.” Miss Cothran, who was wearing a beige wool dress, her rhinestone crown and a full make‐up, looked and sounded like many past Miss Americas. But what perhaps makes her more newsworthy is that she was crowned in a year when 2,000 feminists staged a “Wonder Women Parade” down the boardwalk on the same day the Miss America pageant was held. The parade was part of the National Organization for Women's eastern regional conference, titled “Wonder Women Conference: No Myth, America.” Judy Murphy, of Teaneck, N.J., coordinator of the conference, said: “By being here at the same time as the beauty queens, we feel we're making a very positive statement to the country—that all women are wonderful, and that it's what's in your head that counts, not what your bust, waist and hip measurements are.” Miss Cothran measures 36‐23‐36. Pageant press releases refer to these figures as “vital statistics.” She is also 5 feet 8 inches’ tall, weighs 119 pounds, has hazel eyes and brown hair that she wears in a shortish, pageboy style that she said helped make her a “woman of today.” Master's Degree Miss Cothran's talent contribution in the contest was a flute rendition of “Swingin’ Shepherd Blues” and “Bumble Boogie.” She is a graduate of North Texas State University, where she was a Yucca (the yearbook) Beauty, has a master's degree from the same school in guidance and counseling, and, before her crowning, had planned to begin the doctoral program in guidance counseling this fall at Texas Christian University. Her ambition is to teach at the university level. She will earn more than $100,000 in her year of personal appearances as Miss America, plus the $15,000‐scholarship she won as the winner of the pageant. At the breakfast press conference, Miss Cothran, surrounded by pageant officials, was calm and composed as she fielded questions from reporters — who seem to have grown more aggressive in their questioning of Miss Americas. Not long ago, most questions had a slightly worshipful quality, and “what did you eat for breakfast?” was a typical one. After several minutes of hedging, Miss Cothran said that she was in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment. She said that amnesty for draft‐dodgers and deserters was “too delicate a question” for her to deal with yet, and that she favored abortion in cases when the life of a woman was in danger, or if rape had been involved. Asked if pageant officials had forbidden her and the other contestants to attend events at the NOW conference, to which they had been invited, she replied: “No, not a word was said. I just simply didn't have any tithe —there were so many rehearsals.” Does she herself believe in the women's movement? “That is their thing,” she said, “and this is my thing respect what they're doing, and I hope they can respect me for what I'm doing.” Loves Apple Pie Some of her favorite things, she said, are apple pie, her religion (she is a Southern Baptist who once founded a sorority for Christian girls) and Johnny Carson, not necessarily in that order. In fact, about the only thing on her mind as she was playing the flute and parading up and down the runway Saturday night was Mr. Carson. “I thought, ‘jeepers, Johnny Carson's probably watching me,’” she said, smiling to reveal perfect teeth. The woman she admires most, she said, is Mrs. Pat Nixon, “because she stood by her husband in all his troubles, and I think that's great for a wife to do.” she said she also admired former President Nixon, “because he withstood a lot of pressures, and made some wise decisions.” But the person she regards as the most exciting political figure in America right now is President Ford, “because he's the one in office right now.” Miss Cothran said she had a boyfriend, Richard Barret, a 21‐year‐old student at North Texas State University, but that she would never live in a “trial marriage” with him before they got married. “I don't believe in that,” she said firmly. She said that when she does get married, she plans to use her husband's name rather than her maiden name. And for the time being, she prefers “Miss” Cothran rather than “Ms.,” she said. Miss Cothran's whole family attended the pageant. Her father, James, is a security guard, and her mother, Frankie, is a housewife. Her sister, Joyce Ann Bays, 24, works in a garment factory. The family's home town, Denton, Texas, is also the home of Phyllis George, Miss America of 1971. Meanwhile, back at the Wonder Women conference, two women were elected Eastern regional co‐directors of NOW. They are Rosemary Belmont of New Jersey and Jean Conger of Delaware. The Wonder Women conference and the Miss America pageant both wound down at about the same time. As Representative Bella Abzug was giving the last speech to the feminists this afternoon, most of the beauty queens were getting ready to leave for their respective homes. ‘A Better World’ Representative Abzug suggested a new standard of beauty for women: “She is beautiful because she is an individual, she cares about herself and others, she tries to make a better world for all of us and the whole human race.” The feminists had pledged there would be no confrontations between the two groups over the weekend, and none were reported. Wherever the beauty queens went, however, they were guarded by a squad of security police, who turned away anybody who was not wearing an official pageant badge. Perhaps the closest thing to a confrontation occurred today when five young femin ists made their way to the guarded doors of the Chalfonte‐Haddon Hall meeting room where the Miss America contestants were having their farewell brunch. The feminists were trying to decide if they wanted a glimpse of “Them,” as they called the beauty queens. “You know, I would like to try to rap with them,” said Sue Weinstein, of Springfield;’ N.

Health Insurance Plan Asks 11.1% Rise in Premiums,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/10/archives/health-insurance-plan-asks-11-1-rise-in-premiums.html,"Citing inflation in the cost of delivering medical services, the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York asked yesterday for an average 11.1 per cent premium increase in the next 12 months. The new rates—whili would increase annual premiums by $10.07 for individual members belonging as part of a group and to $37.14 for families of three subscribing directly would affect 760,000 people in the city and in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Of those, 417,000 are employes of the city and their dependents. The increase asked for yesterday would come in two stages — 10 per cent from the first of this month to next Feb. 28, and an additional 2 per cent from March 1 to Aug. 31, the end of the contract year. The State Insurance Department disclosed last Aug. 19‐that it had received the request for a premium increase and that the two‐stage proposal had been made to meet the city's budgetary needs. At a day‐long hearing called by the State's Insurance Department, a statement by Allan Kornfeld, president of the plan, said the organization's largest customer, the city, had agreed to the proposed increase, which will cost it an additional $3‐million a year. The first speaker at the hearing, at the New York County Lawyers Association, 14 Vesey Street, was Leo Gruskin, director of the city's Bureau of Health Insurance. Speaking for Alphonse E. D'Ambrose, Acting City personnel Director, Mr. Gruskin said the city supported the request for the premium increase. According to Mr. D'Ambrose, the figure had been reached “after long and hard analysis and difficult negotiations.” He called it “reasonable and justifiable in view of these inflationary times.” Unlike last year, when the plan received an 18 per cent premium increase on the ground that it needed the money to begin programs to provide better service, the medical prepayment plan said it planned no innovations in the coming contract year. Some of the improvements contained in last year's contract were the establishment of the office of ombudsman to handle consumer complaints and peer review to improve services. When Jack Bigel, a union consultant, was named ombudsman last year, there were charges of a conflict of interest, because Mr. Bigel also served as consultant to the Medical Groups in the plan. John G. Day, deputy superintendent of insurance, who was serving as hearing examer, said yesterday that he would take up this matter when he issued the department's findings in the application for the premium increase, in about two weeks. Mr. Day added that he would also consider at that time charge that the plan had been guilty of a contract violation in making payments to Queens center for abortions. One of the few speakers to oppose the application for the increase yesterday was Donald Rubin, chairman of the Consumer Council of the plan's Yorkville Medical Group. Emphasizing that he was not opposed to a premium increase, Mr. Rubin said he did oppose a flat across‐the‐board increase that would apply to every one of the 28 Medical Groups in the plan. “Some of the centers are violating their contracts and are not giving all the services they should,” he declared, “and so they shouldn't get the same amount of money the good centers get.” The Health Insurance Plan is a prepaid‐practice medical system whose members receive diagnostic, curative, surgical and preventive medical care. An annual premium is the only charge. The plan does not cover, hospital costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milton J. Shapp's veto of the measure. The Senate overrode the veto yesterday. The state law, which takes effect in 30 days, follows the Supreme Court decision last year to permit abortions throughout the nine months of pregnancy if a licensed physician believes that the mother's life or healthis endangered.

Reform Democrat to Face Sargent in Massachusetts,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/11/archives/reform-democrat-to-face-sargent-in-massachusetts-insurgent-ahead.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 10—Michael Dukakis, a Democrat represcenting the “new politics,” won the right tonight to challenge incumbent Republican Francis W. Sargent for the governorship. Mr. Dukakis's grass‐roots organziation easily outdistanced the candidate of the Democratic regulars, Attorney General Robcrt H. Quinn. Despite a lastminute distribution of literature With an emotional appeal, Mr. Quinn ran poorly in the Boston ards where he had hoped to find his greatest strength. Mr. Sargent easily outdistanced his rival, former State Commerce Commissioner Carroll Sheehan, the candidate of disgruntled conservatives and party regulars resentful of the Governor's liberal policies and apixiintments of Democrats to key posts. Insurgent Ahead ??? a race of particular interest to independents and liberals here, the Democratic contest for the Secretary of State nomination, State Representative Paul H. Guzzi, a youthful insurgent and one‐time Harvard football player, was running far ahead of the incumbent, John F. X. Davoren, an entrenched regular who was accused of being a party hack. Thomas P. O'Neill 30, the son of the House Democratic whip, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., won the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor. The relatively quiet race for nomination was enlivened in the final days of the campaign the Democratic gubernatorial Then Mr. Quinn began a series of emotional appeals in Boston's ethnic neighborhoods. The appeals entangled the race in the issue of school busing here, where white resentment is running high over a rurt‐ordered integration plan hat is to take effect when schools open Thursday. Mr. Quinn's campaigner distributed leaflets in the neighborhoods affected, contending “there is a difference” and saying that their candidate had always been against “forced busing.” Mr. Quinn also took out neighborhood newspaper advertisements contending that Mr. Dukakis favored abortion. Also, leaflets were placed in the windshields of cars parked before church beano games (a local variant of bingo) contending that Mr. Dukakis had voted against legalization of the game. Previously, the two Democratic aspirants had concentrated their attacks op Governor Sargent contending that his policies had led to a poor business climate in the state, causing the closing of factories and rising unemployment. Mr. Dukakis, a former suburban liberal state representative who was given much credit for passage of no‐fault auto insurance in Massachusetts, based his campaign on local appearances and a personal organization of activists that he had worked to establish across the state. Mr. Quinn, who put much of his resources into television advertising, relied on an effort to pull out traditionally Democratic voters in carefully targeted urban areas. Governor Sargent, in his campaign, virtually turned his back on the state's relatively small Republican party organization. He sponsored full‐page newspaper ads in an attempt to appeal to the crucial bloc of more than one‐million independent voters. In challenging the Governor, Mr. Sheehan based his campaign on the prospect that there would bn a very light turnout, particularly among independents, that favor, the Republican regulars opposed to the Governor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well‐Schooled Winner,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/12/archives/wellschooled-winner-mary-anne-krupsak-a-political-heritage-law.html,"State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak learned her politics from a succession of mentors. There was, for example, Prof. Richard Wade, who taught her political science at the University of Rochester, where she was majoring in voice. Professor Wade later led and managed the Presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern here. Woman in the News There was Gov. W. Averell Harriman in whose administration Miss Krupsak served as an interne and counselor, sharing an office with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now the Ambassador to India, who was then an interne. She learned, too, from Representative Samuel Stratton, whose Washington office she headed. Having learned, she also taught, spending some years as executive assistant to Howard J. Samuels when he was president of Mobil Chemical. Miss Krupsak's job included tutoring her boss in the intricacies of state politics and introducing him to movers and shakers of various magnitudes. A Political Heritage But the lessons that Miss Krupsak, who is 42 years old, considers most important were learned very early from her father, Ambrose Krupczak, a pharmacist who has been a county legislator and County Supervisor in Montgomery County, and particularly from her maternal grandfather, Michael Wytrwal, who until he died three years ago was known as the unofficial Mayor of the upstate city of Amsterdam. “He was a marvelous man who would help people with immigration problems, with health matters and business problems,” she recalled yesterday, reveling in what she said was “a glorious high” stemminng from her victory on Tuesday in her primary race for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor. Her grandfather came to this country from Poland and worked in the‐mines of Pennsylvania and in the textile mills of the Mohawk Valley. “He believed education was king and he knew everyone and helped everyone, she said. Miss Krupsak and her brother, now a psychiatrist attended Roman Catholic parochial schools in Amsterdam. She was born on March 26, 1932, and lived in a largely Polish community. She understands and reads Polish, but does not speak it. And her parents Anglicized the names of their children when they began school. Senator Krupsak's mother, also a pharmacist, wanted her to become a singer and she trained as a coloratura at Rochester University's Eastman School of Music. “I still ‘Sing, and music is very important to me. It's interesting how nothing is ever lost and I've told my mother how my musical training has helped in projection and public speaking,” she said, In 1953 she received her master's degree in public communications ftom Boston University and got a Civil Service job as a public information officer with the New York State Department of Commerce in Albany. At that time she also became ac tive in the Harriman campaign. ‘ Laisr Career Chosen In 159, she went to the University of Chicago Law School, having determined “that the only women who were taken seriously in government were lawyers.” She made her first run for elective office in 1968, seeking an Assembly seat in a district that includes a slice of Schenectady and Montgomery County and had been regarded as a Republican stronghold for 20 years. She won a narrow victory. Two years later she won re‐election and in 1972 ran and won a race for the Senate. Her most serious challenge in public life, she said, revolved around the abortioti issue. She supported the abortion law on legal principles, though; she said, yesterday, “That does not mean I am pro‐abortion.” That is sue has been used against her in her heavily Catholic district. Miss Krupsak, a practicing Catholic in 1969 was married to Edwin Margolies, a lawyer, who is Jewish. He teaches at Hunter College. They live in Canajohade and also have an apartment in Manhattan. “We both have respect for each other's traditions,” Miss Krupsak said. “When we got married we decided that rather than have a large lava ish wedding we would take both our parents and be married in Jerusalem, the birth: place of all religions.” Miss Krupsak, who has both championed and been championed by feminists, said she believed that the conduct in office of women like herself and Ella T. Grasso, Connecticut's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, would do more for the cause of sexual equality “than all the rallying on the street.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rockefeller to Disclose His Net Worth,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/12/archives/rockefeller-to-disclose-his-net-worth-midoctober-target.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 —The Senate Rules Committee voted today to ask Nelson A. Rockefeller to make a full public disclosure of his net worth before the committee opens hearings on his nomination as Vice President. The panel also decided today to start the hearings on Sept. 23. Mr. Rockefeller said that it would be “no problem as far as I'm concerned” to comply with the committee's request. The panel did not ask that any other financial material that he has supplied to it, including tax returns for the last seven years, be made public. Mid‐October Target Mr. Rockefeller commented during a visit here today in which he met with Secretary of State Kissinger at the State Departffient, paid a courtesy call on Ambassador Itzahk Rabin of Israel at Blair House and atttended a dinner at the Israeli Embassy in honor of Mr. Rabin. The decisions of the Rules Committee were announced by its chairman, Senator Howard W. Cannon, Democrat of Nevada, after a closed meeting. He also said that he hoped to have the hearings completed before Congress goes into recess in mid‐October, The hearings, to be held in the Senate caucus room, will be televised. They will run four or five days the first week, and most likely four days a week after that. Mr. Rockefeller will be the first witness, Mr. Cannon said. The public disclosure of Mr, Rockefeller's assets, liabilities and net worth, which is only a part of the financial material that he has given to the committee, would be in lieu of any requirement that he divest himself of holdings or place some of them in a blind trust, Senator Cannon said. The disclosure, Mr. Cannon added, would allow the public and the press to act as a “watchdog against conflict of interest.” Senator Cannon also said that “if you require a man of great wealth to divest, it could have an adverse effect on the stock market.” He added that “you couldn't completely devoid him of knowledge of his own holdings” through a blind trust. After having read a Federal Bureau of Investigation report on Mr. Rockefeller, Senator Cannon said, “I do not personally see anything that's going to create a difficult problem in terms of confirmation.” Areas of questioning that he mentioned as likely were Mr. Rockefeller's liberal stand on abortion, his handling of the 1971 uprising at Attica prison, his Stern drug‐abuse views and his own campaign financing. Mr. Rockefeller, asked outside the State Department Building whether he saw any areas in which his financial holdings might involve a conflict of interest, said, “No. sir, or I wouldn't have accepted the designation.” Mr. Kissinger, who came out to greet Mr. Rockefeller, said, “We're old friends,” when he was asked what he and the Vice President designate planned to discuss. It was understood that Mr. Rockefeller was given a briefing on the Middle East situation in preparation for his call on Ambassador Rabin and the Israeli Embassy dinner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Nation/ Continued,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/for-women-in-politics-stamp-lickin-the-nation.html,"WASHINGTON—“We're the credible sex,” Liz Carpenter, a former White House, press aide now active in the women's political movement, commented after last Tuesday's primary elections in 13 states. “The cynics say that it's because we've been without power, but the fact remains that there were no women in policy‐making positions involved in Watergate.” After Tuesday's elections, in which scores of women triumphed in a show of strength that took many old pols (mostly males) by surprise, women began to look like the incredible sex. For the women, it was a breakthrough election that capped a trend begun last spring. The smokefilled rooms may never be the same. “Ever since Abigail Adams helped her husband write the Declaration of Independence, women have been active in politics,” said Barbara Mikulski, the Baltimore City Councilwoman who won the Democratic nomination for United States Senator in Maryland. “This is the year women decided not be ghost writers anymore. We're taking our own backgrounds, talents and expertise, and working for ourselves.” When the votes were counted, women had won United States Senate nominations in Maryland (Democrat), Oregon (Democrat), and South Carolina (Republican);; governor nominations in Connecticut (Democrat), Maryland (Republican) and Nevada (Republican); lieutenant governor nominations in New York (Democrat), Arkansas (Republican), Nebraska (Republican) and Rhode Island (Republican). Two years ago, no woman received a major party nomination for governor or lieutenant governor, and no woman has ever been elected governor without succeeding her husband. A total of 44 women have thus far won major‐party nominations for Congress this year, and the number could go as high as 49 after run‐offs and, two remaining primaries, This compares with 34 in 1972 and 26 In 1970. The women also showed strength In local races. A total of eleven women received major party nominations for the New York Legislature, and four women were nominated for the New York City Council. In Maryland, where ‘women's victories were especially noteworthy, a woman received the Democratic nomination for Montgomery County executive, ten women received major party nominations for the legislature from Montgomery Connty alone and women scored heavily in contests for the county councils. In Colorado a woman won the Republican primary for secretary of state, and in Dade County, Florida, women scored heavily in legislative contests. Why this surge of women in politics? Traditionally, “the women do the lickin’ and the stickin’ while the men plan the strategy,” in the words of Moon Landrieu, Mayor of New Orleans. “The parties will now have to start taking women seriously because the women Will be their biggest winners, and will pull them out of the Watergate doldrums,” said Jane McMichael, executive director of the National Women's Political Caucus. The McGovern Impetus Probably the greatest Impetus to women in politics, came from the McGovern Reform Commission, which brought great numbers of women delegates to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, and virtually forced the Republicans to follow suit. Many women returned from these conventions disillusioned with the male politicians for whom they had labored, and determined to seek office themselves. Then along came Watergate, and lack of political experience was no longer a detriment but an asset abetted by women's liberation, raised expectations, increased education and mounting frustrations. Taken together, they created a bond of sisterhood, stripped women of ‘their political inhibitions, supplied some early victories and created a can‐do spirit that became selffulfilling. Tactically, women created a political network that crossed party and state lines. Republicans helped Democrats (as in the Krupsak campaign) and vice versa. They were grassroots efforts, aided by the political caucus, centered on qualified women. Will women politicians make a difference? Certainly on so‐called women's issues such as sex discrimination, job discrimination, credit discrimination, affirmative action, abortion reform, the Equal Rights Amendment, day‐care centers and aid to education—although some of Tuesday's women voters oppose some if not all of these programs. Beyond that, past performance indicates that women in politics tend to be humanistic—antiwar—although here again there are notable exceptions. Forced to run outside the party, they take office unfettered by the ties that bind, and can therefore exercise an independence that is often a luxury for male legislators. Under no compulsion to bring home the bacon, they can spurn lobbyists and big contributors. Finally, they bring to politics a new dimension and a iew zeal and a determination that half the population cannot and should not be excluded from the councils OF government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MESKILL FACING MORE OPPOSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/meskill-facing-more-opposition-school-to-politics.html,"HARTFORD, Sept. 14—Gov. Thomas J. Meskill is expected to have rough sledding as the Senate begins hearings Tuesday on his appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Since last spring, when the Connecticut Governor's name was first put forward, the American Bar Association has been voicing its opposition to the appointment. The bar group's leaders have argued that Governor Meskill has too little courtroom experience. The nine‐judge appellate court, one step below the Supreme Court of the United States, hears appeals from Federal District Courts in Vermont, Connecticut and New York. On Thursday, 35 law professors in Connecticut, 21 of them from the University of Connecticut Law School and 14 from Yale Law School, published a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing the nomination on the ground that went a bit further than the A.B.A.'s. There are 30 on the Connecticut law faculty and 60 at Yale. School to Politics “Governor Meskill has little professional experience as a lawyer, and none as a judge,” the letter read. “It is clear from his record as Governor that he also lacks the judicial temperament which might have compensated for his want of experience.” Mr. Meskill went straight from the University of Connecticut Law School into politics. He was a state legislator, a Mayor of New Britain and a United States Representative. But apart from the two years he spent as Town Counsel in New Britain, he has not spent much time in court, “As Governor, he has repeatedly shown himself insensitive to the rights of the poor and the disadvantaged, and indifferent to civil and political liberties,” the law professors’ letter added. Howard R. Sacks, former dean of the University of Connecticut Law School, said it would be presented formally to the Senate committee in Washington when the hearings begin. On Friday, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York sent a telegram to the committee, asking that the hearings be delayed because of the New York organization's doubts about Governor Meskill. Some liberals opposing the appointment of the 46‐year‐old Governor, who is a conservative Renublican, resent Governor Meskill's role in getting the death penalty restored to Connecticut, his tight‐fisted approach to public spending and his long unsuccessful fight against legalizing abortion. Ford Support Given They were also discomfitted by the fact that the formal nomination of Governor Meskill was one of President Nixon's last official acts. It was made on Aug. 8, only nine hours before the President announced that he would resign the next day. President Ford has since reviewed all his predecessor's unconfirmed nominations and accepted them. Governor Meskill said in Washington earlier this month that the President had informed him that he would support the nomination. United States Representative Robert N. Giaimo of North Haven, a Democrat, offered Governor Meskill his support yesterday, holding that the Governor was a qualified and self‐made man. “He knows and understands the problems and aspirations of the poor and the low‐ and moderate‐income people,” Representative Giaimo The Governor got an indirect endorsement last spring from Judge William H. Timbers of Darien, one of the eight active judges on the court for which Governor Meskill is being considered. “We do not have a single active judge with any significant prior experience in either the legislative or executive branches of the government,” the judge wrote to Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Republican who proposed the nomination to the President last March, after the Governor decided not to seek re‐election.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn Women's Health Co‐op Expanding to Other Areas,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/brooklyn-womens-health-coop-expanding-to-other-areas-reluctance-on.html,"When the Unimposing building at 999 Third Avenue in Brooklyn's Bush Terminal section opened its doors to the subscribers of a prototype prepaid health plan for women three months ago, it was the first step in a program to develop similar health cooperatives nationwide. The steady but slow growth of the Women'e Health Center has not quite met the expectations of its shelter organization, the National Women's Health Coa tion. But the plans to open five more facilities from Los Angeles to Chapel Hill, N.C., are being completed in the hope that they “will share the good experience we've had with the Brooklyn facility,” said Merle S. Goldberg, executive director of the coalition. The cooperatives are designed to provide ambulatory gynecological care integrated with general health maintenance and nutrition education at minimal cost to consumers. When the centers are fully utilized by their communities, internists and other specialists will be added to the staff to provide total, health care for the subscribers, Mrs. Goldberg said. Good Deal Offered The Brooklyn facility is actually a half‐million‐dollar clinic, operated by OBGYN Associates, which contracted with the coalition to provide a participatory, consumeroriented plan to coalition members for $90 a year. “We decided to start the program here because we walked into a sweetheart of a deal,” Mrs. Goldberg said. “The director of OBGYN was willing to provide the services we wanted in the atmosphere we needed and we saved a huge capital investment for a clinic and the $20,000 in legal and licensing fees it would have cost us to have started our own:” More than 700 womerthave Joined the coalition (membership is $1 a year) since April in order 10 enroll at the center. Ten to,25 patients are seen daily, at the, 16‐room nonprofit clinic, which is equipped to handle 4,000 subscribers. Reluctance on Boaids “We don't advertise,” Mrs. Goldberg said. “Mast women find outabout us by word of mouth so we think we've had a success of sorts. It's a happy rate of growth. The staff can absorb the three to five new people who join every day and W can add staff when we see we'll need them.” Three physicians, five nurses and paraprofessionals, three patient advocates, three counselors and a laboratory technician constitute the joint staff of OBGYN and the coalition. “We provide the medical care and the office and meeting room space for the coalition, so they can do the counseling and hold classes and that sort of thing,” said one of the clinic's physicians, who did not want to be identified. “It's been working out very well.” An unresolved problem at the Brooklyn clinic, Mrs. Goldberg said, is overcoming the reluctance of the subscribers to join the consumer boards, which are to monitor the operation, suggest changes and channel complaints to the staff. “They tell us they're happy with the services and don't want to monitor,” the executive director said. “But we volunteered a couple of them so we'd get feedback.” Clinic staff members said the subscribers are now overwhelmingly Brooklyn residents of all ages, races and creeds. “At first we had women coming from the Bronx, and a lot from Manhattan,” one counselor said. “'$ut now they're from the community.” The coalition was organized in 1969 by a group of women from 250 groups interested. in health who met, at a National Organization for Women, convention. It established the first statelicensed abortion clinic in the country on July 1, 1970, with the opening of the Women's Medical Center, 80 Irving Place, Manhattan, “A single procedure [abortion] clinic is an anachronism after the 1973 Supreme Court decision [which removed obstacles to abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy],” Mrs. Goldberg said, “There was no clinic for the woman with a fibroid tumor or those who needed extensive follow‐ups. The cooperatives are designed to provide these services.” The facilities will continue to provide low‐cost, confidential abortions, however. “I'm all for protecting the patients,” said Lola Langley, the outgoing administrator of the counseling division and chairman of the East Harlem Health Council. “They still come here and don't give us their correct name and address because they don't want any materials sent to them so somebody could guess they had abortions.” On Aug. 4, a storefront on the Lower East Side that is being renovated into a bright and gleaming clinic will be the second cooperative. Soon after, a facility staffed as a training center by physicians, internes and residents from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine will be opened. In mid‐October a clinic affiliated with the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School will begin accepting patients. Negotiations are under way for facilities in Chapel Hill, N. C., and rural Mississippi. “We do not want to be in the clinic business,” Mrs. Goldberg said, “but we're trying to establish cooperative prototypes, write a manual on how to set them up and operate them and let individual feminist organizations around the world design and run their own.” She stressed that none of the facilities are “owned” by the coalition, but are autonomous facilities operated by advisory boards with subscribers and community residents as voting members. “We'll help them with educational materials and our experiences,” she said; “but we're out to disperse power, not create it for ourselves.” The impressive list of clinicians and medical professors on the coalition's medical advisory board is not windowdressing, she said, adding:, “A great portion of our work is educational. We've written and distributed clinical pamphlets for doctors and paraprofessionals on modern abortion techniques and family planning.” The medical advisers participate in the writing and rewriting of each leaflet and manual to prevent errors in the highly technical descriptions. An educational kit exhibited by the coalition at international health conferences has drawn requests for copies from the governments of South American, Asian and Western European nations and doctors working in Bangladesh, Honduras and Kenya, The health cooperatives are still considered a major coup by the coalition, however. “It was six years in the dreaming, two years in the planrling and six months in the making happen,” said Mrs. Goldberg. “And we're absolutely delighted.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The winner will be a brave new baby conceived in a test‐tube and then planted in a womb.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/the-embryo-sweepstakes-the-winner-will-be-a-brave-new-baby.html,"Gaunt‐looking and unassuming in manner, Dr. Douglas Bevis from Leeds University, in England hardly seemed a man who would first surprise and titillate, then outrage medical researchers on both sides of the Atlantic. The 55‐year‐old gynecologist was about to deliver a paper in July at a British Medical Association conference on embryo research. But first he handed out a press release with some quietly astonishing news: Human embryos conceived in test tubes had been successfully “implanted” the wombs of three women, and the women had given birth to normal babies. The three women had all been infertile due to diseased, blocked or missing Fallopian tubes, Dr. Bevis's press release reported. The researchers had surgically removed eggs from them, fertilized the eggs in test tubes with the sperm of their husbands and then reimplanted them in the women's wombs. Out of 30 such attempts, Dr. Bevis said, three had been “crowned with success.” The babies were said to range in age from 12 to 18 months. All were developing normally, he claimed. One could not help recalling Aldous Huxley's immensely popular “Brave New World” (1932), in which a scientific elite of totalitarian “predestinators” created test‐tube babies on an assembly line, determining in the process their every mental and physical characteristic. Huxley had placed his “biological revolution” 500 years in the future. Suddenit, headlines in the daily papers were reading like passages from the book. But while much of the press at first accepted Dr. Bevis's claims at face value, skepticism soon set in. Dr. Bevis had made no further mention of the three babies during the presentation of his conference paper, which was on more general aspects of embryo research. Afterward, when questioned, he had not been much more illuminating. He would not reveal the identities or whereabouts of the infants or their parents. Nor would be say where and by whom the historic procedure had been carried out. At first he even denied having participated in it himself, then admitted he had. He also left the impression that others had worked with him. A number of other researchers saw his offhand announcement as business‐as‐usual in what one doctor calls irreverently the “embryo sweepstakes,” adding, “Sortie will do anything to be first.” In the past few years, energetic efforts to achieve the first successful human‐embryo implant (in which a a woman's own egg is removed, fertilized in a testtube and then inserted in her womb), or the even more dramatic transplant (in which one woman's fertilized egg is transferred to the womb of another woman), have been in progress on at least three continents. Dr. Bevis, though a respected researcher, had not been considered in the running. Most experimenters had forgotten, or never heard, that he had announced his intention to attempt an implant as early as 1972, primarily because he had never published results of any such efforts—as would ordinarily be expected of anyone doing such important and controversial research. Two British scientists who have published extensively and were widely considered to be leading the field promptly announced that they were not the doctors who had performed the implants. One of them, Dr. Patrick Steptoe of Oldham General Hospital, condemned Dr. Bevis for making claims unsupported by scientific evidence, implying that the Leeds investigator was thus discrediting the whole field of research. “I am astounded that Professor Bevis would have made this statement,” he declared. “As far as I know, no one in this country or anywhere else has yet succeeded in this technique.” Some others were Willing to accept the claims, but castigated Bevis for proceeding in secrecy, concluding that if his results had been less favorable, if any of the babies had emerged deformed or retarded, he would not have announced them at all, in defiance of the scientific and ethical “rules of the game.” Still others overlooked the issue of credibility and, instead, shuddered at the implications of the claims. Not long ago, Dr. James Watson, the Nobel biologist, told a Congressional subcommittee that a successful embryo transplant would soon occur. Watson foresaw “all sorts of bad scenarios” from the achievement. “All hell will break loose, politically and morally, all over the world,” he concluded, a hit rashly, some felt.  The foundation for “genetic engineering” has already been laid. The primary substance of heredity, DNA, has been identified; the “genetic code” has been cracked, thanks to Dr. Watson and others, and some of the basic building blocks of life have been synthesized in the laboratory. In other experimentation, surgical transplants of ovaries have been attempted in humans; artificial wombs have been under developnient for years, and thousands women have been artificially inseminated with sperm frozen for long periods of time. Now scientists are poised to perform a medical procedure at least as dramatic as, and certainly more far‐reaching in its implications than, the heart transplants of the nineteen‐sixties. No one doubts that well‐documented embryo implants and transplants will occur, probably within a year or two. Indeed, test‐tube reproduction is advancing at such a pace that Dr. Bentley Glass, former president the American Association of Advancement of Science, has predicted that by the end of this century a fully formed baby could be “decanted” from an artificial womb. But whether such procedures should be performed at all, and under what circumstances, is currently the subject of an unusually wide ranging and sometimes bitter debate. It is a debate that rages in the background as the potential “predestinators”—the researchers themselves—go forward, proceeding “Russianlike” in their operating theaters, their critics say, oblivious to the hue and cry rising behind them. But those who would implant or transplant an embryo claim that what they are doing will not only overcome hitherto insurmountable obstacles to pregnancy but will also open the way to tteating genetic disorders at the very earliest stage of development, while providing new knowledge about human reproduction, cell development and specialization into different tissues and organs; that knowledge could, in turn, bring practical results, for example, better forms of contraception and cancer treatment. Given these possible benefits, some angrily question why these procedures should be subject to criticism or evoke controversy at all. At the other extreme, some voice fears that the procedures, once perfected, will, almost inevitably, give rise to undesirable and ever‐escalating expectations and opportunities that parents and governments, respectively, might find irresistible. Many recoil at the thought of an embryo “prefabricated” to exhibit at birth a set number of physical and mental characteristics, whether ordered by the parents or some other, possibly less benign, “authority.” If there to be a progression or “escalation” of the uses to which the technologies involved will be applied, and many believe there need not be, it would probably develop in this order: ■ First, a woman who is infertile by virtue of blocked or missing Fallopian tubes will be able to achieve pregnancy by having an egg surgically removed from one of her ovaries, incubated vitro (literally “in glass,” meaning in a test tube or other laboratory container), fertilized there by her husband's sperm, and then, at the appropriate mcment in her reproductive cycle, implanted into her uterus where, with adequate hormonal priming, it will attach itself to the life‐giving endometrial lirtng and develop through the normal nine‐month process of gestation. ■ Second, a woman capable of carrying a baby to term but unable to produce normal egg cells, will have the fertilized egg of another woman implanted into her uterus. The options here invite more controversy. In one variation of this theme, the egg is fertilized in vivo (in the uterus of the donor) via artificial insemination with the sperm of the recipient's husband, surgically removed from the donor's Fallopian tube at the appropriate moment and then immediately implanted into the recipient's uterus. Some researchers favor this plan as the initial step because it circumvents the technical uncertainties and possible dangers of invitro fertilization, even though it is “sociologically” more perilous because of possible conflicts between egg‐cell donor and recipient. ■ Third, a woman with healthy tubes and ovaries but with a condition that might be dangerously or even fatally aggravated by the rigors of pregnancy has her egg, whether fertilized in vitro or in vivo, implanted into a second woman, who carries the baby to term as a considerable favor or for a considerable fee, after which she gives the baby back to its genetic mother. This plunges us headlong into the controversial realm of “mother surrogates” and raises legal questions about what happens if the surrogate decides she wants to keep the baby. ■ Fourth, a career woman who wants children, but doesn't want to tie herself down or blow herself up with a pregnancy, similarly hires a mother surrogate to do the job for her. At this prospect, even those who usually wax irreverent about the institution of Motherhood show signs of becoming indignant. ■ Fifth, women of all descriptions are free select (or, in an alternate scenario, are obligated to accept) prepackaged embryos with clearly specified characteristics for implantation. Though this may sound like the stuff of science fiction, the late Dr. H. J. Muller, Nobel Prize winner in physiology and medicine, seriously called upon prospective parents to forgo “egotistical” desires to reproduce their own genetic characteristics and, instead, to help improve the human race by constructing their children from the “best” available egg and sperm cells. In sharp contrast to current policies of strict donor anonymity in artificial insemination, he advocated detailed dossiers on all egg and sperm donors, and envisioned catalogues that could be perused in search of the ideal germ cells. Dr. E. S. E. Hafez, an experimental biologist who has done pioneering animal research on embryo freezing, believes the day will come when parents will be able to select from one‐dayold frozen embryos, guaranteed free of all genetic defects, with sex, eye‐color, probable I.Q. and other traits described in detail on the label. Just thaw and implant. In a succession of dazzling animal experiments over the past three decades, scientists have dramatized the possibilities of current biological technologies. With appropriate hormone stimulation, prize cows can now be made to “superovulate,” releasing up to 30 mature eggs at a time, after which they are artificially inseminated with the sperm of prize bulls. The resulting “superembryos” are flushed from the uterus and implanted in other healthy but less exalted cows to be carried to term. According to one report, an entire “herd” of cattle embryos was transported across the Atlantic, incubating in the uterus of a live rabbit (which, experimentation shows, serves as an ideal temporary host) before being extracted and successfully implanted in foster mothers, who gave birth to normal calves. More recently, mouse embryos have been frozen, some at temperatures as low as 452 degrees below zero, thawed, implanted and brought successfully to term in surrogate mothers. Last year, two bull calves were produced in the same fashion. From all indications, the offspring in these animal experiment grew normally. As a result of such research, disease‐free herds of frozen animals may soon be shipped economically from continent to continent in small packages. Rare strains and important mutations of animals used in laboratory studies may soon be stored in the deep freeze when not in use, obviating the need to maintain large and costly breeding colonies. Endangered species may similarly be preserved for future study and proliferation, with the embryos carried to birth in artificial wombs after they are thawed out if no mother surrogates are available. Although laboratory efforts to fertilize egg cells, including those of humans, date back a century or more, progress has been impeded by a number of technical problems, principally those relates to ovum recovery and sperm “capacitation,” a still dimly illuminated process through which the sperm cells must pass before they are capable of penetrating the egg. The need for capacitation was specifically recognized in the nineteen‐fifties. Dr. M. C. Chang, pioneering fertility researcher associated with the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology at Shrewsbury, Mass., was one of the first to demonstrate its role. Dr. Chang achieved in vitro fertilizations of rabbit ova, followed by equally successful embryo transplants. after exposing the sperm to fluids from the female rabbit's reproductive tract for a period of time. Capacitation is now being studied with a variety of sophisticated techniques including one that “tags” components on the surface of the sperm head with radioactive material, the removal of which in various test media can then be quantitatively analyzed with special insru ments. From such studies it is becoming apparent that the sperm of different species require different intervals of exposure, to different chemical components, before their surface components are altered or stripped away, thus “unsheathing” them and enabling them to penetrate the egg, perhaps by dissolving its outer membrane. It is possible, of course, to achieve in‐vitro fertilization without any specific understanding of the capacitation process. Dr. John Rock, the eminent reproductive researcher, says that he and his colleagues at Harvard used common sense to achieve it in 1944. They took care to “mimic nature” by exposing the human sperm to fluids taken from the female reproductive tract. Though some researchers have cast doubts on Dr. Rock's results, attributing them to “parthenogenic” cleavage (in which chance stimulation of the egg induces short‐lived cell division without actual fertilization), he remains convinced that true fertilization was achieved. Dr. Rock was aware of the far‐reaching implications of in‐vitro fertilization, but for the man who would become one of the principal developers of the birth‐control pill, it was just another “interesting experiment.” In the decades that followed, virtually the only researcher working on invitro fertilization of human eggs was Dr. Landrum B. Shettles, until recently of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In the nineteen‐fifties, Shettles was credited by many with being the first to demonstrate clearly test‐tube fertilization of human eggs. His microphotographs of life's beginnings were included in dozens of medical textbooks and displayed in enlarged form at the American Muse. urn of Natural History. Some researchers have questioned the validity of the photographs, again implying that the cell division evident might have been due to chance stimulation. But Dr. Shettles insists they clearly show that he fulfilled all of the criteria which some now consider standard for successful in‐vitro fertilization: observation of both sperm head and tail within the egg proper; the pairing of male and female nuclei; the elimination of excess female chromosomes in the form of “polar bodies”; the actual division of the fertilized egg cell. In addition, Shettles claimed that most of his “bench embryos” were grown to the blastocyst stage (64 cells and up), at which point they normally implant themselves in the endometrial lining of the uterus after having made a leisurely five‐day trip down the Fallopian tube. Reports in 1969 of successful in‐vitro fertilization by Dr. Steptoe of Lancashire and Dr. R. G. Edwards, a physiologist at Cambridge University, were described by segments of the media as “firsts.” The two doctors studiously avoided any reference to the prior work of Drs. Shettles, Rock and others, and, in off‐thecuff comments, Dr. Edwards observed that the in‐vitro photos of an Italian researcher showed sperm “fertilizing an air bubble.” He also implied that the work of Drs. Shettles and Rock was unconvincing. The possibilities in those early “gee‐whiz” days only five years ago seemed limitless: Dr. Edwards, noting that microscopic studies of cells harmlessly removed from test‐tube embryos could determine their sex, said the technique might give parents a choice of having a boy or girl (implant the chosen one, throw the others away), that it could even be used to provide twins, if desired. That was before the “bioethicists” arrived to dash cold water on such talk. Everybody had by then heard of Christiaan Barnard, the South African heart surgeon who reaped overnight fame by becoming the first to transplant a heart successfully. But what might be in store for the first man to transplant an entire human life? Infamy perhaps, suggested some, if the child turned out to be deformed or retarded. With an increasing public expression of such fears, the researchers became more “Russianlike,” often refusing to be interviewed. But behind the scenes, the battle lines were quietly being drawn. The infighting was to become fierce. And one researcher, Dr. Martin Clyman of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, candidly summed it up in 1971: “Everyone is trying, and everybody is skeptical” of everyone else's work, and often of their own. Though no one has yet come up with undisputed evidence of success, much progress has been made in the direction of a reliable, reproducible technique. Today most researchers obtain their eggs with a pencil‐like viewing device called a laparscope, which is inserted into the woman's peritoneal cavity near or through the umbilicus (to minimize scarring) for direct observation of the ovaries. Once the scope is fixed on its target, a needlelike suction device is inserted into the lower abdomen and used to aspirate (pull) eggs from follicles on the ovarian surface. The procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and usually requires only one night in the hospital. To ensure that the egg is at’ the proper stage of maturation when exposed to sperm in the test tube, researchers administer hormones that regularize the menstrual cycle (making the time of ovulation predictable) and also induce the maturation of multiple follicles and ova—so that there will be more than one egg to work with. Injection of these hormones must be timed precisely. Once the eggs are obtained, they must be carefully maintained in a series of media that will encourage, in ‘turn, continued maturation, fertilization, cleavage to about the blastocyst stage and, finally, implantation and continued growth in vivo. Researchers have claimed success with different media, though all agree upon the need for maintaining the eggs and embryos in controlled environments with carefully monitored osmotic pressures, temperatures, pH (relative acidity and alkalinity), gas and ionic compositions. It is now recognized that the metabolic requirements of the eggs and embryos change as they develop; consequently, a great deal of experimentation with various energy sources, the substances that nourish the embryo, has been carried out, with steadily better results. The sperm, too, in some cases, are exposed to various media, or preincubated in the same media used for the eggs. They are capacitated and ready to penetrate the eggs within three or four hours after being exposed to them. Fertilization usually occurs within 12 hours, cleavage into two cells is normally evident within the first 38 hours, and eight‐celled embryos are often seen at the end of three days. Blastocysts form near the end of the fifth day in vitro. Extensive microscopic studies of these test‐tube blastocysts have revealed no genetic defects, so that some researchers have been sufficiently confident to proceed to the next step: implanta tion. Care must be taken at this point to ensure that the embryo and the uterus of the recipient ‘re in biochemical synchronization; otherwise the implant or transplant will not “take.” The recipient is usually given progestational hormones that “prime” the endometrial lining of the uterus so that it is in the “secretory” stage and capable of nourishing the blastocyst, which is equipped with hooklike protoplasmic extensions that dig into the lining and tap the mother's blood supply. (The “invasive” character of embryonic cells bears some resemblance to malignant mechanisms, and it is possible that more studies of invitro blastocysts will shed valuable light on the growth of cancers.) The embryo may be introduced into the womb surgically, through the wall of the uterus, or nonsurgically, via a catheter passed through the vagina and cervical canal into the uppermost part of the uterus. Researchers disagree on which approach is more effective. The most extensively documented work to date, has, unquestionably, been that of Drs. Steptoe and Edwards, although there are those who doubt some of their photographic evidence, too. Steptoe and Edwards recently reported on 10 embryo implants. All ended in failure, though there were biochemical signs that some of the embryos survived in the uterus for several days. The last remaining obstacle to complete success may be in refining some of the culture media in ways that will give the embryos extra staying power once implanted; better nutrition in vitro may be the answer. (One reason some researchers accept the claims of Dr. Bevis is that he is an expert on the physiology and biochemistry of the uterus during the earliest, critical stages of pregnancy, and so may have overcome the postimplantation problem.) Also convincing to some are the reports of an Australian medical team, led by Drs. Carl Wood, John Leeton and D. de Kretzer. The Melbourne physicians recently claimed to have achieved a pregnancy in a 36‐year‐old woman, following in‐vitro fertilization and implantation of one of her eggs. Analysis of hormonal excretions in the urine, they reported, indicated pregnancy had occurred. A lower abdominal wound from a previous operation burst six days after the embryo transfer, however, and this, the three physicians believe, terminated the preg nancy. Again some researchers do not accept the data of the Melbourne team as convincing, among them Dr. Steptoe. Dr. Landrum Shettles claims to have achieved an embryo implant as far back as 1963, during his years at Columbia University; as described in journals by Shettles, the operation was lone on a woman scheduled for a hysterectomy, so that the embryo could be recovered and studied. Shetties tried again in 1973, but this time the project occasioned a bitter controversy, one that illustrates the profound ethical issues involved. He and Dr. William J. Sweeney, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell Medical School sought to overcome the infertility of a Florida woman, Doris Del Zio, whose tubes had been blocked and partially destroyed by disease. Eggs were obtained by Dr. Sweeney at New York Hospital, bathed in follicular fluid that contained bits of tubal mucosa and taken Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center by Mr. Del Zio. There, they were exposed to his sperm by Dr. Shettles. But before the egg could be implanted, Dr. Shettles claims, his superior at the hospital, Dr. Raymond Vande Wiele, “confiscated” the specimen, “broke the sterile conditions” and “terminated the procedure.” In the controversy that ensued, Dr. Shettles resigned under pressure, after 27 years on the Columbia staff. In an interview, Dr. Vande Wiele made a distinction between in‐vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. The latter is premature, he believes; more work must be done in lower primates “to establish whether the number of malformations is acceptable.” Additionally, he asks, “Who is going to get permission for the fetus? This is a very serious consideration.” As for the Del Zios, they have filed a $1.5‐million lawsuit against Dr. Vande Wiele in Federal Court, claiming that termination of the procedure without their consent denied them their last opportunity to have a child. With regard to the moral objections raised by Dr. Vande Wiele, Mrs. Del Zio says: “I can't see why some people believe a baby conceived in this fashion isn't as sacred as a baby conceived in the normal fashion. There's even more care, more desire, more intent involved here—because so much time. energy, skill and emotion had to be invested in its conception.” Dr. Shettles is now director of research at the nonprofit New York Fertility Research Foundation in Manhattan, which is concerned with contraception, sex selection, in fertility and other aspects of reproduction. Shettles, who has defended embryo implants by asking, “If the bridge is out, what's wrong with using a helicopter?,” is now prepared to make transplantation the first step — in an effort to circumvent certain ethical objections. “The idea,” he explains, “is to avoid what I consider to be the very small chance of anomalies developing in vitro and to, instead, remove an embryo from one waman and transplant it into another woman. This is technically far less complicated than the in‐vitro approach and success, achieving the initial goal of giving an otherwise infertile woman a baby, is much more likely. At the same time, of course, we should continue with the in‐vitro work, for the sake of basic research if nothing else.” What about the danger of the donor later trying to claim the baby? “I don't see any real problem,” says Dr. Wayne Decker, surgeon‐inchief at the New York Fertility Research Foundation. “This would have to be handled like artificial insemination. With donor and recipient anonymity. The two women wouldn't even see each other. A lot of things we wouldn't do a few years ago we no longer think twice about. For instance, I do 40 or 50 artificial inseminations a week, whereas a few years ago we would do 10 or 12 a year. The repellent connotations of artificial insemination are almost nonexistent now. Couples not only accept it but seem often to regard it as more ‘natural’ than adoption. I can assure you we will have no trouble finding embryo recipients.” Dr. Decker has prepared an embryo transplant “protocol,” which has been submitted to a major New York hospital. Transplant attempts could begin within a year. Is there any chance that the recipient's body will reject such a transplant? “We don't know, but it seems unlikely in light of the animal work, where there was no re jection,” Dr. Decker says. Dr. Shettles concurs: “Nature has apparently suspended the immunoprotective process here, in the interests of propagation. This is true even in normal conception, where the female body must tolerate the invasion of foreign matter in the form of sperm.” The birth process itself, he adds, might be considered a form of rejection, but if so, in this instance it is life‐giving instead of life‐threatening. There is at present no ban on in‐vitro fertilization and embryotransfer research in the United States, according to officials at the National Institutes of Health. The policy of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which sometimes regulates experimentation on humans, is described as in the formulation stage. But the Journal of the American Medical Association has called for a complete “moratorium on experiments that would attempt to implant an in‐vitro conceptus into a woman's womb,” and numerous organizations have sprung up to lobby Congress and in other ways to seek to block the research. The journal Hospital Practice has described the assault on fetal research in general as “a concerted one, well organized by the national antiabortion, or Right‐to‐Life,’ forces. These forces, frustrated by legislative and judicial actions stripping away the fabric of antiabortion laws, have apparently made a decision to mount an emotionarousing campaign depicting scientific researchers as fiends in lab coats deriving sadistic pleasure from experimenting on and torturing helpless ‘infants.’ “ This assault, the publication continues, “threat‐ ens some of the most promising investigative efforts in biomedicine today …. related to prenatal detection of disease, the development of genetic studies involving human embryonic tissue culture lines, the antenatal development of immunologic competence, etc.” Dr. Philip Sunshine, Stanford pediatrics professor, considers the treatment of infertility through embryo transfers an equally worthy investigative effort and asks by what logic the Right‐to‐Life forces would deny infertile women the right to have children of their own in this fashion. Many of the opponents echo the words of Pope Pius XII, who at the time of the International Fertility Conference in Italy in 1954 condemned those who “take the Lord's work into their own hands.” The argument, posited by Dr. Paul Ramsey, a Protestant theologian at Princeton University, is that reproduction is moral only within the confines of heterosexual, monogamous marriage, and that embryo transplants are therefore immoral. One who disputes that position is Dr. Joseph Fletcher of the University of Virginia School of Medicine's Department of Ethics, who says: “It seems to me that laboratory reproduction is radically human compared to conception by ordinary heterosexual intercourse. It is willed, chosen, purposed and controlled, and surely these are. among the traits that distinguished homo sapiens from others in the animal genus …. With our separation of baby‐making from love‐making, both become more human because they are matters of choice not chance. This is, of course, essentially the case for planned parenthood. I cannot see how either humanity or morality are served by genetic roulette.” Some bioethicists insist that more animal work should be done before embryo transfers are attempted in humans. Dr. Leon Kass, a molecular biologist at St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., calls for more primate experimentation. But Dr. Kass, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine, goes on to demonstrate that primate experiments “could neither rule out nor establish the risk of mental retardation for children resulting from experiments in humans. Unfortunately, as is often true, only humans can provide the test system for fully assessing the risks of using the procedure in hu mans.” Thus Dr. Kass would foreclose all further experimenta. tion. Dr. Sweeney of Comel Medical School calls his rea soning “unreasonable,” bu agrees that the human risks can only be demonstrated in humans. Dr. Fletcher says the cry for more animal experi mentation masks a “policy of benign neglect” on the part of those who are opposed to the clinical applications of embryo transfer. The fear of fetal anomalies, he believes, has been exaggerated. “Nature, not being as undiscriminatingly ‘pro‐life’ as some people are, takes care of most such aberrations by spontaneous abortion, at or about nidation [implanta. tion].” In cases where nature fails, however, he believes medical science should be prepared to step in, detect the aberration and induce the abortion. On the abortion issue, however, Dr. Kass believes that it may be more immoral to destroy a test‐tube embryo than one conceived ip normal fashion. A distinction that he makes involves the degree to which the embryo is “wanted.” Abortion to destroy an “accidental” and unwanted embryo is less reprehensible in his view than the destruction of a test‐tube embryo which is willfully created and perhaps studied before destruction. Dr. Andre Hellegers, director of the Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and Bioethics in Washington, D.C., similarly observes that one of the common justifications of abortion, embryonic threat to maternal health, cannot apply to in‐vitro embryos—or at least to those that are not implanted. But Dr. Mark Lappe of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences in Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N.Y., observes that at present researchers have no way of detecting all possible fetal anomalies and that more work must be done in this respect before such techniques can be ethically applied to humans. Unlike Drs. Kass and Ramsey, however, Dr. Lappe find",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 nothing inherently immoral in embryo transfers. “There is a deep and pervasive felt need for family lineage and continuity of generations common to all peoples,” he says. “I believe that human compassion dictates a response to individual couples who strongly sense that need. including the provision of invitro fertilization.” All, of the bioethicists agree upon one thing: Research in this field should be conducted in the open, for all to comment upon. Only in this way, they say, can the “bad scenarios” Dr. Watson and others predict, be avoided. “One can only hope,” Dr. Lappe wrote in 1972, “that the first baby fertilized in vitro would be produced as the endpoint of a collective and public effort of responsible scientists, and not as the premature experiment of a single physician or scientist.” Meantime, in Leeds, England, the man who has become a focal point for the current controversy, Dr. Bevis, has announced that he is abandoning his embryoimplant work altogether. Dr. Bevis, who was hospitalized in late August with an undisclosed illness, has said that he is disgusted with the wave of publicity over his claims and incensed by a newspaper's $72,000 offer for full disclosure of the facts. He added, however, that there is some chance he will eventually write a scientific paper on his work. The consensus is that he should have done so long ago, and that even if Dr. Bevis did not set out to intentionally discredit the field” (a possibility, according to some), he has nonetheless done so quite effectively. “This sort of secrecy,” Dr. Lappe observes, “creates an atmosphere that might encourage reversion to a grave‐robbing, fear mentality, one that could result in new prohibitions on the research.” The issues, he stresses, must be decided on their merits, not on the basis of irrational fears. We are at a pivotal point in our evolutionary development. For the first time, what we call “the facts of life” need no longer govern us. We possess the knowledge to alter those facts, and Dr. Fletcher of the University of Virginia is one who argues that we have an ethical mandate to do so. Dr. Fletcher says: “We cannot accept the ‘invisible hand’ of blind, natural chance or random nature in genetics, any more than we could old Professor Jevons'S theory of feast and tamine in 19th‐century, laissez‐faire economics, based on sun spots and tidal movements. To be men we must be in control. That is the first and last ethical word. For when there is no choice," there is no possibility of ethical action. Whatever we are compelled to do is amoral.” ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MESKILL FACING MORE OPPOSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/meskill-facing-more-opposition.html,"HARTFORD, Sept. 14—Gov. Thomas J. Meskill is expected to have rough sledding as the Senate begins hearings Tuesday on his appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Since last spring, when the Connecticut Governor's name was first put forward, the American Bar Association has been voicing its opposition to the appointment. The bar group's leaders have argued that Governor Meskill has too little courtroom experience. The nine‐judge appellate court, one step below the Supreme Court of the United States, hears appeals from Federal District Courts in Vermont, Connecticut and New York. On Thursday, 35 law professors in Connecticut, 21 of them from the University of Connecticut Law School and 14 from Yale Law School, published a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing the nomination on the ground that went a bit further than the A.B.A.'s. There are 30 on the Connecticut law faculty and 60 at Yale. “Governor Meskill has little professional experience as a lawyer, and none as a judge,” the letter read. “It is clear from his record as Governor that he also lacks the judicial temperament which might have compensated for his want of experience.” Mr. Meskill went straight from the University of Connecticut Law School into politics. He was a state legislator, a Mayor of New Britain and a United States Representative. But apart from the two years he spent as Town. Counsel in New Britain, he has not spent much time in court. “As Governor, he has repeatedly shown himself insensitive to the rights of the poor and the disadvantaged, and indifferent to civil and political liberties,” the law professors’ letter added. Howard R. Sacks, former dean of the University of Connecticut Law School, said it would be presented formally to the Senate committee in Washington when the hearings begin. On Friday, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York sent a telegram to the committee, asking that the hearings be delayed because of the New York organization's doubts about Governor Meskill. Some liberals opposing the appointment of the 46‐year‐old Governor, who is a conservative Renublican, resent Governor Meskill's role in getting the death penalty restored to Connecticut, his tight‐fisted approach to public spending and his long unsuccessful fight against legalizing abortion. They were also discomfitted by the fact that the formal nomination of Governor Meskill was one of President Nixon's last official acts. It was made on Aug. 8, only nine hours before the President announced that he would resign the next day. President Ford has since reviewed all his predecessor's unconfirmed nominations and accepted them. Governor Meskill said in Washington earlier this month that the President had informed him that he would support the nomination. United States Representative Robert N. Giaimo of North Haven, a Democrat, offered Governor Meskill his support yesterday, holding that the Governor was a qualified and self‐made man. “He knows and understands the problems and aspirations of the poor and the low‐ and moderate‐income people,” Representative Giaimo said. The Governor got an indirect endorsement last spring from Judge William H. Timbers of Darien, one of the eight active judges on the court for which Governor Meskill is being considered. “We do not have a single active judge with any significant prior experience in either the legislative or executive branches of the government,” the judge wrote to Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Republican who proposed the nomination to the President last March, after the Governor decided not to seek re‐election.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The greening of Fletcher Knebel,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/15/archives/the-greening-of-fletcher-knebel-while-i-never-had-a-love-affair.html,"Not long ago an image surfaced in my memory of a 6‐year‐old kid in Jackson Heights, N. Y., watching an old steam shovel gouge a pit for building foundations. 1 recall the boy's feeling fright and revulsion as the machine clawed at the weedy field where he played with other kids. In the child's eyes, an iron enemy assaulted his turf with evil intent. That image of myself and my reactions remained buried for more than half a century beneath civilization's topping of rationality, technology and unlimited production. It popped up as I considered the theme of this article: my attitudes have changed enormously in the 40 years since I, an urban, middle‐class young man, went forth from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, with the class of 34. I judge that little of the change can be attributed to the classic gulf between youth and age since many of my current views are shared by the young. The turbulent sixties, with their cries of revolution and their bitter indictment of the established order, made a profound impression on me. Much as I recoiled from the rhetoric and violence of the New Left, I was forced to re‐examine basic assumptions. Yet I failed to sense the extent of my attitude changes until, in these less strident days, I tried to codify hundreds of tumbling impressions and attitudes. Here's the result, subject, as befits our era, to change without notice. Back then, EXPANSION FOREVER! The America of the first half of my life was one of limitless horizons, soaring expectations, progress, production, prosperity, abundance, expanding forever and ever, amen. Despite its miseries, the Great Depression, which I weathered in college, was seen as but an embarrassing pause in a production miracle which would fetch each American family a spacious hcme, vacations abroad and two cars in every garage. If the slbthful poor of the rest of the world would but follow our example, mass production would surely yield at least a modest cottage with indoor plumbing to every family from the Yangtze to the Amazon. It was fashionable among young people with intellectual pretensions to scoff at those crafting this forthcoming cornucopia. I joined a handful of would‐be cynics in college who reveled in Sinclair Lewis's satire of “Babbitt” and H. L. Mencken's disdain for the “boobs” of the “Bible belt.” But I merely parroted. Deep down, I believed. The American Dream soothed all our slumbers. We had but to get on with the job. The JOB. Ah, there lay salvation and riches. World War II confirmed the magnificence American production. We literally smothered our enemies under an avalanche of arms, all swiftly fabricated, including the manufacture of more than 100,000 warplanes a year at the peak. I came home from the Azores and shed my naval uniform, convinced of American superiority in everything from guns to games. We almost always won the Olympics, didn't we? You better believe! But we AmeriCans regarded ourselves as more than assembly‐line geniuses and medalist athletes. We had built a spiritual haven, a land of justice for all, refuge for the world's oppressed masses. We saw ourselves as a compassionate people who would share our ideals and some of our bounty with less fortunate humans. As our missionaries once fanned out to bring the blessings of Yankee culture to the savages, so would our Government's foreign aid and our businessmen transform the world in our image. As the power with primary responsibility for mankind, vie would chart a course to universal peace, prosperity and social justice. While I chafed over the mouthings of our more chauvinistic propagandists, I bought the package. A society dominated by the doctrine of material expansion for all is as comforting as it is heady. If there are no limits save individual torpor, then any energetic citizen can attain the bliss of success. So I had a satisfying sense of the fitness and continuity of our way of life. I believed in the essential goodness of my country, authority, Western civilization, science, technology, American values and “the system.” We Americans had the answer. Now, CONTRACTION. Today I look at the same scene and fear that our vaunted technology and our good American “answer” have become blasphemies‐against ravaged nature. While medicine cuts the death rate, uncapping a population gush that adds several hundred thousand people a day to the earth's teeming total, the machine and the tarnished miracle of mass production poison the air, land and water. By‐products of our automated and swarming civilization read like the protocols of doomsday: cancer in trout, lethal oil spills, vanishing wetlands, whole mountains carved away for iron, copper and other metals devoured by our dishwashers, tractors and air‐conditioners, pastures and farmlands paved to superhighways, sludge from dumped refuse threatening to contaminate the shining beaches of Long Island, swiftly dwindling forests and wild life. But why go on? Litanies of ecological atrocities have become commonplace. My attitude on industrial expansion has changed 180 degrees. Now I believe that in our feverish preoccupation with consumer goods we are looting our only home, EARTH. Now “Small Is Beautiful,” to borrow the title of a brilliant book by E. F. Schumacher, a British economist who notes that “infinite growth in ‘a finite environment is an obvious impossibility.” Of course, but for five decades of my life, I thought and acted as though weren't. For years I ignored what my eyes, ears and nose told me on the screeching highways, beside the belching factories and along the fouled rivers and streams. I think I, along with so many others, came to awareness with publication of Rachel Carson's “Silent Spring” in 1962. While I'd been busy covering the politics of expansion in Washintgon as newspaperman, Rachel Carson occupied herself documenting the ruin of our natural homeland by that same brand of politics. Hundreds of warnings from scientists, naturalists and counterculture troops folloWed in “Silent Spring's” wake. I listened and I changed. If I had swung 179 degrees i.)y 1974, two events this summer completed the reversal. One came in the shape of a 19‐mile‐long traffic jam on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey that lasted six hours, snarling 75,000 cars. The other was a twopart New Yorker article by Noel Mostert who wrote of ocean waters south of the Cape of Good Hcpe fouled by oil spills from supertankers carrying Arab petroleum to the world's refineries. Monster tankers, ranging from 200,000 to almost 500,000 tons, crack open in wild southern seas, imperiling not only their own crews, but seabirds, fish and other aquatic life in one of the last virgin oceans, breeding place for many species. Even phytoplankton, tiny marine plants that supply much of the world's oxygen, are endangered by the spreading petroleum taint. One broken tanker created a coasting oil slick 60 miles long and 60 miles wide. I'm indebted to the Whole Earth Catalog for the estimate that 25 tons of irreplaceable ores must be extracted from the ground each year to keep each American going in the (Continued on Page 40) style to which he's accustomed. I'm indebted to my own eyes on a recent trip for the estimate that 25 tons is about 200 times what it takes to keep a Cakchikel Indian going for a year in the Guatemalan highlands. If the rest of the world lived as we Americans do, the earth's limited supply of ores would be reduced by more than 100 billion tons annually. Piled ton upon ton, the metallic tower would reach from Pittsburgh to absurdity. Occasionally now, I have twinges of panic. My once comfortable civilization seems out of control and headed for catastrophe. And I'm forced to make the link between the oceans’ imperiled phytoplankton, conveying oxygen we all breathe, and my own lifestyle which depends so heavily on oil. Our Mustang, house furnace and swimming‐pool heater feed on it. Various exhaustible fuels and metals propel my travels and sustain my American consumption habits in a thousand ways. realize I argue from a privileged position. Money from number of successful novels prOvides me a haven from which to decry aspects of a system which made the leisure and rewards possible in the first place. Most workers, depending on weekly pay checks, have no such haven. While a substantial cut in production might trim my income in a few years, it would mean quick loss of jobs for millions. What I yearn for, and what no national political leader dares advocate, is public policy‐ that charts a slow, equitable transition from unlimited production and consumption to a society of curtailed mass production, high craftsmanship and greatly expanded human service. In the meantime, I face a moral question: Is it right to partake of this manic consumption which surely must deplete the planet some day? I think not, but I continue to live a style that belies my conviction. I frankly lack the initiative and courage to follow the example of those who live close to the soil, in rhythm with nature and with a minimum of machines and gadgets. Yet my new attitude per sists, nagging me for commitment, and from this basic shift devolves a whole set of auxiliary attitudes. They include: The Automobile. While never had the love affair with my car ascribed to so many Americans, I regarded it as a handy convenience for going places with a maximum of ease and freedom. I now view its unrestricted use and multiplication as a national disaster. It kills about 55,000 people annually, injures more than two million people a year, converts hundreds of square miles from green acres to sterile pavement, befouls the atmosphere, changes beauty to schlock, drains the cities and makes millions of scattered American households fortresses of isolation. Yet the car has become such a crucial factor in the economy that any proposed shift to mass transport embattles a maze of car‐linked lobbies and raises the specter of depression. Work. For many years I worked compulsively. I felt virtuous about it, for my society had enshrined work and its purifying benefits since Puritan days. Leisure, play or silent contemplation were suspect. I felt guilty when I wasn't either working or preparing to work and grew irritable when “wasting time,” a peculiarly American concept. Today I regard compulsive work as I do any other compulsive act—damaging to the psyche. I view unnecessary work as an abomination and I see no enrichment of personality in those millions of dreary, repetitive jobs on the assembly lines of factory and office dictated by a machine‐dominated culture. Work, as I now see it, falls into two broad slots: the tedious routine chores necessary to survival and the kind of creative endeavor that does nourish the spirit and expand horizons. I believe in performing the first as quickly as possible without any cant about ennoblement. The second, embracing a thousand crafts from carpentry to watchmaking, can be made a vehicle of dignity, joy and pride, but only if society places the needs of the worker above those of the machine. But how can this be done in the age of mass production? You tell me. I'm stating an attitude, not a solution. No. 1. 1 once took quiet pride in America's seaming superiority in forging the good life. Now I believe that if the whole world followed our example, we would quickly mount an ecological and spiritual fiasco. The last thing Bolivia needs is three million Cadillacs and Ford station wagons racing up and down its mountains, while Africa needs industrial wastes in Lake Victoria, on the pattern of polluted Lake Erie, about as much as it needs the‐ transcendental succor of Disneyland. Now I think that if America would but pause and listen to some of the so‐called backward societies, we might gain insights on formulation of a desperately needed new set of values. Competition. Compete, win, beat out the other guy. So read the counsel of my youth. Pulpit, school and locker room chanted the vast character glories deriving from unfettered struggles to win. I believed. I competed with vigor. Up Knebel. Down you and you and you. I knew elation when I won, misery when I lost. But a funny thing happened on my way through life. found that, not competition, but cooperation turned me on. I've discovered that the psychic energy generated by group efforts can galvanize and enrich me more than many of my solo stints at the typewriter. In broader terms, while rugged individual competition may be justified in a world of ever‐expanding economies and resources, only cooperation and joint planning fit a contracting world. With a vi sion of limitless goods available to all, the rich can dismiss the poor as indolent, incompetent or ignorant. Want a stereo set? Then get off your can and hustle as I do. But if our vital resources, from fuel to metals to food, are seen as limited, as they must now be, then exhortations to greater individual and national productive rivalry can dead only to ugly confrontation. Today we Americans, with about 5 per cent of the world population, consume a third or more of the earth's goodies. Are we prepared to preserve that ratio by competition which, eventually, must mean by tank and missile? My new attitude, formed in the last few years, is this:‐ There is but one pie, and if we do not cooperate in equitable sharing, we face hatred, retaliation and destruction. Population. The few savants worrying 40 years ago about the peril of too many human bodies on this small planet did not include me. I assumed that the production of babies in quantity was as much a part of the natural order as the manufacture of refrigerators and radios. I looked with interest and equanimity on thcse pictures which used to grace the newspapers. Caption: “Mr. and Mrs. Horace Smith celebrate 25th wedding anniversary with their 17 children.” When I was a young reporter in Ohio, we had a local judge whose popularity stemmed as much from his prowess in helping to spawn 13 children as from the caliber of his decisions. I did not quarrel with that public as sessment. My attitude changed gradu ally with the drip of statistics, the sprouting of huge highrise apartments and the sprawl of housing developments over meadow and cornfield. Today, with an estimated four billion humans on earth, many of them starving, and predictions of eight billion by early next century, favor almost every population curb save war and famine. I'm for birth control devices, vasectomy, abortion and penalty taxes on parents of large families. In an age of dwindling natural resources on a finite earth, I think the champions of reproduction should at least pay something toward the added fuel, water, food and beer cans their offspring will require. Back then, RATIONALITY. American and Western’ culture, to which I subscribed, extolled the brain beyond all other human wonders. The mind conceived such marvels as science, progress and the indoor flush toilet. Emotions, feeling, intuition and felicities of the body bore the tag: “Use With Caution.” Had a cartoonist depicted the prevailing creed of my youth, he would have shown the shaggy head of Albert Einstein above a mechanical body. The prize word was rationality, acclaimed in the West since Rene Descartes said more than three centuries ago: “I think, therefore I am.” Now, FEELING AND RATIONALITY. I spent more than three adult decades under the spell of undiluted rationality without realizing that Descarte's dictum did not mesh with my own experience, which told me: “I'm aware, therefore I am,” the awareness encompassing both thought and sensation. Back to that steam shovel in Jackson Heights. The 6‐year‐old's reaction to the earth mover holds more truth for me today than much of what I learned rationally in school, college and 27 years covering Washington as a political reporter. Is this merely the case of a 62‐year‐old man entering second childhood before the onslaught of senility? I doubt it. For how is the rational to be trusted when today's rational judgment turns out to be tomorrow's absurdity? think the boy, possessed of scant knowledge, but with a full operational set of those marvelous human senses, was right on. My change has occurred in the last four or five years as I sampled a smorgasbord of what is loosely called the human potential movement—sensitivity training, encounter groups, sensory awareness, husband‐wife seminars, yoga, meditation and most recently T'ai Chi. (Even 10 years ago I would have scorned such explorations as trivial, softheaded indulgences.) I have learned enough to understand my ignorance about my own body and to rue those spare hours in a long journalistic career that might have been devoted to self‐discovery. Inner space, find, holds infinite wonders to match those of outer space. The ‘range of my feelings, long suppressed, astounds me and I'm learning to trust those feelings. I am truly me when I sense the breeze brushing my face, the sun splashing my body or my eyes catching the flutter of a leaf. When think I play chess with concepts and try, as I am doing now, to bring order into a process at once chaotic and mystifying. I do not denigrate the brain. I still marvel at its capacities, but a brain without an aware body belongs only in a medical museum. From this basic shift in viewpoint, is number of altered Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. I spent much of my life either anticipating the future or regretting the past. I dwelt restlessly and somewhat apprehensively in the immediate now. These days confine thoughts of my own future to a modest amount of supposedly prudent planning. When the past intrudes without insight for today, I try to move on. Being aware of myself and my surroundings in the here and now offers an exciting new life. The first precept in “An Eschatological Laundry List” compiled by Shelly Kopp reads: “This is it!” This moment„ this instant. Life postponed, I. find, is life unlived. Control, Self‐control, the stiff upper lip, maintaining a pose of imperturbability amid seething emotions, these stood as bywords in my upbringing in the WASP middle class. Later I witnessed my own mother's breakdown, in part resulting from tensions caused by the clash between that code of behavior and her suppressed emotions. Now I believe that self‐exposure, a rich emotional life and an awareness of one's own vulnerability offer some keys to health and enjoyment. ‐ I thought more, not less, of Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine when he wept publicly in New Hampshire during the 1972 campaign, and more, not less, of Representative Charles E. Wiggins of California when he choked up this summer while announcing his change of position after former President Nixon's semiconfession of Watergate guilt. I believe the person accustomed to open display of emotion is less, likely to panic in a crisis than the uptight one who never ventures far from home without a bland, dispassionate mask. To be human is to be vulnerable. The most poignant,. beautiful moments of the sexual act occur when the partners cease all efforts of self‐control and let emotions sweep them to ecsasy Which brings up: Sexuality: As a son of a Y.M.C.A. secretary and grandson of pious fundamentalists, I may have undergone more preachments against sex than the average child. Yet clues from society at large told all of us that sex was at best a necessary evil, at worst animalistic rutting that corrupted the soul beyond redemption if practiced for goals other than reproduction. Yet every schoolboy knew that adults had an abiding urge to use their genitals. We lived behind a veil of Victorian hypocrisy from which we peeped longingly at whorehouses, “loose” women and French post cards. At Y.M.C.A. camp, a renowned evangelist warned that masturbation would reduce us all to gibbering idiots. In retrospect, this skein of stupefying nonsense seems beyond all credibility even to one who lived through it. It warped many beyond repair and while I came through only partially damaged, echoes of my boyhood still whisper darkly that illicit sex holds an allure unknown to the legal varities. I find today's sexual climate, whatever its surely temporary excesses, far more reasonable and comfortable. I enjoy the erotic. I love the nude female form. I rejoiced in the youthful slogan during the Vietnam nightmare: “Make love, not war.” I've lost my taste for dirty jokes. Robust, healthy sex can be radiant, beautiful and powerful and when one views sexuality as an integral part of nature's oneness, life becomes invested with new energy and exhilaration. Women. Whatever I said aloud, for many years 1 regarded women as slightly inferior beings. Women were powerless and like all Washington correspondents courted the company of the powerful. My livelihood depended on it. I thought women to be irrational, albeit comely, adornments of rational society. They didn't know what I wanted to know: they didn't “think like a man” and many of their concerns seemed both inconsequential and dreary. Oh, sure, there were ‘ exceptions like my friend, columnist Mary McGrory, but exceptions merely proved the rule. In the last 10 years, since switching from reporting events to creating fictional scenes, I've made many more women friends than I did in the then largely male world of newspapermen and politicians. The experience resembles a visit to another planet inhabited by beings of curious and telling insights into such matters as birth and death, people, psychology, health, work and love. I find, for God's sake, that some women are brilliant and many focus on aspects of life that I tended to forget. By and large, they are less stuffy than men and far less predictable. They level more and fewer of them cringe from the intimate, personal talk that most men, in their competitive, macho, one‐upmanship stance, find either trifling or threatening. Then AUTHORITY, now CONSENSUS. As a young man I accepted the touted wisdom of authority with but sporadic grumbling and rebellion. Deans, divines, judges, generals and American Presidents had the word. Later, covering Washington, while I saw clay feet and seamy motivations, for the most part respected authority, gave it obedience and felt guilty when I defied it. Vietnam changed all that. Initially, I gave mindless assent to this extravagant military expedition to the other side of the globe. My wife's opposition was instantaneous and enduring. In discussions I flared angrily like the flagwearers of later years. She had challenged my America, the great and the good. Authority informed us that if the Vietnam domino toppled, then dominoes would crash across Asia and Europe and Communist hordes would threaten the fairest domino of all, the mighty double‐six, America. Gradually and painfully I changed, persuaded by my wife and millions of other dissenters froin campus to corporate suite. A stench at last filled my nostrils, a stench of bodies blasted by bombers, children broiled in napalm, forests defoliated by chemicals, prisoners dumped from helicopters, civilians riddled in ditches. I saw my country as a swaggering bully engaged in a futile, brutal, immoral enterprise. And who had triggered America's ugliest epoch but “The Best and the Brightest,” to use David Halberstam's apt title, the cream of the American Establishment. They reeked of authority and their blunder had tragic consequen6es for all of us. Nor was that the end of it. Men of authority hatched the Bay of Pigs, the invasion of the Dominican Republic, “black” operations of the C.I.A., including such deeds in defense of democracy as murder, bribery, theft and torture and finally Watergate, where the highest authority visited on Americans some of the crimes that had been lavished on foreigners for years under the guise of “national security.” I've had a bellyful of unrestrained authority and I trust I'll never again give blind allegiance to anyone solely because of the office held. Many attitude changes devolve from this one. Here is one sample. Justice. I once believed that the United States system of law and order treated all citizens alike. Disabused of such naivety while covering police and courts as a young newsman in Chattanooga, Toledo and Cleveland, I still believed the law's inequities were more aberrational than endemic. I forgot, of course, that I viewed the police station and courtroom through the eyes of a white, middleclass male who wore a coat and tie and lived at an address deemed “decent.” Police outrages against blacks, students, hippies and Chicanos during the rebellious sixties changed my mind. Power and privilege forever tilt the scales of justice in this world and I was a fool to ignore the fact. Perhaps the post‐Watergate climate since the fall of Richard Nixon will help balance the scales in America. I hope so, but I wouldn't want to test fate by driving to a sheriff's convene tion with a “Support Your Local Revolutionaries” bumpsticker. Then SAFETY, now TERROR. The first half of my life passed in a comforting aura of safety and familiarity in suburban areas of New York, Chicago, Cleveland and Washington, D. C. In our middleclass neighborhoods murder, arson, assault and robbery seldom struck. The mass killers, wars, plagues and pogroms never threatened American borders. Nature might erupt occasionally, but man‐made terror largely spared us. As for my country, it employed implements of war only in defense of liberty. Then came Hiroshima, shattering my insular, snug feeling forever. On Aug. 6, 1945, with Japan already reeling to defeat under great waves of B‐29's, the United States dropped the atomic bomb. In a split second a fireball of incredible intensity vaporized an entire city, killed some 100,000 civilians and condemned others to slow death by radiation. I remember the numbness I felt and the sense of creeping terror when the enormity of instant carnage overwhelmed me a few days later. Proliferation of man‐made terror in the three decades since the nuclear weapon made a mockery of human “security” has reached almost incomprehensible lengths, from submarine fleets with pop‐up hydrogen missiles capable of erasing civilization overnight to hundreds of nuclear projectiles, some of them hydra‐headed MIRV's, poised in the prairies for the ultimate kill. I prefer to ignore the facts during most waking hours, but the terror lurks deep within me, venting occasionally in dreams of holocaustal fury. I have a hunch that most of us have been psychologically maimed by the Hiroshima mentality which accepts mass incineration as an unavoidable, if unfortunate, aspect of human behavior. Certainly the catalogue of institutional and individual barbarism, from calculated torture by a host of governments to random massacres by single gunslingers, has added a score of pages since that summer Japanese morning. A psychiatrist friend says he yearns for the night when some high official breaks Washington's lullaby oratory by screaming with terror on NBC, prime time. At least, he says, he'd recognize a fellow human being. Military. Devolving from my acknowledgment of terror is my new view of the military Establishment. once looked with favor on our armed forces, served pridefully as a naval officer in World War II and believed that retention of vast armaments and uniformed personnel after the Korean War was justified by Russia's hostile tactics during the cold war. But it became obvious to a reporter covering the Pentagon that American profits and jobs, those twin fuels of the military‐industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned against, accounted as much for the staggering growth of our peacetime arsenal as did Soviet intransigence. With mighty weapons waiting to be used, the Defense Department became the Department of Offense. I now regard the Pentagon and its giant budget as more adversary than friend. So there, for what they're worth as you mull over your own views, are some of my attitude changes since the days of my youth. I lay no claim to infallible perception. You may conclude that some new attitudes are self‐deceptive or unjustified. If you don't agree with me, I'm open to dialogue. Just don't shcut me down with quotes from high authority, please. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New G.O.P. Chairman,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/17/archives/new-gop-chairman-mary-louise-smith-republican-bell-ringer-a-party.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 —Mary Louise Smith says she is a moderate‐conservative. But she supports the equal rights amendment, was one of the co‐conveners of Iowa's first women's political caucus, has taken a liberal stand on abortion and is a member of Planned Parenthood. “I'm not an ideologue—not a doctrinaire ideological type,” Mrs. Smith says. “My life style has been conservative but sometimes I cross over to the liberal side. I like to think of myself as being practical.” Today this moderate‐conservative‐liberal‐practica Republican became the first woman to head her party's national committee. Nominated by President Ford earlier this month to succeed George Bush, who will head the United States Liaison Office in China, Mrs. Smith was unanimously elected Republican National Chairman at today's committee meeting. Mrs. Smith, a 25‐year veteran of Iowa Republican politics, has served as national co‐chairman for the last six months. She credits a former Governor of Iowa, Robert D. Blue, and his wife, Cathlene, with introducing her to Republican politics. They met in 1949 in Eagle Grope, where Mr. Blue had gone to resume his law practice after serving two terms as Governor. “It didn't take Cathlene long to find a friend and ally to do party work,” Mrs. Smith said. “She was Mrs. Republican there and it was under her tutelage and with Governor Blue's encouragement that I got into active party work.” Republican Bell Ringer And active is what Mrs. Smith became. After ringing doorbells, filing cards and papers, and telephoning for the Eagle Grove Republicans, she became a precinct committeeman in the early nineteen‐fifties and was elevated to Wright County Republican chairman in 1961. Mary Louise Epperson, born on Oct. 6, 1914, in Eddyville, Iowa, was attending the University of Iowa when she met Elmer M. Smith, who was on his way to becoming a medical doctor. They were married in 1934. She received a degree in social work administration the following year. The Smiths have three children. Dr. Robert Smith of Des Moines, Mrs. Margret Byrne of San Francisco and James Smith of Iowa City, and five grandchildren. In 1962 the Smiths moved from Eagle Grove to Des Moines where Mrs. Smith continued her party work. In 1964 she won a threewoman race for Iowa's National Committeewoman post and was re‐elected to that position in 1968 and 1972. In 1966, Mrs. Smith served on a special subcommittee of the Republican National committee on convention reforms. In 1969 and 1971 she served as vice chairman of the party's Middle West region conference and in 1972 was co‐chairman of the Iowa Committee for the re‐election of the President. Republican rules caii for the use of the title “chairman” and Mrs. Smith said the title was just fine with her. “I don't get hung up on labels,” she said. “To some women they may be symbolic but not to me. I look upon the term as a generic term anyway.” A Party Loyalist Mrs. Smith is known as a party loyalist who believes in working for whomever runs on the party ticket. In 1964 she avoided involvement in the GoldwaterScranton fight for Iowa delegates, but once Barry Goldwater became the party's Presidential nominee, she jumped into the race and became his campaign manager in Iowa. Although she has 25 years of Republican political ex perience behind her, there are some within the party who are skeptical of her ability to run the party on a national level. Some see her nomination as a “holding pattern” unil President Ford chooses someone to run his re‐election campaign. Mrs. Smith, a gray‐haired grandmother, who some say resembles Mrs. Richard M. Nixon traveled 38,000 miles this summer conducting grassroots seminars “to turn people back on to politics.” Mrs. Smith's husband, said he was proud of his wife's political achievements adding that their separate careers have been a boon to their 40‐year‐marriage. Dr. Smith said he would not give up his job to be with his wife in Washington. Instead, he said, they will commute back and forth to see one another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City's Consumer Agency Beset by Internal Strife,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/18/archives/citys-consumer-agency-beset-by-internal-strife-aides-say-citys.html,"Lawyers and investigators, in the city's Department of Consumer Affairs say that the agency's law‐enforcement division is. demoralized and decimated by personnel losses and has deteriorated rapidly during the eight months of the Beame administration. Most of the bright young lawyers who turned the office into a national showcase of consumer protectionisin during the Lindsay administration have left. Same have lost their positions through budget cutbacks. Others have resigned in frustration. Dissatisfaction with the new commissioner, Elinor C. Guggenheimer, was so strong that in April she was presented’ with a petition by a mutinous staff; it said that her actions threatened to “undermine the integrity of the division.” The story behind the petition —the grievances that gave rise to it and the subsequent departure of many who signed it—is the story of one city agency, small but important, that has changed dramatically with the new administration at City Hall. In March, 1973, as a candidate for Mayor, Abraham D. Beame issued a “position paper” against price increases, in which he proposed that “the City Consumer Affairs Departinent should be expanded.” Despite this, the 459‐member department was one of 13 of 03 agencies in the city to have its budget appropriation decreased in the Beame Administration—from $6‐million to $5.7‐million. Mrs. Guggenheimer calls the budget cutback “a heavy blow and one that fell particularl hard on the law‐enforcemer ‘ division because it was lade with non‐Civil Service “prov sionals” who could be dis missed. Out of 15 employes “terminated” by the depart ment, eight were in the div sion. But these dismissals accout for only part of the staff attrition. In December, the division numbered 52 employes its central office at 112 White Street and its seven neighbor.hood offices. Since then, least 27, including the top lawyers and investigators, have left Only a few have been replaced. “Camelot is over,” said Councilman Henry Stern, who serve formerly as first deputy commissioner in the department “All that talent collected Bess Myerson is scattered the winds. It's sad to see some thing built up so painstakingly brought down. And frightening that it can happen so fast.” Accusations Are Cited Many of the lawyers’ resigna tions are grounded in anger; their accusations include the following: ¶A new atmosphere of “po litical considerations” and “timidity” is weakening the will to prosecute businesses for fraud. ¶“Naive” and “uninformed” actions by Mrs. Guggenheimer could have delayed or imperiled several major cases had they not been countermanded by the staff. ¶The new Consumer Advocate in charge of the division, David B. Saxe, who obtained his post through political connections, has suggested “unethical” tactics for investigations, such as breaking into pet store at night to appraise the conditions in dog cages. ¶Too much of their time spent, at the request of their superiors, looking into consumer issues affecting high‐income groups, such as problems in storing fur coats or having to pay for psychiatrists’ sessions canceled in advance. But most of all, because of the sheer loss in manpower, the division has practically ceased to effectively function, according to interviews with 20 among the 25 present and former senior lawyers and investigators. They requested anonymity on the grounds that they are still with the department, still have dealings with it, or are now seeking employment. All who were willing to talk agreed that the office is I ‘in trouble.” “We can't even keep up with the consumer complaints,” said one. “We're just trying to hang on.” ‘Clique’ Is Assailed These accusations are denied by Mrs. Guggenheimer. The department, she said, has not succumbed to political interference and is not “going, to turn its back on the low‐income consumer.” “There is demoralization,” she acknowledged, and she conceded that perhaps she had neglected the division “to spend more time with the sicker parts” of the department. But, in turn, she felt she had encountered “hostility” from a group of lawyers that “functioned like a small club” and did not understand the political realities of a changeover in city administrations. “Everybody wanted the status quo,” she said. “But in a transition there is no status quo. People leave, new people come in. When the Lindsay administration came in, there was a clean sweep. “In a transition period, rumors fly like mad. It takes a ;while to grasp the running of an agency. Why, I found that jf I went into the back room, jt was thought I was brooding.” The lawyers readily concede that they formed something of 4 clique, with strong loyalties to Bess Meyerson, the first pommissioner, who hired most of them. ‘Insulation’ Coveted Under Miss Meyerson and, for nine months of la,st year, !tinder Betty Furness, the deartment held a national reputation. Much of this was due to the law enforcement diviMon, now called the Consumer Advocates Office, which was Set up in 1969 to enforce the weepingly powerful Consumer Protection Law, which outlaws ;Receptive or unconscionable trade practices. Staffed with lawyers recruited from the top law schools, it Won headlines with its cases —such as one against Vigilant Alarm Systems, an outfit that :told slum residents $75 burglar alarms for $750, in which con‘urners won refunds in debts canceled that totaled $1.2‐million. Their effectiveness, the lawjers now believe, derived, in part, from a sense of insulation from politics and from ‘City Hall. And the most effective component appeared to be !the semi‐autonomous neighborhood offices, which began as an experiment in 1971 and, by )ast December, had collectively ireturned over $5 ‐million to ‘consumers. Three months after taking ?office, Mrs. Guggenheimer de(cided to centralize all the lawtyers in the neighborhood offices in the division's central office. She believed the offices ‘would serve a better function as centers for consumer edudon and complaints. The plan, unveiled at a meeting March 25 with the new first deputy commissioner for legal affairs, Robert Egan, was bitterly opposed. It would, the subsequent petition said, “cripple both investigations and complaint resolution,” which needed on‐the‐spot legal work. Because the Commissioner was being besieged with comlaints about the neighborhood lawyers from businessmen being investigated, and because she expressed concern over lawyers working “in isolation,” the move was also seen by many lawyers as a sign of nonsupport from above. The plan has since been abandoned by the Commissioner. Kaufman Case Noted At the same time, several incidents occurred involving specific investigations. One concerned a case against the Kaufman Carpet Company, which ‘was being investigated for a wide range of alleged abuses, including defective carpets, contained in 160 customer complaints. The case made headlines when Mrs. Gu‐genheimer said she had received a telephone call from Irving Goldman, the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, on behalf of Daniel Schoen, the president of Kaufman. But she has insisted that when Mr. Schoen appeared in her office in January, she at first mistook him for a job‐seeker. During the meeting, Mr. Schoen accused the neighborhood office handling.the case of exceeding its authority. Afterward, Mrs. Guggenheimer decided to “Mild up” the case until Mr. Egan, who was treasurer in her unsuccessful 1969 campaign for City Cuoncil President, assumed office Feb 1. However, the neighborhood lawyer in charge f aheces,t lawyer in charge of the case,, Greg Heistand, said he was not told that Commissioner Guggenheimer had suspended his negotiations with the firm, ands when he learned of it, he was not told°, why. He fired off a memo of protest,. Allegations of ‘Interference’ The negotiations, which are directed toward winning an “assurance of discontinuance” —tantamount to an out‐of‐court settlement, were resumed after a delay of six weeks. When they were continued, Mr. Egan sat in on them. The lawyers, accustomed to having a free hand, felt that the presence of a deputy commissioner undercut their negotiating power. During the six weeks, rumors of “interference from City Hall” circulated throughout the division. The lawyers said they did not learn, until they read it in the newspapers, that Mr. Goldman was involved, and that he had placed a second telephone call to Mrs. Guggenheimer, asking her, in her words, to “go easy on” Mr. Schoen, a Beame campaign contributor. The lawyers were furious because it had, been depart. mental policy that the commissioners and their deputies did not meet with businessmen under investigation. Mrs. Guggenheimer finds “nothing mysterious” about the incident. “Lots of people called up and said ‘such and such a friend. He's got a problem with your office. Can you see him?” she said. She reported Mr. Goldman's conduct to the city's Investigation Department, which now conducting an inquiry. But she did not do so, according to sources close to the investigation, until May 1—the day she was questioned about the matter by a reporter. On the same day, Kaufman received notice from the department that it was going to be sued. Another incident involved furniture store in Harlem called Joseph's, also under investigation for improper contracts and defective merchandise. Negotiations with the firm were close to achieving an assurance of discontinuance the lawyers say. Agency lawyers working on the case assert that they they were told to postpone the assurance because an agreement had been reached to await the outcome of a parallel investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, where bureaucratic procedures often delay final action for months. In defiance of the arrangement, Steven Sarshik, special counsel, called up the lawyer from the other side and assigned the assurance on July 2, totally on his own authority, he said. The department did not publicize the action until yesterday. Other Cases Cited Another furniture company that the department prepared a case against was Seaman's, a citywide chain that was the target of complaints from some low‐income buyers about alleged late delivery, unfair credit practices and defective merchandise. Last year, those who represented the company, in its dealings with the department included Judah Gribetz, who was to become Deputy Mayor, and Bernard RUggiert, a major figure in Mr. Beame's campaign. When an assurance of discontinuance was signed in April, Howard Tisch, another commissioner in the department, who is on friendly terms with Mr. Gribetz, complained that the accompanying press release violated an understand. ing because it was too “hard” on the company. In February, in still another case, Mrs. Guggenheimer received a letter from a two‐man firm in the Bronx called Credit Associates. It complained that the company had been unfairly treated by her predecessor. The aollection agency was under suit for its alleged high‐pressure tactics, which included, according to court affidavits, threatening debtors with bodily harm, telling children that their fathers were going to jail, and knocking on apartment doors at 2 A.M. wearing gold shields that read, “C.A.I., Special Agent 147.” Mrs. Guggenheimer prepared reply letter promising to look Into the situation. Several lawyers warned her that her reply :mild be used to postpone the itigation. But, they say, she insisted on sending it. One of them, told to redraft and mail the letter, simply kept it. Mrs. Guggenheimer described ler reply as “noncommittal,” Ind pointed out that, in any case, it had not been sent. She said she was unfamiliar with the facts in the Joseph's case. As to the Seaman's case, she said there was some merit to Mr. Tisch's arguments against “tough” press release, since hat could discourage other ‘firms from agreeing to assurinces of discontinuance. Some lawyers in the depart merit are distressed by what one called “a change in attitude.” “It's not a case of someone handing over 500 bucks to drop a case,” said one. “It's a shift — from neutrality to a consideration of political factors, to thinking ‘How will so and so react to, this?’ “We're paranoid. Why are we all of a sudden meeting with deputy commissioners to discuss the merits of cases? Whose case is it? Who could be talking behind my back? Has some agreement been reached that I don't know about? We're wondering if Bernie Ruggieri told Beame we're all a bunch of wild‐eyed radicals.” As an expression of their anxiety, some lawyers in the division have refused to sign pro forma affidavits involved in pretrial motions because they include the words: “I am familiar with the facts and ‘circumstances surrounding this case.... ” Contributing to the political atmosphere, some lawyers say, is the political background and connections of some of the new appointees. Political Ties Listed Monica Gollub, the new administrator of the neighborhood offices, was a Beame campaign worker. Another deputy commissioner, Mrs. Elsie Altholz, is the sister of Dr. Bernard Greidinger, one of Mayor I3eame's oldest personal friends. David Saxe, the new 32‐year‐old Consumer Advocate, is member of the Tilden Democratic Club, During Mr. Beame's campaign, he worked in his Barclay Hotel campaign headquarters. He is the son of Dean Emanuel Saxe of Baruch College, who taught the Mayor in a graduate accounting course. Mr. Saxe told the mayorelect's transition committee that he wanted a deputy com missionership. Mrs. Guggenheimer hired him, she said, after rejecting some “ei,ght or ten” other lawyers that had been sent over by City Hall. During his first staff meeting after his appointment on April 1, the dissidents say, Mr. Saxe delivered a speech to the lawyers on clubhouse politics and described how his resume had worked tis way up through political channels. Persons with political backgrounds were not totally unknown in the department before. But Bruce Ratner, who served as Consumer Advocate frOm 1971 to 1973, asserts: “Politics did not play an important part in their appointments.” Mr. Ratner, upset over the department's direction, is resigning as chairman of the Consumer Advisory Council, mayoralty appointed position. “The department has been crippled by the political patronage system that elevates and rewards mediocrity,” remarked Stephen Nueman, the acting Consumer Advocate who had been with the division four years and who resigned in May. “What makes it such a pity is that it happened to the foremost consumer protection agency in the country.” Investigators have complained to Mr. Egan that Mr. Saxe has proposed questionable investigatory methods. Female investigators assert that they have been asked to pretend that they are pregnant and to undergo abortions, while investigating fly‐by‐night abortion clinics, and to consult male divorce lawyers to see if seduction attempts would be made. Others assert that Mr. Saxe proposed a night‐time entry into an upper East Side pet shop, to check on the conditions there. None of these things were done. Mr. Saxe said these ,asser tions, are “absolutely crazy”, although he said that he might have made some such suggestions “in jest.” Some lawyers also contend that Mr. Saxe has concerned himself unduly with Issues affecting high‐income consumers. One lawyer was requested.to draft a regulation’ on the “unconscionable” practice of psychiatrists charging patients for “missed” appointments. Another ,was asked to look into complaints over storing fur coats in department stores. “One day, Saxe came in with ticket stubs to ‘The Great Gatsby,’ “ recalled one lawyer. “He complained that even though they were for reserved seats, the Paramount was seating people anywhere.. Next thing I know, we issue a press release, warning consumers about it. “Here we are Spanishspeaking consumers are getting ripped off left and right, and we're talking about pet stores and “The Great Gatsby.’ “ ‘Undermining’ Is Feared These dissidents also assert that Mr. Saxe ‘has expressed a desire to give “a good case” to Richard H. Kuh, the Manhattan District Attorney running for election, whom he knows from the Tilden Club. Mr. Saxe denies this.. His office is now conducting a major investigation with the District Attorney's office into fraud in the sale of hearing aids. The grievances of the lawyers and consumer investigators climaxed on April 8. Some two dozen of them crowded into Mrs. Guggenheimer's office, on the fourth floor of a rundown’ building at 80 Lafayette Street, for an extraordinary confrontation. The meeting had been demanded by the lawyers themselyes, not by the Commission er, and as she sat behind her desk, stunned, one of ‘them read aloud the five‐page petition. It was signed by 27 members of the staff, virtually all ‘of the legal aides in a staff that numbered 50 at the time: It said, in summary; that her actions and decisions “threaten the ‘integrity of law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, ,and demonstrate an evident indifference to the gdals and objectives of effective consumer protection.” Unless the situation changed, it said, the division ‘would be “undermined” and, consumers throughout the city would suffer for it. response was counter‐attack. Flustered and angry, she replied, according to many who attended the meeting: “Look, I'm going to give you a lesson in city government. There's a new administration.. ..” in effective consumer protection,” shot back a member of her staff. Since that meeting, the resig nations have continued, Lawyers Charge ‘Inactivity’ The lawyers say that neighborhood offices hurt the worst have simply dropped their most important eases. The dissidents say the Jamaica office, for example, has no lawyer to handle a major action involving allegations of deceptive advertising against a widely publicized appliance firm. They say the Lower East Side office is unable ‘to go to trialon two of its’ major cases, one against a supermarket and other against,an immigration agency. At the diVision headquarters, there are sometimes not enough people to answer telephones, they add. Since January, they say,there has been only one law suit—the Kaufman case. There has been no department‐inspired legislation passed by the City Council; and the Commissioner has warned Councilmen ‘that she is so low on: inspectors—down from 135 four. years ago to 70 now—that new legislation could not be adequately policed. There have been no new regulations promulgated under the Consumer Protection Law (except for a temoorary measure during the gasoline crisis), alPlough one — regulating pet stores—is pending. Interoffice memos warn that some of the existing 39 regulations cannot be, enforced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CURB ON ABORTIONS PASSED BY SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/18/archives/curb-on-abortions-passed-by-senate.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 (UPI) —The, Senate approved today legislation Ito prohibit the use of Federal funds for abortions or school busing. The anti‐abortion provision, which was sponsored by Senator Dewey F. Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma, passed by voice vote after efforts.to‐kill it by tabling failed on a 50.34 vote,. The Senate voted 45 to 42 to prohibit use of Federal funds for busing of children to achieve racial balance in schols. This provision is expected to have little effect since very little Federal money is used fOr busing. The two provisions were. approved as amendments to a $39.9‐billion appropriation for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare. The omnibus bill, which would provide about $630‐million less than the Administration requested, is expected to pass the Senate tomorrow.

Senate Votes Bill Curbing Abortion Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/19/archives/senate-votes-bill-curbing-abortion-aid-deletion-impossible.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 18—The Senate passed today a $33. billion appropriation bill that includes provisions to restrict Federal funds for abortions and for school busing. The measure, which goes to Senate‐House conference com mittee to reconcile differences with a House‐approved version, appropriates money for health, education, welfare, labor and related programs in the fiscal year 1975 that began July 1. The Senate vote was 77 to 12. The anti‐abortion provision may be deleted in conference. The House rejected such an amendment, 237 to 123, in considering the bill last June. The provision would bar any funds for abortions except to save a mother's life. The ban would apply mainly to Medicaid, the program that pays doctor and hospital bills of welfare recipients and other poor families. Deletion Impossible The antibusing amendment cannot be deleted under the rules because the House approved such a provision last June, 231 to 137. The 45‐to‐42 vote for the amendment marked the first time after many attempts over the years that busing opponents won Senate approval of a ban on Federal expenditures for busing to overcome racial imbalance in schools. The House has repeatedly voted for such a ban only to see its amendments deleted in conference. The final version of a general school aid bill, signed by President Ford last month, prohibits Federal funds for busing beyond the next closest school, except by court order. ‘ The practical effect of the antibusing provision is regarded as all but negligible because the measure does not provide funds for elementary and secondary school aid or for aid to school districts affected by heavy concentration of Federal employes. These funds are to be included in a supplementary bill. The Senate action nevertheless theless was interpreted by the lamendthent's sponsor, Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina, „ as a vote against “forced busing.” Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, challenging that conclusion, offered previous fiscal year. above the amount for the same an amendment that nothing in the measure “shall prohibit the implementation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution.” The amendment was adopted, 85 to 5. In issuing busing orders, the courts have said that busing was necessary to protect rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The Senate bill was $419‐million below the Ford Administration's request and $297‐million less than the House had voted.

CAREY CRITICIZED ON ABORTION ISSUE Wilson Siores Hini for Not Signing Petition — More Pressing Problems Cited,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/20/archives/carey-criticized-on-abortion-issue-wilson-scores-him-for-not-h.html,"Governor‐Wilson yesterday criticized his Democratic opponent, Representative Hugh L. Carey, for refusing to sign a Congressional, petition that would have permitted floor debate on the proposed antiabortion amendment to. the Constitution. Mr. Carey immediately accused.the Governor of “trying to play politics with the sensitive issue of abortion,” and said he had refused to sign because the petition would'have circumvented the Congressional, process of committee debate of the amendment. Mr. Wilson, who is a Roman Catholic like Mr. Carey, sought to draw a’ distinction between himself and the Democrat when asked whether abortion might be an issue in the campaign. “There are many who feel as I do that when we talk about the least of the brethren, the very least of the brethren is the unborn child,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview. “I feel that somebody should speak for the unborn child.” High Court Has Spoken He said that while “many Congressmen” had signed the petition earlier this year to release the antiabortion amendment, from the Judiciary Committee, “Mr. Carey has refused to sign the petition to allow that matter to be discussed before the full House.” Mr. Carey responded through a spokesman that “realistically there was no chance of passage,” and that the Congressman would not circumvent the committee. Mr. Carey's basic position on abortion is that he is personally opposed but that since the High Court has spoken he would not attempt to impose his will on the state in the event he is elected Governor. The amendment would overturn, in effect, the Supreme Court decision that did away with state restrictions on abortions. Republican officials spoke privately yesterday of what they saw as reassuring signs of a new combativeness by Mr. Wilson in the campaign. They were referring to the Governor's remarks Wednesday criticizing Mr. Carey, as well as President Ford for his pardon of former President Richard M. Nixon. A Difference of Style “If there is a difference of style it is becausd I am campaigning,” Mr. Wilson said when asked whether “a new Malcolm” had emerged in response, to widespread criticism among Republicans that his campaign needed more snap. The Governor began the day with a news conference at which the leaders of unions who have endorsed his candidacy gathered for a collective reendorsement. The gathering, which featured officials of six unions representing 125,000 state workers, musicians, construction workers, teathsters and utility workers, was considered by some Republicans as an attempt to. counter the endorsement of Mr. Carey last weekend by the New York State United Teachers. Mr. Wilson announced that he had lent a letter expressing concern to President Ford. that New York not be short‐changed under a new Federal unemployment aid program. The use of statistics dating to last April does not reflect the more severe and recent developments, he said. In commenting on the Governor's remarks on abortion, Mr. Carey said it was “more important for Mr. Wilson to face the state's problems, of joblessness, vacancy decontrol and political independence.” In criticizing Mr. Carey, the Governor has charged that his candidacy seemed manipulated by Democratic “bosses.” Asked Whether he considered the influential Nassau Republican chairman, Assemblyman Jpseph M. Margiotta, a Republican “boss,” the Governor replied: “You're mixing apples and oranges.” He described Mr. Marigiotta as “a fine leader” of the G.O.P. and said he had used the word “boss” in describing the dynamics of the Democratic primary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Scandalous Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/22/archives/a-scandalous-woman-and-other-stories-by-edna-obrien-151-pp-new-york.html,"Here are nine new stories by Edna O'Brien. They offer the pleasures her readers have come to expect: the brisk and deadly pleasures of fairy tale. She is adept at evoking gardens of Eden: a rural Irish childhood‐Eden and the Eden of sexual delight. Snakes abound. Penalties threaten. The dangling apple is too bright to be wholesome, but the girl approaching cannot gain this grim knowledge without risk. As though, exhausted by this primal dilemma, Miss O'Brien's heroines seem, once fallen, unable to rise. Their Fall is always sexual. If they do totter to their feet, it is to fall again, like the girl in the music‐hall ditty who “Went away to London,/For to hide her grief and shame,/But there met another squire,/And so lost her name again.” Six of these stories deal with some aspect of this sad odyssey. It is odd stuff to find oneself enjoying in 1974. Despite feminist efforts on behalf of their kind, Miss O'Brien's sex‐dazzled heroines ccntinue to race like lemmings toward unhappiness. Biology, for them, is still inflexible destiny and, with the possible exception of a quick, free abortion on the National Health, no social advantage is going to change things for creatures whose passivity rivals that of Sade's Justine. Eily, the scandalous woman of the title story, is seduced, impregnated and abandoned by ‘her lover; beaten, imprisoned and forcibly married off by her father; driven mad, institutionalized, drugged and then delivered back sane but with the spirit knocked out of her. Several of these indignities will be familiar to Miss O'Brien's readers for they have befallen women in her earlier books. A highly successful writer, she nurtures her fiction on the compost of defeat. Doom, as in a Totentanz, is visibly present at the happiest moments. Doubt is deftly placed and this device is most effective when sparingly used, as in “A Journey,” a story about a middle‐class girl who picks up a working man and goes on an overnight trip with him. In this story disaster never actually overtakes the lovers, but the writing is on the wall and on the windowpane where “the ice had clawed... and left its telltale marks... scrawls, lines at war with one another, lines bent on torment.” Unpromisingly, the man is already living with someone else. “And she felt certain that the woman he lived with was probably much more adept at living and arguing...” This legitimate woman, a constant though faceless figure in the O'Brien triangle, is the foil and antithesis of the scandalous heroine. The legitimate woman has the social virtues. She keeps her man in the end because she calculates, choosing happiness—a long‐terfn affair—over ecstasy, a much dicier value. Miss O'Brien does not care for the social virtues. “The Favorite,” story about a woman who practices them, is the only one in which the author keeps her distance from her character, condemning her finally for Although a feminist republic of free, responsible women might be tempted to ban Miss O'Brien's defeatist writings, they should rather, I think, be grateful to her. Her stories are bulletins from a front on which they will not care to engage, field reports on the feminine condition at its most acute. Only a woman fiction writer can safely and authentically explore feminine passivity to the full. She can experience it totally in her characters while protected from its virus by the fact that she is, qua writer, simultaneously active. Miss O'Brien explores with persuasive thoroughness. Like any extreme psychic condition, sexual obsession can, if uninhibited, damage the host mind. O'Brien girls’ allow nothing to inhibit theirs. They live their love affairs as Eily, the scandalous woman, rides her bike: without brakes. The only way off is to “come a cropper.” After the cropper comes the threnody. There are two examples in this collection, “Over” and “The House of My Dreams.” The women in these sound like the same woman in successive stages of mental disintegration. The laments incorporate old nostalgias for the lost Edens (Ednas?) of childhood and sex, and so all threads are sinks toward some doomed hallucination, not unlike a bad drug trip. Miss O'Brien's range is narrow and obsessional. The larger world does not interest her. Her social settings are perfunctory. Like Racine's queens, her sex and self‐absorbed women are undisturbed by the day‐to‐day. Nothing intervenes to prevent their passion reaching boiling point. Unlike Racinian passion, however, theirs never boils over. There is no explosion. No climax The slice of life is chopped off more or less neatly and a few sentences of melancholy Stoicism tie it up. Hers is the archetypal Romantic attitude: a yearning to cage the minute, arrest time at the childhood phase or the moment of sexual ecstasy or, all else failing, to recapture it through art. Her talents are for sensuous evocation, shimmering surface seduction. She can make us share her dreams, taste those cakes, feel, see and touch as she has done. What she does not seem to be able to do is to get experience into perspective. She cannot forced—a variant of Santayana's sentence on those who forget history—to rework it. The story is forever the same. As Miss O'Brien's fictional world is cyclic* it would be unreasonable to expect of her the explosive condensation sometimes aimed for in the short story. There is no moment of insight or understanding either, since the world is not to be understood. A quietistic and elegant shrug is her usual way of ending a story: “She thought of the bigness and wonder of destiny—meeting him in a packed train had been a fluke, and this now was a fluke... and they would be together, or not be together, as life the gaffer thought fit.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Italy's First Lady: Effective Booster for Her Country's Fashions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/23/archives/italys-first-lady-effective-booster-for-her-countrys-fashions-well.html,"When President Giovanni Leone of Italy pays a state visit to Washington on Wednesday, the slender, attractive woman with the thick, dark wavy hair at his side is bound to command more than the usual attention. One reason will be her wardrobe. Vittoria Leone, the President's wife, wears clothes well, enjoys wearing clothes and, beyond that, is regarded by her countrymen as their ambassador of fashion. Last year, on a state visit to Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland and even France, her dresses dazzled. In Italy, where fashion—from fabrics and accessories through clothes—is the number one industry (automobiles rank second), this is more than a matter of pride. Italians feel that having an attractive, clothes‐minded First Lady can call at‐, tention to the country's products and spur exports. After all, Italy still generally ranks second to France in the world fashion stakes, and in a country beset with the economic difficulties that Italy has, having someone like Mrs. Leone to act as a showcase is an important factor. So today, just before she leaves for the United States, Mrs. Leone will have Valentino, Rome's leading couturier, supervise the final fittings of her wardrobe. It includes a white evening gown for dinner at the White House Wednesday and a pink one for a dinner at the Italian Embassy the following night. Valentino cut short a trip to New York to be present at the fittings. Well Fitted for Her Role “She's the only First Lady we've had since the Queen [Queen Maria Jose, who left along with King Umberto in 1946] who can serve as a showcase for Italian fashion,” said Count Rodolfo Crespi recently. A social figure around Rome with ties to the fashion industry, he added, “There's no other chance for Italy —the only other showcase we could have is actresses, and Sophia Loren is dressed by Dior.” Though Donna Vittoria, as she is known to Italians, worries sometimes about appearing too frivolous, she admits a long‐standing interest in clothes. “I always liked dresses,” she said. And she takes the trouble to acquire the perfect handbag and the right shoes to go with them. As a result, Mrs. Leone, who is of medium height—she appears taller than her husband—always is immaculately groomed. Mrs. Leone said she honestly believes Italian fashion is the best in the world. “I like the fantasy, the inventiveness, the marvelous color,” she said in a recent interview in one of the myriad drawing rooms of the 16th‐century Quirinale Palace she has called home for the last two and a half years. “Our designers are very clever, full of taste.” She was dressed neatly but elegantly in a pale gray satin shirt and narrow gray wool skirt. The skirt covered her knees, but then her skirts always cover her knees and she is delighted that hemlines are lengthening. “I can understand when a dress is shorter, it can make a woman look Younger,” she explained, “but I prefer to wear this length because I don't like my knees.” Even when her husband was simply successful Rome lawyer and she didn't have to worry about diplomacy, Donna Vittoria never went to Paris to buy clothes. “Sometimes, when I went to a boutique, I would see something French and I'd buy it if I liked it,” she said. “I don't do that any ,more.” She regards this as a small sacrifice. When she's alone in the palace or spending weekends in her country place near Ostia, just outside Rome, Mrs. Leone generally wears pants. But she never does in public—another sacrifice. Like Queen Elizabeth II, Mrs. Leone wears small hats that show her face when she appears in public, but she said she prefers small hats anyway. Most of the time, Donna Vittoria is dressed by Valentino who, she feels, has the proper touch of elegance and refinement. But she will occasionally add clothes by such designers as Princess Irene Galitzine, Pino Lancetti and Renato Balestra, all couturiers in Rome. She fills in her custom‐made wardrobe with ready‐to‐wear, including simple summer dresses, a long skirt, shirts and pants because “I'm always running out of things at the last minute,” she said. Besides, “It's fun to pick them from the rack—I really don't like fittings.” Fittings aside. Mrs. Leone loves shopping and regrets she doesn't have as. much time for it as she used to. “I like the search,” she said. “I'm always expecting something marvelous in the next place.” Mrs. Leone's husband and their three sons are her worst critics. “Sometimes,” she recalled, “I want to buy something funny and frivolous, and then the family gets upset and they tell Me, ‘Mother, you have gone crazy.’ I listen'to them and I thank them and then(I go my own way.” That is about as militant as Donna Vittoria gets: ¶She was not sympathetic to a feminist demonstration that she had to, pass earlier this year to get into a Valentino showing. “Those women didn't think, when they protested a fashion show,” she said, “that making the clothes gave employment to hundreds of women.’ ¶She doesn't go along’ with abortion reform, one of the main issues in Italy's feminist movement. She said she regards human life as sacred, not to be taken away in any forth. ¶She personally is against divorce, although Italian voters recently approval a controversial law permitting it, “With understanding, love and good will, difficulties within the family can be worked out,” she insisted. “I know it isn't easy. Everybody, in the family must make some sacrifices to achieve it.” Vittoria Leone herself never had any thought of a career, outside of marriage. In 1946, at the age of 18, and just out of high school, she was married to Mr. Leone in her home town of Caserta, north of Naples, Her husband, then professor of law at the University of Bari, was 20 years her senior. A month before their marriage, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly that was to draft Italy's Republican constitution. Before she was 20, the Leones’ oldest son, Mauro, was born. At the age of 2, Mauro was stricken with polio and remained seriously ill for several years. He was finally cured in California hospital, for which Mrs. Leone says she will always be grateful to Americans. Mauro is, now a professor of law at the University of Rome and “he is a very good painter also, but his father has never let him exhibit.” Her youngest son, 18, also has an artistic flair. His hobby is photography, “He is always running around with his camera and saying, ‘Hold it a minute,’ and the rest of the family is always saying, Go away, Giancarlo, you are a pest,'” she said. Giancarlo's hobby paid off when ha submitted a photograph of his father in an official competition for the best picture of the President. He won the event, but for a while nobody knew where to find him. He had signed the picture “Glance,” a shortening of his name. “He is also a writer, specializing in theater and films,” his mother sari proudly.

ROCKEFELLER LISTS TOTAL HOLDINGS AT $218‐MILLION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/24/archives/rockefeller-lists-total-holdings-at-218million-tells-senate-panel.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 —Nelson A. Rockefeller, on the opening day of hearings by the Senate Rules Committee on his nomination as Vice President, said today that he hoped the “myth or misconception” about the Rockefeller family financial empire and its influence would be “exposed and dissipated.” But Mr. Rockefeller disclosed figures concerning his own wealth and that of his wife and children that seemed more likely to reinforce the image he was eager to dissipate. These included, total holdings of $218million, mostly in trusts, an average annual income over the last 10 years of $4.6‐million before taxes, and a net worth of $62.5‐million. The Rockefeller family, its fortune and the accompanying power, with its possible ramifications for a man in the country's second‐highest office, were the major preoccupation of , the four and one‐half hours of questioning. Political Philosophy But Mr. Rockefeller, who seemed slightly subdued at the start of the. hearing and noticeably more jaunty and relaxed after the two‐hour lunch break, also answered questions about his political philosophy in general and its specific applications ranging from taxation to abortion, about what he had , done as Governor, of New York‐and what he would do as Vice President. Mr. Rockefeller's testimony about, personal and family finances included the following: ¶He is the life beneficiary of trusts totaling $116.5 million; his wife, Happy, is the beneficiary of securities and trusts totaling $3.8‐million and his six children hold assets, in trust or outright, totaling $35.6‐million. ¶He has paid $69‐million in taxes during his lifetime but no federal income tax in 1970 because of the interaction ‘of personal income taxes and trust capital‐gains taxes. In that year, he noted, the trusts paid more than $6‐million in capital gains taxes while he paid slightly less than $1‐million in taxes other than Federal income taxes. ¶He had a total income of $46.8‐million in the last 10 years, about $1‐million a year A which was not subject to taxation as it came from tax‘ree securities held by two :rusts. After brief pleasantries in the foin of introductions by Iew York State's two Senators, Jacob K. Javits and James L. Buckley, Mr. Rockefeller then read excerpts from the 72‐page autobiographical statement submitted to the committee today, which also included summaries of his tax returns for the last 10 years and of his financial holdings and arrangements. He soon deserted the text for a handwritten summary, reading from notes scrawled on lined yellow paper and arranged in outline form. Speaking quickly, he led the committee through his childhood, education, first marriage and business experience, his entry into government with his 1932 election to the Westcheser County Board of Public Heatlh, his travels, his years as Governor. Of his many years of unsuccessful pursuit of the Presidency, he said: “On the national front I didn't do so well,” noting that he had made three formal tries, and ending: “I think that covers it.” This brought the first of the ripples of laughter that punctuated the hearings. He also summarized his forebears’ finances, with emphasis on the tradition of philanthropy. Indicating his awareness of the widespread belief and fear about the extent of his family's financial dominance in the oil industry, he said firmly that no member of the family was on the board of any Standard Oil Company, “nor do we have any control over the management of these companies.” Asked About Nixon Pardon He himself owns no more than two‐tenths of I per cent of the outstanding shares in any oil company, he said, and the total holdings of the family do not amount to more than 2.06 per cent of the stock of any of the oil companies. He also said that he did not own any shares in the Chase Manhattan Bank, headed by his brother David. One of the trusts of which he is a beneficiary does own 325,000 shares, worth $25.4 million, in Chase Manhattan. It was at this point that Mr. Rockefeller said, “I hope that the myth or misconception about the extent of the family's control over the economy of this country will be totally brought out and exposed and, dissipated.” Senator Howard W. Cannon, the Nevada Democrat who is chairman of the nine nember Rules Committee, began by asking Mr. Rockefeller, several times, about President Ford's pardon of former President Richard M. Nixon in the light of Mr. Ford's statement to the same committee, during his confirmation, proceedings as Vice President last year, that the country “wouldn't stand for” a prior pardon of President. “What assurances do we have that your responses will be anything more than empty phrases given at the moment?” Senator Cannon asked. Mr. Rockefeller replied that while his “total inclination” was to say.that he would not grant a similar pardon, “I I should at this point say that ‘would not amend the Constitution—and renounce the power that the Constitution gives to la President.” Later, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, returned to the same issue with a presistent inten sity that apparently sounded hostile even to him: He came over to Mr. Rockefeller just before the hearings resumed at 2:30 P.M. to say privately that he had not meant to embarrass him. Mr. Byrd, in his questioning, I said’ that without some assurances from Mr. Rockefeller as to the firmness of his commitment, “The committee is wasting its time and the process of hearings becomes a mockery.” After repeatedly pressing Mr. Rockefeller, he finally asked him: “Do you, yes or no, consider the questions today to be hypothetical” and that the answers “can be lightly put aside at some future date?” “The answer is no,” Mr. Rockefeller said. But Mr. Byrd, too, returned to the day's abiding preoccupation—the Rockefeller money. Attempting to define the amount of Mr. Rockefeller's personal fortune — $182.5 million—he said it was “one dollar every minute going back to the year 1627.” He said that he believed the family's “economic power” gave it a “stranglehold” Ion many areas of the national economy, and would give Mr. Rockefeller greater power than any previous Vice President. Mr. Rockefeller, as he did earlier and continued to do, quarreled with the notion of a Rockefeller “empire,” saying that his family merely had “interests,” not “controlling interests,” and saying emphatically that there would be no conflict. In the financial statement, which showed Mr. Rockefeller's income for the 10 years 1964 through 1973 as totaling $46.8million, $14.6‐million was listed as charitable contributions and $21.7‐million as payments of Federal, state and local taxes of all kinds. But the list of holdings of the two trusts,from which he derives the bulk of his income included about $14million in tax‐exempt securities. These, it is estimated, would bring him an income of about $1‐million a year, tax‐free, which by law does not even have to be entered on his tax return. So it is likely that his yearly income is that much higher than is shown on the tax returns. Throughout his 72 ‐page statement, Mr. Rockefeller stressed the “ethic” of the Rockefeller family, in which philanthropy plays a major role. He himself, he reported, has given $33‐million to various philanthropic and charitable institutions and undertakings,” and has pledged an additional $20.5‐million in art and real estate. The questioning also touched on his career as Governor. At various points, he was asked to defend his spending record, and explain his actions concerning abortion, welfare and drug laws. Mr. Rockefeller, sipping frequently from a glass of water and referring to notes, said that while New York State expenditures had gone up 300 per cent during his tenure, state expenditure nationwide went up 240 per cent during the same period. He said that he did not believe that the needs of the nation Low weic the same, in economic terms, as those of the state that led him to increase capital spending and raise taxes. The discussion about Mr. Rockefeller's changes in the state's welfare and drug abuse programs came in response to a question from Senator James B. Allen of Alabama, a Democrat. Senator Allen said that he had heard Mr. Rockefeller had “moved philosophically to. the right” in recent years, adding, “I hope that this is so.” Mr. Rockefeller. said that he felt he was “progressive or liberal in terms of meeting human needs, more conservative in terms of fiscal affairs.” He said that he believed it was these. itwo areas—welfare and drug laws—that had given rise to the chara.cterization. The hearings, held in the Senate Caucus Room, which was the scene for the 1973 Watergate hearings, were only moderately well attended. Mrs. Rockefeller, relaxed and smiling. sat two rows behind her husband, next to her cousin, Mrs.. Peter. Iselin. Others in the small cluster of chairs behind his seat at the green‐felt‐covered table included lawyers, guards and aides. Only one major question about foreign affairs was‐asked. It came from Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican, who asked Mr. Rockefeller if he believed the Central Intelligence Agency ought to interfere in foreign countries “such as in Chile.” Mr. Rockefeller produced a yellow‐jacketed book, “The Art of War,” by Gen. Sun T'zu, written about 2,300 years ago, and noted that it contained “a whole chapter on secret agents. I really believe that there is a gray world that exists among nations that, sad and tragic as it is, is there.” He also said that the C.I.A.'s activities had the approval of “top administrators in our Government. assume they were done in the national interest.” Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that he had received a great deal of mail concerning Mr. Rockefeller's action: in vetoing a bill that would have repealed New York's abortion ‐reform law. Mr. Rockefeller retraced the history of the law and the veto, and said it was “the most controversial subject that in my years in, public life I've ever run across.” As Mr. Rockefeller gathered up his papers and his silver ballpoint pen, he said he had enjoyed the first day Of the hearings: “I thought it was great,” he said, ‘adding: “I've never been through this before.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Double Standard,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/24/archives/double-standard.html,"Once again the anti‐abortion forces are trying for an end‐run around the will of the majority and the word the Supreme Court. In a previous attempt last year, bill intended to liberalize Social Security benefits was selected as the vehicle for an amendment that would have prohibited’ all Medicaid payments for abortion. In their current effort to subvert existing law and to impose their doctrinaire views, the same forces have managed to wrap the same amendment around a $33‐billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare. The effect of such a prohibition against the use Federal funds for abortion would be to tell the poor that they are once again to be deprived of personal rights legally enjoyed by the affluent. If enacted, this provision would dictate the birth of thousands of unwanted children, by Government order. Perpetuating.poverty and misery, such an application of governmental power would make a mockery, of last year's ruling by the Supreme Court that the decision whether or not to give birth to a child belongs not to the state but to the woman and her physician. Since the House appropriations bill contains no such discriminatory restriction, it is clearly the responsibility of the House‐Senate conferees to eliminate this amendment which violates the Constitution by establishing double standard that is indefensible in principle and callous in its human consequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rockefeller Panel Focuses On Attica and Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/27/archives/rockefeller-panel-focuses-on-attica-and-abortions-attica-abortion.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26—The issues of abortion and Attica dominated. the final day of the Senate Rules Committee's hearings today as more than a dozen witnesses, including Angela Daivis, testified fay and against Nelson A. Rockefeller's confirmation as Vice President. Just after 5 P.M., Senator Horward W. Cannon, the Nevada Democrat who is the committee's chairman—and who was the only one of its nine members to last throughout the afternoon's testimony—recessed the hearings for an indefinite period. He has said the panel will not vote until an audit of Mr. Rockefeller's taxes has been completed, sometime next month. Mr. Cannon, and his colleagues for varying periods of time, listened to nearly six hours of testimony concerning Mr. Rockefeller's suitability for the Vice‐Presidency, testimony in which the abortion issue and Mr. Rockefeller's handling of the Attica prison revolt, emerged as the dominant factors. Miss Davis, the black Communist, scholar who was acquitted two years ago of charges of murder and kidnapping, was the fourth witness of the day. She identified herself as. a “co‐chairperson of. the National. Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression. Arriving shortly after 10 A.M., she sat quietly in a front row with the Rev. Ben Chavis, who is appealing a 34‐year murder sentence in North Caro lina. When her turn came to testify almost two hours later, she concentrated on Mr. Rockefeller's public perforinance as Governor of New York in the Attica prison uprising. Six of the nine members of the committee were there today and committee staff men and women came in to watch as the tall woman with the familiar big puff of reddish brown hair approached the witness table. There was scattered applause. It was quickly gaveled down as she sat down with Mr. Chavis to testify. In her prepared statement, and later in response to questions from the Senators, Miss Davis contrasted Mr. Rockefeller's refusal to grant amnesty to the rebellious prisoners at Attica prison in 1971 with his description of President Ford's pardon of President Nixon as “an act of conscience, compassion and courage.” “How profoundly hypocritical this is,” she said, “and, how revealing of Rockefeller's true concept of justice and law. The regime of Richard Nixon did more to undermine constitutional government, subvert the democratic processes and endanger the liberties of the people than any other single event in recent history.” Mr. Rockefeller, she said, “permitted state police and prison guards to stage one of the most wanton massacres in the history of the United States” after ignoring the prisoners earlier demands for “a human environment in Attica.” Greeted by Applause Miss Davis, who spoke in clear, high voice, was greeted with a burst of applause from a section of the audience as she was called to the witness table at noon. Under questioning from Senator Hugh Scott, Republican of Pennsylvania Miss Davis said that she believed the “central demand” of the prisoners was for immunity from prosecution for the uprising, and that if it had been granted, “that would have been satisfactory.” Senator Scott tried repeatedly. to elicit her opinion of the prisoners demand for transportation to a “nonimperialist” country, saying finally “If can't get it from you, I'll have to give up. I thought you might want to be candid...” “I understand the reasons behind the demand,” Miss Davis said, “I do not know if this was a realistic demand.” Several hours later, there was testimony from W. Haywood Burns, the attorney for the Attica Brothers Legal Defense and from a former Attica inmate and participant in the rebellion, who identified himself as Frank (Big Black) Smith of Brooklyn, N.Y. Mr. Burns charged Mr. Rocke feller with the responsibility for “human tragedy that ranks; in the annals of national disgrace with My Lai.” Mr. Burns said: “His refusal to go to Attica state prison, coupled with his order for the state military assault on the unarmed men inside, cost the lives of 43 people.” He said that the position taken by Mr. Rockefeller in his testimony before the committee on Tuesday, that he now believed “assault without weapons” to be the correct procedure in such situations, was contradicted by his actions at Attica. Following Mr. Burns came an emotional plea from Mr. Smith, who is now on bail and under indictment on charges of murder and kidnapping for his part in the uprising. He said that the prisoners demands for improvement in their living conditions had not been agreed upon and that Mr. Rockefeller had “tried to dupe” the prisoners. He also denied Mr. Rockefeller's contention that the shooting began when a state police lieutenant was seized by the inmates, saying “there was firing from helicopters, firing from roofs.” The next witness, the Rev. Kenneth E. Lee of the Washington Christian Action Council, who also opposed Mr Rockefeller's confirmation, said he wished to disassociate himself from the opposition of Miss Davis and others. Mr. Rockefeller's support of New York State's liberalized abortion law was one of the grounds for Mr. Lee's objection to his nomination. For several others, it was a principal reason. They included Senator Jesse A. Helms, a North Carolina Republican who has cosponsored an amendment to the Constitution that would entirely ban abortion. Mr. Helms, the day's first witness, also questioned whether Mr. Rockefeller could validly disassociate himself from the “Rockefeller dynasty.” He submitted a list of questions to the committee having to do with Mr. Rockefeller's finances and those of his family, and also concerning the “Rockefeller stand against human life.” Another witness for whom abortion was the issue was Edward J. Golden, a founder and past president of the National Right to Life Committee. Mr. Golden said that Mr. Rockefeller had “turned his back on the child in the womb,” and that, if confirmed, he would “cast his shadow of an anti‐life philosophy so foreign to our JudeoChristian heritage.” Still another was Charles E. Rice, a member of the national advisory board of the United States Coalition for Life. Mr. Rice, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, assailed not only Mr. Rockefeller's “personal support of permissive abortion” but also his “involvement in the population control movement.” Urging Mr. Rockefeller's confirmation, at least in part because of his abortion stand was Assemblywoman Constance E. Cook, of New York, who sponsored the state's abortion bill. Mrs. Cook, a Republican from Ithaca, said Mr. Rockefeller had acted as “a responsible man of faith, of courage and of independent intellectual ability.” She called his veto of a bill repealing the abortion law, “an act of responsible leadership.” In addition, she said, she wanted to add her “personal full and unqualified endorsement” to his confirmation. Supporting her position was Carol Burris, president of the Women's Lobby, Inc., who said he “is a very good choice for Vice President because he has concerned himself with the problems of the silent majority—women.” Other witnesses appearing today included Curtis Dail, president of Liberty Lobby, an ultraconservative group, and J. George Frain, of Businessmen Affected Severely by the Yearly Action Plans, Inc., a smallbusinessmen's group protesting what it says are Rockefeller investments in urban renewal projects that displace small business and the poor. In addition, there were representatives from the National Lawyers Guild and the National Caucus of Labor Committees, in opposition to Mr. Rockefeller and of the Council of 100, black Republicans group, in support of his confirmation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Pope, at Synod Opening,",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/28/archives/pope-at-synod-opening-asks-church-for-courage-pope-paul-opens.html,"ROME, Sept. 27—Popp Paul VI opened the fourth Synod of Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church today With a prayer for the help of the Holy Spirit in carrying out the theme of the gathering, “evangelization in the modern world.” In a homily during mass in the Sistine Chapel, he called on the 208 members of the synod to face with courage “the ocean of incredulity, indifference and hostility” confronting the church. “Let us not be paralyzed by fear,” he declared. The Pope urged the faithful not to reduce their. action “to mere sociological or political activity and the mission of the church” to a temporal message. He warned, against methods “in open conflict with the spirit of the Gospel—neither violence, therefore, nor revolution, nor, colonialism in any form.” Het warned also against “politics for its own sake,” although he said it was the duty of Christians to make their contribution to public administration. The Pope also opened the synod's first working session seven hours later in the Vatican's modern audience hall. The synod members, who include 143 bishops, 17 cardinals from the Roman Curia and 14 patriarchs and metropolitans from the Eastern, rites, are to discuss, the experiences of evangelization through Oct. 7. From then until Oct. 16, they are to take up the theology of bringing the Gospel to the world. The remainder of the synod, which is scheduled to, end Oct. 26, is to be devoted principally to drawing up nonbinding pastoral proposals to be presented to the Pope. The 77‐year‐old Pope, gently supported up and down steps, was principal celebrant at the mass in the Sistine Chapel. He was assisted by the three cardinals he has appointed to serve as synod presidents: Franz Kiinig of Austria, Juan Lanciazuri Ricketts of Peru and Paul Zoungrana of Upper Volta. As the synod began its first working session, Cardinal Konig congratulated the Pope on his 77th birthday yesterday. Of fmicrophone, the Pope, replied, “Senectus ipsa est’ morbus""—“old age is my illness.” The quotation is from “I Promessi Sposi,” or “The Betrothed,” the 19th‐century romantic novel by Alessandro Manzonl. In Mansoni's book, an old priest uses the phrase to the young couple of the title. ‘Signs of Strength’ Summarizing church activities since the last synod in 1971, Archbishop Aloisio LorScheider of Brazil said that the national conferences of bishops had been more articulate in noting problems than in recounting thing's that were going Nell. “There are signs of strength and vigor in the church,” he said. Among the problems of he church, he said, are rigidity of the liturgy, insufficient coordination between Rome and churches abroad, the status of narriage, free love, abortions, routh and workers who hav9 urned from organized religion, Ind relativism in moral values. Archbishop Lorscheider also poke of “a shortage of workers in the vineyard""—that is, a deline in pastoral vocations and in aging priesthood. Five bishops representing major language groups—Engish, French, German, Italian and Spanish‐Portuguese — are to report tomorrow on evangelitation in their areas. Archshop Joseph L. Bernardin of Cincinnati will speak for the dshops of North America, Ausralia and Oceania. Parish Life Criticized His report says that local hurches complain that parish life does not furnish true felowship of faith. He speaks of great confusion among parents and educators about how to ransmit faith to young people who are repelled by institutional religion. His report quotes Canadian bishops as speaking of a brutal, complete questioning of an emaciated faith. The shortage of priests, long characteristic Of, developing countries, has now appeared in bishop Bernardin reports, noting a sudden drop in the number of men entering the priesthood and abandonment of the ministry by large numbers. He adds that many’ of the priests who remain are undergoing an identity crisis. The work of evangelization will have to be shared by the laity, his report says. Archbishop Bernardin says that the conferences he represents maintain that ecumenism does not mean avoiding discussion of difficult issues and that these conferences re sist explaining the drop in con versions by the rise of ‘ecu‐, menism. The Synod of Bishops is an advisory body created after Ecumenical Council Vatican the general meeting of the church of 1962‐65. The council had called for the collegial government of the church, meaning, government by the Pope and bishops together. The first synod was held in 1967, the second in 1969 and the third in 1971. Sessions of the fourth synod are to be held six days a week, morning and afternoon. Many of the meetings will be broken up into language groups, with about 20 synod members in each group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why six million have deliberately chosen an ultimate form of contraception.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/29/archives/sterilization-why-six-million-have-deliberately-chosen-an-ultimate.html,"An extraordinary number of Americans—the current estimate is six million—have voluntarily had operations to make themselves sterile. They have shown a remarkable willingness to abandon less drastic and permanent methods of birth control and have sought deliberately to achieve the barrenness that once was considered a curse. According to the 1970 National Fertility Study, one‐sixth of all married couples in this country who were using contraception in that year had been sterilized. Among couples where the wife was between 30 and 44, sterilization was the most popular form of contraception used—it accounted for a quarter of all the couples in this age group. STERILIZATION This so astonished the Princeton University researchers who were tabulating the results that they ran their data through the computer again. But sterilization had, in fact, become that popular, surpassing the pill among order couples. The trend has continued: Since 1970, sterilizations have been perforined at an estimated rate of one million per year. And the operations have become more popular among young people, who finish having their smaller families at an earlier age than they used to. In places like India, where population growth a daily crisis, men are induced to undergo sterilization operations with offers of free food, radios, bicycles and stoves. They accept this package deal because of their extreme poverty, and the Government offers assembly‐line sterilization camps complete with door prizes because it doesn't seem able to reduce the growth rate any other way. But Americans who have chosen sterilization up to now have, for the most part, had incomes over $10,000 a year. Far from being urged by Government, they are often frustrated by state laws and hospital regulations, and often must be strongly motivated to overcome all the obstacles. In the last five years, in fact, sterilization has for many people become a form of salvation. Its popularity has grown despite publicized reports that sterilized rats developed cysts and shrinking testes, that sterilized men have reported masculinity problems and troublesome granulomas, and that other physical and psychological complications may follow the operations in either sex. Furthermore, the popularity of sterilization persists despite the hard reality that the operation is usually final. People who are sterilized must assume that they can never again produce a child. Why do so many Americans choose so absolute a method of contraception when no one is urging. them or offering them bribes, and the population growth of the United States, where the fertility rate has fallen to an average of 1.9 children per family, is apparently under control? The fact that a million people a year opt for this extreme form of birth control reflects, for the most part, a widespread disillusionment with the other methods, all of which are awkward, uncomfortable, messy, cause bleeding or other unpleasant side effects and, in most cases, place the burden of contraception on the woman. Despite their massive use, the failure rates of today's contraceptives as they are used are still too high. The 1970 National Fertility Study reported the following annual rates of failure over the preceding two decades: pill, 6 per cent; I.U.D., 12 per cent; condom, 18 per cent; diaphragm, 23 per cent; foam, 31 per cent; rhythm, 33 per cent, and douche, 39 per cent. Unwanted pregnancies, as a result, have been epidemic. It is estimated that one‐third couples who did not want another child and who were using some form of contraception to prevent it conceived within five years—a fact that surely contributes to the million abortions performed each. year. Increased interest In sterilization also results from the development of laparoscopy, a technique for sterilizing women that is increasingly replacing the conventional tubal ligation, where the abdomen is cut open and the Fallopian tubes tied. The laparoscopy involves locating the tubes with a visualizing instrument and cauterizing them with a forceps, both inserted through small incisions in the abdomen. It eliminates the expense, trauma, major surgery and long convalescence of a tubal ligation. Since this new method has become available, there has been a shift in proportions choosing each operation. According to the Association for Voluntary Sterilization, a nonprofit, educational and research group, of the million people sterilized in 1971, 80 per cent were men and 20 per cent were women. By 1973, a smaller proportion (57 per cent) were men and more than double (43 per cent) were But there are also larger reasons for the sudden growth in acceptance of sterilization, and they tend to reflect shifting attitudes of the past few years. W.B., 34 and the father of two girls aged 2 and 5, explained that he had not made a sudden decision to have himself sterilized. He and his wife had been thinking about it for two years. Their motives are shared by many other couples. The W.B.'s are concerned about being able to care for the children they already have. They are also worried about the world's population growth and the consumption of resources. “I'm thinking of my children's future. Even if they could afford everything, it's... well, it's a finite world.” Then, he admitted, as much as he loves his two children, “kids tie you down and are lots of work.” His wife told me she wants to be certain she never has to have an abortion, and they both said they want to enjoy their sex life more, they want more spontaneity; they are tired of concerns with contraceptives and pregnancy. “We don't like the idea of sterilization, but of all the possibilities, it's the least of all evils,” said Mrs. W.B. She has been using the pill and doesn't think it is a good idea to continue it over a long period of time. However, she added, “My husband decided to have the operation because he was more definite about not increasing our family, and we thought the person who was more concerned should be the one to do.something about it.” They had thought about the possibility of losing one of their children after giving up the ability to conceive another. But they decided that if they wanted another, N.J., 42 and the mother of two girls aged 15 and 17, has gone back to school and is planning career as a clinical psychologist. She told me she wanted a laparoscopy because she wanted to stop taking the pill. “I don't want to continue to disrupt the chemical balance of my body. I've known since the day my last child was born that I didn't want any more children. I have always wanted only two. Even if I remarry” (she is expecting her divorce shortly), “I'm not concerned with having more children. I don't want more. And there is no question that I will enjoy sex more without the threat of pregnancy. I'm really doing this for myself. For me. A separate person. For my health and my enjoyment of sex.” Despite its popularity, misconceptions persist about this procedure and how it works. In the male, the cutting of the vas deferens tubes—the vasectomy—prevents sperm from traveling up the vas deferens from the testes, where it is manufactured, to the urethra, where during ejaculation it mixes with fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate. After the operation, sperm cells continue to form, but they never complete their journey up the vas. Instead, they are attacked by antibodies that defend the body against foreign intruders and are carried away by the white blood cells. During intercourse, the same amount of fluid is released, the sensations and pulsations are the same, the ejaculate looks and feels as it did before. But examination under the microscope will show that 300 million to 400 million sperm are missing. In the female, the Fallopian tubes down which the microscopic egg travels every month from the ovary are cut or cauterized so that the egg never reaches the uterus for its rendezvous with the sperm. The unfertilized egg dies and dissolves in the tube. In the female as in the male, all the processes are the same as before sterilization. The eggs ripen and the woman continues to menstruate as her hormones prepare the uterus for a possible pregnancy each month. Her sexual sensations and appetites are no different and may even become stronger as she no longer fears pregnancy. For his vasectomy, W. B. lay partially nude on the long examining table in his doctor's office, his groin shaved, and his scrotum, Surrounded by sterile drapes, smeared with an antiseptic iodine compound. Lifting W.B.'s right testicle in his hands, Dr. Stanley Rosenberg carefully injected an anesthetic, something like the dentist's Novocain, under the skin, then deeper into the sheath of the vas deferens. There was supposed to be a split‐second sting, which W.B. did not seem to feel. He had propped his head on his arm to observe his own operation. As the area became numb, Dr. Rosenberg made a half‐inch incision in the scrotum. Through it he pulled a small section of the vas deferens, an 18‐inch spaghetti‐like tube, and tied it in two places with catgut; then a half‐inch piece of the tube between the knots was cut out. The remaining ends were deftly turned away from each other and tied. The gut would be absorbed by the body, leaving the vas closed and separated. The incision was stitched and the process repeated on the other side. W. B. felt no pain, only a slight tugging sensation as the tubes had been lifted out. At the conclusion of the operation, Dr. Rosenberg assured W. B. that what he had done was certain to make a “vas deferens” in his life. Everybody laughed. W. B. rested for half an hour, put on the For her laparoscopy, N. J. was wheeled into the operating room of a small hospital, and an anesthesiologist administered a drug that paralyzed her so that a machine could do her breathing and her body could lie inert. While she slept, her legs were placed in stirrups, and she was draped in green sterile sheets. Dr. J. Anthony Dede swabbed her abdomen with iodine and soap, and with an instrument placed in her vagina he grasped her cervix so that during the operation he would be able to manuever both it and the attached uterus. Twoand‐a‐half liters of carbon dioxide were pumped through a needle into the abdomen until its walls were raised away from her intestines and other organs, ironically making N.J. appear about five months pregnant. Through her navel, Dr. Dede inserted a laparoscope, and through a one‐inch incision farther down her belly, (Continued on Page 80) he placed the Teflon‐coated forceps that would carry high intensity radio waves to cauterize and destroy small sections of the Fallopian tubes. The remarkabe laparoscope, a lens surrounded by 10,000 separately coated microscopic glass rods capable of transferring light but not heat, enabled Dr. Dede to look into the depths of N.J.'s abdomen without opening it up. He could see clearly the white ovaries and pink Fallopian tubes, alive, vital and glistening in their opulent, pillowy chamber, never before exposed to intrusion from another world. When he had visually located one tube, he held it with his forceps and burned it in two places until it paled and the tissues were destroyed. The uterus was rotated and the other tube was burned in two places. Then, in rapid succession, the instruments were removed, the carbon dioxide escaped, the belly collapsed like a punctured balloon, the navel and tiny incision were stitched with catgut, a BandAid was placed over the stitches (hence the name “Band‐Aid operation”), the patient started breathing herself, and the laparoscopy was Some of the pros and cons of sterilization are obvious. it is cheap (when compared with 20 years of contraceptives and doctor visits), speedy (about 20 ‘minutes), safe, convenient, effective. It is a permanent, one‐time method. There is no need to repeat anything; it eliminates buying contraceptives and remembering to use them. It is almost perfect, with a failure rate of less than 1 per cent for men, and between 1 and 2 per cent for women. And this includes the unusual cases of women who are pregnant before the operation and men who have an extra vas on one side that continues to The disadvantages of sterilization are that it necessitates an immediate expense (male, $50‐$200; female, $500), and protection for the male is not immediate—it takes about 12 ejaculations to empty his reservoirs until his sperm count is zero, and contraception must usually be continued for this period. For the woman it means having a general anesthetic and an overnight stay in the hospital (laparoscopy is being done on a less expensive, out‐patient basis at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere). For most men there is slight temporary pain, and about 1 per cent may experience infection or bleeding. In from 1 to 5 per cent of cases, granulomas — uncomfortable but treatable swellings — are caused by sperm leakage from the ends of the tied vas tubes. In less than 1 per cent of cases, the granulomas can cause the spontaneous recanalization of the cut tubes, opening up a passage for the sperm to make its way into the ejaculate once again. The complications for women are also rare — around 1 per cent—and much depends on the skill of the doctor. However, when they exist, they may involve gas under the skin (which disappears very quickly), bleeding, infection, temporary irregular heartbeat, electrical skin burns or bowel puncture. The major disadvantage is that you can't change your mind. In 50 to 80 per cent of mains the operation can be reversed in a more expensive, difficult, uncomfortable procedure, but in such cases a return to fertility cannot be guaranteed, because the antibodies that attack unused sperm during the period of sterility continue to function. Thus, even though the sperm's ability to travel up the vas deferens has been restored, there is only a 10 to 25 per cant chance that it will be viable enough to fertilize an egg. The laparoscopy cannot be reversed, although when the Fallopian tubes have been tied off surgically — in the tubal ligation performed most often just after childbirth—=it is sometimes possible to re But this very permanence, along with the new popularity of sterilization, raises a basic health question: Are the long‐range effects of sterilization either physically or psychologically harmful for a man or a woman? The problem with finding answers is that most clinical studies are done on animals, most are poorly designed, none provide follow‐ups over a long period of 10 to 20 years. Studies on psychological aspects are small, often include people with unrelated psychiatric ailments and, in the case of women, fail to differentiate among those who are sterilized after a Caesarean, an abortion, a hysterectomy, for medical reasons or for contraceptive reasons. The result is that physicians and psychiatrists disagree, the physi cians being mostly for, and the psychiatrists mostly against, sterilization. The psychiatrists and their colleagues are critical of each other's studies and contradictory findings are often announced with great authority. Two studies on the possible harmful physical effects of male sterilization created much alarm. In 1968, Dr. if. J. Roberts, director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research, published reports of a handful of case histories in which vasectomized patients subsequently developed serious diseases such as thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolisms, lymph node enlargement and multiple sclerosis. Dr. Roberts suggested these were caused by sperm antibodies, inflammation from trapped sperm and a hormonal imbalance as a result of the operation. A second disturbing report was published in 1973 by Dr. Arthur M. Sackler and colleagues at New York Medical College. They found, after a seven‐month study of immature sterilized rats, that the weight of the testes decreased, they became purplish, small and soft, and cysts developed in the region of the testes. Other researchers have reported finding granulomas, the tender, swollen nodules in the testes of men. The suggestion was also made that antibodies in the blood that attack sperm might attack other organs of the body as well. Although antibodies are found in the blood of half the men who have been vasectomized, no one yet understands their significance, or why some men have them and some don't. And no widespread pathology has been detected in vasectomized men, despite Dr. Roberts's reports. Furthermore, since there is no animal whose testicular, hormonal or immunological reactions to a vasectomy resemble those in man, the rat experiments seem irrelevant. This is the opinion of Dr. Philip Roen, professor of urology at New York Medical College, whose comment on the study was, immature rats!” Dr. J. Michael Bedford of New York Hospital‐Cornell Medical Center said, “These reports are not substantiated by the mass of experience in vasectomy. Sperm antibodies are produced in some men, but it seems highly unlikely they cause any prqblems. There is no remote guarantee,” he went on, “that the illness of Dr. Roberts's patients had anything to do with their vasectomies. The sperm that continue to be produced are carried away by the white blood cells. Perhaps a very few men may be susceptible to the effects of a vasectomy, perhaps 2 per cent. Men have been vasectomized for half a century. Obviously, for the majority there are no ill effects.” He added, “In, spite of the animal experiments, I'd have a vasectomy if Currently the Center for Population Research at the National Institutes of Health is funding 13 research projects whose results are expected in two to three years. One interesting preliminary finding showed that one kind of sperm antibody has appeared in 50 per cent of the men studied before their vasectomy. On the psychological side, men have feared castration, impotence, dry ejaculation and a soprano voice as a result of sterilization. The comment of a graduate of the Harvard Business School was typical: “If a surgeon ever got that close to my genitals with a knife, the fright alone would sterilize me for life.” Some people still believe these fantasies, and many psychiatrists continue to believe that men have unconscious fears of genital mutilation, and if sterilized must develop some kind of crippling complex. True or not, there seems to be a tendency among certain investigators to blame whatever happens to a person after his sterilization—a decline in sex activity or a divorce—on the fact of the One of the most often cited investigations, and one that has caused serious doubts, was reported in 1969 by Dr. Fredrick J. Ziegler and Dr. David A. Rodgers of the Cleveland Clinic, and Dr. Robert J. Prentiss of the University of California, San Diego. This was a four‐year, controlled study that compared a small, sample of 37 vasectomized husbands and their wives with a group of 37 couples who relied on the pill. Results after two years were quite negative. The vasectomized men and. their wives had more psycho logical problems than the pill couples and rated their marriages less positively. It seemed that vasectomy was causing marital stress. But when the couples were tested after another two years, things had changed. After four years, both vasectomy couples and pill couples rated their marriages the same, their frequency of intercourse the same, and an equal number of men ‘in each group reported problems with impotence, premature ejaculation and sex drive. Dr. Ziegler believes that the men may have had real problems that they learned to cope with in time. He did notice an increase in “masculine ‐confirming” behavior vasectomized In another study by Lois D. Janke and Dr. William M. Wiest of Reed College, another small sample of 33 vasectomized men who were subscribers to the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in Portland, Ore., were studied along with a control group. It was found that the vasectomized men suffered no greater degree of marital, job or general living stress than those in the matched control group. In fact, these researchers found the psychosocial adjustment of the vasectomized men superior to that of the men who had been using other methods of birth control. Dr. Wiest assumes this is because anxiety over the risk of pregnancy was gone. They found no support for Dr. Ziegler's view that men exaggerate their masculinity to compensate for loss of the ability to impregnate. Wiest ironically questions whether observed castration fears are more real for the man or for The largest sample to be queitioned included more than 1,000 men in England a year or more after their vasectomies. This Simon Population Trust survey showed that 99 per cent of the men and their wives said their sex lives had improved or remained the same, more than 99 per cent said their marriages were more harinonious or the same and 99 per cent of the men and their wives reported no regrets. There are not as many studies of sterilized men as are needed, but there are even fewer of women, and they are flimsy. Most of. the research focuses on improvements in instruments and operating technique rather than on the woman herself. There are no reports of long‐range physical dangers, and though women have feared that sterilization would cause them to become frigid, lose their femininity, begin the menopause early, suffer loss of libido, get fat, or experience hormone‐related emotional problems, none of these appear to happen. In several small reports appearing in British medical journals, women who were followed for several years expressed unanimous delight with their operations, saying that they enjoyed freedom from fear of pregnancy; a few said they had experienced orgasm only since their sterilization, and some, quite candidly, admitted they no longer tried to avoid inter Still, in order to minimize regrets ‐and psychological complications, responsible doctors have been extremely cautious and do not sterilize people with unstable marriages, emotional instability, sexual problems, those being pressured by a spouse, those who don't fully understand the nature of the operation or those who are filled with youthful ideologies they may not be championing in future years. Dr. Roen, who has performed hundreds of vasectomies, carefully screens his patients, deciding if each is sincerely motivated. “I size him up,” he said. “If you accept the psychologically impaired, you later ‘have complaints. And I take a dim view of someone in his 20's doing it for the sake of sexual freedom.” Urologist James K. Varney believes a man should be 35 or over, have been married, and had children. “When was 30, I thought I knew everything, but now that I'm 40,” he said, “I realize I didn't know everything, but you never could have convinced me of that then. I refuse to do vasectomies on, very young men,” he went on, “even though it's a form of making a judgment, playing God.” Perhaps the most adamant comment on the subject comes from David and Helen Wolfers of Columbia University, who are critical of what they term “vasectomania.” They believe young vasectomized men are “destined to become a bitter bank of outcasts, disqualified from the joys and responsibilities of normal men by an hour's surrender to the voice of the death wish.” They are against vasectomy for childless, healthy men of less than 25 who have not been married (or lived with the same woman) for at least three However, the Associa tion for Voluntary Sterilization says it wants “to make voluntary sterilization freely available to all Americans aged 21 or over, with children or no children, married or single.” A.V.S. director Dr. Ira Lubell feels that “it's a difficult question. I'd like to see people wait a year after deciding. However, I don't see where marriage has any role; and some people are adamant that they don't want any children. It's up to the doctor to screen them well. Some people at 19 are more mature than other people at 35 will ever be.” This concerned attitude has avoided many mistakes, but some doctors and hospitals have been leaning over backwards to make sure that they sterilize only the people they think ought to be sterilized, despite the fact that the operations are legal everywhere in the United States, are accepted for payment by Blue Cross and Medicaid, and have received the blessing of the American Medical Association. Before 1969, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology had suggested that sterilization be performed according to an arbitrary formula involving age and number of children. It was called the rule of 120. A woman's age multiplied by the number of her children had to total 120, or she could not be sterilized: Thus a woman of 25 with four children could not be sterilized. and one of 40 with two children could not either. Now the college advises that sterilization should be performed on “anyone legally capable of giving the obstetrician‐gynecologist permission to operate on her.” Nevertheless, some states have passed laws concerning age, marital status and waiting period, some hospital boards have made their own rules, and some ‘doctors their own formulas. Almost everyone insists on having the signed, informed consent of the spouse. (On.the morning of N. J.'s laparoscopy, the staff stood more or less poised with instruments in hand while the patient, who had been separated from her husband for two years, arranged for him to sign his consent for her operation, something he hadn't even known about before his telephone rang.) sterilizations has caused a certain amount of legal controversy. Many lawyers feel that consent of the spouse is an unnecessary requirement imposed by doctors and hos pitals who fear lawsuits. Dr. Clifford R. Wheeless Jr. at Johns Hopkins says, “There has never been a successful lawsuit against a doctor for doing a sterilization on a patient who asked for it, and I can't imagine a modern court upholding such a complaint. It would be like saying the marriage contract transfers certain parts of the woman's body to the man—the man owns them. I believe her tubes belong to her.” Planned Parenthood clinics do not require consent of the spouse, and it is not legally necessary in New York or most states, despite frequent requests for it. In specific cases certain hospitals have been ordered not to demand such consent. Since the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, the feeling seems to be that if you have the right to control your body for abortion, you ought to have the right to control it for sterilization. (Of course, it is unquestionably important to discuss sterilization with spouse, and if it is done against his or her wishes, this might be considered grounds for divorce.) There have been cases where women who were refused sterilization by a hos pital sued to force the hospital to sterilize them. Mrs. Linda McCabe, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the Nassau County Medical Center in 1971 when it refused to allow her to be sterilized because she was 25 and had only four children. The hospital finally reversed its position. And Mrs. Janet S. Stein, 29 and mother of three, also sued through the Civil Liberties Union and won the right to be sterilized as well as $2,000 in damages from the Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. Informed consent for a voluntary operation became a widely publicized moral issue last year in Montgomery, Ala., when two young black sisters, Minnie Reif, 14, and Mary Alice Relf, 12, who is retarded, were sterilized in a federally funded birth‐control clinic. The girls’ parents sued the Government, insisting they had not given their consent and believed the girls were being taken to the hospital for their periodic injections of Depo Provera (a drug later banned for contraception because of undesirable side effects). Judge Gerhard A. Gesell found evidence that poor pco ple, particularly pregnant women whose deliveries came under Medicaid, were forced to accept sterilization under threat of losing their welfare benefits. He ordered that Federal funds no longer be used for sterilizing minors or mental incompetents. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare is appealing the case and devising a new set of guidelines that should remedy the situation. In the past, 100,000 to 150,000 people have been sterilized annually with Federal funds. Statistics are limited, but H.E.W. estimates that in 1972 this included 2,000 to 3,000 under 21, and 200 to 300 under 18. Since it is often difficult to tell whether a child is culturally deprived or mentally retarded, the decision to sterilize a minor is an exserious The Relf case brought to light a string of abuses. For example, an obstetrician in Aiken, S. C., Dr. Clovis Pierce, is reported to have told pregnant women receiving Medicaid, and who already had several children, that they would have to agree to be sterilized or he would not deliver their babies. He defended this policy by citing the heavy tax burden created by welfare patients. According to Joseph Levin, Jr., lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, who handled the Relf case, this kind of pressure is not unusual. He gave as an example the case of a public hospital in Los Angeles that has sterilized more than 100 Chicano women who, though they speak only Spanish, were given consent papers in English to sign. A doctor is reported to have told Levin, “Every time you get a sterilization, it means two more tubes for some interne to practice on.” Levin says sterilization is pushed heavily in public hospitals across the country, and some women simply do not know what is being This view was supported by one of Ralph Nader's groups, which discovered that sterilization is promoted in large city hospitals in Baltimore, New Orleans, Chicago and elsewhere. In addition, half the states in the country have laws allowing the forced sterilization of mental incompetents. Mississippi, for example, can sterilize “certain hospital inmates with incurable conditions,” and Georgia sterilizes those whom it judges are “incurably men tally incompetent.” Some states have used sterilization as a prerequisite for release from prison or other institutions. The vast majority of sterilizations remain voluntary, however, and for those who would like to see this methodof birth control become even more acceptable, the future holds some promise. Researchers are seeking ways to make vasectomies completely reversible, perhaps by perfecting a removable plug or minivalve that might be installed in the vas deferens. They also hope to find suppressants to counteract the male antibodies, so that after reversal the sperm would be capable of fertilization. In the meantime, one company in New York, IDANT Corp., offers a small amount of insurance through its sperm. bank. It has been freezing semen since 1971 and has 5,000 sperm deposits, mostly from men who have subsequently undergone vasectomies. Within two hours of ejaculation, the semen is mixed with glycerol and a balanced salt and egg‐yolk solution to protect it in the freezing process. It is then stored in liquid nitrogen at minus 321 degrees F. Although human semen has been successfully kept for as long as 10 years, and children have been conceived with thawed‐out sperm, freezing weakens or destroys large numbers of sperm, and the longer it is frozen, the weaker the sample of semen may become. So although a deposit in a sperm bank offers some extra latitude in changing Research on female methods includes further experimentation on hysteroscopy, where the tubes are reached through the cervix and no incision is involved; on silver clips; on chemicals and plugs that will obstruct the tubes, and on better electrocautery techniques. In fact, current research might eventually make it feasible for men. and women to be sterilized automatically at the onset of puberty and present themselves for reversal only when they wish to have a child. The prospect of such rational control over one's own biology and destiny may seem startling, yet the personal and social forces causing an average of 3,000 men and women a day to seek sterilization suggest that is where we are heading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehnquist Says ‘Benefit Programs’ Threaten Privacy More Than Crime Data Do,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/29/archives/rehnquist-says-benefit-programs-threaten-privacy-more-than-crime.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 —Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist has urged advocates of the right of, privacy to fight expanded government regulation of citizens’ lives rather than seek preservation of secrecy that may hamper criminal law enforcement. In two lectures delivered at the University of Kansas law school this week, the Supreme Court Justice questioned efforts to limit the circulation of criminal records as an invasion of personal privacy. Mr. Rehnquist suggested that the Secret Service would be justified in photographic surveillance of audiences at political rallies in an effort to detect a potential assassin, even though some sacrifice of privacy for others in the crowd would be involved. The Justice, one of the high court's leading conservatives, told his audience that “the increasing amount of government regulation and the larger numlber of government benefit programs” had resulted in “less privacy enjoyed by the individuals who live under that Government.” Move, to Repeal Laws “What I have in mind,” Justice Rehnquist said, “is that the fight for retention or expansion of privacy may be waged in the legislative halls not in terms of measures which would increase privacy but detract from effective law enforcement, but head‐on against the expansion of substantive government regulation of our lives. “A logical corollary of such an effort would be a countermovement dedicated to repeal of regulatory laws currently on the books,” he observed, noting that “some responsible opinion” favors decriminalizing prostitution, procuring and the use of marijuana. Without endorsing such proposals, Mr. Rehnquist said he believed “a very compelling argument can be made, that it is preferable to repeal a law which makes a particular act criminally punishable, rather than keeping the law on the books but making it very difficult to enforce against those who transgress it.” The Justice had little sympathy for those who would restrict the circulation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of arrest records to local law enforcement agencies on the ground of privacy. An arrest, he said, “is not a private event.” “I think it would be a rather bold person,” Mr. Rehnquist declared, “who would suggest that if one of the suspects in an investigation of a serious crime had a record of several arrests fns similar offenser, that sart of information would not be of significant help to the investigating authorities.” The question of whether ‘arrest records should be made available, outside the criminal justice system, to public and private employers “seems to me to be a closer one,” the Justice said. Issue of Manpower “To me the question posed by these situations is not an issue of core privacy since think as a policy matter it is quite justifiable for the Government to collect arrest data,” Mr. Rehnquist declared, “The question is simply whether or not the Government ought to spend its funds and use its manpower to supply this information to inquiring potential employers.” The Justice based his support for photographic surveillance of political rallies on the fact that Arthur Bremer, who attempted to assassinate Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1972, had been Observed at previous rallies in other parts of the country. “Given the extraordinary gravity and seriousness of the crime, should it be committed,” he said, “Lwould think that on the basis of our experience of the last decade or so the interest in trying to provide personal security to Presidents and Presidential candidates would outweigh the claim to privacy advanced on behalf of innocent spectators at a political rally.” ‘Justice Rehnquist expressed doubt that Supreme Court decisions legalizing the sale of birth‐control devices and all but end‐of‐term abortions actually involved the constitutionally protected “right of privacy” cited by the majority in both instances. “It would be far better to recognize that this sort of case involves a series of relationships which are thought to be sufficiently intimate’ that the Government is prohibited from substantively regulating then” he sad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/29/archives/letters-to-the-editor-on-binding-up-the-nations-wounds-the-food.html,"To the Editor: I find most disturbing Mr. Ford's appropriation of our Great Emancipator's words “binding up the nation's wounds.” Following those “five days in August”—and more grateful than ever for our Heaven‐blessed Constitution—we had felt so wonderfully healed of what had seemed for so long like a mortal wound. After overcoming that ordeal, we'd forgive anybody! Then came that premature, and vacuous, “pardon,” On the heels of this excruciating blunder came the infuriating proposal. What artless adviser, or artful agitator, could have put together for the approval of a President—so appointed—that request for $850,000 (including “tamper‐proof vault with 24‐hour guard” over nothing as far as We the People were concerned: only blasphemy and obscenity!) to underwrite the first eleven months in “exile” of a Commander in Chief who deserted our Ship of State in disgrace after receiving‐a “dishonorable discharge” (if ever one has been issued in our Federalized history) by, our Congress. I must say, as a Republican woman farther into her sixties, that on the heels of this pair of actions I find revolting this extravagantly overpoliticized President's and Great Agitator's offer of “amnesty” (to be “earned” by up to 24 months of alternative “public service”) to young American men who either knew they should avoid participation in a war so evil that their Congress could never bring itself to declare it forthrightly over a period of twelve years or, once participating in it, could no longer stomach what they had so deviously been led into and were being expected to fight, endlessly. With those broken promises of 1964 and 1968 fresh in our minds (including that secret nostrum finally applied five years later—at Christmas time, with sickening brutality and in the name of “peace with honor”), the fact remains—and plainer than ever as this all‐but‐mortal wound is reopened—that without such resistance on the part of its youth our nation would still be fighting, in Burma or Bangladesh by now. I fail to see, or feel, how any one of these three actions has the effect of “binding up [our] nation's wounds.” In fact, with our soaring crime, these young Americans should remain in their deserved exile until their homeland can restore its original sanity—and reclaim that once very common decency, out of which they were manifestly bred. Clearly, in our as yet‐unsettled “evil upheaval” of the past thirteen years, the old scum persists in masquerading as our fresh cream. MARY MENZIES Goleta, Calif., Sept, 20, 1974 Adam Smith's Message To the Editor: Assume, if you will, that Adam Smith, the great eighteenth‐century theorist of capitalism, were asked by President Ford to attend the next summit conference of economists to discuss inflation. Witat might he say? No doubt he would quote himself, “Wealth of Nations,” Book One, Chapter IX: “Our Merchants and master‐manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains, They complain only of those of other people.” ISAAC KRAMNICK Ithaca, N. Y., Sept. 19, 1974 The Food Weapon To the Editor: In his United Nations speech on Sept. 18, President Ford said, “It hai not been our policy to use food as a political weapon.” Yet the U.S. apparently stopped large‐scale food assistance to Chile after the election of Salvador Allende to the Presidency and then resumed it soon after a repressive military dictatorship took over in the wake of a bloody coup. The recent report on Nutrition and the International Situation published’ by the U.S. Senate Committee on Nutrition states that in fispal year 1974 “more than 50 per cent of Food for Peace Shipments went to politicalmilitary related countries such as Viet. nam, Laos, Malta, Jordan and Israel.” In the same year South Vietnam received over 50 per cent of all fertilizer purchased by U.S.A.I.D. for its programs in developing countries. Where is the candor, openness and honesty which President Ford so recently pledged to us when he took office? MICHAEL C. LATHAM, M.D. Prof., International Nutrition, Cornell Ithaca, N. Y., Sept. 20, 1974 Eugene Debs, Verbatim To the Editor: In a letter on the “Nixon Myth,” which appeared in your issue of Sept, 22, Henry Beetle Hough ascribes as a direct quote from Eugene V. Debs a sentiment which Debs expressed, but in quite different words. What Debs said was: “While there is a lower class I am in it; While there is a criminal element I am of it; While there's a soul in prison I am not free.” DAVID I. ASHE New York, Sept 23, 1974 Large‐Denomination Currency: The Hefty Hoard To the Editor: In a recent letter, Walter Wilson advocated that “the Federal Government should consider a recall of largedenomination bills—say. $20 and higher—for a new bill issued in honor of our bicentennial.” Mr. Wilson suggests that “such a currency recall—Treasury or bank check payment for turnovers in excess of $100—would inconvenience a very small number of American citizens (a few hundred thousand at most) and require minimal administration.” I should like to point out a few of the disadvantages to Mr. Wilson's scheme. Since 1946, no large‐denomination currency ($500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000) has been printed in the United States, and since July 14, 1969, such currency has been actively pulled out of circulation by the Federal Reserve and by the Treasury. Yet there still are 584,283 pieces of such largebill currency outstanding. Since the first paper money was issued in 1861, the U. S. Government has never recalled any of its currency, a fact.which contributes to the desirability of holding our dollars. There are over $400 million currently being hoarded or held in collections by Americans in the form of bills $500 or larger. There are perhaps $2 billion held in such hoards in the form of $20, $50 and $100 notes. To force Americans to cash in these bills would be to convert a large amount of currency into transactions balances from its present use as speculative or asset balances. This could only have an inflationary impact on the economy. Finally, there are. a few of us romantics who just dig large‐denomination bills and other monetary memorabilia. I have spent several years and about $500 to find one of the 409 outstanding $10,000 bills that I could touch, fondle and show to my money and banking class. For Mr. Wilson “a twentieth‐century President might look better on a $50 bill than Ulysses Grant,” but there are more than a few of us who would rather see a picture of Salmon P. Chase than Richard Nixon any day. DANIEL A. MCGOWAN Professor of Hobart & William Smith Colleges Geneva, N. Y., Sept. 13, 1974 Our Brave New World To the Editor: Perhaps some young people have forgotten that hi 1932 Aldous Huxley wrote a wild, funny, apocalyptic novel called “Brave.New World.” In his “inSane. utopia” of the far‐distant future, Huxley prophesied that:  Marriage and the family would be eliminated. Sexual promiiculty would be the norm. Children would attend classes on Elementary Sex. All women would have supplies of contraceptive pills, and abortion centers would be available to all.  Human ova would be fertilized in test tubes (see recent news from England. Substitute “petrie dish” for test tube.)  Behavioral conditioning, employing. electric shocks, drugs and other stimuli, both pleisant end unpleasant, would become a major tool of the managers of society.  New drugs, more effective than alcohol, “euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant,” would allow “holidays from reality.”  Helicopters would rise from rooftop launching pads.  People would clothe themselves entirely in synthetic fabrics, “acetate” cloth, “viscose” fur and wool, leather “surrogate.”  Public announcements would constantly din into children's minds the society's need for more consumption (“I do love flying, I do love having new clothes... we always throw away old clothes.”) If all these predictions arb not proof enough of the divine inspiration under which Huxley labored, consider this one feature of the book: In “Brave New World” people swear by “Our Ford,” talk about “this year of our Ford 602,” and say, “Oh, for Ford's sake!” Now that the Oval Office has happy new proprietor, Huxley's vision is surely complete. As one of his characters exclaims, “Ford's in his flivver, all's right with the world!” DOROTHEA WENDER Norton, Mass., Sept. 3, 1974 Communism's Helpers To the Editor: There is a popular call for freedom to emigrate and for freedom from harassment for Soviet citizens seeking to emigrate. While emphasizing this aspect of our relations with the U.S.S.R., we are overlooking another at least equally significant aspect of such relations. I refer to the proposed amendments to the Trade Reform Act that would authorize our technical, industrial and fiscal aid in promoting the industrial growth of the Soviet Union. Were this growth intended and used primarily to raise the standard of living for the Soviet people, there should be little opposition. But the nature of the aid, and the terms on which it may be granted, would only strengthen the military‐industrial complex in this heartland of Communism. Not only would we in effect transform Siberia into an industrial “Ruhr” (as was done for Hitler), but we would be doing it in terms of interest on loans at rates half of what industry at home has to pay for growth capital. The cold‐war pendulum seems to have swung from the comic to the tragic. There was a time not so long ago when the “strategic list” of banned trade with the Communist world ranged from kimonas to locomotives. Now we are told that for the sake of détente we must promote trade with the U.S.S.R. Trade—when there is two‐way significance—does have a quieting effect on bilateral tensions, particularly when it is accompanied by humanitarian motivations that genuinely promote peace. There is little evidence of either in the current proposals and in the conduct of the U.S.S.R. Net there appears to be an almost obscene rush for corporate profits, particularly for multinational corporations, regardless of the national interest. Selling scrap metal to Japan did not prevent Pearl Harbor. It has been written that when American capitalism is about to be hung, an enterprising capitalist will sell the rope to the hangman—at a profit. MORTON STEINBERG Englewood, NJ., Sept. 18, 1974 How to Insult Ghana To the Editor: President Ford's nomination of Shirley Temple Black as Ambassador to Ghana is both a disgrace to American foreign policy and an insult to Ghana. After being nominated and then asked by the press what she knew about the country, she replied that she had just read an encyclopedia article, and the local newspaper had just carried a good story. Is such person the most qualified candidate to represent the United States in Ghana? To head an embassy? To carry out President Ford's policy there? Merely to ask these quitions is to illustrate the absurdity of the nomination. How would the American people feel if country X sent a former actress, an unsuccessful candidate for office but a campaign contributor as ambassador to Washington? We would treat the event as a joke, an aberration of that country's domestic political system, and disregard the person as a serious diplomat. A similar fate awaits Mrs. Black in Ghana. In recent years Congress has wisely begun to re‐examine its role in shaping America's foreign policy. The Senate should begin to use its confirmation power to insure that America's ambassadors are at least moderately qualified. There is no better place to begin than with Mrs. Black.

Obscurity Is Lifted From Campaign for Lieutenant Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/29/archives/obscurity-is-lifted-from-campaign-for-lieutenant-governor-closer-to.html,"The obscurity that traditionally haunts the campaign for Lieutenant Governor has been lifted from this year's two candidates, at least within their own camps. Far from being a figurehead candidate for the post, State ‘Senator Mary Anne Krupsak has been promised major roles in statewide Democratic strategy, legislative campaigning and her party's raid on Republican dissidents. At the same time, aides to the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Nassau County Executive Ralph G. Caso, say that lately — after an initial phase of being mostly ignored by the ticket's gubernatorial strategists—Mr. Caso's strengths as an Italian‐American and suburban specialist are being valued as the possible margin of victory in close race. ‘Closer to 8040’ “Before it felt like a 90‐10 relationship with [Governor] Wilson's guys,” one Caso worker said last week. “Now it's closer to 60.40 — they're giving us more staff, more attention, and there's even talk of having Ralph in one of the TV commercials. “Things changed when the Democrats failed to put an Italian on the ticket in the primary and when Wilson realized he was in trouble.” Since Senator Krupsak's Insurgent victory over two men in the Democratic primary, some of her partisans have been expecting a struggle to assure for her a strong role in the over‐all campaign controlled by aides of Representative Hugh L. Carey, the gubernatorial candidate. Two days after the Sept. 10 primary, however, Mr. Casey had made sure that the Krupsak staff—a dozen unsalaried volunteers working from a Manhattan apartment for much of the primary — had a fourth floor of space at his campaign headquarters at 518 Fifth Avenue. And the switchboard operators were instructed to greet callers with: “Carey‐Krupsak Headquarters.” More importantly to the 42‐year‐old Senator, she finds she is being treated not as some new‐wave feminist phenomenon but as the seasoned politician she is. Her roots go back to the Administration of Gov. W. Averell Harriman, which she served as a young counsel, and to repeated upset victories in her heavily Republican hometown area upstate in Canajoharie, After six years in the Legislature, she probably knows more about specific state problems than Mr. Carey does. But none of the Krupsak workers are bragging about this point—a measure of the good adjustment reported thus far between the two halves of the ticket. The Democrat strategists, too, are planning a TV commercial that includes the. Lieutenant Governor candidate. And because of, the number of Republican women who expressed support for her Democratic primary drive, the Senator will be a principal in the campaign's adjunct of “Republicans for Carey‐Krupsak.” One angle the Senator is pursuing in the latter cause is to win the final endorsement of Assemblyman Constance E. Cook of Ithaca, one of the most respected Republican women in the state, who took the unusual step of praising Senator Krupsak during the primary. Since then, Mrs. Cook has been noncommittal and Wilson workers reportedly have been pressing partisan loyalty on her. A Bullhorn and a Car Mr. Caso is a principal in the G.O.P.'s highly successful Nassau County wing and thus is accustomed to better conditions than the often obscure and thankles ways of being candidate for Lieutenant Governor to whom “the media” usually means a bullhorn and allnight auto treks. From his halfmillion‐dollar re‐election drive last year in which he bucked a post ‐Watergate Democratic tide in impressive fashion, Mr. Caso has been allotted well less than $100,000 for stumping the entire state. Both second‐spot candidates are finding that the Governor's slot gets fiscal priority because any amount the Lieutenant Governor candidate spends is subtracted from the combined maximum spending limit of $4.6‐million set by law for the two top spots on the ticket. The fruit of victory can have the same bland taste, for the Lieutenant Governor serves only to preside over the Senate—a rarely exciting task—and otherwise‐waits to stand in for the Governor, although often shouldering nonpublic political duties. Both candidates, like those of previous campaigns, speak of innovating in the $60,000‐a‐year post by reforming legislative procedures or maintaing closer ties witIr local government. ‘Palms’ and ‘Compares’ Just as Senator Krupsak's campaign has a core of ethnic politicking tailored to her Po‐, lish‐Amencan heritage — she will be guiding Mr. Carey about, the Pulaski Day parade today in Buffalo—so does Mr. Case's schedule make no secret of his heritage. He will visit at least 75 Italian'American events and places by election day. Lately the suburban politic!. an has been making references to the fact that he was born near the old Third Avenue El in Manhattan as the son of a grocer. Mr, Caso is not fluent in Italian, although his wife, Grace, is. But the candidate has been sprinkling his speeches — at least 10 New York events are planned each campaign week — with a “paisan” here and a “compare” there: Heritage is one thing, but gender is another topic, a ten der one that Mr. Caso has been wary of since his initial attempt at lightness in discussing the campaign's interesting aspect of male‐female rivalry. “Her campaign slogan is: ‘She's not one of the boys,’ ” Mr. Caso said to a Republican audience. “All you have to do, is look at her to see she's not one of the boys. I'm just won dering if she's one of the girls.” He got a good amount of laughter for the remark, but also a large number of Complaining letters and telephone calls. His aides “who are very contrite about the incident, say it underlines what they feel is more difficult problem: “How do we even make a simple, legitimate criticism of her without risking being called chauvinists?” One ,task Mr. Caso has tried lately is to point out differences over the abortion issue with Senator Krupsak, who, like him, is Roman Catholic. “I am against abortion. She voted in the Senate for abortion,” he says. This fits in with the G.O.P. middle‐roast strategy of trying to isolate the opposition as “liberal Democrats” Who would loosen family and budget ties. In the case of, Miss. Krupia who is married to Edwin Margolies, a ,quiet lawyer VAG works for the Assembly Democrats, the Republicans press this approach by tying her to “women's libbers” outside female mainstream and noting that she won the primary With 42 per oent—a minority—against two males. “Well I carried every county but Genesee in a three‐man race, and I won upstate by 60 per cent,” the Senator repllelo “That's hardly radical feminism.” Of abortion; ‘she defends her position in liberalizing ‘the law by arguing that Governor Wilson has played ‘politics with the issue and could have fought harder against’ it if he were sincere in his total:opposition. When Repulilic'ans_discuss Mr. Caso, they note that he is the chief executive of the prototypical postwar Republican suburb, and that comparable suburban flightS have been taking place around all the. major upstate cities. The suburbs are the key to the G.O.P: strategy and Mr. Caso was working statewide even before this campaign in his role as: leader of the legislative lobbying group of the dozen largest suburbs. Things have lprogressed to the point now, where an operative the the Caso camp—a man of Perhaps average male sensibilities and above‐average success in politics—could he heard the ‘other day arguing. against the notion of it feminist vote and saying: “It really is’ true—the appeal has ‘to be made to the voter on the basis of mind and not body,”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
State G.O.P. Committee Wilson's Top Contributor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/30/archives/state-gop-committee-wilsons-top-contributor.html,"The Republican State Committee is fast developing as Governor Wilson's counter to Edward M. Carey, Representative Hugh L. Carey's brother and chief angel. The Wilson campaign financial report filed with the State Board of Elections today shows a $200,000 state committee contribution to the Wilson campaign atop an earlier contribution of $350,000. James G. Hellmuth, a banker who is treasurer of the state committee as well as several Wilson committees, said that the state committee money came from individual contributions, the proceeds of the annual committee dinner and dues of the Governor's Club members — several hundred “fat cats” who donate at least $1,000 annually to the club. Mr. Hellmuth said that the state committee did not have a huge war chest that would be gradually transferred to Mr. Wilson's campaign. He said that unless new money came in, the $200,000 was the last of. the big contributions. The ample funds of the state committee demonstrate the value’ of a Nelson Rockefeller as a Governor and party patron and the importance of control of state government and its contracts to a political party. Bankers and other businessmen affected by state government are enthusiastic givers to the party in power. The Democratic State Committee, which has been shut out of Albany for the last 16 years, has a current bank balance of $32,000, according to the Democratic state chairman, Joseph F. Crangle, and a debt of $263,000 with many of the bills dating back years. If Mr. Carey had to depend on his party's state committee, he would be in sad fiscal shape. Instead he had a wealthy brother who contributed about $1‐million to the Carey campaign. Edward M. Carey is president of the New England Petroleum Corporation. For the first time in memory, the Democratic state ticket does not have a platform to run on. Party leaders and the state candidates decided not to build the platform because the various carpenters who would have to be consulted would probably take hammers to each other over such delicate issues as abortion and, amnesty. The party is so unified these days that even the liberal wing, which relishes arguments on issues, went along with the ditching of the platform, which is usually as appealing as a budget and read by about the same clientele as a budget. John V. Lindsay's first politicking after his return from a nine‐month hiatus in Europe was less than successful. Mr. Lindsay endorsed Howard J. Samuels, the loser in the Derh‐Ocratic gubernatorial primary, while a close ally of Mr.'Lindsay and his former deputy mayor, Richard R. Aurelio, was a behindthe‐scenes strategist for Mr. Samuels. Those moves will, not be helpful if, as many Democrats expect, Mr. Lindsay seeks the Senate nomination in 1976 and Mr. Carey is the Governor and titular leader of the party. Meanwhile, another Senate aspir‐ ant, Representative Ogden R. Reid, jumped aboard the Carey bandwagon just before the primary and is now organizing Westchester for the Representative's campaign. The first heralds of the 1976 Presidential campaign are being heard in the current election campaign in this area. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, for example, is obviously trying to liberalize his image by campaigning for at least two liberal Democratic Congressional candidates, Allard K. Lowenstein in Nassau County and Andrew Maguire in Bergen County. Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has his son, Steve, serving as the manager of his campaign for a fifth term. Steve Lefkowitz, 37, is general counsel to the state's Urban Development Corporation and is considered an expert on housing. Last year, Mayor Beame had his son, Bernard, running his campaign. Another father‐son combination is prominent in the Carey campaign. That's former Mayor Robert F. Wagner and his son. Councilman at Large, Robert F. Wagner Jr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Carey Would End Crangle's State Job,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/01/archives/carey-would-end-crangles-state-job.html,"ALBANY, Sept. 30—Guiding his running mates from one jubilant crowd of Democrats to another, Representative Hugh L. Carey promised today to remove his party's state chairman from the state government payroll if the public elected a Democratic ticket. Mr. Carey, his party's candidate for Governor, promised a purely political status, paid for by the party for the chairman, Joseph F. Crangle, who holds a $35,000‐a‐year appointive job as counsel to the Democratic leadership of the Assembly. Mr. Carey made the statements as he led the party's full state ticket on a five‐city tour, and promised “something totally different” in government and politics. Groups of 200 to 300 Democratic workers, assembled at each stop by party leaders, showed a noisy, pep‐rally enthusiasm that the candidate for Attorney General, Borough President Robert Abrams of the Bronx, termed “euphoria.” The four men and one woman on the state ticket seemed a confident group at newsconferences witnessed by groups of cheering partisans. Shoulder ‐ to ‐ shoulder, there was Ramsey Clark, candidate for the United States Senate, speaking of “staggering need and high opportunity” facing the voters. There was the 75‐year‐old Controller, Arthur Levitt, speaking of his expert knowledge of the job, and being urged to “talk louder, louder” by a nervous aide at the edge of one crowd. There was Mr. Abrams, maintaining his photogenic smile throughout the upstate tour. There was the candidate for Lieutenant Governor, State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, tolerating the band's renditions of the bawdy and presumably male‐chauvinist calypso tune, “All Day, All Night, Marianne,” and coming on stronger at each stop, demanding at one point that the Legislature be kept in session 365 days a year if necessary to accomplish reform. The head of the ticket, the 55 year‐old Mr. Carey, talked of party unity unknown “for a generation.” He said: “I feel and I hear and I sense a Democratic victory of great dimensions.” Mr. Carep professed to be unconcerned at possible overconfidence among party workers. When asked about estimates that he is the front‐runner in his contest with Senator Jacob K. Javits, he urged party workers to work “seven days a week” to assure victory. Mr. Carey kept to the attack on the Republicans, particularly former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and dealt briskly with attempts to portray differences among the Democrats. Asked whether he and Senator Krupsak had differences over abortion, Mr. Carey sought to stress the innovation of a woman's being on the ticket, and commented: “It's quite apparent to me that we're the only team run‐ning for Governor and Lieutenant Governor who can have an abortion and won't.” Mr. Carey barely mentioned his opponent, Governor Wilson, referring to him as Mr. Rockefeller's “unsuccessful succes‐I, sor.” Of Mr. Rockefeller, the Democrat drew repeated laughter by declaring that “he spent our money as if we had his money.” The line proved so popular thar that Senator Krupsak adopted it at one point. As for his view of the future of Mr. Crangle, the state Democratic chairman, which the candidate made at the first stop in Buffalo, Mr. Carey said: “There will be no official of this party carrying on a full‐time business and at the same time being a public paid official.” Throughout the tour, which, also took in Syracuse, Rochester and Utica, the Democrats emphasized unemployment as a major issue and repeatedly held the Republicans responsible for it. Tactically, though, it was the promises of unity that seemed to be an equally important theme. This even extended to a display of fellowship by Mr. Crangle and Assemblyman Arthur O.

Byrne Signs ‘Conscience’ Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/03/archives/byrne-signs-conscience-abortion-bill-governor-signs-right-to.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 2—Governor Byrne signed into law today the so‐called “right to conscience” abortion bill permitting physicians, nurses and hospitals to refuse to perform elective abortions, but he acknowledged that the controversial measure “may go too far.” The Governor said at a news conference that a veto of the bill, which cleared the Legislature after a stormy Assembly debate late in July, would “frustrate the wishes of our citizens.” At the same time, he conceded, allowing public, or nonreligious hospitals to refuse abortions raises serious constitutional issues which may be resolved in the courts.” Mr. Byrne made it clear that he had opposed extending the “right to conscience” expressed in the measure to any but hospitals with religious affiliations that opposed abortion on the grounds of principle or conscience. The Governor said that during the legislative debate on the measure, sponsored by State Senator Joseph L. McGahn, an Atlantic City Democrat and also a physician, he had opposed the inclusion of public hospitals from the application of the. “conscience” clause. But amendments allowing that exclusion were defeated, he said. The Governor cited the United States Supreme Court decision of January 1973, that “defined the right of any woman in consultation with her physician, to obtain an abortion.” The High Court held that the state could not interfere with that decision during the first trimester, or 12 weeks, of pregnancy, although state control over the second and third rimesters were permitted. Mr. Byrne referred, however, ??o a companion ruling by the Supreme Court, which found in ??t case involving a Georgia ??aw similar to the one he just ??igned that only religious hos??itals could qualify on the ground of “conscience” in reusing the perform abortions. The New Jersey law states that no person “shall be required to perform or assist in the performance of an abortion or sterilization” and that no hospital or other health care facility be required to provide services or procedures for such operations. And it adds that the refusal ??o provide those services or facilities shall not constitute grounds for “criminal liability, disciplinary action or discrimi??atory treatment.” The first test of the new ??aw's constitutionality may develop in weeks when a suit ??volving three South Jersey nonreligious hospitals is settled in State Superior Court in Cumberland County. A.C.L.U. Files Suit The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sued, on behalf of two unidentified women, to compel the Bridgeton Hospital Association of Bridgeton, the Salem County Hospital in Salem and the Newcomb Hospital of Vineland to perform elective abortions. The A.C.L.U. complained in its action that the three hospitals were in a region where adequate medical facilities were not otherwise available, especially if health complications developed or if the woman was in the critical period after the first trimester of pregnancy. The case is before Judge Herbert Horn, who is expected to rule this month. When the Governor was questioned about the possibility that the refusal of some hospitals to reject medically approved elective abortion services might create a hardship in areas where alternative hospitalization is not available, he replied: “I believe that any person who wants an abortion in New Jersey can get one.” The Governor, in another action announced at his news conference, signed an executive order transferring the State Energy Office to the State Board of Public Utility Commissioners. The order at the same time established a Cabinet Energy Committee, with the Governor as chairman, “to oversee all energy related decisions of state government and to coordinate with the Federal and local governments.” Other members of the committee, representing a broad spectrum of citizen interests, will be the Commissioners of Community Affairs, Environmental Protection and Labor and Industry. One of the objectives of the new organizational structure, the Governor said, is to assure that the several departments of the state government have a role in making decisions in the private use of energy. The Energy Office will continue to have stand‐by emergency powers. and administer. Federal allocation programs Mr. Byrne said. He promised that the new arrangement would bring greater efficiency and economy to “energy decision‐making.” One of the most critical energy problems facing New Jersey is the predicted shortage of natural gas, which the Governor said would reach a “highly critical” point in the winter months ahead. He said that the natural gas shortage in the state should be taken into account by the Federal Government in the allocation of other fuels for New Jersey. Asked about reports that a liquefied natural gas terminal was proposed for Woodbridge, in a highly industrialized and densely populated section of the state, Mr. Byrne said he did not believe that a terminal for the extremely volatile liequefied from of gas was intended there. He noted that the State Public Advocate had just intervened with the Federal Power Commission in a move to bar such construction in that region, and he added: “I don't want to expose our residents to the risk of annihilation for the storage of LNG [liquefied natural gas],”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most Women Want Status Improved, Poll Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/03/archives/most-women-want-status-improved-poll-finds-men-more-favorable.html,"A majority of American women now favor efforts to improve their status in society, according to a nationwide poll released yesterday. The poll, conducted by The Roper Organization, Inc., showed that 57 per cent of the women questioned now give a clear vote of confidence to efforts to change or strengthen their status, while only 25 per cent pre opposed. Four years ago, only 40 per cent of those polled supported such efforts, while 42 per cent were opposed. Two years ago, 48 per cent expressed such support and 36 per cent were opposed. “This does not mean most American women are fullfledged feminists,” said Burns W. Roper, whose organization conducted the third Vir“ginia Slims American Women's Opinion Poll. But it demonstrates that the general drive toward sexual equality is now a mainstream movement.” Men More Favorable The poll, which cost Philip Morris U.S.A. $100,000, also found that men continue to display greater enthusiasm for women's progress than women themselves. The poll indicated that 63 per cent of men support efforts to strengthen women's status in society, compared with 49 per cent in 1972 and 44 per cent in 1970. The latest survey was conducted last spring, with a total of 3,006 women and 1,002 men, aged 18 and over and drawn from a cross‐section of economic and educational levels, being questioned. Mr. Roper and his organization's vice president, Shirley Wilkins, who directed the poll, reported on their findings at a luncheon yesterday at the Park Lane Hotel. The Egalitarian Marriage Mr, Roper said that his pollsters found “a push for an egalitarian marriage,” with almost half (46 per cent) of the women surveyed preferring a marriage “where husband and wife share responsibilities more—both work, both share homemaking and child responsibilities.” More than half (52 per cent) of the women questioned said they wanted to combine a career with marriage and raising children, while 38 per cent said they preferred marriage and motherhood without a career. But marriage in either form, the survey indicated, remains the preferred way of life for 9 out of 10 women. Despite the wide attention given to alternate life styles, the survey found that very few members of either sex want to stay single and live alone (I per cent), or live in a commune (1 per cent) or live with someone of the opposite sex without marrying (1 per cent of women, 3 per cent of men). According to Miss Wilkins, while the vast majority of women are still committed to marriage as a way of ife, they are definitely not committed to continuing a bad marriage. “Marriage may march on,” she said, “but many marriages do not, and divorce is now accepted by a 3 to margin as a solution for an twsuccessful marriage.” Four years ago, she said, 52 per cent of the women queried found divorce an acceptable “out” for marital failure; the figure has now risen to 60 per cent, with 20 per cent opposed. And when a divorce does occur, only 1 in 4 thinks mothers should automatically get custody of the children, she said, And a clear majority (66 per cent) oppose alimony for a divorced woman who is able to earn a reasonable living for herself. As far as the so‐called “runaway mother” is concerned, two–thirds of the women interviewed and nearly seven‐eighths of the men questioned said they believe that the woman who walks out on her spouse and children deserves no more criticism than a man who walks out. In the feminist area, only 14 per cent of the women questioned prefer the title “Ms.” over Miss or Mrs., while 7 in 10 women reject the idea of a weekly wage being paid to housewives. On the other hand, more than half of the women polled said they feel that they are discriminated againstwhen they seek top jobs in business and government, and when they try to obtain loans, mortgages and charge accounts in their own names. Reject Second‐Class Idea “But women do not feel downtrodden, and they are not discouraged,” Mr. Roper said. “They may see themselves as having a harder time on the job front, but they reject the idea that they lead second‐class lives.” Nearly four out of five women polled said it takes as much intelligence and drive to bring up children properly as it takes to hold down a responsible position in business or government. And three out of four said that being a woman has not prevented them from doing the things they wanted to in life. In the area of morality, only little more than half of the women polled — 53 per cent — considered premarital sexual intercourse immoral compared with 65 per cent in 1970. And three out of four women oppose what they see as an unfair double moral standard for the sexes. In other social areas, attitudes would seem to have been altered dramatically, too. More than half of the women polled see no reason why a single man or woman should not adopt and raise a child, and nearly one‐third think there is no reason why single women should not give birth to their own children and raise them if they want to. By 50 per cent to 36 per cent, the women questioned do not want legalized abortion laws to be repealed, and they strongly believe, by 74 per cent to 15 per cent that where abortions are legal, the decision on whether. to proceed should be left to women and their doctors. And although two–thirds of the women surveyed still feel that a family's relocation depends on where the husband's jot is, 30 per cent of the women queried and 39 per cent of the men say that relocation should be considered if the wife is offered a good job, and that it “depends on who has the better job.” Copies of a 20‐page “mini” hook summing up the findings of the poll are available free of charge by writing: Virginia Slims American Women's Opinion Poll, Volume III, Philip Morris U.S.A., 100 Park Avenue, New York, N, Y., 10017. Mr. Roper, in discussing those qualities that the sexes look for in each other, noted that sex appeal is still one of the most admired female qualities. by one out of four men. “It seems that women's day as sex objects is not over—and that does not wholly upset me,” he said, to mild hisses from the largely female audience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Film Festival: Kluge's 'Part-Time Work of a Domestic Slave' and Chabrol's 'Bench of Desolation',https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/03/archives/film-festival-kluges-parttime-work-of-a-domestic-slave-and-chabrols.html,"She drops the plates, he glowers, the children wail, he says the house is a pigsty. He even reproaches her for the kind of bread she buys. He's furious when she leaves the house for work, and the children tend to build dangerous little fires in her absence. There's no apparent friendliness in this marriage—the man and woman seem to share only a nose-wrinkling disgust. As a chemist who prefers research to wageearning, he lets her support him by performing abortions—which he deplores.From the content, you might think that Alexander Kluge's ""Part-Time Work of a Domestic Slave""—which played Tuesday and last night at the New York Film Festival—is sympathetic to women's issues. And I suspect that the director may fancy himself a male feminist. However, ""Slave"" manages to be reactionary in several ways—partly because you can't possibly like either of these one-note characters: the wife (Alexandra Kluge, the director's sister) is presented as a dreary clod, and the husband (Franz Bronski) is just a grouch. The shallowness of the characterization, combined with the pretentious bleakness that runs throughout, results in a paralyzing pessimism that makes the lives depicted seem contemptible.There's an exceptionally grim abortion that should please the Friends of the Foetus — especially since this foetus quivers after it's removed. (Program notes state that the operation was simulated.) The patient appears to be dressed for a festive occasion (indeed, who would wear an off-the-shoulder blouse to her abortion?). It's hard to know what this scene is supposed to prove—unless it's a device to establish the director's toughness.The husband reluctantly takes a job, and the wife becomes a political activist. Most of the time, she's hopelessly inefficient, naive, and ineffective. Her social concerns are made to appear faddish, until she manages to rally the workers at her husband's firm against the management. Hence her husband—who doesn't like her politics—is fired. The conclusion implies that the effort for change is useless. All in all, the movie would be depressing if it weren't so dull.Also on the program is a marvelous adaptation of Henry James's ""The Bench of Desolation,"" directed by Claude Chabrol for television. A fastidious man is faced with a breach of promise suit by a woman who eventually makes him pay a sum that plummets him into a lifetime of debt and destroys his marriage.Years later, the woman reappears and offers to repay him—with interest. Her love and her revenge took the same form: of making money for him (and out of him), and of creating his need for her. She has blighted his life so that she may later have the chance to comfort him—that is, if he no longer loathes her.The James tale respects the pain of both characters—the rejected woman and the crippled man—while stressing her appalling ruthlessness and condemning the aptitude for suffering plus the dread of vulgarity that made him unable to defy her. (She's also the kind of controlling, semi-maternal figure that frightened James himself.)The movie is faithful to the original, and it's admirably performed. Catherine Samie achieves an extraordinary shift of character: early on, she's formidable, threatening in her upright posture; later, she's extremely touching, also acrid and sensitive by turns. Meanwhile, the contrast between Michel Duchaussoy's cautious glares and his moments of raw suffering fully express his sense of a wasted life. These people even have the pallor that James described, and the film is merely a small triumph for Mr. Chabrol.

Byrne Approves Bill Linking ‘Conscience’ To Elective Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/03/archives/byrne-approves-bill-linking-conscience-to-elective-abortion.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 2—Governor Byrne signed into law today the so‐called “right to conscience” abortion bill permitting physicians, nurses and hospitals to refuse to perform elective abortions, but he acknowledged that the controversial measure “may go too far.” The Governor said at a news conference that a veto of the bill, which cleared the Legislaature after a stormy Assembly debate late in July, would “frustrate the wishes of our citizens.” At the same time, he conceded, allowing public, or nonreligious hospitals to refuse abortions “raises serious constiutional issues which may be resolved in the courts.” Mr. Byrne made it clear that he had opposed extending the “right to conscience' expressed in the measure to any but hospitals with religious affiliations that opposed abortion on the grounds of principle or conscience. The Governor said that during the legislative debate on the measure, sponsored by State Senator Joseph L. McGahn, an Atlantic City Democrat and also a physician, he had opposed the inclusion of public hospitals from the application of the “conscience” clause. But amendments allowing that exclusion were defeated, he said. The Governor cited the United States Supreme Court decision of January 1973, that “defined the right of any woman, in consultation with her physician, to obtain an abortion.” The High Court held that the state could not interfere with that decision during the first trimester, or 12 weeks, of pregnancy, although state control over the second and third, trimesters were permitted. Mr. Byrne referred,however, to a companion ruling by the Supreme Court, which found in a case involving a Geogia law similar to the one he just signed that only religious hospitals could qualify on the ground of “conscience” in refusing to perform abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Governor Adds New Force in Old‐Style Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/05/archives/governor-adds-new-force-in-oldstyle-campaign.html,"On the rare days that he can relax at home, a high‐ranking state official likes to dress up in the kind of clothing he would never wear in public and show it off to a few old and trusted friends. Governor Malcolm Wilson, whose rumpsprung nineteen‐fifties sack suits, heavy brogues and narrow neckties have become symbolic of his conservatism, admitted during a campaign swing upstate last weekend that he was a closet Beau Brum “Mrs. Wilson is like my sisters when I was very young,” he said, asking for understanding. “They seem to like all men to change when styles change. Katherine has given me Christmas gifts of nice sports jackets with wide lapels and very colorful shirts and around the house I will wear them.” To display his new wardrobe in public, on the other hand, might be interpreted by the electorate as an attempt to change his image, he said. Since he was the same man he had always been during 35 years in state government, he continued, he would not consider it. “I follow the advice of Polonius,” he said. “‘To thine own self be true.’ Everyone does his or her own thing as he sees it. My whole style has always been to be totally candid, to say the tough thing, and not to pretend that there are simple answers to complex problems.” But a political campaign creates its own dynamic, and the weekend was to be the last in which the Governor maintained his tone of scholarly detachment, In the days that followed, under pressure from Republican leaders fearful of his defeat by Representative Hugh Carey, his Democratic opponent, Mr. Wilson became more aggressive and accusatory. The campaign swing began at the. Governor's large but by no means palatial Tudor brick home a block from the Bronx River Parkway near the Yonkers‐Scarsdale line. The 60‐year‐old Mr. Wilson who throughout his life has observed at least half of another of Polonius's injunctions—“neither a borrower nor a lender be”—mentioned that he had paid cash when he bought the house for $59,000 a decade ago. A state trooper bodyguard drove him to the Westchester County Airport in Purchase, while he leafed throug'h The Daily News—he said he had already read time day's Times—paying special attention to the political stories and the comic strips. At the airport he was joined by his ad ministrative assistant Joseph Kilgallen, and his stenotype reporter, Bernie Levine, who takes down his public utterances, for the flight to Albany in a state‐owned eightpassenger Beechcraft. “Have you got the proclamation, Joe?” the Governor asked, as he strapped himself in his seat. Mr. Kilgallen nodded. An hour later at the Colonie Center, a vast, covered shopping pall outside the capital, Mr. Wilson wasproclaiming with many “whereases” State Hunting and Fishing Day to a slim crowd of perhaps 100 people. He then bought state fishing license No. 1, producing the $4.20 fee — a dead loss since he hasn't fished in years—out of his own pocket. Next, escorted by a state police car, Mr. Wilson set out for Ghent, on the other side of the Hudson, where the Columbia County Republicans were having a luncheon. “Columbia was the first county to endorse Nelson Rockefeller when he first ran for governor in 1958,” Mr. Wilson said. “I had been taking him around the state, introducing him to people, and when the date of his announcement was set, I got Myrtie Tinklepaugh, who was the county chairman, to issue the endorsement the same day. You probably don't know that Mary Ann Knauss, the executive assistant to Dick Rosenbaum, the state chairman, is her daughter.” The county, like Dutchess to the south and Rensselaer to the north, was settled by Dutch farmers when New York was still New Amsterdam. Their influence can still be seen in gabled brick farmhouses, in place names like Kinderhook, Ghent and Valetie, and, less directly, in its rock‐ribbed Republicaton. Columbia regularly returns 75 to 80 per cent of its vote for any candidate the party puts before it. Its inhabitants like to boast that one reason Democrats are so scarce there is that they were hunted for sport back in the early days of the century. Among those awaiting him at. Kozel's Restaurant in Ghent were R. Burdett Bixby, the chairman of the state campaign committee, John Sharp, the county chairman, and Albert S. Callan, the publisher of The Chatham Courier, and his wife, Virginia, who is serving as Mrs, Wilson's campaign press secretary. “Columbia County is running this campaign and maybe that's the way it should be,” said Mr. Bixby jovially. “Besides me and Mary Ann Knauss and the Callans there's Brad Race, the upstate chairman, who is from Philmont.” Mr. Bixby, chairman of the Throughway Authority, is a veteran of gubernatorial campaigns going back to 1936. He also is a partner in the Wall Street law firm that Governor Thomas E. Dewey joined after leaving public office. After the cold roast been and potato salad had been consumed, Mr. Wilson gave a virtuoso display of small town politicking. He prefaced his remarks by acknowledging by name the presence of a couple of dozen present and former local leaders, recalled anecdotes about several, and cited projected county population growth figures. Then he sounded the major themes of his campaign. He cited his 35 years of experience in state government, including 20 years as an assemblyman, nearly 15 years as lieutenant governor and 10 months as governor. His Democratic opponent, Representative Hugh Carey, he reminded his listeners, did not have “five minutes” of experience either in state government or in an executive capacity. “The last time a congressman, his name was John Lindsay, got executive responsibility in the state,” he said, “he left New York City $1.5‐billion in the red.” As Governor he had appointed a “Little Hoover Commission,” he continued, to take a hard look at state government with a view to reducing expenses and, ultimately, taxes. “No one ever heard of a liberal Democrat like Mr. Carey ever doing either one,” he said. “We're getting more government than we need, than we want or can pay for,” he declared. Mr. Wilson expressed these views without much emotion. The Republican faithful applauded dutifully, but looked disappointed, like a man who had lost a good sneeze at the last instant. Party professionals who heard the speech and others he gave later that day and on Sunday in the Rochester area all said the same thing—that it wasn't going over. “fief's got to change his tactics,” said one elected official. “If you don't hit the pheasant with the first barrel, you pull the second. I'm damned if I know what he's doing up here, anyhow. He's got our votes. It's in New York and the suburbs that he ought to be campaigning.” There is also general agreement that Mr. Wilson is finding the habits of his 15 years as lieutenant governor hard to break. While Mr. Rockefeller concentrated on winning over swing voters in organized labor and in the suburbs, it was Mr. Wilson's assignment to smooth the feathers of upstate conservatives ruffled by enormous expenditures on such projects as the Albany Mall and the State University system, and of Roman Catholic voters outraged by Mr, Rockefeller's stands permitting liberal abortion laws and opposing aid to parochial education. A foreboding that 1974 will be a Democratic year, perhaps big enough to permit the party to take control of the Legislature, seems to be pervasive among Republicans even in such counties as Columbia and Greene, in the Catskills, where Mr. Wilson appeared at the $50‐a‐plate county committee dinner that night. It is reflected in a sharp falling off of contributions, Mr. Bixby said in an interview at his headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel a couple of days ago, “As of now,” he said, “we have raised less than $800,000 of a campaign budget of $4‐million.” To some extent, he believes, Republicans got out of the habit of giving during the Rockefeller years, knowing that the former Governor and his family who made announced contributions of more than $5‐million to the campaign in 1970, would make up any deficiencies. That night, driving from the Greene County Republican dinner to Albany, and then during a flight by chartered plane to Rochester, Mr. Wilson said that he would continue to appeal to his listeners intellect rather than their emotions, let the chips fall where they might. “That's the reason why won't—why it's impossible—I to pledge not to increase taxes, as, my opponent has done,” he said. “My gifted predecessor once campaigned in good faith saying there would be no tax increases. Then, as the fiscal realities developed, he had to ask the people for taxes. There's an old Chinese proverb—'Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me.'” Mr. Wilson, who was a debater and a student of Latin and Greek in his days at Fordham University, takes a craftsman's pride in the careful construction of his speeches, whether prepared or impromptu. Combined with his extensive knowledge of state government, this facility often leads him to spin out answers to even seemingly simple questions at great length and with arabesques of logic that might please the Jesuits who were his teachers. While he often refers to himself as “a brand new governor,” partly to disassociate himself with at least those aspects of the Rockefeller administration with which he was not in sympathy, Mr. Wilson says he has accomplished a good deal since taking office. At his urging, he said, the Legislature increased payments to welfare and unemployment compensation recipients and cut taxes by a total of $130‐million a year. He was also instrumental in providing $100‐million In emergency funding to the city to preserve the 35‐cent fare at least for the time being. On the minusside, some of his advisors acknowledge, was his failure to act decisively in setting up gasoline and fuel oil allocations during the period of shortage that occurred shortly after he took office, and his apparent lack of interest in what are usually called bold and innovative proposals. Mr. Wilson said he was well aware that anyone who talks about prudent government, about reserving the welfare rolls for the needy rather than the greedy—to quote a phrase he uses—and about reducing the cost of government, is bound to sound to many voters more like a skinflint banker than the man to lead the state during what are likely to be four difficult years. No matter, he said, staring hard at his questioner. “I always wanted to be governor and Nelson Rockefeller made it clear to me he wanted me to be his successor,” he said. “I felt that all conditions being equal I would be at least a candidate. I'm anxious to serve in my own right, but a victory achieved at the expense of deceit and false promises would be a Pyrrhic victory indeed.” He then explained, in response to a question, who Pyrrhus was. On Monday morning Mr. Wilson flew back to New York and it immediately became apparent that his tactics were changing. On television interview show he accused State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, of favoring “dirty pictures and dirty books” because she had voted against an anti‐pornography bill he favored. At Republican campaign headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel the word was out the next day that the Governor had decided to stop resisting the advice of his managers. The gloves, it was suggested, were coming off. On Wednesday, bidding for the support of the state convention of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O., he invoked the specter of rising crime turning New York City into a jungle and driving out businesses. “It takes a while to find yourself after being overshadowed for 15 years by the incredible brilliance of Nelson Rockefeller,” Burdell Bixby said. “But now I think Malcolm Wilson is finding himself. He's getting stronger every day.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His Democratic opponent, Representative Hugh Carey, he reminded his listeners, did not have “five minutes” of experience either in state government or in an executive capacity. “The last time a congressman, his name was John Lindsay, got executive responsibility in the state,” he said, “he left New York City $1.5‐billion in the red.” .As Governor he had appointed a “Little Hoover Commission,” he continued, to take a hard look at state government with a view to reducing expenses and, ultimately, taxes. “No one ever heard of a liberal Democrat like Mr. Carey ever doing either one,” he said. “We're getting more government than we need, than we want or can pay for,” he declared. Mr. Wilson expressed these views without much emotion. The Republican faithful applauded dutifully, but looked disappointed, like a man who had lost a good sneeze at the last instant. Party professionals who heard the speech and others he gave later that day and on Sunday in the Rochester area all said the same thing—that it wasn't going over. ‘He's Got to Change’ “He's got to change his tactics,” said one elected official. “If you don't hit the pheasant with the first barrel, you pull the second. I'm damned if I know what he's doing up here, anyhow. He's got our votes. It's in New York and the suburbs that he ought to be campaigning.” There is also general agreement that Mr. Wilson is finding the habits of his 15 years as lieutenant governor hard to break. While Mr. Rockefeller concentrated on winning over swing voters in organized labor and in the suburbs, it was Mr. Wilson's assignment to smooth the feathers of upstate conservatives ruffled by enormous expenditures on such projects as the Albany Mall and the State University system, and of Roman Catholic voters outraged by Mr, Rockefeller's stands permitting liberal abortion laws and opposing aid to parochial education. A foreboding that 1974 will be a Democratic year, perhaps big enough to permit the party to take control of the Legislature, seems to be pervasive among Republicans even in such counties as Columbia and Greene, in the Catskills, where Mr. Wilson appeared at the $50‐a‐plate county committee dinner that night. It is reflected in a sharp falling off of contributions, Mr. Bixby said in an interview at his headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel a couple of days ago, “As of now,” he said, “we have raised less than $800,000 of a campaign budget of $4‐million.” To some extent, he believes, Republicans got out of the habit of giving during the Rockefeller years, knowing that the former Governor and his family who made announced contributions of more than $5‐million to the campaign in 1970, would make up any deficiencies. That night, driving from the Greene County Republican dinner to Albany, and then during a flight by chartered plane to Rochester, Mr. Wilson said that he would continue to appeal to his listeners' intellect rather than their emotions, let the chips fall where they might. “That's the reason why I won't—why it's impossible—to pledge not to increase taxes, as, my opponent has done,” he said. “My gifted predecessor once campaigned in good faith saying there would be no tax increases. Then, as the fiscal realities developed, he had to ask the people for taxes. There's an old Chinese proverb—‘Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me.’” A Craftsman's Pride Mr. Wilson, who was a debater and a student of Latin and Greek in his days at Fordham University, takes a craftsman's pride in the careful construction of his speeches, whether prepared or impromptu. Combined with his extensive knowledge of state government, this facility often leads him to spin out answers to even seemingly simple questions at great length and with arabesques of logic that might please the Jesuits who were his teachers. While he often refers to himself as “a brand new governor,” partly to disassociate himself with at least those aspects of the Rockefeller administration with which he was not in sympathy, Mr. Wilson says he has accomplished a good deal since taking office. At his urging, he said, the Legislature increased payments to welfare and unemployment compensation recipients and cut taxes by a total of $130‐million a year. He was also instrumental in providing $100‐million in emergency funding to the city to preserve the 35‐cent fare at least for the time being. On the minusside, some of his advisors acknowledge, was his failure to act decisively in setting up gasoline and fuel oil allocations during the period of shortage that occurred shortly after he took office, and his apparent lack of interest in what are usually? called bold and innovative proposals. Mr. Wilson said he was well aware that anyone who talks about prudent government, about reserving the welfare rolls for the needy rather than the greedy—to quote a phrase he uses—and about reducing the cost of government, is bound to sound to many voters more like a skinflint banker than the man to lead the state during what are likely to be four difficult years. No matter, he said, staring hard at his questioner. “I always wanted to be governor and Nelson Rockefeller made it clear to me he wanted me to be his successor,” he said. “I felt that all conditions being equal I would be at least a candidate. I'm anxious to serve in my own right, but a victory achieved at the expense of deceit and false promises would be a Pyrrhic victory indeed.” He then explained, in response to a question, who Pyrrhus was. On the Offensive On Monday morning Mr. Wilson flew back to New York and it immediately became apparent that his tactics were changing. On television interview show he accused State Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, of favoring “dirty pictures and dirty books” because she had voted against an anti‐pornography bill he favored. At Republican campaign headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel the word was out the next day that the Governor had decided to stop resisting the advice of his managers. The gloves, it was suggested, were coming off. On Wednesday, bidding for the support of the state convention of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O., he invoked the specter of rising crime turning New York City into a jungle and driving out businesses. “It takes a while to find yourself after being overshadowed for 15 years by the incredible brilliance of Nelson Rockefeller,” Burdell Bixby said. “But now I think Malcolm Wilson is finding himself. He's getting stronger every day.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mary Lindsay Eases Into the New Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/06/archives/mary-lindsay-eases-into-the-new-life-defends-city.html,"Mary Lindsay always laughed when she was labeled a political wife. She knew the characterization wasn't true but she didn't much care, and that in Totelf precluded her from the label, Political wives do care and moreover, they are very careful when they laugh and when they don't. For 17 years, while her husband, first as executive assistant to Herbert Brownell Jr., Attorney General under President Eisenhower, then as a United States Representative and later as Mayor of New York, became one of the best known political figures in the country, Mrs. Lindsay refused to fit into the stereotype of the little helpmate. She was tough, assured and candid, and she helped, but on her own terms. Mary Lindsay was always her own person. Now that her husband has retired from politics, at least temporarily, things haven't changed too much. Mr Lindsay, rather than heading for City Hall every day, travels to his old law firm (Webster Sheffield Fleischmann Hitchock and Brookfield), where he has an office, and attends numerous conferences and lunches with publishers and television executives. Mrs. Lindsay is free of public responsibilities, but the millenium of doing exactly what she'd like hasn't yet arrived. However, she's trying. Sets a Deadline “I feel pleasantly relaxed,” she said exultantly, standing amid cartons of books in the Lindsays' new apartment at the Hotel des Artistes, on West 67th Street, “My time is my own.” Mrs. Lindsay has given herself until the beginning of the new year to finish organizing the duplex apartment, with its two staircases and huge living room fireplace and windows. In the meantime, the ironing board is in the red‐carpeted, blue and white bedroom, and the bicycle is in the living room. She laughs them off with a flourish of hinds and makes a date to play tennis with her daughter. First things first. Mrs. Lindsay has always had priorities and neither public life nor the passage of years has changed them. Personal relationships, particularly family, are at the top. Her children's privacy was guarded as much as possible and during the years in Gracie Mansion, and other than at times of crisis, she took the telephone off the hook for an hour and a half every night so that the family might have some uninterrupted time together. Looking back on the political years. Mrs. Lindsay is now convinced that the fact that her husband became Mayor, rather than staying in Washington, contributed to the family equilibrium. “Even though Gracie Mansion was a goldfish bowl, we did have the house and we concentrated on keeping it as private as possible and it worked,” she said. “The children felt they could bring their friends in, and after the first few months, they ignored the guards at the gate.” She believed, she said, that the dual residences and constant traveling required of national politicians might contribute to the problems encountered by some of their families. The Lindsays have four children. Katharine, 23, now Mrs. Richard L. Shaffer, is with the Legal Aid Society. Margie, 21, is with a ski patrol in Vail, Colo. Anne, 18, who left college after one term, has been spending some time in Colorado with her sister. John, 14, now at tending a New England school, was the only one of the children to accompany the Lindsays on their recent European sojourn. “The children are very happy John is out of politics,” Mrs. Lindsay said. “Even though they felt that he was the best possible in political life, it's an interesting commentary on what young people feel, that they thought it was fine for someone else but not for their father.” A woman of considerable presence, once described by Robert Price, a former Deputy Mayor, as “a political force nearly equal to patronage,” Mrs. Lindsay looks appalled at the suggestion that she might consider becoming politically involved. Defends City “Never, never,” she said, positively, using the same answer she gives when asked if her husband might once again run for Mayor of New York (the possibility of Mr. Lindsay running for other political office is not as firmly precluded). “I think I can do as much in other ways,” she added. One of the other ways might be writing, and one of the first subjects to be tackled would probably be the city to which she is committed. “As a New Yorker, I'm damn sick of hearing people knock New York,” she said. “It's totally unfair . . . so many problems are worldwide and yet people make outrageous statements about this city.” Although Mrs. Lindsay, a Vassar graduate, once said that she wasn't sure that everybody was made to have causes, and indirectly applied the statement to herself, she does have strong beliefs and rarely hesitates to let them be known. A Do‐lt‐Yourselfer She said she believes in planned parenthood and affixed her signature to a recent letter sent out on behalf of the campaign. She ap‐. peared at a news conference to defend the state's abortion bill. And she said publicly that, she wasn't very happy about her husband's second‐ing Spiro T. Agnew for the Vice Presidential nomination in 1968. Her public statements, and appearances, have been minimal of late. There are too many chores, and as long as she can take her time doing them, she's rather enjoying the process. “John spent the weekend hanging pictures but for the most part, there's nobody around but me, and if I don't do it, it won't get done,” she said. “The apartment we had before was bigger than this, and then we had three years of living in Washington and eight years in Grade Mansion, and the accumulation is something to see. The problem of condensing is horrendous.” The prospect of cooking isn't quite that horrendous, but it also isn't that appealing. “I had a cook for eight years and that was the joy of my life,” she said, with unabashed nostalgia. “It's not that I dislike cooking—the creation is kind of fun—but it's the time involved in the shopping and the peeling and all that funk. If I only have to cook dinner once a week, maybe I'll survive.” At the moment, the Lindsays are eating out a good deal “but with restaurant prices what they are, we're going to have to stop that.” The layout of the apartment, with the kitchen adjoining both the library and the living room, is one of the reasons Mrs. Lindsay thinks that survival is probable. “I always felt isolated before,” she said. “People were sitting in the living room, having interesting conversations, and I'd be mad as a hornet at not being able to hear or take part. In this apartment, all I have to do is peek around the corner.” Being a part of things, rather than observing second‐hand, is important to Mrs. Lindsay. A lot of politicians still remember her comment in Gracie Mansion when she would walk in and listen to political discussions. “This is my house and Igo where I please,” she said then. Despite her emphasis on family, Mrs. Lindsay is not an unlimited togetherness person. At the moment, she's rather pleased that her husband is going to an office every day, and if he stays home to work on his book, “I'll turn off the telephone and leave . . . I can't visualize myself hanging around the apartment. I'll have to figure that part out.” The only part figured out so far is an amorphous weekly schedule. “I'm going to continue spending two mornings a week working with the Museum of Natural History [she works at various tasks, including that of a guide] . . . it gives me a focus,” she said. “Wednesday will be for old buddies, Thursday for tennis . . . and that leaves Tuesday for Bloomingdale's. I haven't gone beyond that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A former Supreme Court clerk spills the bean,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/06/archives/serving-justice-a-former-supreme-court-clerk-spills-the-bean.html,"“Serving Justice” may appear to be an “inside” book — former Supreme Court law clerk tells all — but there are no revelations here. As the author makes clear to us at the outset, he has “tried in every instance to respect” the confidence of the Court. The book is nevertheless worthwhile. What Mr. Wilkinson, who clerked for Justice Louis Powell and now teaches at the University of Virginia Law School, has written amounts to a readable primer on the workings of our highest Court —valuable exposition of the Court's role and workings for the citizen reader, and the kind of book for which college teachers of introductory American government are constantly looking. The book contains thoughtful comments on the contrasts between and the continuity with the Warren and Burger Courts, thumbnail sketches of the judicial philosophies and backgrounds of the current Justices, warm portrait of Justice Powell, ruminations on the law clerk's role, brief discussion of recent cases and indications of the Court's internal procedures. Nonetheless, with the inside experience Mr. Wilkinson has had, he could have given us more without any damaging breach of confidence. Take the process after an opinion is assigned to a Justice until its ultimate issuance. Although the author discusses the Justice‐clerk relationship in drafting an opinion, there is little about the pulling and hauling that can go on among the Justices over a draft opinion. Yet this is at the heart of understanding the internal politics and operations of the Court. An opinion is drafted and circulated among the Justices for comment. Changes in its language — sometimes in its entire legal rationale — may be necessary to get another Justice to join instead of writing a separate ophiion or even voting the other way. But changing it may endanger still another Justice's willingness to join. The stakes are high. The legal theory finally chosen may make a great deal of difference for the future. Moreover, fewer than five votes for a majority opinion, even though there are five or more votes for the result, means no one legal theory has commanded a majority; the value of the case as precedent will be seriously clouded. Opinions can go through 10 and 15 drafts as the currents swirl within the Court. One wishes Mr. Wilkinson had felt free to take us into this crucial internal world. The lack of detail about the Court's internal processes leaves unillumined the immense subtlety of the Court's role as a political institution. Mr. Wilkinson implies more than once that the Court has become too political in the sense of deciding cases better left resolved in forums of elected officials. This is to re‐argue with different rhetoric the long‐simmering controversy over judicial restraint, and the reader should be aware there are views other than those advanced by our author. Moreover, the book gives insufficient emphasis to the deep sensitivity the Court has shown for the political implications of its work. Mr. Wilkinson refers passingly to one example, the “all deliberate speed” formulation in Brown v. Board of Education, but that is of course just the tip of the iceberg. One wishes, again, that he could have presented us with an analogous situation during his time inside. Two examples from Mr. Wilkinson's time as a clerk will illustrate. In the capital punishment oases, one of the opinions supporting the majority position described narrowly‐drawn possible capital punishment statutes that the Court might find acceptable. This is a vintage example of the Court trying to ease the impact of a highly controversial decision. On the other hand, the abortion cases seem to be an instance where the Court deliberately chose a broad, all‐inclusive approach, perhaps on the theory that the matter is so divisive that as little opportunity as possible shbuld be left for further litigation. Deeper examination of how these opinions evolved in tone and nuance would have been extraordinarily helpful. Missing also is any critical examination of internal Court management. Mr. Wilkinson mentions that more than half of all petitioners to the Court are in the in forma pauperis category. What he does not say is that these handwritten petitions of poor people (mostly prisoners), usually without counsel, are presumed frivolous by the Court. To my knowledge these cases are brought up for discussion in conference only if a Justice asks that this be done. Otherwise; they are automatically denied. The procedure is the opposite for paid petitioners. One might ask, indeed, why there is no paid advocate created by statute and attached to the Court or the Justice Department, to make the best case to the Court on every petition where counsel is not involved. Mr. Wilkinson gives fond mention to Justice Black's aging messenger with his knowledge of Court lore. He does not tell us about the Court's caste system of employment. So far as I know, all the messengers are black, and always have been. When one of them sought in a recent year to apply for a vacant job elsewhere in the Court, he was told that he would not be considered because the job had never been held a black. There is some measure of inside information about the Supreme Court which could constructively be made public. “Serving Justice” does not help in this regard, but it is still useful. It is as good a current summary of what the Supreme Court is and how it operates as I have seen. Anthony Lewis's “Gideon's Trumpet” is perhaps the classic layman's guide to the Court, but it is now a decade old, and lacks up‐to‐date examples of the Court's work. Mr. Wilkinson has at the very least provided us with suitable supplement for the seventies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/06/archives/pressure-groups-are-increasingly-putting-the-heat-on-tv-television.html,"THIS Tuesday evening, courtesy ?? a “Marcus Welby, M.D.” episod?? called “The Outrage,” the mos ?? significant scenario concerning ?? prime‐time program will have alread?? been played off camera. The name ?? the power game can be called “Power ?? ful. Networks Versus Increasingl?? Powerful Pressure Groups.” In this case, the network is ABC. Th?? pressure groups are organizations repre ?? senting the causes of homosexuals, moss?? prominently the National Gay Task?? Force. It all began several months ago?? when David Victor, creator of the ?? “Welby” series, approached ABC executives with a proposal for an episode involving child molestation. Mr. Victor?? was armed with what the network refers to as “significant” statistics on the problem compiled by the Los?? Angeles police department. He was told?? to commission a “proper” script. The script, written by Eugene Price, was sent to the. National Gay Task Force for advisory “input.” Task Force leaders exploded. They refused to suggest “positive” changes and flatly declared that the program should never see the light of a TV tube. In the script, a 14‐year‐old boy has been raped by his science teacher while on a field trip. The focus, of the story is kept on how the incident affects both the boy and his family. ABC insists the program involves not homosexuality but pedophilia in the form of an erotic desire for children. The Task Force maintains that, no matter the intentions, a story using the rape of one male by another can't help but have a “chilling effect” on pending legislation in several cities and states that “would protect gays from discrimination in employment and housing.” The group also questions the accuracy of the program's basic details. A 14‐year‐old, they say, would fall outside the range of the typical pedophile, who is likely to prefer children under the age of 10. And, they add, key statistics, including those gathered by the Kinsey Institute, indicate that incidents of sexual child molestation are almost exclusively heterosexual. Despite the protests of homosexual organizations, ABC proceeded with the project, but not without incorporating careful script changes. Several, though not all, references to violations of “manhood” were eliminated. And it is specifically stated that the case “has nothing to do with homosexuality,” that the guy has a “severe mental and emotional problem,” and that the typical pedophile is “often married and middle‐aged.” Homosexual organizations, however, show little inclination for compromise on the issue. Instead of maintaining negotiations with the network, they have gone to affiliate stations the direct source of network power, in a campaign to have the stations refuse to carry the program. At deadline for this article, at least two major stations, in Philadelphia and Boston, had expressed agreement with the pressure groups. Another station won't carry the episode because it simply, objects to the subject matter. It couldn't be less concerned with homosexual rights. And ABC indicated there could be further station defections. Irresistible force would appear to have met immovable object, but the issue is complex, and the cast of characters cannot be neatly assigned to black hats and white hats. Both sides are treading on genuinely sensitive issues. For its part, ABC made a mistake in attempting to force this subject, with its obvious potential for controversy, into the rigid format of “Marcus Welby, M.D.” The script and the production are dreadful. If the network was determined to pursue the subject, it had the responsibility to provide the care and attention that generally can be offered only in a special production, much as was done with the portrait of a juvenile detention home on NBC's “Born Innocent.” Suppose though, that a network did devise a serious and effective production dealing with sexual child molestation, a problem that does exist. And suppose the central incident did involve two Males. “Almost exclusively heterosexual” does not mean “never homosexual.” At what point does the understandable anxiety of homosexual groups become censorship or prior restraint? That is the key issue underlying the role of all pressure groups: the Catholics objecting to the abortion episodes of “Maude,” the Jews objecting to any production of “The Merchant of Venice,” the Poles objecting to “QBVII,” and so on to weekly infinity. Within the context of their own special and inevitably narrow interests, many of these groups present arguments that cannot and should not be ignored. The National Gay Task Force is no exception. In a letter to ABC in January, 1973 (this is not the group's first run‐in with “Marcus Welby”), the Task Force explained: “Our point is that gay people in our society are where blacks were not so many years ago, just emerging from media invisibility. Greater caution is needed at present to avoid giving offense.” Homosexual groups have undoubtedly won a measure of “greater caution” from broadcasting. Offensive “fag and dyke” jokes have been reduced. Mincing stereotypes are examined more closely and are beginning to be supplanted with touches of more authenticity (“That Certain Summer”). The greater caution is a direct result of pressure on broadcasters, and the pressure has to continue. But, given the “committed” nature of a pressure group, the demands can become unreasonable or even counterproductive. Eventually, the pressure begins to generate polarization. For one executive at ABC, the demands have become political, exacerbated by the defeat of a “gay rights” bill in New York City. “No,” is his message to homosexual organizations, “you may not use me to get your legislation passed.” In his contacts with these organizations on specific projects, he is looking for advice rather than censorship, appraisal rather than prior restraint. The balance is undeniably delicate. But in attempting to replace the old and frequently abusive stereotypes of homosexuals with only “positive” nonabusive stereotypes—even if only until the “prejudice balance” is redressed—the homosexual groups are veering toward an unreality of their own. That unreality is as objectionable as any other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City Hall Listens to Whites But the Results Seem Mixed,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/city-hall-listens-to-whites-but-the-results-seem-mixed-the-real.html,"New York's Italians, Irish, Poles and a smattering of other groups—the white ethnic people who were probably the most alienated in the city under the Lindsay administration—are fashioning a more pleasant, but still uncertain, relationship with the Beame administration in City Hall. “On the whole,” Msgr. Eugene Clark of the New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese said carefully, “they seem to be listening to us.” But the Rev. Robert Kennedy, the breezy political affairs coordinator for the Brooklyn Diocese said, “Under Lindsay you knew who was in charge. And you knew he didn't want to talk to you. With Beame, it's hard to figure who's in charge.” An amalgam or census reports and estimates from various sources indicates that the three major ethnic groups in New York, each at a bit more than 20 per cent of the total city population, are Jews, Italians and blacks. The Puerto Ricans are at about 10 per cent, and so some sources suggest, are the Irish. The white groups—predominantly Roman Catholic —were cultivated vigorously by the Beame‐for‐Mayor campaign. Now that the campaign team has settled into City Hall, however, there are some signs of disenchantment, an attitude that the Beame people are aware of and can explain. “Look,” Deputy Mayor James A. Cavanagh said wearily. He drew a long bar on a piece of note paper. “Suppose that's money and you've given it to one group.” He drew another, much shorter bar. “And this one is the demand of a new group. How can you help the new people if the money's all been given away?” As Mr. Cavanagh explained it, although the Beame people arrived in City Hall attuned to the white ethnics, it was a time when money to satisfy their demands was drying up. Money seems to have replaced the so‐called “Catholic” ideological issues like abortion and government aid to parochial schools, particularly in the Brooklyn diocese, a sprightlier operation than the tradition‐conscious New York archdiocese. The Real Point “We feel it's dirty pool to ask somebody about something they can't do anything about,” said Father Kennedy. “An old lady was in one of our health centers the other day and she started to cry as the nursing sister took her blood pressure. She only gets $140 a month to live on and she had to pay $75 rent and she said she didn't know where to get money to eat. That's something that gets into your gut, real fast, not how someone stands on some issue.” But whatever the attitude of official municipal sympathy that might be discerned by representatives of ethnic and religious groups, there are mixed reports on the concrete aid that results from it. “Oh, we're getting a lot of sympathy,” an, Irish priest said caustically. Through a spokesman, John Nikas, president of the Greek umbrella organization HANAC, said that the regular monthly payments of some $10,000 for social services simply stopped in July. “You get a lot of commitments but no money,” the spokesman said. “We don't know if it stops at Cavanagh's office or the Mayor's office or where.” HANAC is one of five ethnic groups that have been approved for so‐called “ethnic grants”—city money for social programs outside the officially labeled poverty areas, which tend to be black and Puerto Rican. The others are the Metropolitan Coordinating Council on the Jewish Poor, the Congress of Italian American Organization, the Council of Belmont Organizations (a mostly Italian group in the Bronx) and the Polish and Slovak Center in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The Polish center was founded in 1972 by the Rev. Longin Tolczyk, an assistant at a nearby Roman Catholic church, with some $80,000 left to him in an uncle's will. To keep it in operation, he asked the Lindsay people, in potver, for some help. “But we didn't receive a penny,” he said. ‘A Good Protector’ Then, more traditional political techniques were brought to play. “Now we have a good protector,” said Father Tolczyk, grinning at “Tom Bartosiewicz, a Greenpoint resident who headed the advance operation in the Beame‐for‐Mayor campaign and now performs similar chores in City Hall. “I pushed it,” Mr. Bartosiewicz said simply. He spoke with officials of the Human Resources Administration, who run the ethnic‐grants program, and, after winning their approval, took up the matter directly with the Mayor. A former Lindsay official insisted that the Polish grant had been plodding methodically through the bureaucracy and probably would have surfaced sooner or later anyway. But that is how officials past and present say it is with the Human Resources Administration; the agency has its own quirky, and, not particularly swift, rhythm. According to Joseph Fallon, who was the ethnic affairs assistant in the waning days of the Lindsay mayoralty, “the H.R.A. is such an independent creature and so unresponsive to City Hall that you can have a policy on ethics, but by the time it filters through H.R.A., it might end up different.” A onetime mayoral aide pointed out that, during Mr. Lindsay's abortive Presidential campaign, he found working‐class neighborhoods impenetrable, even antagonistic. Ethnic Affairs Office So, back home in New York, an office of ethnic affairs was set up, which, this official recalls, “meant everybody but the blacks and the Puerto Ricans and the Jews. Marvin Schick [a mayoral aide] did the sews and we figured the Human Resources Administration did the blacks and Puerto Ricans.” Looked at from another standpoint, ethnic groups in New York can often can be seen as neighborhood groups, of course, and the Beame team, which grew up in the neighborhood‐based regular Democratic organizations, has shifted away from that Lindsay office and back to the traditional clubhouse structure for answering the neighbors' complaints. “It's better this way,” argued City Councilman Howard Golden, a regular Democrat from the Brooklyn organization. “I'm convinced a lot of the city's polarization was caused by that Lindsay divisiveness, by looking at things that way.” Now there is a diffuse set of people responsible. Deputy Mayor Paul Gibson is the neighborhood liaison man in the Beame administration and if something identifiably and persistently ethnic refuses to go away, insiders say, Deputy Mayor Cavanagh serves as a court of last resort for his fellow Irish; Anthony Vaccarello, a mayoral aide, for the Italians, Mr. Bartosiewicz for the Poles. Differing Opinions There are various estimates of the effectiveness of the restoration of that old‐style system. “Look,” said a Beame aide. “The ethnic catchword is ‘neighborhoods’ and we're from the neighborhoods. We're New Yorkers.” “Look,” said a former Lindsay official in disagreement with that view. “A lot of the groups concerned about the white poor are insurgents, poverty types, not friends of Meade Esposito's. They might be getting cut out now.” But according to Deputy Mayor Gibson, the man who at one time or another confronts most of these prolllems, his door is always open. “I would hope,” he said, “that we're better at this than the Lindsay people. For two reasons: First, we have their experience to draw on; second, there's a different ambiance in this administration—we try for an ongoing relationship to prevent situations, like in Forest Hills, where a problem peaks into a crisis.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How can you help the new people if the money's all been given away?” As Mr. Cavanagh explained it, although the Beame people arrived in City Hall attuned to the white ethnics, it was a time when money to satisfy their demands was drying up. Money seems to have replaced the so‐called “Catholic” ideological issues like abortion and government aid to parochial schools, particularly in the Brooklyn diocese, a sprightlier operation than the tradition‐conscious New York archdiocese. “We feel it's dirty pool to ask somebody about something they can't do anything about,” said Father Kennedy. “An old lady was in one of our health centers the other day and she started to cry as the nursing sister took her blood pressure. She only gets $140 a month to live on and she had to pay $75 rent and she said she didn't know where to get money to eat. That's something that gets into your gut real fast, not how someone stands on some issue.” But, whatever the attitude of official municipal sympathy that might be discerned by representatives of ethnic and religious groups, there are mixed reports on the concrete aid that results from it. “Oh, we're getting a lot of sympathy,” an Irish priest said caustically. Through a spokesman, John Nikas, president of the Greek umbrella organization HANAC, said that the regular monthly payments of some $10,000 for social services simply stopped in July. “You get a lot of commitments but no money,” the, spokesman said. “We don't know if it stops at Cavanagh's office or the Mayor's office or where.” HANAC is one of five ethnic groups that have been approved for so‐called “ethnic grants”—city money for social programs outside the officially labeled poverty areas, which tend to be black and Puerto Rican. The others are the Metropolitan Coordinating Council on the Jewish Poor, the Congress of Italian American Organization, the Council of Belmont Organizations (a mostly Italian group in the Bronx) and the Polish and Slovak Center in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The Polish center was founded in 1972 by the Rev. Longin Tolczyk, an assistant at a nearby Roman Catholic church, with some $80,000 left to him in an uncle”s will. To keep it in operation, he asked the Lindsay people, in power, for some help. “But we didn”t receive a penny,” he said. Then, more traditional political techniques were brought to play. “Now we have a good protector,” said Father Tolczyk, grinning at Tom Bartosiewicz, a Greenpoint resident who headed the advance operation in the Beame‐for‐Mayor campaign and now performs similar chores in City Hall. “I pushed it,” Mr. Bartosiewicz said simply. He spoke with officials of the Human Resources Administration, who run the ethnic‐grants program, and, after winning their approval, took up the matter directly with the Mayor. A former Lindsay official insisted that the Polish grant had been plodding methodically through the bureaucracy and probably would have surfaced sooner or later anyway. But that is how officials past and present say it is with the Human Resources Administration; the agency has its own quirky, and not particularly swift, rhythm. According io Joseph Fallon, who was the ethnic affairs assistant in the waning days of the Lindsay mayoralty, “the H.R.A. is such an independent creature and so unresponsive to City Hall that you can have a policy on ethics, but by the time it filters through H.R.A., it might end up different.” A onetime mayoral aide pointed out that, during Mr. Lindsay”s abortive Presidential campaign, he found working‐class neighborhoods impenetrable, even antagonistic. So, back home in New York, an office of ethnic affairs was set up, which, this official recalls, “meant everybody but the blacks and the Puerto Ricans and the Jews. Marvin Schick [a mayoral aide] did the Jews and we figured the Human Resources Administration did the blacks and Puerto Ricans.” Looked at from another standpoint, ethnic groups in New York can often can be seen as neighborhood groups, of course, and the Beame team, which grew up in the neighborhood‐based regular Democratic organizations, has shifted away from that Lindsay office and back to the traditional clubhouse structure for answering the neighbors' complaints. “It”s better this way,” argued City Councilman Howard Golden, a regular Democrat from the Brooklyn organization. “I”m convinced a lot of the city”s polarization was caused by that Lindsay divisiveness, by looking at things that way.” Now there is a diffuse set of people responsible. Deputy Mayor Paul Gibson is the neighborhood liaison man in the Beame administration and, if something identifiably and persistently ethnic refuses to go away, insiders say, Deputy Mayor Cavanagh serves as a court of last resort for his fellow Irish; Anthony Vaccarello, a mayoral aide, for the Italians, Mr. Bartosiewicz for the Poles. There are various estimates of the effectiveness of the restoration of that old‐style system. “Look,” said a Beame aide, “The ethnic catchword is ‘neighborhoods’ and we”re from the neighborhoods, We”re New Yorkers.” “Look,” said a former Lindsay official in disagreement with that view. “A lot of the groups concerned about the white poor are insurgents, poverty types, not friends of Meade Esposito”s. They might be getting cut out now.” But according to Deputy Mayor Gibson, the man who at one time or another confronts most of these problerns, his door is always open. “I would hope,” he said. “that we”re better at this than the Lindsay people. For two reasons: First, we have their experience to draw on; second, there”s a different ambiance in this administration—we try for an ongoing relationship to prevent situations, like in Forest Hills, where a problem peaks into a crisis.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Duryea Running Hard for Assembly Seat In Eastern L.I., Base of His Political Power",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/08/archives/duryea-running-hard-for-assembly-seat-in-eastern-li-base-of-his.html,"MONTAUK, L.T. — Perry B. Duryea, Speaker of the Assembly, is running for re‐election to his legislative seat as if it were the governorship. Determined to rebound from the political scandal that ended his gubel‐natorial hopes, the second most powerful Republican in the state is running hard, if not scared, fielding the most organized and careful campaign of his 14 years in office. Even Joyce Burland, the outspoken candidate of the area's regenerated Democratic party, concedes that the Speaker has seen to it—“cynically,” she says—that a formidable and well‐publicized amount of state aid has come through his office to the eastern Long Island district. As enumerated by the Duryea staff, this includes such items as dock improvements and clam transplants for fishermen, promised railroad improvements for travelers, arts aid for the Hampton colonies, and dune and wetland protections for the conservationists. At the same time, a steady string of special groups unlike any of past campaigns is at the ready to carry his cause through already prepared radio and print propaganda. These include Women for Duryea, Firefighters for Duryea, Baymen for Duryea, and Democrats for Duryea. They are all suspected by the Democrats of being G.O.P. front groups, but the Duryea camp says there is genuine and great sympathy for the Speaker this year. Works Near Birthplace The campaign is “an average effort,” Mr. Duryea says casually as he works in his shellfish corporation office across the road from a clapboard house that faces the ocean and that was his birthplace as the scion of the East End's best known nolitical family. But his partisans—including wealthy landowners, middleclass patronizers the powerful G.G.P. organization, and at least one fisherman who used his fists to respond to some criticism of Mr. Duryea in a tavern—say this election is a special chance to vindicate the reputation of the 52‐year‐old, silver‐haired politician known locally as “Junie.” These locals want to re‐elect him overwhelmingly to the seat that is the elemental link in his stature. Intent on denying him continued power are the Democrats, who last year scored upset victories in Mr. Duryea's home town of East Hampton on the strength of new candidates and strategists wise in the ways of insurgent urban‐style politics. Some longtime residents grumble that the upset was the work of “artsy” clusters of newcomers seeking some postsummer chic. But Mr. Duryea, who has been emphasizing arts aid approved by the Legislature, makes no such complaint. He notes that perhaps half of the area's residents are newcorners by traditional standards, a fact that does not make the interloper issue a promising one. Republicans have been of watching new party registrants closely to see whether city Democrats are switching voting addresses to their summer residences. Mrs. Burland feels the things have backfired on the Republicans because the local police have been verifying details of registration and, she contends, annoying people. Complaint on Radio Time She feels this is just one aspect of entrenched Republican power in the district. Another, she charges, is the difficulty she has been having in buying commercial time on several local radio stations. The Federal Communications Commision has rejected her complaint. The Democrat also has been attacking the Speaker on the environmental issue, particularly as it relates to the controversial extension of Sunrise Highway. Mr. Duryea says he favors a limited two‐lane extension an end that local residents increasingly are resenting opposition to the road. He denies that he is a land “speculator,” as Mrs. Burland charges, who profited from owning tracts nearby a pending park project. Rather, the at Speaker says, his investments as a local businessman have been limited and he has avoided various investment opportunities to avoid any suspicion of profiting from inside information. The main issues, Mrs. Burland feels, are the public's disgust over inflation and their lingering uneasiness about the indictment last year in the alleged vote‐siphoning scheme. “That kind of abuse of power ought to disqualify a fellow from public office,” Mrs. Burland says. In the alleged scheme, which took place two years ago, tens of thousands of pamphlets were circulated quietly in a dozen em Assembly contests by staff aides of the Speaker intent on pushing weak Liberal candidates to the detriment of Democratic candidates. An indictment was thrown out of court on constitutional grounds, but Mrs. Burland feels the basic facts are enough to cause a strong voter reaction, in this year of popular with some politicians. Denies ‘Direct’ Authorization Republicans say such tactics are time‐honored by both parties, and Mr. Duryea said in an interview that he “did not directly authorize” the scheme. But this is no defense in the view of Mrs. Burland, a 40‐year‐old woman who is the daughter of Clark Clifford, the former Secretary of Defense and Presidential adviser. “They're listening,” she says of the hundreds of families she has visited door‐to‐door since June. “They're fed up.” Duryea partisans say that, to the contrary, many people feel the Speaker was victimized—“jobbed” was the term applied by one man in the Blue Marlin bar here the other day—in a Republican intrigue engineered by former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to aid the hold of his successor, Malcolm Wilson, on the governorship. Mr. Wilson has been invited to a fund‐raiser (700 donors at $30 a ticket) by Mr. Duryea. The Governor will be the latest in a series of prominent state officials to come through the district. In one such appearance last August, while the Democrats were raising the issue of serdi‐Nice on the Long Island Rail Road, Mr. Duryea was chairman of a well‐publicized meeting in the district at which he had the State Commissioner of Transportation, Raymond Schuler, and the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, David L. Yunich, discussing plans for $50‐million worth of rail improvements. That sort of incumbent's edge is frustrating to Mrs. Burland. She moved to Long Island three years ago, to an 11‐acre homesite in Bridgehampton, with her husband, Sascha, a musician and arranger, and their three children. She had been a fundsar, and had served in various. sar, and had served in variou inner‐city aid programs over the years. she said, before making this first run for office. Another neophyte candidate is the third person in the race, Virginia S. Walker, a 32‐year‐fold enrolled Conservative who is also running on the Free Libertarian line. Mrs. Walker, college instructor who speaks of Dryden as easily as Duryea, offers a wide and disarming array of views rooted in disgust with politicians. “who hold pragmatism above principle,” and disgust with government that coerces citizens through such devices as taxation and zoning laws. Mrs. Walker is a tireless speaker. At times she has to debate fellow conservatives annoyed at some of her views, such as her tolerance of abortion and her opposition to most pornography laws and other laws affecting victimless crimes. In brief, she feels that liberals are too illiberal about recognizing individual property rights and that conservatives are too conservative about individual freedoms. While the other candidates may spend More than $20,000 each on the campaign, Mrs. Walker has about $1,000. Even so, Republicans are hoping some of her views and her genger will cut into the Burland Vote. Mr. Duryea says he has left behind the experience of last year and is looking forward to “many constructive years in the Legislature.” He says he expects to retain his seat as well as the Speakership, and even if the Democrats take the governorship, his old position of Republican minority leader would be an interesting front‐line position. Others talk of his eventually moving into gubernatorial contention again. He does not. “I'm not one to look back.” he, comments. “What will be will be.” Mrs. Burland is somewhat fatalistic, too. “This is one of those weird, wonderful times when you have to say you don't know how people are going to go,” she says. “There's something abroad this year.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital Right to Bar Abortions Is Upheld,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/09/archives/hospital-right-to-bar-abortions-is-upheld.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 8 (AP)—A Superior Court judge today upheld the right of a hospital to refuse to allow its facilities to be used to perform an abortion. The ruling by Judge Herbert Horn of Atlantic City upheld that right for three South Jersey hospitals. The judge noted that Governor Byrne last week signed a new law dealing with the issue of hospitals and abortion. But the judge said he did not find a need to rule on the law. The statute, called the “right‐to‐conscience law,” allows doctors and nurses acting on religious or personal beliefs to refuse to participate in an abortion operation. The law also gives hospitals, including public institutions, the right to refuse abortion services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/09/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"Urging a “new mobilization against inflation,” President Ford proposed a broad program that included a call for a reduction of oil imports and a one‐year tax increase for corporations and many individuals. In an address to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Ford called on all Americans to enlist in the fight to “whip inflation now.” The President's proposals would provide tax incentives for business, help unemployed workers, stimulate home construction, and expand agricultural production. [Page 1, Column 8.] Congressional reaction to the President's economic proposals was restrained, with key members of both houses hailing the spirit of the program while many Democrats and Republicans alike voiced sharp disagreement with its substance — particularly Mr. Ford's call for a 5 per cent surcharge on middleincome and high‐income taxpayers. The Senate Republican leader, Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania called the Ford program “courageous,” but added that there was a “reluctance to share the President's enthusiasm for sacrifice.” [1:4.] Under the President's many‐faceted tax proposals, the working poor would get a small reduction, corporations and many individuals would get a one‐year increase and businesses would get two permanent programs of tax relief. Mr. Ford also endorsed a complex tax‐revision bill before a House committee, apparently enhancing the possibility that some sort of tax legislation would be passed by Congress this year. [1:5.] In his address to Congress, Mr. Ford called on the American people to adopt a variety of energy‐saving measures from driving less to using cold water for laundry. He also called for increased domestic oil production, and named Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B. Morton to head a new national energy board. Ruling out an increase in the Federal gasoline tax, he urged motorists to form car pools, use public transportation or walk. [1:6–8.] International Former Japanese Premier Eisaku Sato and Sean McBride of Ireland, the United Nations commissioner for South‐West Africa, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Sato was cited for stabilizing conditions in the Pacific area by his signing of the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Mr. McBride, who was Ireland's Foreign Minister from 1948 to 1951, was honored for his work in human rights. [5:1.] The six terrorists holding seven hostages in the Venezuelan Consulate in Santo Domingo accepted an offer of safe conduct out of the country; the American Ambassador, Robert A. Hurwito, announced. The offer assures the six Safe conduct to any country of their choosing under guarantees from the American, Spanish and Venezuelan embassies in Santo Domingo. [1:3.] National Vice, President‐designate Nelson A. Rockefeller has been requested to turn over to the Senate Rules Committee “detailed background information” of financial gifts he has given to his aides and associates. The request for the information came following the discosure that Mr. Rockefeller had given $550,000 to William J. Ronan, now chairman of the New York‐New Jersey Port Authority. The gift was in the form of canceling a number of loans to Dr. Ronan. [1:2–3.] The presence of United States marshals was requested by Boston Mayor Kevin H. White to maintain order in the city's schools while a program of court‐ordered school busing for integration is carried out. Despite the request, at the same time, widespread stoning of cars by black youths developed in a previously peaceful black neighborhood. A white taxi driver was seriously injured when he was beaten by black youths. [1:2–3.] Metropolitan In the largest failure in American banking history, the Franklin National Bank was declared insolvent and promptly taken over by a local bank owned by six of the largest financial institutions in Europe. Under an agreement designed to protect them from loss, all Franklin depositors will become depositors of the European‐American Bank and Trust Company, which will operate all of Franklin's brance offices. [1:1.] Plans to establish an Office of Hispanic Affairs in Newark—regarded as a major concession to the city's Spanish‐speaking community after last month's racial disturbances—appear to he languishing in a morass of bureaucratic red tape and opposition in addition, several Hispanic leaders have begun to question the commitment of Mayor Kenneth A.

Upstate Weekly Bans Reports On Pro‐Abortion Candidates,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/09/archives/upstate-weekly-bans-reports-on-proabortion-candidates.html,"Proclaiming on his editorial page that “I and the members of the staff still firmly believe in God,” the editor of a small upstate weekly newspaper has refusd either to accept advertising from or to print news articles about any candidates for political office who favor abortion. Elmer J. Spear, the publisher of The Orange County Post in Washingtonville, N. Y., estimated yesterday that the new policy would cost the paper as much as half its advertising revenue between now and the Nov. 5 election, as well as create large holes in the paper's news columns. But Mr. Spear said that he and his son John, who wrote the editorial that appeared last Thursday, said they could not have acted differently because “we believe that people are killing people.” The Spars are Roman Catholics. Mr. Spear, an enrolled Conservative, said that the new policy means the paper will give news coverage only to the Conservative party candidate, Thomas Moore, in the hotly contested Congressional race in the area. Be described the two other candidates, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, the Republican incumbent, and former Representative John G. Dow, the Democrat, as “antilife.” The Orange County Post has a circulation of about 2,000, and Mr. Spear said that during his last 30 years as publisher the policy had been to accept news releases from any candidate, with a general attempt to give equal space to opponents. The publisher said he had not yet received much reaction to the new policy, but that since the majority of local candidates appeared to favor abortion he expected to lose up to $2,000 in advertising. Newspapers often refuse to accept various forms of advertising, but it is rare for them to refuse by written policy to refuse to print news articles on a given subject. A spokesman for the American Newspaper Publishers Association in Reston, Va., called The Orange County Post's policy “absolutely horrendous” and “unprecedented.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ANTI‐ABORTION DRIVE SUFFERS A SETBACK,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/09/archives/antiabortion-drive-suffers-a-setback.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 13—The campaign to override the Supreme Court's ban on anti‐abortion legislation by amending the Constitution ran into an unexpected obstacle in Congress today. Three of four law professors at a Senate hearing, while differing widely on other legal aspects of abortion, agreed that both pending proposals for abortion reform would not achieve their sponsors' goal, the restoration of state laws restricting early termination of pregnancy. As a result, any prospect that Congress would approve either of the abortion amendments before the current session adjourns in December all but vanished, confronting the “right to life” lobby with the possibility of having to start over again in 1975. The two basically similar proposed amendments, sponAred by Senators James L. Buckley, Conservative‐Republican of New York, and Jesse A.

Transit Bill Backed By President Stalls In Rules Committee,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/10/archives/transit-bill-backed-by-president-stalls-in-rules-committee.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9—The House Rules Committee declined today to send an $11.8‐billion mass transit bill to the house floor in a move that took supporters of the legislation by surprise. House leaders pledged to seek to revive the bill after the election recess. The legislation would provide New York City with $170‐million of the $200‐million that city officials say is needed to save the 35‐cent transit fare. President Ford, who apparently did not receive word of the action until after a news conference at which he said he had helped draft the bill, told newsmen that congressional approval was “a fait accompli.” Speaker Carl Albert said at a news conference that “I thought it was coming out,” and Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois, chairman of the House Republican conference, said “I thought we had the votes.” Representative Ray J. Madden, Indiana Democrat, chairman of the Rules Committee, had the votes to send the bill to the floor. But he said he sought to smooth ruffled feelings by postponing action until after the election recess. The action was deferred without a vote. “We'll get a mass transit bill,” Mr. Madden told the committee. However, the bill's supporters said today that the legislation would not gain by being postponed until after the election recess, and some feared that its chances declined with every passing day. Democrats and Republicans exchanged charges on who was to blame for delaying the bill. Representative Anderson charged that the rules committee was motivated by “electionyear politics,” because House Democratic leaders did not want President Ford to receive credit for the legislation. “If there had been any will at all on the part of the Democratic leadership of the House, it would have come out of the Rules Committee,” Mr. Anderson said. Speaker Albert noted, however, that Mr. Anderson had cast the committee's one Republican vote yesterday in favor of the bill. Three Republicans voted against the bill and one was absent. Five of the 10 Democrats also voted for the bill. The bill was stalled yesterday by a 6‐6 vote, which Mr. Madden sought to reverse at today's session. “The Democratic leadership supports this bill,” Mr. Albert said. “I personally went to members of the Rules Committee.” The most intense opposition to the bill came from the Public Works Committee which last August approved an $11.3‐billion mass transit bill that was enacted by the House. This legislation was bypassed, however, by a House‐Senate conference committee that expanded a Banking Committee's one‐year, $800‐million bill into a six‐year, $11.8‐billion bill. The major provisions of the bills are the same, but the Public Works Committee charged piracy, legislative plagiarism and unprecedented parliamentary manipulation. Rules Committee members today generally denounced the procedural irregularity of the House‐Senate conference bill, which was sponsored by Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr. and Representative Joseph G. Minish, both New Jersey Democrats.  “This is the most unparliamentary thing I've seen in 32 yaers here,” Mr. Maddden said. “People on the floor asked me, “what was the vote in the Senate on this bill? Well, there wasn't a vote in the Senate. This bill was created in the conference committee.” “This bill is a legal abortion,” said Gillis W. Long, a Louisiana Democrat, who voted yesterday, against the bill. “This bill is an atrocity,” said Richard Bolling, Missouri Democrat, who was absent for the vote yesterday. Mr. Bolling was on the House floor during the committee vote, but said that he would have voted in favor of clearing the bill in committee and perhaps against the bill on the House floor. President Ford told newsmen that “I had some considerable part in working out the compromise on the Williams‐Minish bill.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rockland Congress Race Is Rerun of '72,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/12/archives/rockland-congress-race-is-rerun-of-72-220000-registered-price.html,"MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Oct. 9 —The campaign in the 26th Congressional District is in many ways a rerun of the local election in 1972, offering the voters a clear‐cut choice among a liberal Democrat, a moderate Republican and a Conservative party candidate. Two years ago, the Democratic incumbent, John G. Dow, an early opponent of the Vietnam war and a strong supporter of Senator George McGovern, the Democratic Presidential candidate, was defeated by Benjamin A. Gilman, the. Republican, who supported former President Richard M. Nixon and his actions in Vietnam. Today, the same two candidates are running again. Mr. Dow, who also has the Liberal party nomination, is challenging the incumbent Mr. Gilman in a campaign that so far has stirred little voter interest in the district, which encompasses suburban Rockland County, rural Orange County and three townships in southern Ulster County. 220,000 Registered The district, normally Republican, has 220,000 registered voters, more than half of them in Rockland County. In 1972, Mr. Gilman received 91,000 votes, 16,000 more than Mr. Dow. The Conservative candidate received 25,000 votes. The Conservative candidate this year, Thomas Moore, a retired New York City employe and a past chairman of the Orange County Conservative party, again may hold the key to the election, even if no independent observer here considers that he has a chance to win. Once again, as in 1972, the question is how many votes the Conservative candidate may take away from Mr. Gilman. But this time, aside from general ideological differences, there is a specific issue that Mr. Moore has been supporting, —opposition to abortion reform and those who supported it. Mr. Gilman, who voted for abortion reform when he was a member of the State Legislature, recognizes that the abortion issue is overriding for some people, but he hopes that they will not vote on a single issue, but on the full record of a candidate. Mr. Dow, who favors abortion reform, thinks that it is not a major issue. “It's a drop in the bucket, of no consequence in our campaign,” he said. Mr. Moore, who believes that the abortion issue is important, said that the majority of the people he comes in contact with are more interested in inflation and means of controlling it, however. “As far as I am concerned, there is no difference between the other two candidates,” he said. “I am trying to offer the people a choice between bureaucratic socialism and the free enterprise system.” Both major party candidates agreed that the voters were concerned with the great national issues of inflation, taxation and energy, but added that the overriding local issues seemed to be sharply rising real sate taxes and unemployment in the building trades. “This has been a fast‐growth area, but construction and home purchases have dried up,” said Mr. Gilman, a 51‐year‐old lawyer, who campaigns only on weekends while Congress is still in session. A former State Assemblyman, he is serving his first term in Congress. “This is a suburban area and construction is more important here than in other areas,” said Mr. Dow, a 69‐year‐old business systems analyst, who has served three previous terms in Congress. “Construction workers keep coming up to me and ask where they can get work.” As a result both candidates have come out in favor of action now on two controversial projects in the district, the extension of the main runway or a new runway at Stewart Airport in Newburgh and the construction of the proposed Storm King pump storage power plant at Cornwall by Consolidated Edison. In facing the national economic issues, the two candidates offer programs that demonstrate their ideological differences. “I am shooting for broadrange efforts on big issues in a major way as a national program rather than small technical adjustments tht Mr. Gilman suggests,” Mr. Dow said. Price Controls Backed Among the programs he supports are prices and pofit controls, development of coal resources, control of the oil industry, a study of long‐rango power sources, elimination of real estate taxes and substitution of income taxes for suppo of schools. “My opponent has talked quite a bit about the tax bun den, but on the other hand when he was in Congress he was among the big spenders,” Mr. Gilman said. Mr. Gilman supports tax credits for savings bank depositors, a “circuit ‐ breaker” limit for property taxes, tax reform, a regional transportation authority, a strong national defense and exploration of new sources of energy. Neither Mr. Dow nor Mr. Gilman would predict how the election would end, but one independent observer noted that Mr. Dow, who was elected to Congress in 1964, 1966 and 1970 and who lost elections in 1968 and 1972, seemed to win in alternate campaigns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Relative youth and long sideburns notwithstanding, he has become the point man of the Supreme Court's right wing",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/13/archives/mr-justice-rehnquist-dissenting-relative-youth-and-long-sideburns.html,"WASHINGTON. One morning last April, a law school professor was trying to persuade the Supreme Court that the cause of press freedom was advanced by a Florida law requiring newspapers to print verbatim, at the same length and with the same prominence, any statement by a political candidate in reply to a news story or editorial that he regards as critical of his record. When Professor Jerome Barron, warming to his task, told the Court that “this statute does not detract from freedom of expression, it adds to freedom of expression,” the dark‐haired, somewhat owlish justice at the right end of the bench leaned forward and interrupted. “Are you suggesting,” he asked, “that the First Amendment confers the right to commandeer anybody else's printing press?” At that point, Professor Barron's case sank quietly through the carpeted marble floor of the august chamber, for he had lost the vote of the one man most likely to buy his curious thesis, William Hubbs Rehnquist. In two‐and‐a‐half terms on the high tribunal, Associate Justice Rehnquist has established himself firmly as a one‐man strong right wing, a constructionist so strict as to make Chief Justice Warren Burger look permissive on occasion, a man seemingly dedicated to cleansing, singlehandedly necessary, the Augean stable that conservative dogma perceives as the Supreme Court of the nineteen‐fifties and nineteen‐sixties. As the 1974–75 term of the Supreme Court opened last week, Rehnquist was in position play an influential role in galvanizing the Court's emerging conservative majority on such key issues as reinstatement of capital punishment, foreign intelligence wiretapping and discrimination based on sex. Articulate, purposeful and self‐confident, he may even, upon occasion, be able to expand that majority with his arguments. This is the dawn of a new era for the nine justices who have sat together for the past two‐and‐a‐half years; suddenly they have become the Nixon Court without Nixon. The sponsor of four of these men has fled the Washington scene disgrace, and his successor has yet to have any impact on the Court. Such a time of readjustment could turn out to be an opportunity for a militant judicial activist. As Supreme Court justices go these days, Rehnquist is a striking figure. For one thing, he is young —he turned 50 on Oct. 1, and though that may not seem youthful, it makes him a mere stripling on bench where the ages of the other eight members average 65. And Rehnquist looks younger than he is, with sideburns and modishly long hair that make him the hippie of the Court. Rehnquist's arrival in his lifetime post at a relatively early age could easily make him a leading candidate for Chief in some subsequent conservative administration (although only four of history's 15 Chief Justices had also served as Associate Justices—John Rutledge, Edward White, Charles Evans Hughes and Harlan Stone). Rehnquist's youthfulness has hardly impeded the growth of his reputation for intellect, however. While lawyers hesitate to make invidious comparisons among the learned justices, a sizable number regard Rehnquist as having the best mind on the Court. He is not bashful about questioning attorneys during oral argument, and the speed and incisiveness of his interrogation have impressed members of the bar, whatever their political orientation. (There are dissenters however. One veteran of Supreme Court practice observed: “He has a very quick mind, one of those steel traps. But when snaps shut, there's no way of opening it again.”) These and other qualities cause anyone counting the ways in which Rehnquist differs from most of his colleagues to notice the ways in which he resembles one of them: William Douglas, the dean of the Court. Both men were born in the Middle West but developed strong roots in the West, Douglas in Washington and Rehnquist in Arizona. Douglas followed 9 years as a law professor with three years in the Federal Government, as member and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rehnquist followed 16 years of private practice with three Government years as an Assistant Attorney General in the Nixon Justice Department. Douglas was named to the Supreme Court when he was 40, Rehnquist when he was 47, making each of them by far the youngest man on the bench at the time. But the parallel between the two justices is even more striking in terms of their roles on the Court today, in the morning of Rehnquist's career and the twilight of Douglas's. Since he came to the high bench in January of 1972, Rehnquist has constructed a judicial niche for himself that is almost exactly the mirror image of that occupied in recent years by Douglas. For Douglas has long been the leader of the liberal wing of the Court, dissenting more than any other justice, filing separate dissents of his own when his colleagues' dissent is not strong enough for him. Douglas keeps up a drumbeat of moral pressure on the Court as a whole to move leftward toward his interpretation of the Constitution and on his closest allies, Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, to pull closer to him as he ranges out on the liberal flank of jurisprudence. ‘He has a very quick mind, one of those steel traps. But when it snaps shut, there's no way of opening it again.’ In remarkably similar fashion, Rehnquist has taken a highly vocal position on the far right flank, dissenting more often than the other Nixon justices. In his first full term he filed 33 negative opinions, in his second, 25; on both occasions Chief Justice Burger, with 19 dissents, was his nearest competitor among the Nixon appointees. No one came close, however, to Justice Douglas's dissent totals of 70 and 52. Today's Supreme Court is in relatively delicate ideological balance, but the four Nixon Justices — Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell, along with Burger and Rehnquist—make up a cohesive bloc that, while falling short of a majority, is the largest and most influential force in the Court's decisions. In 1972–73, these four men voted together 70 per cent of the time; in 1973–74 the figure rose to 75 per cent. Only once in each term did they fail to make up the nucleus of a majority when all four voted together. If there was any doubt that Rehnquist has made a difference in the Court, Justice Potter Stewart resolved it for the record last spring. Before the Court was a case involving the right of the purchaser of goods on the installment plan to notice and a hearing before the finance company repossesses his stereo set for alleged default in payments. Two years before, the Court had concluded, 4 to 3, that due process required a hearing; now it was reversing that decision, 5 to 4. “The only perceivable change that has occurred since [the earlier ruling] is in the make‐up of this Court,” Justice Stewart wrote in an angry dissent, identifying the change in a footnote as the addition of Justices Rehnquist and Powell to the bench. “A basic change in the law upon a ground no firmer than a change in our membership invites the popular misconception that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government.” Still, there is considerable debate among lawyers and other Court‐watchers over the amount of influence that Rehnquist has developed among his colleagues by his posture as a Douglas of the right. Liberals, not surprisingly, tend to view his pulling power more ominously than moderates or conservatives. One Washington attorney who has spent some time analyzing his voting record said: “Rehnquist is the cutting edge of the emerging conservative majority on the Court. The other Nixon justices won't always go as far as he wants to, but he exerts almost continuous pressure in that direction, pressure that is bound to produce more movement as the pass.” But a constitutional‐law professor with a national reputation rejects this view. “Rehnquist is still a lone wolf, not a leader,” he observed. “He isn't pulling any of the other Nixon justices with him when he sees these issues in terms of absolutes. I think he's actually had the opposite effect on Powell, who is a gentle sort of man, anxious to weigh each case rather than respond dogmatically.” ‘Some of his opinions are so well done,’ says one liberal lawyer, ‘that they almost persuade you his underlying position isn't outrageous.’ Rehnquist has assumed his role as point man of the conservative counterattack in the Court more in the manner of William Buckley than that of the traditionally dreary, humorless polemicists of the right. His opinions have style, bite and even an occasional dash of wit. Hilarious he is not, except in contrast with his colleagues, but that contrast has led one Court correspondent to call him “Laugh‐a‐minute Bill.” He set a new sort of precedent by leading off an opinion on one Government agency swallow ing another's jurisdiction by quoting a limerick: There was a young lady from Niger Who smiled as she rode on a tiger. They returned from the ride With the lady inside And a smile on the face of the tiger. Of a credit‐card thief, he wrote: “In the spring of that year, respondent's fancy lightly turned to thoughts of the sunny southland, and he ... headed for Southern California.” In a profession that has rarely fostered good writers and even more rarely elevated them to the bench, he has established himself as a noteworthy exception. “Some of Rehnquist's opinions are so well organized and have such surface clarity and polish,” one liberal attorney observed, “that they almost persuade you his underlying position isn't outrageous.” Rehnquist's ideological mind‐set shines through his votes and opinions with a clarity not always attained by his fellow justices. He believes the states should be allowed to legislate largely as they choose, with Federal constitutional limits applied sparingly in only the most flagrant instances of abuse. He sees the equal protection clause of the Constitution in a narrow historical framework, helping blacks but not available to other victims of discrimination. And yet, when the issue is Federal aid to parochial schools, he is able to interpret the Constitution in a much more charitable manner. In criminal cases, Rehnquist has displayed an uncanny ability to find almost uniform merit in the prosecution's claims that the accused had been treated fairly. In antitrust cases, he has sided consistently with business against the Government, in labor cases with employers against unions. In a speech last month, he tentatively identified himself as a “libertarian,” the sort of political theorist who believes that minimum‐wage and maximum‐hour legislation interferes impermissibly with an employer's freedom of choice. The pattern of Rehnquist's philosophy during his two‐plus terms on the Court emerges from a highly consistent if somewhat contentious record. These are some of its highlights: ■ He was the lone dissenter in the Court's first major decision that an enclave of all‐black schools made the entire Denver city system unacceptable. Rehnquist accused his colleagues of taking “a long leap” by applying such standards to communities where school segregation had resulted from economic and social patterns rather than from past laws barring biracial schools. ■ He was the lone dissenter in a leading women's‐rights case in which the Court held that husbands of female members of the armed forces are entitled to the same dependency allowances as wives of male members. He declined to write an opinion. ■ He was the lone dissenter to a decision striking down as unconstitutional a New York law prohibiting aliens from holding civil‐service jobs, and one of two justices who dissented when the Court invalidated a Connecticut ban on aliens taking the state bar examination. Rehnquist insisted that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause guaranteed fair treatment to blacks but not to victims of other kinds of discrimination. ■ He was the sole dissenter when the Court ruled unconstitutional an Arizona law prohibiting poor people from receiving free nonemergency medical or hospital care unless they had a year's residence in the county. Rehnquist said the State Legislature should have had the right to decide who receives such treatment and who does not. ■ He was one of two justices to refuse to accept the Court's landmark decision legalizing abortions in all but end‐of‐term pregnancies. Rehnquist accused the majority of “judicial legislation” rather than constitutional interpretation.

He maintained that legislatures were entitled to draw a line for teachers' withdrawal somewhere “short of the delivery room.” ■ He wrote the dissenting opinion for a three‐justice minority when the Court struck down New York's program of financial aid to parochial schools and parents of their pupils. Rehnquist protested that the proposed tax benefits for parents were “indistinguishable in principle” from the property tax exemption given churches, which the Court upheld most recently in 1970. ■ He wrote the dissent for himself and the three other Nixon justices in the decision abolishing capital punishment, questioning the authority of the Court to invalidate laws that had been approved by elected legislatures. Such notable dissents aside, Rehnquist has assumed a prominent positive role on the Court as a frequent spokesman for the evolving majority that has produced a series of criminal law rulings favoring society's interest in law‐enforcement and security over the need to protect rights of the accused. During his two full terms, Rehnquist has written a dozen majority opinions in criminal cases, coming down squarely on the side of the prosecution in all but one. Among his opinions were those permitting Federal agents to lure a defendant into crime if he had a “predisposition” to commit it anyway, authorizing a warrantless search of the locked trunk of a car of an arrested drunken driver and approving the warrantless search for narcotics of persons stopped for minor traffic offenses. Tracing Rehnquist's philosophical development as an adult is like charting the evolution of the single‐cell amoeba. It has not changed a bit. The Justice's views on the law, the Constitution, discrimination and crime seem indistinguishable today from those friends recall in his late adolescence. While most people's views evolve and shift as they grow older, Rehnquist's conservative outlook seems to have been adopted and then flash‐frozen while he was an undergraduate at Stanford, a period that also spanned three years in the Army Air Corps during World War II. A law‐school classmate at Stanford, an unabashed liberal, recalls: “Rehnquist was very consistently more than just conservative. Even then, he was clearly marching to a different drummer. He was cold, remote and dour. I always thought maybe he was weaned at too early an age.” Another fellow student observed: “Bill was the school conservative. A lot of us had mixed views about him. He was very sharp, a brilliant student, but so far‐out politically that he was something of a joke.” After finishing first in his law‐school class, Rehnquist spent a year as clerk for Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, a reward that only goes to a few outstanding students. There, in 1952, he wrote a memorandum declaring that separate but equal schools for whites and blacks, still legal at the time, were “right and should be reaffirmed.” Later, during his Senate confirmation hearings, he maintained that these were Justice Jackson's views, not his own. In 1954, however, Jackson was one of the nine justices who unanimously rejected that segregation policy. After his clerkship, Rehnquist decided to begin law practice in the Southwest; legend has it that he flipped a coin and moved to Phoenix rather than Albuquerque. An Arizona lawyer who got to know him well recalls that his conservative orientation was already well‐fixed when he arrived. “I don't know where Bill's philosophy came from,” he said. “It couldn't have been from his parents, who were middle‐of‐the‐road middle‐class Middle Westerners. Somewhere, years before, he had developed a totally different viewpoint.” In Phoenix, Rehnquist's positions remained consistent. In a 1957 political speech, he denounced as “left‐wing” Justices Warren, Douglas and Black for “making the Constitution say what they wanted it to say.” A few months later, in an article in U.S. News and World Report, he characterized the political philosophy of the Warren Court as “extreme solicitude for the claim's of Communists and other criminal defendants, expansion of Federal power at the expense of state power, great sympathy toward any Government regulation of business.” In 1964 he campaigned ardently for Barry Goldwater. This sort of alignment be came a political and professional asset when Richard Nixon went to the White House in 1968. When the new President summoned Richard Kleindienst from his Phoenix law firm to become Deputy Attorney General, Kleindienst brought Rehnquist with him, to head the Office of Legal Counsel under Attorney General John Mitchell. Of the three men, Rehnquist seems clearly to have survived the association most successfully. The Justice Department legal counsel had traditionally been a Congressional spokesman for the Administration, but under Rehnquist, the little‐noticed post assumed a new prominence. Eighteen times in a little more than two years, the Assistant Attorney General climbed Capitol Hill to explain his President's views on such topics as obscenity, campaign reform, wiretapping, war powers and executive privilege. On the whole, the Senators and Representatives found him well‐informed and articu late, even when they failed to agree with him. “Rehnquist was so well prepared and well spoken that he could make the right‐wing positions sound reasonable to a liberal Congressional committee,” one House Judiciary member recalled. “He was damned effective because there was almost nothing of the right‐wing zealot about him. He was too good a lawyer for that.” On the relatively rare occasions when the Administration's position was at odds with his personal view, Rehnquist managed to convey that fact to Congress without conspicuous disloyalty. White House policy compelled him to testify in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment to prohibit sex‐based discrimination, but his “balanced” presentation acknowledged so many defects in the proposal that it was subsequently quoted effectively by opponents of equal rights. In 1971, after the deathbed retirements of Justices Hugo Black and John Harlan opened two vacancies on the bench and the Senate rejected Presi dent Nixon's nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, the President, under pressure from the American Bar Association to come up with higher caliber candidates, picked Rehnquist, the bright young Justice Department conservative, along with Lewis Powell, a nominal Democrat who had served as president of the A.B.A. Liberals of the Senate Judiciary Committee gave the Rehnquist nomination a searching, even combative review. In the course of it, there were charges that, as a Republican poll‐watcher in Phoenix in 1964, Rehnquist had harassed black would‐be voters, but he denied any connection with the incident, and the committee cleared him by a 12‐4 vote. Only six weeks after his nomination, the full Senate confirmed Rehnquist 68‐26, and he took his seat on the high tribunal in January, 1972. It did not take Justice Rehnquist long to become the subject of a virtually unprecedented Court controversy. He only had an opportunity to hear some two dozen cases in January and February that the Court went on to decide before adjourning in June, but two of them involved disputes on which he had taken a public position as a Justice Department official. Federal statute requires a judge to disqualify himself in any case in which he is “so related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to render it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit.” Canons of the American Bar Association, approved in the summer of 1972, require any judge “to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety” and a judge who formerly worked for a Government agency to disqualify himself from deciding a case when “his impartiality might reasonably be questioned beof such association.” But Rehnquist did not hesitate to cast the deciding vote against the challenge of antiwar activists to the Pentagon's political surveillance program, despite the fact that he had testified before a Senate committee that those same plaintiffs had no legal right to be in court. Or to cast another tie‐breaking vote to require Senator Mike Gravel to testi fy before a grand jury about publication of the Pentagon Papers, despite the fact that Rehnquist had helped organize the Government's lawsuit to block that publication. So incensed were the losing parties in both cases that they accompanied their routine motion for rehearing with a highly unroutine motion that Justice Rehnquist disqualify himself—the legal term is “recuse”—the second time around. The Court denied the first motion, but the challenged justice himself denied the second. No one really knew whether this was proper Supreme Court procedure because, as far as anyone could remember, such a motion had been made before. In support of his refusal to give way, Rehnquist issued a 15‐page memorandum, maintaining that the new A.B.A. canons were not “materially different” from the Federal statute, a dubious legal reading at best, and that he had not been directly involved in the cases of Senator Gravel or the surveillance protestors. In his book, “The Appearance of Justice,” John MacKenzie summed it up this way: “Try as he might to restate the matter, Rehnquist judged the rights of the parties after giving his view that one of the parties had no rights and after working to defeat the other party's claim to rights.” Lest anyone suspect him of subsequent repentance, Rehnquist devoted an entire 22‐page address to the Association of the Bar of the City of New York a year later to debunking the notion that judges should disqualify themselves when they have previously expressed views on the issues or parties before them in court. Judges, lawyers and the public, he observed self‐consciously, have come to regard a judge's refusal to disqualify himself as “roughly speaking, a lesserincluded offense within the crime of bribery.” In 1970 as Assistant Attorney General, Rehnquist drafted for the White House a proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting busing to achieve desegregation and a legal memorandum in support of the amendment. But when the Supreme Court ruled last June against merging the heavily black Detroit schools with those in the virtually all‐white suburbs, Rehnquist did not hesitate to sit on the case or to vote with the 5‐to‐4 majority. Only when the issue of President Nixon's refusal to surrender the White House tapes arrived at the Supreme Court did Rehnquist feel called upon to disqualify himself. He never revealed his reasoning—some justices do, others do not—but it was widely assumed that he stepped aside because of his past association with former Attorney General John Mitchell, one of the Watergate cover‐up defendants. We will probably never know whether he would have joined the unanimous ruling against Nixon or voiced another lone dissent. Beyond his duties on the bench and such speaking appearances, Rehnquist leads a quiet life in McLean, the open‐country Virginia suburb favored by the Kennedys among others. His wife is the former Natalie Cornell, whom he met during his clerkship, while she was working for the Central Intelligence Agency. They have three teen‐age children, a boy and two girls, who appear to be in the family tradition. When Rehnquist's nomination to the Supreme Court was announced, a classmate of one of his daughters told her father: “I sure hope he's not as conservative as Janet.” One sharp‐eyed reporter maintains that Rehnquist is a girl‐watcher, that his attention to the legal arguments wavers when a comely visitor enters or leaves the court room. That is as far as anyone has ever gone toward classifying him as a swinger, and the Supreme Court offers relatively few opportunities for even this innocent pastime. He is not generally observable on the Washington cocktail circuit, as are Justices Douglas and Stewart upon occasion. Rehnquist is far less consistent in his personal behavior off the bench than in his judicial behavior on it. Aides report that he is very sensitive about receiving more attention than do his senior colleagues on the high court; he declined to grant an interview in connection with this article, apparently on those grounds. He occasionally will talk with newsmen whom he trusts to preserve his anonymity, but nothing more than a harmless anecdote has ever surfaced in print as a result. His last on‐the‐record interview appeared in 1971 after he had won Senate confirmation, but before he took his seat on the Court. But this retiring posture is not reflected in his professional judgments off the bench, which move freely into controversy. He has joined Chief Justice Burger in charging that the Supreme Court is overworked and does not have enough time for careful deliberation. Besides his outspoken stand on judicial disqualification, he has criticized the “ethical overreaction” of lawyers who shun social contact with judges. When he does not choose to discuss serious professional issues, Justice Rehnquist can charm a legal audience out of its writs with soothing oratorical Pablum. At an American Bar Association luncheon earlier this year, he said that bar activity was “as essential to being a good lawyer as attendance at circuses was to being a citizen of Rome.” During 20 graceful minutes, he quoted Edmund Burke, alluded briefly to the possibility that a client's interest and the national interest may not always be synonymous and left his audience flattered by his visit, but otherwise intellectually undisturbed. “Bill is a slick article,” one of his colleagues concluded. “Even when you disagree with him, you have to concede that he has brought a touch of class to the Court. He may never make Chief, but he's not going to be one of those men who slip onto the Court and then off unnoticed. Everybody will know he was here.” ■ Rehnquist has assumed his role as point man for the conservative counterattack more in the style of William Buckley than that of the dreary, humorless polemicists of the right.

Dear Ann Landers: Is incest hereditary?,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/13/archives/dear-ann-landers-is-incest-hereditary-from-shamokin-pa-to-the-fiji.html,"The trouble was, he just wouldn't take her advice. “Oh, I always found him fairly easy to talk to,” says the doll‐sized woman in the leopard‐print robe that reveals lot of cleavage. “He was really quite a reasonable man. “Whenever I had an opportunity to see him—say at a small social function—I would try to get him off to one side.” (One pictures her advancing relentlessly in the black sequins‐with‐marabou she likes to wear for Occasions.) “I'd say, ‘Now look! We've got to get rid of this war!’ And then he'd say, ‘I know, but how do you do it?’” She checks out her apartment's 15th‐story view of Lake Michigan and Chicago's Gold Coast and sighs, “I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson.” As for Richard Nixon, he'd have resigned five months earlier had he taken the advice she directed his way in a speech at Notre Dame last April. But if the gang at the White House doesn't always listen to the lady with the syndicated dimples, 56‐year‐old Eppie (Esther Pauline) Lederer—who is Ann Landers to an audience she round‐numbers at 60 million—has been affecting life, thought and social custom with a continuing impact such temporary kings might envy. Her “Ask Ann Landers” column appears in 810 newspapers from Medicine Hat, Canada, to Dothan, Ala., from Shamokin, Pa., to the Fiji Islands. (“They ask the same things in Fiji as they do in Toledo.”) She survives a daily saturation bombing of mail soliciting her opinion on everything from whether “you do a woman favor when you tell her she has lipstick on her teeth,” (yes) to “Is incest hereditary?” (no)—from heartbreak questions of loss, despair, dysfunction and disability to speculations concerning the proclivity of raccoons to breed through the nose and gestate in the sinus cavity. Fortunately, some readers merely need to know—preferably by return mail—what life is. Surveys that measure such things show that in paper after paper she is first‐read and favorite; “Dear Ann Landers” is frequently digested with morning toast before the headlines. Hers is said be the most widely followed column in the world, a claim also made on behalf of her twin sister, who writes similarly pungent counsel under the name of Abigail Van Buren. Humorist George Me would have called her Sassy Savant. In her natural lunchbox style—pithy, punchy, earthy and often snappily amusing—she has addressed herself to a regular stock company of American characters: the “funny” uncle, the meddling mother‐in‐law, the boss who collects pornography, the miniskirted (“Nobody would ever dream I'm 36”) mama who chicken‐frugs away the night with teen‐age daughter's boyfriend. She brooks no nonsense. “Bubs,” “Busters” and “Kiddos” by the columnload had better shape up and “quitcherkidden.” Miss Icarus, who writes she wants to marry her fiancé's father, is advised “Drop Daedalus,” and the actress whose true love beats her to improve her art by acquainting her with the range of human emotions is cautioned, “If he doesn't know how Sarah Bernhardt lost leg, don't tell him; he might get ideas.” Certain griefs earn compassion and special endearments: “honey,” “dear” or even “buttercup.” “Terrible things can happen to some very nice people,” she says, and to these she doles out cheer, comfort, support (frequently with the names appropriate community‐service agencies) or a typical, “And don't forget about me, toots, anytime you want to unload. That's what I'm here for.” She is not always thanked. “This is to let you know that I took your advice and it wrecked my whole life,” writes Heartbroken Edna, who went along with the suggestion that she tell her nowdeparted fiancé of the illegitimate child in her past. “Get your head out of mothballs!” yowl three 12‐year‐old “refined ladies from nice families.” But she is publicly kissed by admiring strangers wherever she goes (“You helped me raise my children”), given standing ovations at schools (“I asked you things I didn't dare discuss at home”), has been named Woman of the Year by six organizations and is a regular on “Most Admired” and “Most Influential” lists. A staff of eight secretaries (“They're almost all college graduates; I'm not!”) sorts out the daily deluge of 1,000 or more letters. She calls this daily Krakatoa of correspondence “a sacred trust between me and my readers,” and when a newspaper employe in the East recently violated that trust by penciling a comment on a forwarded “Dear Ann” letter, he got a crackling reminder of her eyes‐only policy. Eyes only, too: a letter from pal Hubert Humphrey which she says concedes “I should have listened, Eppie; you were right about Vietnam.” (He couldn't do much with Lyndon, either,” she notes, “which was one of his problems.”) Nearly three‐ quarters of the letters are requests for advice general reader comment. Of this number, half are anonymous, and these go to Landers herself. From them she selects the “gut letters” that will ultimately appear—three a day, seven days a week, her column. Though she spends three hours a day in her Chicago Sun‐Times office, actual column preparation and writing is done at home. She swears by her favorite possession, a paper‐clipencrusted bust of John Kennedy, that every word under her byline is her own—columns, books and pamphlets. She is frequently accused of inventing reader letters. “A person would have to be psychotic to make this stuff up,” she says. One‐quarter of the daily mail contains requests for Landers‐written pamphlets: “Teen‐Age Sex and Ten Ways to Cool it,” “Alcoholism—Hope and Help,” “The Key to Popularity” and nine other 25cto‐$1.00 miniguides to social behavior and contemporary crisis. Most of the mail that is signed and return‐addressed receives prompt staff‐written answers, based on Landers guidelines and customtailored to the inquiry. Difficult or unusual signed letters are flagged to Landers or community‐service organizations and a vast referral file is maintained of health and counseling services throughout the country. A “philosophy session” held every few weeks with visiting medical and psychiatric consultants is meant to keep the secretarial staff au courant with latest opinions and Landers‐approved viewpoints. About a quarter of the mail is from teenagers and the bulk of the rest from 30‐45‐year‐olds—nearly half of them male, she says. But she hears from prepubescents with sibling grief and a 103‐year‐old faithful follower in Cleveland who reads the column without glasses. A National Education Association survey once indicated that Landers had a larger following among teachers than any other columnist; in fact it would be hard to find a social, economic or work category that doesn't “Dear Ann” her. What are the biggest concerns? “Loneliness and people who don't know what to do with their lives ... ‘Should I leave him?’ ‘Should I kick him out?’ ‘What can I do about his—or her—drinking?’ ‘What are we to do about these kids?’ “With teenagers, it's a toss‐up between sex and trouble with parents; the drug questions are tapering off. I'm very sympathetic with the kids and with the parents. There have been so many changes in the last 10 years and more in the last 25 than in the previous 250. A lot of kids hate their parents; probably kids always have, but they're expressing it now. Many are in therapy and it has strewed up a lot of them into thinking their parents wrecked them. I've said in my column, ‘All right, if you don't like what you are, make some changes, Bub.’ A good therapist will get a kid past hating and blaming his parents and on to understanding and building a life.” (Misery, however, is not her sole concern. A sort of Landers lechery poll has recently evolved from her mail. At a reader's request, she compiled a survey among women to determine which males—by occupation—most frequently try to seduce them. At final count, it was doctors by a stethoscope; clergy collared second, with dentists catching up, lawyers gaining and professors—“It's that or flunk” —closing in fast.) “I view my column as an opportunity to educate. I want to let people in trouble know that others have problems, too. I want to be the shoulder to cry on,” she says earnestly. “Maybe I can't solve the problem, but at least I can turn on the light so they can see it. People are lonely, anguished ... if I can give some support, what a blessing! What more could anyone want out of life?” “Eppie just loves telling the world how to behave,” says friend. Is it frightening being mentor to millions? “Never! I answer one person and forget the 59,999,999 others.” (That cool extends to private life. Trapped in her nightgown by a selflocking door in a St. Regis corridor, she commanded by house‐phone, “Send up your oldest bellboy!”) Wedding etiquette and woe swell the mail sacks. A “Bride's Guide” booklet can be ordered from the Landers office for 35c, but it provides. scant help for such letter writers as the pregnant bride whose father threatened to have groom‐to‐be arrested for the “rape” she denied (“Shut up,” she reported papa yelled. “If I say you were raped, you were raped!”). It does, however, give such modern guidelines as proper roles for the wedding principal's illegitimate progeny (ring‐bearing and flowerstrewing are frowned upon) and garb for those pregnant and altar‐bound: “Better not plan on a white bridal gown; the best bet is an ensemble with loose‐fitting coat.” Drug‐related queries have abated from the poisonous flowering in the late nineteensixties. “My answer to your questions,” she characteristically writes, “would cut no mustard. You might as well ask your mother. The opinions of the country's most distinguished psychiatrists, however, might make a dent.” She tries to achieve balance, though most reflect prevailing cautionary medical views. She opposes the legalization of marijuana but deplores criminalization of youthful offenders. Her booklet, “Straight Dope on Drugs,” is a direct, unemotional and readable compilation of properties, effects and legal ramifications, to heroin. It's a far cry from the fifties, when Landers‐column headlines reflected the travail of the day: “IS TEACHER'S TIGHT DRESS CORRUPTING PUPILS?,” or, “TWO FLASHY GIRLS LURE BOYS TO APARTMENT.” (“My buddy and I were in a high‐class lounge and before you could say, ‘rum and Coca‐Cola,’ they were sitting at our table.”) “Stay away from dogs if you don't want fleas” answers then came a lot easier than those addressed more recently to “Speed Freak” and “Nothing to Live For.” Mind ‐ jarring trivia and slipped‐gear logic provide res pite from the daily litanies of anguish. One man solicited the legal requirements for having himself embalmed and buried at the wheel of his beloved 1939 Dodge. Landers's underground adviser (her funeraldirector son‐in‐law) recommended either three adjoining plots to lodge the Dodge or cremation and storage in the car's ashtray. A not‐quite widow devoted five pages of inquiry to contemplated funerary chic: “Could a veil like Jackie Kennedy's be worn with glasses, or should I get contact lenses? Are white gloves too dressy?” Despite such letters, she is never contemptuous of her readers' need for her. “I have been very lucky,” she says. “I have good health, amazing vitality, good head, good body, a wonderful husband and daughter. Anybody who has it as good as I have has a responsibility to do some thing for those who haven't. And most haven't. “I never insult or make fun of the person with the problem. And I never sacrifice sound advice for a laugh.” Almost before her column is set in type, its reverberations can be felt from suburban breakfast nook to Senate Dining Room. A million Landers‐inspired letters to legislators in support of the National Cancer Act, for instance, spurred a $100‐million appropriation. Such power to mobilize support inundates her office with requests for backing —worthy cause and crank's fancy alike. An inaccurate or controversial column reply, a provocative question or the most innocuous assertion can set off mushroom clouds of reader response and endless fallout concerning such things as acceptable hair lengths, the ability of a woman who has not been pregnant to breastfeed or the efficacy of doing housework in the nude. Seven thousand lawyers wrote to protest gratuitous and incorrect advice from a letter signed Legal Secretary. (Ann is quick with a mea culpa: “Twenty swats for me with a rolled up writ of replevin” or “I'll take 10 lashes with an old prayer shawl.”) A newspaper error, the omission of an ingredient in a reader‐requested Landers recipe favorite (meatloaf), unleashed 3,000 outraged “stick to advice, the dog wouldn't eat it” letters. Correction only loosed another torrent—helpful suggestions such as “try whipping cream for water.” “I wrote, ‘Look, the recipe is a darn good one from my sister in Omaha, Mrs. David Brodkey. If you don't like it, eat lamb chops!’” Meatloaf purists rushed to dial the Nebraska sister and alerted the police when they couldn't get through to the by‐now Bell‐shocked Mrs. Brodkey. “A little bacon On top adds flavor,” brought 17 rabbinical outcries; several thousand new requests poured in from those who “lost the first one.” Last in an estimated 20,000 meatloaf missives was an appeal for a Chinese translation of the recipe for the reader's Oriental cook. “Because your name is on the list of the most‐admired women in the world, Miss Landers, means that you go out of your way for people.” Landers, by then a dazed cookery drop‐out, advised, “Try Mme. Chiang KaiShek; she was on the MostAdmired list too.” Critics accuse mail oracles of playing God‐cum‐Freud, and cite the danger and possible damage to the vulnerable. Readers' letters, they point out, may omit significant detail and bend situation reality to their own biased or neurotic view. Others try on advice that doesn't fit them. Worse, it's charged, newspaper nostrums may deter or delay disturbed people from getting live professional counsel; advice may be oversimplified and based on insufficient data or geared to the entertaining answer. Landers, they note—like most of her past and present colleagues—has had no experience in psychiatric or social work. Ann herself is convinced of the solidity of her product and an army of medical and psychiatric advisers and auditors give her a glowing, sometimes panegyrical bill of health on all counts. “I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space. But in 810 cities, we know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem. The dean of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Robert Ebert, says we run the most effective social‐service agency in the world. “I know that I'm giving the very best possible advice, and I work like a dog to get it.” The phone calls to her network of experts cost more than $24,000 annually. Dr. Robert Moser, editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, says, “Her mind is somewhere between a buzz saw and a filing cabinet, and because of her incredible contacts she has at her fingertips a cadre of the best medical brains in the country. Everyone is willing to help her because she has enormous power. People ask her questions they'd never ask their doctor.” She has taken doctors to task for just that in a recent magazine article, charging that many tune out the cries for help—particular. ly in sexual matters—that eventually end up in her mailbag. She sits on the Board of Overseers of Harvard Medical School, is a trustee of the Menninger Foundation and Mayo Foundation Sponsors' Committee and the Chicago Rehabilitation Institute and is the only woman member of the National Dermatology (despair is often skin deep) Foundation. She is an active participant in all. “I mean business when I accept one of these positions; I won't allow my name to be used just to decorate stationery.” Though irate readers have accused her of being a shill for the A.M.A. and the American Psychiatric Association, she can dish out strong medicine to an occasional errant Welby. Psychiatrists are especially subject to criticism. “Your chances of getting a good one are about 50‐50,” she says. (Her latest columnblast at chiropractors set off a predictable furious postal deluge, along with—anonymously—a photograph of a bulletin board whose sole message was, “DID YOU READ WHAT THE JEWISH BITCH SAID ABOUT CHIRO‐PRACTORS NOW?”) To help with religious problems, she has rallied an ecumenical council of her own, and clear favorite on the side of the angels is the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president of the University of Notre Dame, to whom she often turns for theological and moral counsel. His photograph hangs in her hall, its signature, “Love, but no kisses.” She signs her let ters to him the same way, but sometimes adds a jaunty, “Darn it !” Among the custommade rugs, paneling imported from a British castle, mother‐of‐pearl inlaid chairs, huge 15th‐century kneeling angels she calls “the girls,” Picasso, Dali, Renoir and Ming treasures in the Landers/Lederer apartment, an unexpected sculpture of a horse‐drawn cart loaded with assorted poultry cages draws the eye. It may be a reminder of notso‐fine‐feathered beginnings when her father peddled chickens in Sioux City, Iowa. Abraham Friedman fled Russia with his wife Rebecca to avoid conscription in the Czar's army and quickly parlayed the chicken‐vending wagon into a movie and vaudeville chain that spanned three states. “I am typically upper middle class, Midwestern Jewish,” and this — says Landers —has shaped her thinking, her humor, the column and its style. “I grew up,” she once wrote, “in an atmosphere electric with Yiddish adages. My father was sort of a Jewish Lin Yutang and my mother had a talent for fitting an appropriate expression to any set of circumstances.” Identical twins Esther Pauline (Eppie/Ann Landers) and Pauline Esther (Popo/Abigail Van Buren) followed two older Friedman girls in 1918. Born center‐stagers, both studied the violin and neither has ever been content to play second fiddle. They were a vibrant, dress alike matched pair, in the classroom, on dates and finally at the altar in a double ceremony that continued their 21‐year‐old habit of astounding Sioux Cityites. Ann Landers's unchanging warning of the perils of interfaith marriage apparently was absorbed at home with parental chopped liver. When fiancé Jules Lederer was introduced for family inspection, papa Friedman questioned —despite assurances — the blond young man's credentials in the faith, “Say something in Yiddish,” demanded the patriarch. Jules thought it over. “I vanna go for a valk,” he ventured, which evidently was good enough. (Daughter Margo recalls that as a Brandeis student she once requested permission from home to date the Aga Khan's Harvardbased son. “You say the boy's name is Kahn?” said Eppie. “Go ahead, doll.”) “Most married people, if they are honest,” she has written, “will admit that marriage isn't all they hoped it would be.” In her own case, she admits, the gypsy violins of courtship were muted when she “settled down to the hardships of everyday living. We had a child and moved around a great deal—to wherever Jules could make another five dollars.” Good marriages, she allows, may be made in heaven, but “the maintenance work must be done down here.” “Ann Landers can tell woman to scrub floors and sweat over the kitchen stove because she doesn't have to! I'll bet that dame has hired help all over the place,” an Ohio husband reported his wife as saying in reaction to a 1968 column chiding “sloppy housekeepers.” “Your wife is right. I don't do housework, but I did plenty of it the first 10 years of my marriage. And I didn't hate it or feel it was beneath my dignity. My house looked fairly presentable and so did my husband's shirts, which ironed. And nobody ever died from my cooking.” She once comforted a struggling housewife, “Pity the poor millionaire; he'll never know the thrill of paying the final installment.” It is a thrill she has had to forgo. Husband Jules, former owner of Budget Rent‐A‐Car (“Pretty good,” she says, “for a guy who took on the world with a ninth‐grade education and a hole in his sock”) now has international business interests that keep him away from their 14‐room apartment at least one–third of the year. His constant travels, she says, “have taught me how to be alone without feeling sorry for myself. He really does enjoy my success, but he's always insisted on supporting me.” Though she warns that earth‐bound unions lose heavenly transport, she is nonetheless inspired by her own to rhapsodic variations Liszt wouldn't have dared. In column and conversation, he is “my doll, my beautiful guy; he is my best friend and I am his.” She inscribes the books she writes and the linings of a herd of fur coats, “Jules' Wife.” A new acquaintance recently said of daughter Margo Furth, “I just met the camplest lady; she has a big framed picture of Ann Landers in her bedroom!” Now 34 and mother of three, Margo once had her own syndicated column and—along with the familial urge to write—has the maternal luminous skin (“I envy people with a few wrinkles”), high cheekbones, and congenital outspokenness. “I think I've always scandalized my mother, but she's behaved very well and never asked me not to do something because it wouldn't be compatible with the image of her column. She tries very hard not to give advice, though she sometimes sneaks little in.” Landers has had frequent admonitions for grandchildren‐spoilers (“Ddn't tell me wait till I have some of my own; I do, and I'm a pretty tough old cookie”) and meddlers (“Margo is perfectly capable of raising her own children”). “She's pretty businesslike with my kids,” says Margo. “She wants to teach, instill values. They go to her house for a coloring contest—she's not an impartial judge; who ever needs the lift most, wins —and for dinner.” Basic Landers laws for inlaws are: live separately, be friendly, husbands and wives owe first allegiance to each other. Readers don't always get the message. One husband drove his mother to her bridge game when his wife's labor pains began. A lament signed “Miami” stated, “Whenever you print a letter knocking a mother‐in‐law, I receive two copies the next day. One I'm sure is from my daughterin‐law and the other from her miserable mother. I can't tell you how it hurts a mother's heart to raise a boy and then hand him over to a lazy goodfor‐nothing who uses plastic tablecloths and buys readymade potato salad. You should live to be a hundred, Ann Landers, and never know from such things.” Her own mother‐in‐law, to whom she once awarded “World's Best M.I.L.” medal, called her “Eppeleh with the Two sons‐in‐law, past and present, give high marks to her ability to take her own advice and “M.Y.O.B.,”—a vintage Landersism meaning mind your own business. In 1955, after a series of moves around the country, 37‐year‐old Eppie beat out 27 competitors for the just‐vacated Ann Landers slot on The Chicago Sun‐Times. The “Ann Landers” name was a 1952 inspiration of editor Pete Akers, who thought it had a nice ring. The first and only other “Landers,” nurse named Ruth Crowley, wrote the column till her death three years later. Sister Popo needed only six more months to create an identical role for herself on The San Francisco Chronicle. Before moving to Chicago, Eppie had begun to make her presence felt in Wisconsin politics when, in a 1954 effort to get her licks in at then‐Senator Joseph McCarthy, she won a hotly‐contested Democratic county chairmanship. But neither sister had ever held a job or published a word. Both had married before completing Methodist Morningside College in Sioux City. Their readers weren't worried about credentials, though, and the lively, irreverent columns were an immediate hit. Syndication in newspapers was not far behind, thus launching race for space and a furious feud that finally exhausted itself in rapprochement years later. Since then, frequent phone calls, letters and joint anniversary celebrations attest to the détente. Dr. George Engel, professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of Rochester and himself a twin, says, “Most identical twins—torn between the need for preserving the unique and attention‐getting relationship and finding singular identity—struggle vigorously to keep their competitive feelings under control. If a break occurs, it is likely to be serious and painful.” Deprived of “the other” during their rift, Popo and Eppie had compensatory, perhaps more perfect pairings—one with “Abby” and one with “Ann.” (“Eppie never really reveals herself,” says an intimate. “Sometimes think she's gotten lost in the identity of Ann Landers.”) It's intriguing to wonder if the biological caprice that is twinning, with its psychic effects on the Sioux City sibyls, has had secondary impact on all those Distraughts, Left Behinds and Troubled in Topekas out there in universal readerland. In 1958, Widow, 34, solicited Landers's blessing for a proposea motor trip to Mount Rushmore. Son Ronnie, 8, would share a room with Widow's fiancé; separate quarters— of course—for her. “I hope you will see the educational value in this trip, Miss Landers,” she ventured, “and say it's all right, since my son wants to report on Mount Rushmore to his class.” Hard lines for Widow, 34. She was briskly informed that trip to altar precedes trip to Great Stone Faces. “It is not proper for unmarried people to travel together, even with an 8‐year‐old chaperon.” “Eppie has always been a puritan,” says an old friend. Through the years, the columns have been studded with laudatory references to “white‐flower girls” (virgins), and cautionary tales of the seduced‐andabandoned. Though her views on virginity have mellowed through the years, her pamphlet “Love and Sex—and How to Tell the Difference” still concludes, “I hope all of you someday will know this most exquisite of all experiences, the moment when you give your most precious gift—yourself—to your beloved in marriage. You will be glad you waited and ever thankful that you refused to settle for a shoddy susbstitute.” (“If men admire virgins so ardently,” counters a letter signed Knob Hill, “why don't they leave a few around?”) Teen‐age attraction is “one set of glands calling to another;” her “Necking and Petting” rules specify “all hands on deck” (a neat trick for petters) “and four feet on the floor.” However, she has been in the vanguard for sex education at home and in the classroom and was one of the first popular columnists to discuss V.D. She was an early advocate, too, of experimentation and freedom of sexual expression between married people. Nothing is indecent or unnatural, she has counseled, that is pleasing to both and degrading to neither—not revolutionary doctrine, but liberating revelation in many American homes. “Many are cold, but few are frozen,” she has instructed U.S. husbands. “Communicate!” she exhorts wives. “Tell your husband what you like and what you don't.” (A young bride's tearful complaint of unappreciated husbandly ear‐blowing prompted telegraphed instructions from the column queen herself: “TELL HIM TO STOP IT!”) Joyful spankers and spankees, swingers and swappers, husbands and wives with his‐andhers girdles and bras are sick, all sick, says Landers, but—she tells them—“If it's O.K. with you, it's O.K. with me.” “My two biggest changes over the years have been in the areas of divorce and virginity. There was a time when I thought that no unmarried girl, no matter how old, should have any physical relations with a man. Well, I see now that is not the brightest approach. Some girls can handle sex outside of marriage if they're sufficiently mature ... an awfully smart 19 or a darn steady, stable 20. But I firmly believe high school girls should stay intact.” And Landers standards preclude joint unwed domesticity, even as a test for marriage. Perhaps the biggest shift in Landers's attitude has been toward divorce, once rigidly opposed. “How come your dateline isn't Vatican City?” demanded Jaundiced Eye in 1962. A decade later, spiraling divorce rates and, friends say, her own daughter's divorce and remarriage, have moved her to countenance what man sometimes puts asunder. “Apparently,” she concedes, “some people must live through one unsuccessful marriage to know how to make a second marriage work.” It is rumored that when sister “Dear Abby” decided to investigate a new sociological trend firsthand, she put on an “Ann Landers wig” and went to see a porno movie. Ann herself met the devil‐in‐theflesh in a TV confrontation last year with actress‐contortionist Linda Lovelace. For the edification of viewers who might have spent the previous six months in Nebuchadnezzar's hanging gardens, Landers unabashedly explained the Lovelace feat by saying that she “accommodates male genitalia deeply.” Years of bizarre mail had not prepared Landers for Linda and her magic tricks; two cultures have rarely run so counter. There was considerable discussion about commitment (or its absence) in coupling animals. At program's end, Ann, grim with professional concern, leaned toward the younger woman. “If you're ever in trouble, dear,” she said, “don't hesitate to write me.” Lovelace peered out from an explosion of curls to murmur, with identical solicitude, “And if you're ever in trouble, don't hesitate to contact me.” The pill and an alleged sexual revolution may have wrested Ann's grip from the chastity chalice, but on several controversial issues—such as support for strong gun‐control legislation—she has a circulation‐be‐damned attitude. John G. Trezevant, executive vice‐president of The Chicago Sun‐Times and The Chicago Daily News, continues to edit her column daily, as he has done since he was a Sun‐Times editor in 1966. (“I do it for friendship and fun, and it takes damn little work.”) “Her policies and replies are all her own,” he says, “though I urge her to stay out of such political things as specific endorsements of candidates or pending legislation. But Eppie's been able to break most of the accepted rules and do things the way she wants by sheer force of personality. If she decided to be a brain surgeon, she'd be cutting heads open in a couple of months ... and finding new ways to do it.” Liquor advertisers have urged some client papers to stop teetotaling Landers from hitting the bottle so hard in her column, a pressure management has not passed on to her, she says. “I'll con tinue talking up A.A. and hammering away at so‐called social drinkers who are really alcoholics. I don't drink or smoke, and it's paid off in enormous energy.” Her strong advocacy of abortion on demand and columns on birth control and vasectomy have loosed landslides of protesting mail. “If I get one more copy of ‘The Diary of an Unborn Child,’” she says, “I'll kill myself.” Her pro‐abortion utterances cost her an honorary degree and the speech she was scheduled to give at one Catholic college, but clerical columnists such as the Rev. Paul Cuddy have nevertheless likened our lady of letters to St. Teresa of Avila. Enraged by her refusal to endorse the American Psychiatric Association's removal of the word “sick” to describe them, a coalition of gay organizations recently picketed what they mistakenly believed to be her residence chanting, “Ann Landers, we won't take your slanders!” She counters that she has been urging self, family and community acceptance — and an end to discrimination — since 1966, when her first column on the subject prompted a Michigan publisher to announce, page one: “There will be no Ann Landers column today; the one she presented was not fit for a family newspaper.” There have been occasional protests from feminists, too, but she",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is relaxing her rigid posture that women belong in the home except in cases of financial need. Now she will say, “The average American woman whose kids don't drive her batty should stay at home at least till they go to nursery school.” She points out that she began her own career when she was 37 and her daughter 15. “I probably could have run for Congress before that,” she says, “but I wouldn't leave my family to go to Washington.” It is clear that stable, hearth‐hugging Mom is still Landers's ideal, but some of the zest is gone, one senses, from the good old “pick up his socks and iron the sheets if that's what your guy likes,” pronouncements. (An enraged wife once wrote, “My husband threw his shirt on the floor and said, ‘Ann Landers said you're supposed to pick it up.’” She has recently issued a statement of support for the Equal Rights Amendment, although “in the beginning, the women's movement turned me off—they were pushy, aggressive and antimale. But the more I began to think about it the more I realized, yeah—they really have something. Women are not paid what they're worth.” (What she's worth—and gets, it is said—is comfortably six‐figured, proof of the marketability of counsel.) She makes nearly 100 speeches throughout the country each year, some without charge for a cause she supports, sometimes for fees that range from $300 for a highschool address to $3,000 for business conventions. She has been paid as much as $5,000 for a single lecture. What she says is often news fodder. “And, if the publisher in some city doesn't like me to speak my mind, which I have to do for my self‐respect, he can lump it.” Since her column may attract more readership than page one in their papers, objecting publishers are likely to opt for the lumps. “Look, there've got to be 8,000 letters here,” she says, pointing to a pile that nearly buckles her home desk. “They're anonymous .... who would know if I put a match to them? But I'll read every one. Now that some people would consider sick.” With the same energy, she hits the floor for daily exercise, wears out relay teams of secretaries, makes innumerable public appearances, strides the mile to and from work and does her mandatory Olympics dash (“Good for the heart!”) up the escalator to her office while lobby saunterers break for cover. Her sense of mission sometimes approaches religiosity. “It's so late, dear,” she tells an interviewer. “Why do you work so hard?” When reminded of her own dizzying day, she protests, “But this is a service!” Later, she'll recline in perfumed bubbles, a buxom Venus in reading glasses, in the kind of mirrored, marbled bathroom they use to pose Miss Februarys for Playboy (not to be confused with her bathroom that has the seashell‐shaped toilet and sink, or the other one with the hand‐laid mosaics featuring water nymphs, fish, vines and Neptune). The famed pouf‐wing hairdo (“I haven't changed in 20 years”) survives the steamy mists while she selects column material from the agony, ineptitude, loneliness and dementia piled at tubside. There is one on pale blue paper that begins, “Dear Miss Landers: The main reason am writing is regarding Nixon, freedom of speech, the right to vote and my ex‐husband.” (It is not known whether Widow, 34—she'd be pushing 50 by now—ever got to see Mount Rushmore.) ■ Dear Ann Landers: I am a 15‐year‐old girl with a terrible problem. I steal from my dad's wallet when he has several bills it and I figure he won't miss one or two. Last week I took $20. We are not poor and I am not hard up for money. In fact, I babysit and have plenty of my own money to buy whatever I want. How can I stop this rotten habit? A THIEF Dear Friend: I urge you to talk to a guidance counselor at school. Since money appears to be plentiful in your family," you could ask your parents to send you to a therapist. No need to be explicit. Simply tell them you feel depressed and troubled and that you want professional help.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ousted St. Peter's Profesor Fights to Retain Post,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/13/archives/ousted-st-peters-professor-fights-to-retain-post-jurisdiction.html,"SOUTH ORANGE — St. Peter's College of Jersey City has refused to renew the contract of Dr. Renee Kogel, the head of its History Department, chairman of the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities and an ardent feminist. Dr. Kogel has charged that the termination of her teaching contract at the end of the current school year is a reprisal for “making the cause of women's rights my own.” The reason given by the college, she said in an interview at her home here, was that she had failed to render “substantial service.” Francis Mertz, St. Peter's executive vice president, asserted that it would be inappropriate to comment on the historian's charges, since the dismissal was being contested. Accusing the college of discrimination because she is a woman, Dr. Kogel has appealed to the state's Division of Civil Rights, as well as to two Federal agencies, the Office of Higher Education of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Jurisdiction Question Dr. Kogel expects no action by the Federal agencies before two years—both have a large backlog of cases—but is hopeful that the state unit will uphold her. St. Peter's moved to dismiss the action before the New Jersey division on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over a private college; however, the state Attorney General's office is reported to be considering the jurisdiction question. Dr. Kogel, who has been teaching at St. Peter's for six years and has the rank of assistant professor, was chosen chairman of the History Department by her colleagues two years ago. Last spring, feeling that she had taught well and had satisfied requirements with the publication of a book, she applied for a promotion. The school gave her a terminal contract instead. “I feel that academic freedom is involved in the issue,” Dr. Kogel said. “I had mentioned abortion and birth control in my courses [St. Peter's is a Roman Catholic college], but this is difficult to prove. “I have been trying to make sure that women get a fair share of the jobs in this coed school, in accordance with Federal guidelines, and to make sure of women's place in continuing, adult education. There has been some resistance to this at the school. “I'm not a strident feminist. I don't hit people over the head with my ideas. But I feel strongly about the women's movement, and I think that women's role throughout history is worth teaching.” According to Dr. Kogel, she has received an “out pouring of sympathy” from St. Peter's faculty members and many offers of help. Several students, she went on, “are trying to bring pressure on the administration to rescind the termination of my contract so that I can continue to earn a living.” Dr. Kogel was graduated from New York University in 1953. She received her master's degree from Wesleyan a year later, and her doctorate in history from Michigan in 1969. In 1972, Dr. Kogel, already a member of the St. Peter's faculty, taught a course on the history of women. A number of males took the course, she recalled, adding that one had said that it changed his marriage through his acceptance of a larger share of household responsibilities. Also as a result of the course, one woman student is now in law school, rather than being simply a housewife, Dr. Kogel said. The historian mentioned her own career as an example of the changes brought by the quickening interest in new roles for women in society. “My first husband wanted me to be mainly a housewife,” Dr. Kogel observed, “but as such my mind was getting rusty. Divorce followed. My present husband [Henry Kogel], a private mathematics teacher, is a feminist and a house husband.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDY FINDS RISK IN SURGERY WORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/15/archives/study-finds-risk-in-surgery-work-anesthetic-gas-suspected-cause-of.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 14—A nationwide survey indicates that women who work in hospital operating rooms run a sharply increased risk of spontaneous abortion, birth defects in their children, and cancer, liver and kidney disease. The survey also indicated that men who work in operating rooms have an increased risk of liver disease and that their children have a statistically significant increase in risk of birth defects. The probable culprit in these occupational health hazards is long‐term exposure to anesthetic gases, according to Dr. Ellis N. Cohen. professor of anesthesiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is chairman of a committee of the American Society of Anesthesiologists that conducted the survey. In a report to the society's annual meeting here today, Dr. Cohen said the survey had indicated that the health hazards do exist among operating room personnel, but did not prove that waste gases from anesthesia are the cause. The gases are under strong suspicion because most operating room personnel are exposed to them regularly and because animal experiments indicate that they can have ill effects on health and the outcome of pregnancy. Strong Recommendation The seven‐man committee recommended strongly in its report that hospitals take steps to eliminate the waste gases. The survey, done by questionnaire, with follow‐up letters to those who did not respond, covered most of the roughly 50,000 American men and women who work regularly in operating rooms in occupations most likely to expose them. These include anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists and other operating room nurse and operating room technicians. The rates of abortion, birth defects and the other health problems among these men and women were compared with those of comparable groups of professionals whose work did not require them to spend much time in operating rooms. The results showed that women anesthetists, operating room nurses and technicians had spontaneous abortion rates 1.3 to twice as high as those of the unexposed persons. The excess risk of cancer was about comparable. The survey also showed that birth defects had occurred twice as frequently in the children of women physicians exponed regularly to the gases as to women physicians not so exposed. However, the numbers involved in this comparison were considered too small to be statistically significant. Even the unexposed wives of male anesthetists had higherthan‐expected risk of birth defects in their children. While both men and women in the exposed group had more than the expected amount of liver disease, the excesses of cancer and kidney disease seemed limited to women. “The results of the survey,” the report concluded, “strongly suggest that working in the operating room (and presumably exposure to trace concentrations of anesthetic agents) entails a variety of health hazards for operating room personnel and their offspring.” At a news conference, Dr. Cohen said an estimated 20 per cent of the roughly 25,000 operating rooms in the United States already had equipment to capture and remove the waste gases from anesthesia. For many hospitals it would cost only about $100 per operating room to provide equipment to remove the gases. While individual patients are not thought to be sufficiently exposed to face the same kinds of risks, a study published earlier this year raised questions concerning the trace gases' effects on a surgeon's performance. Tests, after four hours exposure to gas concentrations in the same range as those of some operating rooms, showed measurable fall off in perceptive, cognitive and fine physical skills. This study was done by Dr. David L. Bruce and colleagues of Northwestern University. The report made public today showed that operating room air may contain as much as 7,000 parts per million of a widely used anesthetic gas nitrous oxide and 85 parts per million of halothane. At the news conference. Dr. Cohen said needed anesthetic effects might require the surgical patient to breath a mixture that is 50 per cent‐500,000 parts per million of anesthetic gas—but this exposure is rela?? brief.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LUTHERANS FOCUS ON WOMEN'S ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/16/archives/lutherans-focus-on-womens-role-panel-to-seek-greater-voice-in.html,"DETROIT, Oct. 15 (UP)—The American Lutheran Church, the ninth‐largest Protestant body in the United States, ended a weeklong convention today by voting to establish an organization to give women a greater voice in church affairs. Delegates voted 431 to 307 to set up a panel of 12 persons, majority of them women, to monitor action giving women more responsibility in governing the 2.5 ‐ million ‐ member church. Delegates also approved spending $659,103, the anticipated budget surplus, for food to feed the world's hungry. They earlier approved a record $26.5‐million budget. The nearly 1,000 delegates debated a wide‐ranging series of social and religious issues, including the controversial question of abortion. Delegates voted 500 to 379 late yesterday to relax a previous church policy and permit abortions in “compelling individual circumstances.” Christians have “a responsibility to make the best possible decision” in considering the termination of a pregnancy “based on the situation and accountability for God, self and neighbor,” the convention said in the resolution on abortion. The resolution, however, reaffirmed the unborn child's right to life. The previous church position permitted abortions only when the health of the mother was endangered. In 1966 and 1970, the church had issued statements saying, “There are times and circumstances when interruption of the pregnancy is necessary for therapeutic reasons.” Last night's resolution rejected induced abortion as a ready solution for problem pregnancies, but allowed church members “the judgment that—all pertinent factors of responsibility considered —the developing life may be terminated to defend the health and wholeness” of those involved. Rejects Sterilization The resolution said that contraception was a viable alternative to ending the life of an unborn infant but rejected voluntary sterilization as a method of preventing pregnancies. The statement also said that church counseling “should offer understanding” to the parties concerned as to what was involved in either abortion or carrying the child to term, and “the possible effects of either decision.” In a final address, the president of one of three Lutheran denominations in Canada predicted that all three bodies will unite by 1980. The Rev. S. Theodore Jacobson, President of the Evangelcal Lutheran Church of Canada, said that delegates to a combined Canadian church conference had voted by a 4‐to‐1 ratio to unite the 301, 000 Lutherans living in Canada. Eventual unity of the nine million Lutherans in the United States is also a goal, but American Lutheran leaders said that no timetable had been established to unite the three major churches. Seminary Head Dismissed ST. LOUIS, Oct. 15 (AP)—The Rev. John H. Tietjen, whose suspension as president of Concordia Seminary touched off doctrinal dispute within the Lutheran Church‐Missouri Synod, said today that he had been dismissed by the Board of Control for allegedly teaching false doctrine. “I do not and will not accept the validity of the board's decision. I have not been and an not now a teacher of false doctrine as my responses to the charges have made clear,” Dr. Tietjen told a news conference. Dr. Tietjen was suspended by the board last Jan. 20 and was dismissed at its meeting last Saturday. He was notified of the dismissal yesterday after returning from the Americas Lutheran Church convention in Detroit. He said that he would not appeal the ruling and added that his plans were unsure. Dr. Tietjen's suspension was initiated at the synod's New Orleans convention in 1973, when he was criticized for allowing faculty members to interpret Scripture loosely. Formal charges against him included malfeasance in office and heresy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These Days It's a Political Plus if You're a Woman Candidate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/18/archives/these-days-its-a-political-plus-if-youre-a-woman-candidate.html,"This article was written by Martin Tolchin, a member of the Washington Bureau of The New York Times, and his wife, Susan, a political scientist. The Tolchins are the authors of “Clout: Womanpower and Politics,” to be published next month. WASHINGTON, Oct. 17—“I don't need any Madison Avenue speechwriters —I'm not a package of granola,” Barbara Mikulski, Demcratic candidate for the United States Senate tells an audience of older persons in Silver Spring, Md. A short, feisty woman, a former social worker, she takes a hand microphone and paces the platform. “I'm 38 years old—it's old for a prizefighter but young for a United States Senator,” she explains. “My family didn't want to be buried alive in the coal mines of West Virginia or the steel mills of Baltimore, so they opened a grocery store and we helped people. We gave credit during strikes, we delivered eggs to older people during snowstorms, we brought oranges to diabetics.” Miss Mikulski receives strong campaign support from women in Washington, New York and Boston, and holds joint fund‐raisers with Mary Anne Krupsak, the intense Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York. “We have a tremendous number of women volunteers from New Jersey and Connecticut,” said Miss Krupsak, who campaigned in Corning, N.Y., last week and cited the shortage of public nursing homes—including the absence of any such home in Steuben County, which has about 100,000 residents.. She spoke of a couple in their 80's, one of whom was sent to a home in Binghamton and the other to Jamestown. “A week after they were parted, they both died,” Miss Krupsak said. “Instead of sterile monuments to ego, like the Albany Mall and the Nassau Coliseum, why can't we use public funds to build day care centers and nursing homes?” In Connecticut, Ella T. Grasso, the lowkey, calmly professional Democratic candidate for Governor, receives campaign support from women in Washington and in New York. Her major campaign issues include a charge that the electric companies overcharged the state's residents by $19‐million, a proposal for a care‐line for the elderly that would enable them to discover and use available facilities, and a bill of rights for patients in nursing homes. These three candidates are the major recipients of a women's political network that crosses party and state lines, and is active in dozens of races across the country. The network is made up, mainly, of well‐to‐do, well‐educated women who have only recently become politicized. It is a network that provides funds, volunteers, expertise, encouragement and, on occasion, solace. The network helps liberal and moderate candidates who stress humanist issues, but not Conservatives such as Louise W. Gore, Republican candidate for Governor of Maryland, whose aides nonetheless believe that she has benefited politically from being a woman, getting attention in the media that she might not have gotten otherwise. The unquestioned leaders of this network are Representative Bella S. Abzug, Manhattan Democrat, and Gloria Steinern, both of whom raise funds and crowds for women candidates across the nation. At Blair House, Miss Mikulski was introduced by Mrs. Abzug, who exhorted the audience to “let Maryland be the state that will break the stag Senate, because a stag Senate means a stag‐nation.” Last weekend, Mrs. Abzug repeated the plea to Oregonians on behalf of Betty Roberts, Democratic Senate candidate, and then traveled to. California to campaign for women candidates for Congress and the State Legislature. In Manhattan last fall, in a show of bipartisan unity, Republican and Democratic women traveled together on the back of a flatbed truck, exhorting voters to elect more women to public office. In the year of Watergate, it has suddenly become an advantage for a politician to be a woman. It also usually means being an independent, a maverick, relatively new to politics, unconnected with party organizations and unbeholden to major contributors. They have little hard evidence, but many women candidates believe that they are pulling more than their share of women's votes, reflecting a recognition that women's voices are needed in government councils, where women constitute only 3 per cent of all elected officials. They believe that women candidates are needed not only on the major issues, but also to bring pressure on traditional women's issues, including sex discrimination, credit discrimination, job discrimination, abortion reform, education subsidies, day care and aid for the elderly. Miss Krupsak, for example, cites one poll that showed that the male vote was equally divided in her three‐way primary race. She won, apparently, because she received 46 per cent of the women's vote, while the other two candidates shared the remainder. “She won because her name is Mary Anne,” Mrs. Abzug summed up. “This is the year of the woman.” Watergate also helped shatter the inhibitions of would‐be women candidates, some of whom had previously lacked the self‐confidence to seek public office but saw male officials impaled because of their lack of ethics and morality. Women's disillusionment with male politicians received a powerful impetus at the Democratic National Convention of 1972, when the McGovern Commission brought large numbers of women out of the political volunteer pool, where they had done “the lickin' and stickin'” and onto stage center of national politics. Many of these women spoke openly of their disillusionment. The disillusionment was increased for thousands of women who went to state legislatures to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment, and returned to ask themselves why they had been cowed by male politicians, many of whom they now regarded as mediocre. As a result, more than 1,500 women—the largest number ever—fought their way through the piiimaries, and when the dust had settled, they had won three major party nominations for Governor, three for United States Senator, four for Lieutenant Governor, 45 for Congress (compared with 34 in 1972) and 1,000 for state legislatures (whose 443 womenmembers are expected to double this year). Women also scored heavily in races for county and city councils. In Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, nearly half the candidates on the ballot will be women—including Idamae Garrott, Democratic candidate for County Executive, and 10 women candidates for the Legislature. “They will provide the pool for future congressional races,” says Betsey Wright, executive director of the Women's National Education Fund, a nonpartisan group that conducts regional seminars to encourage women to run for political office, and instructs them on campaign tactics. The National Women's Political Caucus also encourages women candidates. Jane McMichael, its executive director, offers media advice to women candidates, and has been instrumental in persuading some unions and large donors to put money or time into the campaigns of promising women candidates. “There's a different kind of woman running this year,” Miss McMichael said. “They've got strong professional and political experience. They're well‐educated and many have good backgrounds. in civic clubs, law firms and political service. They're running as professionals, and not as housewives with grown children looking for something to do.” Despite the promising signs, women candidates still face obstacles rooted in culture and tradition. “There's still some sentiment in Arkansas that a woman's place is in the home,” noted Judy Petty, Republican candidate for. Congress and the first strong opponent in decades against Representative Wilbur D. Mills, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mrs. Petty's campaign was heralded with a newspaper headline that read: “Divorcee files against Mills.” “They didn't say ‘divorcee files against married man,’” Mrs. Petty observed. “They wouldn't say that about man.” “Politics is set up for men,” she continued. “You have to give your speeches from the back of flatboard trucks, at least three feet off the ground. Men can easily leap up the three feet, but when you're in a dress and heels, it's hard.” Maryann Mahaffey, a member of the Detroit City Council, recalled that after she announced her candidacy, she received a telephone call from a fashion reporter from The Free Press, one of the city's major newspapers. “They wanted to do a before‐and‐after story on all the women candidates, before and after a complete beauty workup and a couple of outfits. “I said, ‘No,’ I'm a serious candidate, like my hair the way it is. I'm perfectly satisfied with my wardrobe. I want to get elected on the basis of my record and the program I'm advancing for the city.” “Finally I said, ‘Okay, yes, I'll do it, if you do the same things for the male andidates,’” she went on. “That ended the discussion.” Women are now seeking dramatic ways to exploit the media. Colleen O'Connor, a former swimming champion, attracted wide coverage in her race for Congress from San Diego by two‐mile swim up the Pacific coastline of her district. In addition to dramatizing her opposition to offshore drilling, her aides said she also wanted to show that she had the stamina her opponent lacked, a kind of reverse macho. Women candidates report that the greatest drawback, by far, to their campaigns is lack of money. “Being a woman hurts,” Mrs. petty said. “If they'll give a man $100, they'll give a woman $10 and be proud of it. Most of the money comes in small amounts—$5, $25, $1 bills.” The contrast between woman candidates and their incumbent opponents, is noteworthy. In Oregon, Betty Roberts has raised $50,000 compared with $169,000 for Senator Robert Packwood. In Maryland, Barbara Mikulski has raised $47,000 compared with $197,000 by Senator Charles McC. Matthias Jr. Many women candidates are using their meager funds to attract women's, votes. Miss Mikulski's campaign has set aside $20,000 for the media, concentrating on daytime spots—watched by women and older persons Mrs. Petty also will concentrate on daytime television to reach women. The women also pose a problem in another way for their male opponents. “You have to run a little different kind of campaign,” explained Gov. Marvin Mandel of Maryland, who is Louise, Gore's opponent. “In debating on television, you have to be more careful and restrained. You can't be as vigorous.” Mr. Mandel, it turned out, wasn't able, to heed his own advice completely. In a televised debate Tuesday night with Mrs. Gore he ended up in a shouting match.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How it is playing in Emporia,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/how-it-is-playing-in-emporia-if-kansans-dont-like-nixon-can-they.html,"EMPORIA, Kan. When outsiders think of Kansas at all they are apt to dust off shopworn images of cow towns before the turn of the century, William Allen White's Emporia Gazette, Alf Landon in 1936, or the type of changeless life depicted in the movie “Picnic” with its opening longshot of mammoth Hutchinson grain elevators looming beside the Santa Fe tracks that stretch endlessly away into an all‐pervading flatness, moral, cultural, social, topographical, political. The Kansas political flatness has best been exemplified by the state's one‐party system going back to frontier days, a devout established Middle Western Republicanism, as fervent in its day as the Democratic faith of a Deep South state like Mississippi. But Kansas and the Republican Middle West, like Mississippi and the Solid South, are changing politically, and for some of the same reasons. The break‐up of the solidly Republican Middle West, although not as well‐publicized as the defections from the Solid South, has been carefully charted by political experts who see the two offsetting developments as examples of a national trend. The trend they see is not, as Kevin Phillips would have it, toward an emerging Republican majority, or, as hopeful Democratic liberals claim, toward an overwhelming new Democratic coalition, but rather, toward an emerging independent majority. Kansas, which gave Richard Nixon a greater margin of support against John F. Kennedy in 1960 than any state in the union except Nebraska; Kansas, which has kept Republicans in almost all state offices for half a century and has sent only Republicans to the United States Senate since 1932, going independent? In 1974, such upheaval is possible. Specifically, because of its new voter alignments, there is a possibility that the state may elect a nationally unknown Democrat to the U.S. Senate and oust a Republican star, Bob Dole, former Republican national chairman. Why? Partly because of events in Kansas but principally because Kansas reflects, and reflects in its customary bedrock way, things that are happening politically across the country. Watergate is clearly one of those things. Kansans have at least the average interest in issues like honesty in government and polls in the state during the past year were in line with national polls showing the diminishing popularity of Richard Nixon. Republican candidates across the country appear to be in trouble because of what voters see as the Nixon legacy—Watergate, inflation, stagnation of the economy and fear of depression. In Kansas there are reasons for special interest, at least in the Watergate issue. Senator Dole was the G.O.P. chairman during most of the time that the Watergate scandals were being perpetrated, covered‐up and then uncovered. Before Watergate it was sometimes said that if you liked Richard Nixon “you'll love Bob Dole.” Senator Dole was a part of the Nixon offense during the early stages of Watergate, blaming much of the fuss on The Washington Post, which he said “deliberately mixes together illegal and unethical episodes, like the Watergate caper, with shenanigans which have been the stock in trade of political pranksters from the day I came into politics,” and accusing the newspaper and George McGovern of being “partners‐in‐mudslinging.” But Dole shifted to the defense and began moderating his public comments as the scandal grew to greater and greater dimensions. By early summer of this year, with the issue causing him more and more trouble back home, Dole allowed as how he “wouldn't mind if Nixon flew over the state.” Senator Dole denies any involvement in Watergate but because of all the Nixon scandals he has said that 1974 is a Republican “hang‐on” year. And in Kansas, he is trying to do just that. His opponent is Congressmen William Roy, 49, a two‐term Representative from the Topeka area, the only man in Congress with both a law and medical degree, a moderate liberal who can attract Republican as well as independent and Democratic votes. After trailing Dole 10 months ago by 32 percentage points in the polls, Roy caught up with him in August, and in the weeks that followed moved ahead by 8 points. Dole then fired his campaign coordinator, dropped the Mr. Nice Guy post‐Watergate pose he had been advised to take, got out the old weapon he used against The Post and McGovern—accusing his opponent of slinging mud—and early this month climbed back even. Roy says Watergate itself is not an issue but adds in his campaign speeches that Kansans feel “Dole knew or should have known about the Watergate affair in his capacity as party chairman.... We need a candidate who will represent the state and the nation rather than his party and the head of his party.” And his campaign literature includes a cartoon of Dole's secretary poking her head out of Nixon Headquarters to tell the folks back home that their Senator is too busy to see them. It is always dangerous to make predictions in advance of elections, but what can be said of the Dole‐Roy race is that the outcome is far from the foregone conclusion it would have been even in the recent past, when a liberal Democrat would run against a conservative, incumbent Republican in Kansas. It is, as they say, a horse race. When Congressman Roy took his campaign into Emporia for a hospital coffee and a teachers' reception several weeks ago, he was greeted by an editorial in The Emporia Gazette. The old William Allen White paper is still going strong, still Republican and, clearly still sensitive to grassroots political opinions, as it was in the venerable editor's day. It thinks Dole is a good Senator, should be re‐elected, but, noting that Roy had taken the lead in the race, cautioned its man to change his tactics: “In this year of Watergate, voters are looking for nice guys.... The proper image for 1974 is ‘Mr. Clean.’ Congressman Roy projects this Image naturally. He seems soft‐spoken and reserved. Senator Dole is a witty, slashing campaigner whose barbs once made a hit with voters. Not any more. His abrasive technique is out of style.” In a year when noncharisma is charisma, Congressman Roy is very much in style. The night before in the living room of his house in Topeka he had told me how he had gotten into politics 1970 after talking it over with his wife and one or two others. There is a couple‐of‐us‐around‐thekitchen‐table air to Roy and his campaign that is, whether true or not, very much in because it seems to contrast so strikingly with the slickness of Watergate Washington. When discussing his stand on abortion (against it personally but thinks the law should be neutral) and his manner of arriving at his stand, he told me that he had read a great deal of the work of the Jesuit John Courtney Murray, and since no one has quoted Father Murray to make an impression for a decade, you tended to believe that Roy's reading is extensive, self‐directed and refreshingly out‐of‐date. The Nixon connection is not the only issue, of course, and on abortion, as a matter of fact, Roy has a unique problem. Of all the men in Congress who must vote on the issue, Roy is the only one who admits to having performed an abortion himself. The issue, according to polls, is of interest to only 15 per cent of the Kansas electorate but to that 15 per cent it is of crucial interest—many observers compare it to gun control. Dole has the prolifers on his side because he has said he would support a “prolife constitutional amendment (“Whatever it is,” Dole told me. “Who knows what they will settle on?”) Among prolifers there has been a whispering campaign that Roy, during his 15 years' practice as a Topeka obstetrician‐gynecologist, performed an abortion. And in the campaign's later stages, after Dole dropped Mr. Nice Guy, he has made increasing use of the issue. Roy was asked about it during the reception at Emporia: “When I was an obstetrician in Topeka, I operated on one woman who had a tumor the size of your fist in her uterus. I removed the uterus to save the woman's life. But the uterus contained a fetus. The operation was performed only to save the life of the woman. And, I might add, it was performed at a Catholic hospital. It was an abortion technically. But it was necessary to save the woman's life.” Roy looked at a priest standing at the rear of the crowd. “Correct me if I am wrong, Father, but I think I am right in saying that this is permissible under Catholic teaching.” The priest Aztec for the campaign, and, by that point in the campaign, he had logged more than 200 hours and 35,000 miles in it. That day he went from Topeka to Emporia, to Newton, to Marion to Hillsboro and back to Topeka. Roy leased a five‐seat Piper At Newton, Roy sat on a park bench and was interviewed for the Cronkite news, an old Santa Fe locomotive on exhibition in the background. The state license plate of Kansas this year commemorates the centennial of wheat, the arrival 100 years ago from the Ukraine of a contingent of German Mennonites who had gone to Russia to avoid conscription by Bismarck, then came to Kansas to avoid conscription by the Czar, bringing with them several sacks of Turkey red wheat. The Mennonites were brought in by the Santa Fe railroad to settle the sections of railroad land along the right of way and their Turkey red wheat, because it was hard grain, able to withstand the Kansas winter, became the foundation of the state's agricultural prosperity. A week before our visit the Postal Service had brought out a stamp at Newton honoring the anniversary of the wheat. Kansas has gone on to other strains of wheat but Newton is still a Mennonite stronghold. Honesty in government, I was told by several local citizens, is a very important issue with Mennonites. At the Marion airport, we were met by local Democratic workers, several in Westernstyle hats. The Congressman and several local candidates spoke briefly, everyone gathered around the Piper, some leaning on the tail section. His mention of Watergate was strictly subterranean, as it often is. “I feel as you do that this is an important Senate race and in a time of inflation with the threat of depression to go with it, I think it is very important to cut Federal spending. I think that it is important that I have voted for some cuts in defense spending. I have been unhappy with some AID programs. (Nods from the Western‐hats.) I think that my priorities are the priorities of the people of Kansas.” In the caravan going into Marion an editorial from The Marion County Record was passed around. “Roy is full of promises,” it said. “As this column has remarked before he can make promises but can't deliver. As an obstetrician he should at least know how to deliver.” Roy commented that “on the whole the press treats me fairly. Even the ones that are going to support Dole editorially are fair to me in the news columns, although there are some exceptions.” The day's campaigning ended with a honking caravan into Hillsboro 10 miles away. At the Sportsman's Bar, I tried some random polling. “What are the important issues in Marion County?” I asked the man at the bar next to me. “Issues?” he repeated, looking up from his beer. “There are no issues in Marion County.” That night I told Alfred M. Landon the results of my poll. He laughed and tended to agree with the beerdrinker, but Landon does not believe overmuch in polls, random or allegedly scientific. As the second most famous mishap in the history of polling he is understandably skeptical. At his sprawling estate outside Topeka we sat at dusk on the enormous veranda, the former Kansas Governor and 1936 Republican nominee for President decked out in riding boots and jodhpurs (rio mere cos tume—Landon rides horseback several miles a day), following a Cardinal‐Met broadcast and a political conversation simultaneously, never missing a pitch or a nuance, a tour de force of geriatrics considering that his 87th birthday came two days later. “I think too much attention is paid to polls,” Landon said, “particularly in the early stages.” The sound of a telephone ringing came from the house. Mrs. Landon appeared at the screen door. “Alfred” A few minutes later he was back. The call had been from a Kansas editor, news about the Dole‐Roy campaign. Landon stays abreast of politics and a lot of other things, through visits, through phone calls and through reading. Later when I went into the house to call a cab I noticed among the classics in his library a stack of current books, including “Burr.” Both Landons had read and enjoyed the book. Mrs. Landon confessed, though, that she didn't like everything by Gore Vidal. Landon returned, picking up the interrupted broadcast and the interrupted conversation: “The polls might be able to tell you something at the end, but right now I'd rather have the report of a good precinct captain or a good county chairman any day, than all the polls in the world.” Did he think Kansas was becoming more Democratic? “The same thing is happening in Kansas that has happened in Michigan and Iowa and Indiana and Illinois,” he said. “These were all Republican farm states. Farmers are conservative. But their sons left the farms and went to the industrial centers and found jobs and joined the unions and became Democrats.” (During the discussion he introduced and returned several times to the subject of the Robert Sherrill article in this magazine on Ted Kennedy, which reopened questions about Chappaquiddick; Landon said he was fascinated by it, but wondered why what he called the largest Democratic paper in the country would have run such a story.) “The Republican party has become identified with antiunionism. That was never the way I felt. I was never antiunion. I was always for unions, for collective bargain ing, for the right to strike, all of it. In all the states that I mentioned where this has happened, the tendency is for the Republican party to lose strength and the Democratic party to gain. In Michigan the Republican candidates were either the General Motors candidates or the Ford candidates until Romney. And Romney got the votes of union men by showing that he wasn't antiunion. In Kansas the same thing is happening. Kansas isn't Democratic yet. It's more independent but it's still a Republican state. But it could be a Democratic state within 10 years.” The next day Representative Roy drove to the Kansas City area with his wife, Jane, and the chairman of the Kansas Democratic Committee, Bob Brock and Brock's wife. Brock, Kansan of the Year in 1973, a lawyer and the owner of a string of Kansas Holiday Inns, is Roy's campaign manager. On the trip over he reported on the results of a letter he had sent out soliciting funds for the campaign. “I sent it to each of the 490 members of the Nixon enemies list,” Brock said. “I'm a member of the list myself. When the newspapers called to ask how I got on it I told them that I had a local recommendation—Bob Dole. He doesn't deny it. Anyway, I've started getting returns on the letter and we've raised almost $5,000 so far.” Brock, incidentally, agreed with Landon's assessment of change in the Middle West. In the recent primary elections in Iowa, he said, more Democratic than Republican ballots were cast for the first time in history. The first stop of the day was at a church in a suburb of Kansas City. Roy spoke briefly, and answered questions on what he would do about crime, about amnesty, where he would cut the budget and alternative sources of energy. At the second stop, the Oakwood Country Club just over the Missouri line, Roy was joined by the senior Senator from Missouri, Stuart Symington. It is always being pointed out that Symington is the very picture of what a United States Senator should look like but with the passing years he has been elevated; he now brings the bearing of a fine old archbishop to these services, which are essentially the episcopal ones, to confirm and to ordain. “In my 22 years in the Senate this is the first time I ever went into another state to campaign against an incumbent,” he said. “I do not know Dr. Roy well but my son Jim, who serves on the Public Health and Environment Subcommittee of the House, knows Dr. Roy well. And Jim tells me that Dr. Bill Roy will make a fine United States Senator. The Midwest and America need Dr. Bill Roy in the United States Senate.” Just before we sat down to the brunch the report swept through the group that President Ford had just pardoned Richard Nixon. Senator Symington was called away to the phone to give his reaction to the pardon to The Associated Press. Kansas reaction to the pardon began to build the next week. A state poll showed people opposed by a 52‐to‐40 margin, and by the following weekend, that margin had grown. “The reaction that we got at my ofice,” Senator Dole told me during an interview while we were driving from Wichita to the state fair at Hutchinson the next Sunday, “was 20‐to‐1 against the pardon. We've had approximately 600 responses, wires, phone calls and letters.” Dole was clearly worried. “I tried to reach President Ford the other day by phone but he was in the air on his way to Pinehurst and General Haig said that it would be difficult having a private con versation. I wanted to talk to the President about the wholesale pardons that were being discussed for the other Watergate figures and to thank him for throwing me an anchor with the Nixon pardon.... When I couldn't talk to the President I told Al Haig that I wouldn't appreciate any more surprises like the Nixon pardon.” Before the Nixon pardon Dole had been talking enthu siastically about a visit by President Ford to Kansas on his behalf during the final weeks of the campaign. During the ride to Hutchinson Dole was still talking about the visit by Ford—but with diminished enthusiasm. “I talked to Dean Burch about it and I am sure President Ford will come to Kansas if we ask him. He might make two appearances in different parts of the state. That doesn't win an election but it would be very helpful if his popularity is strong then. While he was in Congress Ford made a number of visits to Kansas. The Nixon pardon substantially damaged his popularity in Kansas, though. “The pardon of Nixon was premature. Like everyone else I don't relish the thought of some former President languishing in jail. But there was no certainty that he would have been indicted. The damaging part is the feeling that people have that this is the same old ball game. A new player does the same thing the last one did—he takes care of his friends. That's what people are saying.” President Ford had looked like a great asset to Republican candidates before the pardon, Senator Dole said, and he might be yet if his reason for granting the pardon was convincing to the electorate. “When he first went in Ford seemed to have it in the palm of his hand and then he loses it in a matter of days and he's no great asset to Republican candidates now. Still, if we're going to have a strong, balanced Republican ticket in 1976, we will have to do it with a Ford‐Rockefeller ticket. That is if Ford doesn't kick the ball away in the first quarter. He's already fumbled it a couple of times.” Remarks like that fit into Dole's pre‐post‐Watergate style of campaigning, visible at hundreds of Republican functions across the country for the past few years when, as G.O.P. chairman, he was the slashing, quick‐witted spokesman for his party's cause. Before the 1972 election, for example, he told a Maryland fund‐raising group that “Mr. Bradlee (Washington Post Executive Editor Benjamin Bradlee), an old Kennedy coat holder, is entitled to his views. But when he allows his paper to be used as a political instrument of the McGover?? ite campaign; when he himself travels the country as a small‐bore McGovern surrogate—then he and his publication should expect appropriate treatment—which they will regularly receive.” The Post's reputation for objectivity and credibility, he said, had “sunk so low they almost disappeared from the Big Board altogether.” But early in this campaign, while I was with him, the Senator said the slashing technique was really not, at heart, his style, The Emporia Gazette to the contrary notwithstanding. “I'm not naturally a slashing campaigner. When I was national chairman, I had to get out and rough it up, but I'm not that kind of campaigner usually. That doesn't get you any votes.” He talked as he stood in the bright sunlight at the Hutchinson fairgrounds, shaking hands with constituents, looking a trifle out of place with his powder blue suit, his alligator shoes, but getting a good reponse nevertheless. Dole cannot shake hands the usual way; his right hand is crippled, and he had to reach out with the left. This would be a damaging handicap for most politicians but Kansans know that right hand was severely injured in combat in World War II. The left arm was injured, too, though less severely. Even his opponents conceded that he is a genuine war hero and the awkward handshaking only reminds voters of that heroism. “You can see,” he said, “that I'm a friendly campaigner.” Even then, though Dole seemed to have a hard time dropping the unfriendly approach. “I get along fairly well with the press,” he said. “I even had Mary McGrory singing, ‘For He's a Jolly Good Fellow’ at my farewell party as Republican national chairman. But there is a double standard. There has been Democratic skulduggery for years and there was never any interest in that like there has been in Watergate. The architects' fees and Governor Docking's brother — we haven't gotten to the bottom of that yet.” (He was referring to indictments handed down a year ago against George R. Docking, the brother of Democratic Governor Robert Docking, indictments involving alleged kickbacks by architects to Democratic coffers.) “Now they're saying I was involved in the I.T.T. case, We have an opponent who runs as a doctor and his lieutenants accuse me of being involved in the I.T.T. affair. We have just gone through two years of this with Muskie and Humphrey and Senator Jackson being accused unfairly and everyone jumps on that but the Democrats do it all the time. There are some editors in Kansas now who are starting to notice these unfair campaign tactics by the Democrats. It's about time. You can go through any Kansas paper for the past year or so and you will find 40 column inches on Watergate and the possible involvement of Senator Dole for every one inch on the scandal of the archi, tectural fees and Governor Docking's brother. I get asked once a night about Watergate as if I directed the whole scenario. There is a double standard here—Roy is never asked about the Docking architectural fee affair.” I asked Dole how he answers charges that he was involved in Watergate. “I tell them what Senator Ervin said about me,” he said. “Senator Ervin said that Bob Dole had nothing to do with Watergate.” His official campaign brochure mentions all the vital statistics of his life and career: born Russell, Kan., 1923; magna from Washburn Law School; U.S. Representative, 1960–1968; Senator since 1969. (Dole has an apartment in the Watergate officeresidence complex in Washington, where the famous break‐in occurred, but this is, not surprisingly, unmentioned.) The only references to what was once Dole's proudest achievement, the G.O.P. chairmanship, are quotes from Sam Ervin and Senator Lowell Weicker absolving him of any involvement in Kansas Democrats like to point out that Dole in past years invited in such nowfaded luminaries as Spiro Agnew and John Connally. Guest‐speaker invitations now tend to go out to the reform wing of the party: Senators Weicker, Robert Griffin, Edward Brooke and a victim of the Saturday Night Massacre, Elliot Richardson. Dole thinks his slippage in the polls was primarily due to “the decline of Richard Nixon and to mass‐media spending on the part of Congressman Roy in his primary fight,” but he says he thinks he can pull ahead again, partly because he regards many present Roy supporters as lukewarm. “I think this race is going to come down to who has the guts to make the hard votes. I made a hard one on agriculture and got clobbered. But you can't paint yourself as a fiscal conservative if you vote for a rehabilitation bill that is several hundered million dollars over the budget, as Congressman Roy did. Or vote as Roy did for an agriculture bill that is also several hundred million dollars over the budget and call yourself conservative. Roy is trying to get a lot of mileage from my vote against the agriculture bill, which I voted against because it was way over the budget. But his ads use that vote. Flash! Dole votes against farmers!” There are other issues—amnesty, abortion, crime, ecology. But Dr. Don Hardesty, head of the Central Research Corporation of Kansas, which has done the polling, says that Watergate (including the Nixon pardon and integrity in government) and the economy (inflation, stagnation, fear of depres sion) dominate all of the others. And even the economy doesn't seem to escape the Nixon connection. Hardesty says 60 per cent of the people thought inflation of critical importance, with 25 per cent listing the issue as important. “The poll shows that the main thing people think about when they talk about inflation is the price of food. Medical care and fuel and interest rates, too, but nothing like food.” Inflation also hits in Kansas in special ways —the price of fertilizer in the last year has more than doubled, diesel fuel (needed for tractors) is also up. Dealing with the economy issue, Senator Dole gives the Republican National Committee argument that a spend‐thrift Democratic Congress is to blame. Roy, again, cites Nixonomics. Gun control could become an issue with some voters in the closing days of the campaign. Dr. Roy pointed out to me that Senator Dole had voted for gun control and that “there is a hell of a temptation to use the Dole vote for gun control in this campaign — we've discussed using it but we haven't made up our minds yet.” At the recent state fair, Dole told me, “I voted for the 1969 bill outlawing the Saturday Night Special. That's the issue that's giving Birch Bayh so much trouble in Indiana because he was the sponsor.” And there's no telling what other issues could arise. At Dole's booth at the fair one of his workers, wearing a Dole hat and Dole buttons, and passing out Dole literature, told me that she was not going to vote for Dole, He had just told her he was going to vote to confirm Nelson Rockefeller for Vice President —and she didn't like that. “You have to vote one way or the other,” Dole said to me later, “and you can't please everyone. I'm not going to spend too much time in Congress the rest of the year, though. I'd rather miss a few votes this year than all the votes for the next six years. I have a 95 per cent voting record in the Senate and I think Rocky will make it without me.” In the final stages of the campaign, Roy has not used the gun‐control issue, tempting though it may have been. And Dole, as he did in the Nixon ‐ McGovern campaign, has apparently felt compelled to “rough it up.” Though Roy seems content to limit his Watergate criticisms of Dole to the relatively mild not‐involved‐but‐should‐have‐known variety, Dole is almost perversely unable to drop the subject. And his response to Watergate criticism now is similar to what it was in 1972: Speak not about the specific accusations themselves but instead raise the charge of mudslinging and go on the offensive. Yet, perhaps, it's not that perverse for Dole at all. The last Nixon campaign was pretty effective with the voters—dirty tricks or not. During the two weeks when Dole wiped out an 8‐percentagepoint deficit to pull even, Dole has intensified his mudslinging charge, just as he did in 1972. He has made frequent use of television commercials including a poster of Senator Dole with a hand slinging mud at the poster, first a glob of Watergate mud, then a glob of antifarm mud, while the voice over identifies the slinger of mud as Congressman Roy. The term “mudslinging” is not precise, but obviously if it would fit the action of Congressman Roy criticising Senator Dole's vote against the agricultural appropriations bill, it could be stretched to the point where nothing whatsoever could be said about opponents or their records. Senator Bob Dole looks at times strikingly like Humphrey Bogart. The resemblance has often been commented on, he says. Fighting through the 1974 campaign, though, he looks less like the debonair Bogart of “Casablanca” and more like the Bogey of the “African Queen,” with Watergate and Ford's pardon of Nixon and inflation and the recession—all of the Nixon‐Ford record —as that rusty, leaky bucket of bolts that he must pull through the jungle, through swarms of flies and plagues of leeches, through what was once such a fine, navigable, Republican stream, looking for open water once again, just a Republican trying to hang‐on in a Republican hang‐on year.■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tristate Congressional Races: Outlook and Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/things-are-looking-better-for-democrats-than-republicans.html,"In the Congressional campaigns in the tristate area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the outlook is considerably bullish for Democrats and bearish for Republicans, Democrats alreadly have a 33‐27 edge in Congressional seats in the three states and that margin is almost certain to grow. At least six Republican‐held seats in the three states are in serious jeopardy and nine ?? also could fall. The issues most damaging to Republicans are Watergate and inflation but the party also faces strong Democratic state tickets In Connecticut and New York, which could provide “coattail” victories for Democrats further down the voting machine. Here is the situation in the three states. New York The delegation now consists of 22 Democrats and 17 Republicans. The Democrats' edge has dwindled from a high point of 26 in 1968 largely because of reapportionment, which has reduced the number of Congressmen in heavily Democratic New York City and increased seats in the largely Republican suburbs. There has already been a major shake‐up of the delegation with retirements, forced or otherwise, of six Democrats and two Republicans, including four of Brooklyn's six Congressmen. Voluntary retirees are Democrats Hugh L. Carey of Brooklyn, now running for Governor; Ogden R. Reid of Westchester; John J. Rooney of Brooklyn; Thaddeus Dulski of Buffalo, and Republicans Henry P. Smith 3d of the Buffalo suburbs and Howard Robison of the Binghamton area. Frank Brasco and Bertram R. Podell, both of Brooklyn, were convicted of corruption. Despite the large number of Democratic retirements, the party should score heavily this year. At least two Republican seats are considered in serious jeopardy, the Third District in Nassau‐Suffolk Counties now represented by Angelo Roncallo, and Mr. Smith's 36th District. Five other districts are rated marginal Republican: The Second in Suffolk County; the 26th in the Hudson Valley; the 27th in the Binghamton area; the Saratoga area's 29th, and the 31st in the Utica‐Mohawk Valley area. New Jersey The delegation now consists of eight Democrats and seven Republicans; in the 1970 and 1968 elections Demo'crats, had a 9‐6 edge. Six of the state's 15 districts, all represented by Republicans, appear mar ginal in this election, including the two held by leading defenders of former President Richard M, Nixon during the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings—Charles Sandman and Joseph J. Maraziti. Another leading figure in the impeachment drama, Peter Rodino, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is considered safe in his strongly Democratic Newark district. Mr. Maraziti faces a stiff challenge from Helen Stevenson Meyner, wife of former Gov. Robert Meyner. This contest and the challenge to Republican Representative John E. Hunt of the First Congressional District of Gloucester and Camden Counties by State Representative James J. Florio are considered the Democrats' best chances of picking up Congressional seats in New Jersey.  However, Democrats also have a track at three other seats new held by Republicans in addition to Mr. Sandman's. These marginal Republican districts are the Fifth, now represented by retiring Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen, the Sixth, held by Edwin B. Forsythe and the Seventh, represented by William B. Widnall. Connecticut The delegation is split 3‐3, but at least one Republican seat could be chalked up to the big Nixon victory in 1972. In the two previous Congressional elections, 1970 and 1968, the Democrats held a 4 to 2 edge. At least two Republican‐held seats are considered in jeopardy. Ronald A. Sarasin, a freshman in the House, faces a strong challenge from State Representative William R. Ratchford, a former speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives, in the Fifth Congressional District in the Danbury‐Waterbury area. In the Second District, which covers the rural eastern half of the state, the incumbent, Robert H. Steele, is the Republican candidate for Governor. A Democrat, Christopher J. Dodd, an attorney and son of the late Senator Thomas J. Dodd, is given at least an even chance of capturing the seat. The Republican candidate is State Senator Samuel B. Hellier. There will be at least one other change, in the Connecticut delegation. Ella T. Grasso, the delegation's only woman, is the Democratic nominee for Governor. Her seat is expected to remain Democratic, however. Anthony J. Moffett, the Democrat, is running against Republican Patsy J. Piscopo and Independent Louis J. Marietta. . . . Because Economy and Watergate Look So Bad to the Voters From Cape May to New London, Congressional candidates agree that inflation and the state of the economy are the major issues in their contests. The only question is who takes the blame for them. The Democrats blame the Republican White House. The Democratic candidate in New Jersey's First Congressional District, James J. Florio, for example, accuses the incumbent, Representative John E. Hunt of “unswerving devotion” to Nixon Administration policies. Republicans, in turn, echo Representative Ronald A. Sarasin in Connecticut's Fifth District, who said that “the blame has to be placed on Congress and that's Democrat controlled.” Despite the emphasis on the econnomy, Watergate is still a potent issue, particularly in districts where Republican incumbents, like Representatives Charles Sandman and Joseph J. Maraziti, both of New Jer sey, were either highly visible or bitter‐enders in their defense of former President Richard M. Nixon. Republican candidates acknowledge that they have also been placed on the defensive by President Ford's pardon. The continuing strength of the Watergate issue is pointed up by several polls that indicate that one of every four voters is more inclined to vote Democratic because of Watergate. Representative Donald Mitchell of the Utica area in New York summed up the continuing impact of the Watergate issue. Asked if he were troubled by it, he replied: “No, I sleep like a baby—I sleep for an hour and wake up crying.” Joseph F. Crangle, the New York State Democratic chairman, put it more pungently with Shakespearean oyertones. “Republicans say that Watetate is all behind them. There is blood on their hands and they are trying to wash themselves from it but the damn stains won't come off.” One signal of the impact of the Watergate and inflation issues is that Democratic candidates are more likely to talk about them while Republicans, particularly incumbents, are likely to emphasize local issues and service to constituents. But even the local issues weigh against Republicans, at least in some marginal districts where they are already having problems with the national Democratic trend. Mr. Maraziti, for example, was stung in the final weeks of the campaign by charges that he operated a real estate business out of his Congressional office and had given a woman a “no‐show” job on his staff. Representative Angelo Roncallo in Long Island's Third District was acquitted of Federal conspiracy and extortion charges but his Democratic opponent, Jerome Ambro, misses few opportunities to talk about “integrity in government” and the need for the voters to “trust in their elected representatives.” In some districts, the proposed Federal constitutional amendment outlawing abortion except to save a mother's life has been raised as an issue by anti‐abortion groups but many politicians believe that the issue produces more heat than votes. One New York poll, for example, showed that two‐thirds of those surveyed were satisfied with New York's liberal abortion law or wanted the law liberalized even further. Rockefeller, Again Even Vice‐President‐designate Nelson A. Rockefeller, who has been an issue in New York elections for 16 years, is still an issue in the 36th District in northwestern New York. The Democratic candidate and the favorite, John J. LaFalce, notes that Mr. Rockefeller, as Governor, ran poorly in his area. “I know how the people in my district feel about Rockefeller,” said the candidate. —FRANK LYNN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only Faye Dunaway Knows What She's Hiding,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/only-faye-dunaway-knows-what-shes-hiding-only-faye-dunaway-knows.html,"“Bonnie and Clyde” put Faye Dunaway on the cover of almost every major magazine. She became a fashion style‐setter, an Oscar nominee, and one of the most sought‐after stars in Hollywood. The height of Miss Dunaway's fame may have been reached the afternoon that Arthur Penn, the director of “Bonnie and Clyde,” turned to Warren Beatty, the film's co‐star, in a London restaurant and asked, “Isn't that Faye over there?” indicating a lovely blonde in a Bonnie beret and blouse. “No,” said Beatty. “That's Brigitte Bardot.” Seven years and eleven movies later, Miss Dunaway admits, “I sort of dropped the ball after ‘Bonnie and Clyde’.” Lonnie Schlein Sort of dropped the ball . . .Into that phrase goes long list of disappointing movies as well as a career‐disrupting personal life that included an extended romance with Marcello Mastroianni. But her eleventh picture, “Chinatown,” is an enormous success, one of the highestgrossing pictures of the year, one that has reestablished Miss Dunaway as an important star. It is not just a matter of the movie's success —one shared with co‐star Jack Nicholson and director Roman Polanski—but her reemergence as an actress. Rarely has she given a bad performance, but, by any measure, in “Chinatown” she gives one of her best performances. Even the few critics —such as Vhicent Canby In The Times—who had reservations about the movie, singled her out for praise. In “Chinatown,” as in her other movies, she projects an image of great strength and sensuality. Off screen she loses none of her beauty, but gains in fragility and femininity. Her skin is as white as porcelain (her hair is now natural dark brown instead of Bonnie blonde). She Is slim, slighter than on screen. In conversation, She is as open and as vulnerable as she was when “Bonnie” made her a star. Relaxing, resting her head against a white couch in her coolly modern apartment, she began talking about her role in “Chinatown.” Evelyn Multvray was “a very difficult character to play” she said. Mysterious and enigmatic, she must, for most of the picture, elude our grasp and also that of the private eye (played by Nicholson) investigating the death of her husband. At the same time, she must be extraordinarily provocative, promising sex along with a solution to the mystery. • Her entrance in the film is stunning. Nicholson is regaling his assistant with a vulgar story, and the assistant is trying to signal him that Miss Dunaway is present. He is oblivious. Suddenly he, and we, see her and he swallows his words. She is beautiful but with an icy elegance that can shrink a man (at the same time that it excites him). Nicholson is hooked and for the rest of the picture he is looking not only for her husband's murderer, but for the meaning of Mrs. Mulwray herself. Ultimately, he learns that she is a woman who is desperately trying to conceal the fact that she has been raped by her father and given birth to their child. How did Miss Dunaway play Evelyn Mulwray? Before she begins a role, she explained, she learns as much about the character as she can. Sometimes, as in the case of Bonnie, that means historical research. For “Chinatown,” it meant long talks with the screenwriter, Robert Towne, who made up the story (based on an actual California case). What she is looking for is a “framework.” “Then you sort of forget about it,” she said. “Acting is different from mental gymnastics. You try to discover as much about the character as you can, but a large area is mysterious.” Miss Dunaway puts all this “groundwork” in the “bank”—in the back of her mind. Then she works hard on understanding and expressing the reality of each of her character's actions. “Sometimes you can swim through a part,” she said, “but Evelyn is the most complex character in the movie. I had to know why she was behaving as she did.” Evelyn's main driving force is to keep her incestuous child a secret. So she lies. “The audience—and Nicholson, who represents the audience—doesn't know what she is doing until the end. Only I know what she is concealing.” And one way she communicates this is by having “nervous, impulsive reactions.” In other words, when she is giving Nicholson one of those pregnant looks, she is not only acting the scene, she is thinking about “what went on with that character before and what is going on now.” In describing how she works, Miss Dunaway said, “You don't become a character. You experience and illuminate her in some way. You may know things about her that she does not know.” Miss Dunaway's method of acting is related to the Method, although she has never studied at the Actors Studio. “You draw on personal experience,” she said. “You use parts of yourself”—and of people you know. “I know people badly harmed early in life.” To portray a victim of incest, she can only assume a reaction. “I don't know what I would do if I had been raped by my father and had a child. Inevitably you would hale that child — abortion was not legal in those days. A great deal of guilt and trauma is involved in that character. Evelyn is a woman with an enormously traumatized, complex, mysterious past. She spends her life trying to rectify it and to protect her child. As a result, she develops neurotic behavior.” • ‘There was high high tension,’ says the leading lady, about ‘Chinatown's’ filming. The actress's portrayal was made doubly difficult by her problems with the director. Much has been written about their conflict. In one interview Polanski said that Miss Dunaway demonstrated “certifiable proof of craziness,” but that she was “worth all the trouble.” She refuses to engage Polanski in a feud‐by‐interview (just as she refuses to respond to Mastroianni's published statements about their affair, except to comment, “He didn't say bad things about me. The worst thing he said was that I have bony knees. All Capricorns have ??ony knees.”) “Films are highly pressurized,” she explained. “You try to keep yourself as cooled down as possible. Otherwise, it's like trying to walk With broken leg. What comes out is private, so, private.” With “Chinatown,” “a lot was at stake for all of us.” Both she and Polanski had had recent failures. This was the first movie personally produced by Robert Evans, head of the Paramount studio. “There was high high tension,” deepened by Polanski's manner of working. “It's the pearl in the oyster syndrome, his feeling that it takes great pain to make something good. A director like Polanski wants you to get your adrenalin up. But your adrenalin is already up. The lens is staring at you. I'm vulnerable to the rigid, dictatorial approach. It's painful. I get angry when people push people around.” There was no rehearsal for “Chinatown.” “I never discussed the character with Roman. The word motivation was never mentioned.” There were confrontations between director and actress (and also between director and screenwriter). During shooting, said Miss Dunaway, “There was only one major blow‐up.” Actually, it was a head‐on collision that threatened to close down the picture. But the two met with the producer, tempers were soothed, and filming continued. “Roman is a very stubborn man and I'm a very stubborn woman. I realized that he would ultimately define my role—in he cutting room.” Asked if she ever told Polanski to leave her alone, she smiled and said, “He wouldn't, so I left him alone.” At stalemate, the picture was finished. The question remains, of course, how much of Miss Dunaway's performance was her acting and how much was Polanski's directing? “Often a performance is ‘because of, and often it is ‘in spite of I'm not saying ‘in spite of Roman,’ but he had a great rigidity. That attitude of make her mad at me and she'll be mad in the movie—that freezes me up. And I don't find it easy to parrot things. With non‐professionals that may be the only way to work. But if I understand what I'm doing, I'm going to give you more than you expect.” • So much of what she gives comes from her own life. Born in Bascom, Florida, Dorothy Faye Dunaway was pampered by her mother—who dressed her pretty daughter like Shirley Temple —while following her career Army father from base to base. When she was 13, her parents were divorced, and she felt “the greatest degree of frustration.” It was an economic and emotional hardship. She went to several colleges, ending with Boston University, where she studied theater and felt her first commitment to acting. Giving up a Fulbright scholarship, to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, she joined the original training program at the Lincoln Center Repertclry Theater, which for her, most of all, meant a chance to work with Elia Kazan. In Arthur Miller's “After the Fall,” she understudied Barbara Loden, who played the lead, the Marilyn Monroe character. Almost every night Miss Dunaway sat in the balcony and watched Miss Loden. “I wondered how she did it. It was a tearing, staggering performance and she never failed to bring it to life. It was the part I most wanted to play.” During those days, she said, she felt “some of the blackest depressions.” One major difficulty was her acting. “I had a great problem doing deeply emotional scenes, which I wanted to do more than any other. I was very had. For a long time, I couldn't cry on stage. I cried very rarely as a child.” One day Kazan said to her, “You obviously learned somewhere that crying is weak. You should not be ashamed to show your emotions. That's your identity.” She cried on the spot. It was a breakthrough. In her first major role, in the Off Broadway drama “Hogan's Goat,” she cried—and much more. On the strength of that powerful performance, she was rushed off to Hollywood. “Bonnie. and Clyde,” her third movie, was a roaring success —and she became a movie star. From the time she was a child, she had been instilled with “the American dream” —to succeed is good. “Luckily, success happened tome early. I got it out of the way.” Actually she almost lost it entirely. “For a while it was just ‘career’,” she said, moving her hands straight in front of her as if forming a tunnel. “Then I said, ‘Wait! I'm a woman. And who's there? Who do I spend time with at midnight?’” As for her choice of films between “Bonnie” and “Chinatown,” a reiterated phrase was, “I did it for all the best reasons and it just didn't work out.” About three years ago she suffered “a personal upheaval,” which led her into a period of self‐analysis. “I had been turning everything down. I realized that I was sacrificing an essential part of myself.” For one thing, though she said she loved acting on the stage, she hadn't done any since “Hogan's Goat.” She returned to the theater at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in Harold Pinter's “Old Times” and followed that as Blanche du Bois in “A Streetcar Named Desire.” To her surprise, she found “I had to have a lot of helps I studied voice again and I took a movement class and I started to learn about dissecting a play. You get out of practice making films.” With Blanche, as with Bonnie, she felt “home free.” “I'm Southern,” she explained, “and I know neurotic behavior.” Actually, the woman she would most like to play is Zelda Fitzgerald. “I empathize with a woman like that.” About her own life, Miss Dunaway said, “I learned things about myselves.” She laughed at her Freudian slip. “Myself,” she corrected. “Schizophrenia is a strange word. You have all those voices inside.” Smiling, she patted her stomach. “Settle down!” she ordered her voices. “You try to deal with things, to have a focus. The reason for really extreme behavior is that you get deluded by one screaming voice inside.” Back on top, twice a star (and still only 34), recently married, for the first time, to hard rock star Peter Wolf (lead singer with the J. Geils Band), she faces a future of even greater promise than before. About her marriage, she said, “It puts a definition on a relationship. A door has been closed.” Her next picture is “The Towering Inferno” and in December she will star in a twoand‐a‐half hour NBC‐TV version of “After the Fall.” In this play, she said, she has the opportunity “to explore the, connection between pain and anger. Anger is only a mask of pain. With anger, you can get around the room.” Remembering her nights in the balcony watching “After the Fall,” she said, “This rounded a circle for me.” Then she added with an air of resolution, “I'm on the right track.” ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mrs. Keating Carries Senate Campaign to Brooklyn,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/mrs-keating-carries-senate-campaign-to-brooklyn-tv-ads-praised.html,"Barbara Keating, the Conservative candidate for the United States Senate, made an leight‐stop motorcade tour of Brooklyn yesterday in which she pressed her antibusing, antiabortion and antigovernment spending campaign themes and shook the hands of hundreds of friendly people. Mrs. Keating concentrated her activities yesterday in the Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Flatbush and Canarsie sections. A campaign aide explained that Mrs. Keating was concentrating on those areas where the successful 1970 Conservative candidate for the United States Senate, James L. Buckley, drew the most votes. Mrs. Keating told voters that she was the “only alternative” to her “ultraliberal” opponents Ramsey Clark, the Democratic candidate, and Senator Jacob K. Javits, the Republican incumbent. Because the 38‐year‐old housewife, who has not sought office before, is much less‐familiar to the public than the two majorparty candidates, she was preceded on the sidewalk by two bullhorn‐carrying campaign workers. The aides passed out her literature and urged passers‐by to shake hands with “the only candi date opposed to busing.” Mr. Clark and Senator Javits have supported busing as an occasionally necessary tool to achieve integration. TV Ads Praised At 86th Street and Bay Parkway in Bensonhurst, Mrs. Keating encountered several women who praised her television advertisements opposing abortion started running in various of the state last week. advertisements, which have cost $20,000 to date, were paid for by an antiabortion group. Mrs. Keating's husband was a marine major who was killed while serving in Vietnam in 1968. Encountering a voter under the elevated at 86th Street, in Bensonhurst, who apparently did not understand what office she was running for, Mrs. Keating explained, “I'm running against Ramsey Clark — he went to Hanoi with Jane Fonda.” Mr. Clark was not accompanied by Miss Fonda on his controversial trip to Hanoi, and Mrs. Keating was asked later why she had said that he was. “Well, mentally, I think they're together,” she said.” I think they're both disgusting.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FEW ISSUES FOUND IN EJECTION RACES ACROSS THE NATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/few-issues-found-in-election-races-across-the-nation-polls-and.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 19—The year of the first double‐digit inflation in peacetime, the year of Watergate reckoning and of the first Presidential resignation in American history, has also become a campaign year in which national “issues,” in the conventional sense, have almost disappeared. “Nineteen‐sixty‐six was a referendum on Lyndon Johnson, Vietnam, inflation,” observes Patrick Cadell, the Bostonbased pollster for Democratic candidates in a number of midterm races this year, “though can you imagine people worrying about inflation in 1966? “Nineteen‐seventy turned on issues that Richard Nixon created: ‘permissiveness,’ ‘radic‐libs,’ the ‘social issues.’ ‘Someone's Going to Pay’ “Both of those elections meant something. But I'm not sure that 1974, even with an avalanche building, will say anything except what we've been hearing all year: ‘Someone's going to pay!’” Pulse‐takers and candidates alike, surveyed in dozens of races around the country, agree that anxiety about the economy has driven other issues out of the public mind without giving voters a clear choice of economic remedies. Watergate scandal, in turn, has given rise to the “politics of full disclosure,” what some analysts call “the politics of character.” On both counts, Peter D. Hart, an independent pollster, calls 1974 “the year of the disappearing issue.” At a minimum, it has proven that the familiar political handles on the public mood are not working any more. Some hardy perennial issues, are truly gone, like Vietnam. Others, like “law and order” and “the welfare mess,” seem to have died of overexposure and been dropped from the language. Consumerism is no longer viewed as a political movement. Environmental issues are still lively in campaigns in a few growth‐torn states like Oregon and Colorado, and even more so along the path of the new coal boom, notably in North Dakota. Elsewhere, environmental protection as a popular cause has suffered in the energy shortage. Louis Harris, the pollster, reports that sample majorities favor‐ the Alaska pipeline and, among East Coast voters, oil drilling in the Atlantic. Potentially the most powerful national issues of 1974 were pre‐empted before most voters had a chance to address them. On July 25 the Supreme Court virtually banned the busing of children between city and suburb for purposes of school desegregation; and then on Aug. 9, Richard M. Nixon—himself the paramount “issue” in six special Congressional races earlier this year—resigned his Presidency. And finally the one surviving “super‐issue”—the high cost of living that nearly 8 of 10 Americans, in a Gallup poll, considered the most important problem facing the country—is an issue of such complexity and international scope that, while it feeds the public's impatience and undoubtedly helps Democrats in general, it presents few articulate choices between candidates for the Senate, the House or Governor's offices in 1974. “The hardest thing to write about in politics,” says Richard Scammon, an authority on voting patterns, “are the things that didn't happen.” But the mood of the moment, he suggests, derives from two nonevents in particular. “We didn't have a Senate trial of Richard Nixon in October,” he remarked in an interview. And because of the Supreme Court decision, “Labor Day was not the start of massive busing of suburban kids into the Detroit ghetto.” “Many of the social issues have been muted,” said Mr. Scammon, who defined them four years ago—from pot and protest to busing and abortion —in a book called “The Real Majority,” “because none of them are really controversial any more. “I don't think anything's taken their place,” he continued. “So it may be this is the nonissue year, and in a sense the nonparty year. It looks like a good year for Democrats because of the economy. But if you were to ask what is the Democratic program for '75 and '76 you'd come up with a blank sheet of paper.” “The only issue is the economy, and of course it hurts us,” says Eddie Mahe, the circuitriding campaign director at the Republican National Committee. “When have we ever won an election when the economy looked rocky?” Yet Democratic campaigners readily acknowledge that simply being out of the White House will get them more votes this year than any alternative they have defined to President Ford's economic program. “More people thing the Democrats are good for the economy,” Mr. Cadell remarks, “but part of that is that people think the Republicans are so bad for the economy. The relative difference on that point, and the intensity of feeling, are not as great as they were in 1958.” “Voters view the Democratic party as closer to the average man, and the Republican party is still associated with big business and special interests,” says Mr. Hart. “But people don't really feel either party can answer the overriding problem this year.” The fall campaigns of 1974, full of new candidates and personal styles, are almost barren of new issues. It has been bad year, too, for one‐issue candidates of any kind and for antibusing candidates in particular. Even as Boston schools were opening last month under an intensely unpopular busing order, John J. Kerrigan, the School Committee chairman, and City Councillor Albert L. O'Neill, two of the loudest voices against busing, lost their campaigns, respectively, to be Sheriff and District Attorney. Casualties of 1974 A busing order in Denver has stirred controversy in Colorado, too, but not enough to nominate Bill Daniels, the antibusing conservative, over Gov. John D. Vanderhoof in the Republican primary last month. And even in Detroit, where Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama rode the busing i,ssue to victory in Michigan's 1972 Presidential primary, Patrick A. McDonald, a leader of r'tibusing efforts on the city school board, lost to State Representative William M. Brodhead in the Democratic primary last August to succeed Representative Martha Griffths in Congress. Capital punishment, once viewed as an emerging issue, seems to have faded. In the Tennessee primaries for the Governor's office, for example, it did not seem to help Ross Bass that he was the only Democrat militantly opposed to the death penalty; neither did it help Nat Wilson that he declared, in the Republican primary, that “I could pull the switch” on the electric chair. Both candidates lost. The abortion issue is another casualty of 1974. In Pennsylvania last spring, Martin P. Mullen, as State Representative from Philadelphia, won less than a fifth of the Democratic primary vote campaigning against Gov. Milton J. Shapp's support of liberalized abortion. Elsewhere this fall many candidates are declaring their personal reservations about abortion but few are proposing any changes in the law. The scarcity of clear alternatives on issues this year would seem, to weaken the connection between people's choices in the voting booth and decision in government. But there is still room for debate as to whether the decline of issues represents a healing consensus or a cynical helplessness. Mr. Scammon and Mr. Cadell take the darker view—both of them, independently, in sports metaphors. Mr. Scammon senses “disappointment, frustration, anger—the sort of firethe ‐ coach mood that goes through the college alumni association even when the old grads know that the losing season wasn't the coach's fault.” Mr. Cadell worries about “the lack of linkage between voting and public policy.” Politics, he senses, is becoming a spectator sport. “People are voting the way they'd root for teams—trying to get involved, but feeling that they're not really affecting the outcome.” To Louis Harris, on the contrary, a measure of confusion and disillusionment is a part of maturity. “Issues,” he suspects, were often illusions. “The days of appealing to easy fears—fears of crime, racial fears, fear of Communism or some foreign power—have pretty much disappeared for our time with the demise of Richard Nixon,” Mr. Harris commented the other day. “But the whole idea that candidates can get elected by splitting up groups and promising each of them something is gone, too. Fifty‐eight per cent of the people don't think they get their money's worth out of government anyway, so even if they get what they're promised, they expect they'll pay for it siz or eight times over.” “What it means,” Mr. Harris continued, “is that the old politics of the promise and the handout, which has been the basis of Democratic politics, and the old politics of fear, which has been the predication of Republican politics, have all gone out the window. “It's a whole new ball, game,” he said. “I've never seen a period in American politics when the sense of community was so strong—when people sense that their own well‐being is tied up in the well‐being of everybody else.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coast Jews Tested for Rare Disease,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/coast-jews-tested-for-rare-disease.html,"SAN DIEGO, Oct. 19—Louis Weinstein and his wife, Laura, who is two months pregnant, sat in a crowded room at the Jewish Community Center here, staring at a four‐page questionnaire while they nervously waited their turn to give blood samples. After a whispered conversation, they wrote down that 22‐year‐old Laura would submit to an abortion and they would adopt a baby if tests showed that their unborn child has inherited from them a rare but fatal genetic disease found mostly among Jews of Russian or Polish extraction. Until a few weeks ago neither of them had heard of Tay‐Sachs disease, or the fact that one out of every 30 American Jews is a carrier of the defect. The disease condemns one in 3,000 newborn Jewish infants to mental retardation, crippled bodies and death before the age of 4 or 5 years. The disease occurs only once in about 300,000 non‐Jewish births. The Weinsteins were among some 4,000 San Diego Jews of child‐bearing age being screened in a two‐week pilot program to seek out carriers of the incurable disease caused by a lack of an essential enzyme, hexosaminodase‐A, or Hex‐A. The disease causes rapid and fatal damage to the central nervous system and brain. Sponsors of the test program, here and in Los Angeles hope that the program will lead to a national network of free clinics under the Federal Institute of Child Health and Development to combat the affliction. Should‐the blood tests, which take 10 days to complete, show both of them to be carriers, Mrs. Weinstein will undergo another test, a tapping of the amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant in her womb. She was told by a genetic counselor that, even if both she and her husband were carriers, there would still be a 75 per cent chance that their child would not be afflicted and there would be no need for an abortion. The counselor said that the odds against both of them being carriers were 800 or 900 to 1. The first laboratory results involving some 600 San Diego Jews 18 to 40 years old were reported to have corroborated existing data indicating that some 200,000 of the country's six million Jews, mostly of Ashkenazi ancestry from Central and Eastern Europe, are carriers. Only when the genes of both parents have an insufficient level of Hex‐A is there danger of their child having Tay‐Sachs disease, fated to die in infancy because its body cannot assimilate the lipid, or fatty substance, accumulating in the blood. The regressive gene that causes the disease was discovered here in 1969 by a team headed by Dr. John S. O'Brien, chairman of the department of Neurosciences at the University of California School of‐Medicine They were able to identify the lack of Hex‐A either in the blood of prospective parents or, in pregnant women, from samples of the amniotic fluid. An absence or a very low level of the enzyme in the amniotic fluid is “an almost sure sign” that the child will be born with the disease and will die in infancy, said Dr. Raymond N. Peterson, director of the Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled here. If the woman is not pregnant, a carrier couple can elect not to have children, can adopt a child, can resort to artificial insemination from a nonaffected donor or, preferably, wait until she is pregnant, when a test of the amniotic fluid can determine whether an abortion is indicated. Mrs. Barbara Dixon, a genetic counselor, said that almost all the Jewish couples screened here have accepted abortion as a “preferable alternative” if the two tests showed the likelihood of their having a Tay‐Sachs child. Many of those taking the tests, she added, are young single Jews, some of them engaged to be married. Several who have had healthy children have asked to be tested “because they feel they may have been fortunate and don't want to stretch their luck.” The San Diego free clinics are being sponsored by the local chapter of the March of Dimes, the regional center, the medical school's pediatrics department and the Council of Jewish Women, with assistance of some 100 volunteers from Jewish groups. Dr. Michael Kaback, director of the California Tay‐Sachs Disease Prevention Program and Dr. O'Brien said that the TaySachs studies might lead to means of prenatal detection and treatment for other genetic disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Nation /Continued,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/nationally-the-issues-are-translated-into-personalities-the.html,"WASHINGTON—Is it pure coincidence that some of the most compelling views about political people this fall are or over the borderline of their private lives—Nelson Rockefeller's gift‐giving and Wilbur Mills' nightlife? At the level of campaign politics, it has been very much that kind of year. “Nothing is sacred, everything is personal,” observes Peter D. Hart, the pollster, generalizing about a score of local mid‐term races. Overriding apprehension about the economy seems somehow beyond simple definition and political debate. And after Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew were hoist on their own law‐and‐order petards, voters seem to be saying that “issues” in the old sense—platforms and promises about “missile‐gap” and “permissiveness,” or even abortion and school busing—do not mean that much anyway. In the 1974 campaign, character is almost all, and everyone is suspect. A lot of the tone and what little content there is in the election contests are summed up in the give‐and‐take of the Iowa Senate campaign. “Hi, I'm David Stanley from Muscatine, running for the United States Senate,” says the Republican nominee, a rich, energetic, 46‐year‐old State Senator who nearly beat Senator Harold Hughes six years ago for the seat Mr. Hughes is now giving up. The curbstone greeting to voters continues: “I really need your help to clean up that Congress and get rid of all those big spenders to fight inflation.” Of his Democratic opponent, five‐term Representative John C. Culver, he adds: “If you like inflation you'll love Culver. If you can't afford inflation, you can't afford Culver.” Mr. Culver dismisses the “big spender” charge as “demagoguery,” but the Democrats bore in harder on the picture of “Mr. Clean from Muscatine.” When Mr. Stanley seemed to boast that he was not taking any “special interest” money, Democrats pressed him to disclose that for past campaigns he had received close to a half‐million dollars from his father. Mr. Stanley had the further distinction, as Democrats dug up the record, of being the only State Senator in Iowa history ever formally charged with conflict of interest. His slogan against Mr. Hughes in 1968, they reminded the state, was “Nixon needs Stanley.” The Republidans, or course, have fired back. How was it possible, they asked, that the infamous milk cooperatives made illegal corporate contributions to the Democratic party in Iowa to finance voter registration in 1971 without Mr. Culver's ever knowing it? And why, Mr. Stanley asked, after Mr. Culver bared his personal finances, had be not filed a separate financial diselosure for his wife? The only nationally concerted .theme of the 1974 campaign is the Republican effort (with man‐by‐man tabulations from headquarters here) to hold Democratic incumbents responsible for the grand total of appropriations they have voted for. In the Indiana campaign against Senator Birch Bayh, the main line of Indianapolis Mayor Richard G, Lugar's attack is the assertion that in an average year Mr, Bayh votes for expenditures $25‐billion above the budget. “He's a nice guy,” Republicans say of Senator Bayh, “but Indiana can't afford him.” In the First District of Iowa, Republican James Leach says that Representative Edward Mezvinsky, a first‐term Democrat, voted for $408‐billion in appropriations this year. In the South Dakota Senate race Leo Thorsness, the Republican, charges flatly that his opponent, Senator George McGovern, is “the third biggest spender” in the Senate. Clearly by now, however, there is no magic, in the attack. Few Democrats are campaigning for new spending ventures this year, and many incumbents cast precautionary budgettrimming votes as the campaign season approached. But even Republican polls show that fewer than a third of the voters see Government spending as the chief cause of inflation, and most of them are Republicans anyway. There may be less faith than ever that any party can solve the economic problem, but the tribal memory still favors Democrats in bad times, especially when Republicans hold the White House. And so, in state after state, as in the Stanley‐Culver race in Iowa, campaigns this year seem to lurch, from shadowboxing on the economy to a sometimes nasty level of personal attack. In another time it might be described as namecalling. In the Watergate era it is billed as a purity contest. But the politics of probity, or whatever else it is called, has largely displaced the usual sense of a national referendum on something. Democrats, here and there, have suffered by the purity standard, Gov. David Hall of Oklahoma, under sustained grand jury investigation in connection with personal taxes and campaign financing; ran third in the Democratic primary for renomination last summer. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who had hoped to win the seat he has been holding by appointment, was probably doomed in his primary against former astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. last spring by disclosure that he had a $100,000 tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service and had paid no income tax at all because of deductions in 1969. Republicans, though, are almost automatically vulnerable to the Nixon connection and a keen curiosity about the special interests that back them. For some candidates there are pointed questions to answer: In the New Hampshire Senate race, for example, Representative Louis Wyman, the Republican nominee, is still explaining his role in coaxing a $30.000 contribution to the 1972 Nixon campaign from Dr. Ruth Farkas, who was rewarded in turn, with an Ambassadorship in Luxembourg. In Colorado, Senator Peter Dominick, hard pressed by Gary Hart, the 36‐year‐old Democratic challenger, is still denying that he funneled “milk money” to the Nixon campaign in 1971. Seldom have so many politicians seemed so much on the defensive, which may be where they belong. But seldom has the play of style and personality so overshadowed the policy decisions ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why Are College Kids in a Lather Over TV Soap Operas?,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/why-are-college-kids-in-a-lather-over-tv-soap-operas.html,"It's a gray afternoon in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The time is 1 P.M. A television set glowing dully across the room is tuned to “All My Children,” a serial tale of frustrated love among constantly distraught young adults. On the screen, Phil, a tall, dark‐haired, athletically built Vietnam veteran in his mid20's, stands nervously in a phone booth and at the other end of the line is Tara, a tall, striking brunette in her mid20's, whose relationship with Phil to date has included elopement, illegitimate childbirth and wartime Separation among other no less emotional cataclysms. What does he want from her now? She thought he was gone from her life forever! A gasp rises from the audience. The audience? Is this gathering, perhaps, a group of middle‐aged housewives who have assembled for tea and vicarious sympathy? Scarcely. The scene is the TV lounge at Brooklyn College. More than a hundred young faces—white, black, male, female — are staring fixedly at the television screen. All the chairs are filled. As shill more students pack into the room, they squat on sshe floor or lean against the walls, And now, there's standing room only. Just as the climax of the half_ hour episode approaches, two late‐comers bang open the lounge doors amd start noisily across the room. “Hey, shut up!” bawls a male voice. “This is heavy stuff!” There is nothing unique about this scene in Flatbush. The situation is much the same in Columbia University dormitories and New York University's Loeb Student Center, in fraternity and sorority houses from Boston to Madison to Berkeley, in Ivy League college lounges and student apartments throughout the metropolitan New York area alike. A clutch of Lehman College co‐eds rush from classes to their shared Bronx flat to catch the latest installment of “One Life To Live”; a band of Queens College underclassmen try—unsuccessdully—to switch the school's closed ‐ circuit TV station to pull in the “soaps”; a Wheaton, Ill., graduate boasts that her most adroit accomplishment over the past four years was never to schedule an afternoon class while “All My Children” was on the air. Although soap opera aficionados would seem to be minority among college students, there are none. theless thousands of young people around the country who daily put aside their Sartre, Machiavelli and Freud —not to mention such obsolete writers as Fanon and Debray—to watching the moiling passions of middle‐class America as portrayed on daytime TV. What is it about these slow‐moving melodramas with their elasticized emotions that today's college students find so engrossing? Dov Stern, business manager of Lehman College's student newspaper, “Meridiah,” offers one possible explanation: today's students are going through a process of “internalization, putting more emphasis on developing themselves” than on the idealistic causes of past years. Soap operas, he suggests, teach people something about themselves by portraying “life as it is” or at least by providing living characters that young viewers can easily identify with, as they would with similar characters in a novel. “It's just easier to go home and watch TV than to get ‘involved,’” he says. But that's not the whole story. For the fact is that in recent years the subject mat. ter of daytime TV has changed and become much more relevant to the interests of young viewers. Into the world of frazzled passions and leaden drama, which could grip chiefly the bored housewife (homebound women still comprise the largest proportion of afternoon viewers), contemporary issues have been injected. The “generation gap,” abortion, obscenity, narcotics and political protest are now commonly discussed and dealt with on the soap operas of TV. From its inception in January, 1970, “All My Children” has consistently employed topical material. “It was a kind of ‘first,’” explains Lewis Antine, an American history graduate student at New York's City University. “It was a sense of your stuff being on TV for the first time, like ‘Hey, they're talking about us on Mom's Show! How will they handle it?’” In the wake of the success of “All My Children,” (right from the start, the show has enjoyed healthy Nielsen ratings) even such hoary serials as “Love of Life,” “The Guiding Light” and “Search for Tomorrow” have begun to toy with “relevant” social subjects. At least one new entry this season, “The Young and the Restless,” revolves almost entirely around young people's problems. • In general, most regular campus serial‐watchers are underclassmen, having picked up the habit while in high school. And, though some co‐eds might be less than flattered by the asserts. don by Brooklyn College biology senior Ian Newmark that “most females in our so. ciety still hover towazd the romantic, and the soap operas spoon‐feed them vicarious thrills,” noticeably more females than males on college campuses are seemingly addicted to the “soaps.” Some students claim they watch the soaps for a dose of “realism,” others for a taste of “unreality”; some say they find them thrilling and exotic, while still others see in the soap opera an emotional blueprint of their own home life. Jeff Loesser, a Queens College senior majoring in communications, believes that young viewers prefer to “concentrate on somebody else's problems instead of their own — problems you know are going to be a lot bigger and worse than your own.” Sherma Smith agrees. An education major In her third year at Brooklyn College, she has rarely missed an installment of “All My Children” in its four turgid years. “Although the show isn't realistic,” she says, “it does make life seem more exciting and romantic.” And, as Lewis Antine at CUNY points out, “A soap opera moves awesomely slow, as slow as lire Itself. A day in real life is a day in the soap opera, not like an evening show where everything is compressed into an hour or two. The soaps set up an unresolved situation and you spend a month waiting and waiting and waiting for them to resolve it. It's addicting.” Indeed, many students admit that once they have become hooked on a given TV serial they find it virtually impossible to kick the habit. For example, Susie Monaco, a sophomore at Barnard College, concedes that she has been watching “General Hospital” at least once a month for years; when asked, however, what interested her in the program, she replied, “Nothing. It's terrible.” Bud Kloss, producer of “All My Children,” by far the most popular serial among college students, receives loads, of letters and petitions from student groups around the country requesting that the serial's story line be developed in one or another way. The program's creator, Agnes Nixon, also receives quantities of similar correspondence; in addition, a year ago this past spring she received a visit from a delegation of seniors from Duke University in Durham, N. C. A student spokesman for the delegation of “All My Children” fans told her: “The show is one of the few constants in our lives.” A long‐time professional writer for television, Mrs. Nixon lives with her husband and their four children (three girls and a boy, all in their late teens or early 20s) in Bryn Mawr, Pa., a community which, according to Mrs. Nixon, is the prototype of the serial's “Pine Valley.” She graduated from Northwestern University (in the same class with such future Hollywood notables as Charlton Heston and Cloris Leachman) and has had at least one of her shows aired every day for the past 19 years. She created “Children” essentially for herself, she says, and draws its material from the daily events she sees around her in Bryn Mawr. “I used to think,” Mrs. Nixon says, “that one reason for the show's popularity was that old people would be interested in young people's romances, but it turns out that young people are just as interested in the older characters in the series as in the young ones.” • Marc Frons, a Brooklyn College sophomore and soaps fan, suggests that the TV serials are not only the heirs to the pulp magazines of earlier times and the 19thcentury serialized fiction of writers like Bulwer‐Lytton, but also the cousins, in their sweep of time and emotion if not their depth, of Balzac, Dostoevsky and Proust. Soapopera time flows with expansive slowness, and human affairs are (at least theoretically) explored as slowly as they are in real life; at best, perhaps, the soaps manage to portray life in all its true banality rather than attempting to squeeze art from what is inherently a pretty bland affair. “After all,” as one Columbia art history graduate student — female — observes, “life itself is a soap opera anyway.”■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Catholics and Jews Urged to Conduct Greater Dialogue,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/catholics-and-jews-urged-to-conduct-greater-dialogue.html,"Archbishop Jean Jadot, the representative of Pope Paul VI in this country, called last week for a “fuller, deeper and more open” dialogue between Jews and Roman Catholics. He specifically singled out for broader discussion the subjects of abortion and aid to private schools. The prelate, the apostolic delegate to the Roman Catholic Church in this country, addressed more than 50 leaders of American Judaism at a luncheon Thursday in the headquarters of the American Jewish Committee, at 165 East 56th Street. According to the Archbishop, many of the differences between the two faiths over abortion and parochial‐school aid arise from a lack of dialogue, not its failure. “To say that abortion and aid to public schools are strictly Catholic issues is not only questionable, but false,” he declared. “Catholics consider them to be community concerns. Oddly, it is non‐Catholic opinion that for the greater part views them as Catholic. “We must also question the proposition that ‘the Jews’ in general have opposed the efforts against the liberalization of abortion laws or to obtain aid for private schools. There is, to my knowledge, no single position on these two issues to which all Jews or all Jewish groups would subscribe.” Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, national director of the committee's interreligious affairs department, introduced Archbishop Jadot and said his presence was a “significant mement” for the Jewish community,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What Grand Rapids did for Jerry Fiord—and vice versa,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/what-grand-rapids-did-for-jerry-fordvice-and-versa-a-reporter.html,"In his address to Congress shortly after taking over the Presidency, Gerald Ford twice mentioned his hometown, Grand Rapids. This was considerably more attention than Richard Nixon ever gave Whittier, Calif., or Lyndon Johnson gave Johnson City, Tex., in a major speech and it no doubt testified to Ford's real affection for the place where he grew up and that had kept him in Congress for 25 years. However, grateful as he was to his constituents in the Fifth District of Michigan, he also let it be known privately that, as President, he no longer felt an allegiance to their backwardness. “Forget the voting record,” he was quoted as saying. “The voting record reflects Grand Rapids.” That would mean a majority of the Grand Rapids electorate had pressed him into the actions he took as Congressman to undercut civil‐rights legislation and to oppose Medicaid, job‐opportunity funds, rent subsidies, Federal aid to education, mass‐transit money, urban‐renewal funds and everything that went into the general slot of “poverty programs.” Partly because Ford was its Representative, and partly because of the self‐perpetuating powers legend, Grand Rapids had the reputation of being a square, unimaginative, conservative, strictly Midwest Gothic city that for generations has been squished into a Calvinistic straitjacket by its large population of Dutch lineage. This is what I expected to find when I visited Grand Rapids recently. And I found just the opposite. From what I saw and heard out there, it seems more likely that Gerald Ford's 25‐year voting record represented Gerald Ford: it was a simple downthe‐line expression of Republican partisanship, and Grand Rapids is not simple at all, or unimaginative, or ideologically monolithic, or predictable. With its sick downtown and its boring suburban sprawl, Grand Rapids does look like hundreds of other American urban areas, but below the surface it has a fascinating split personality. While its crime rate is climbing faster than the national average (up 11.7 per cent locally in 1973 compared to 6 per cent nationally), its stability in terms of home ownership is also much higher (75 per cent in Kent County). The psychic split is also, in some ways, a geographic one. The Grand River cuts through the city. Traditionally, the tone of the city has been set by the Dutch/German/English, Protestant, affluent element on the east bank. (The Dutch make up 39 per cent of the county's population.) But sometimes—especially in recent years—the Polish/ Lithuanian/Latino, Catholic mostly blue‐collar romantics on the west bank have set the tone. A reporter visits the President's hometown, expecting to find a conservative, Calvinistic, square segment of Middle America. Among his surprises: the city is way ahead of its favorite son. Grand Rapids's Omar Khayyam impulses are just below the surface. Philip W. Buchen, one of President Ford's legal advisers, briefly dropped out of one of Grand Rapids's most prestigious law firms (not that he ever practiced law with much enthusiasm) to write poetry and, as one friend put it, “contemplate things.” This 35‐year‐old heir to one of Grand Rapids's old family businesses told me he longs for the day when he can quit the industry and open a book‐and‐pipe shop. One of Grand Rapids's prominent politicians got fed up with things a few months ago and went off on a motorcycle to write poetry and drink wine in the mountains of New Mexico; he's hack now, but he daydreams of another excursion, this time “maybe with 15 Indian women.” Despite the repaation of Grand Rapids as a city cowering under the heavy hand of Dutch Calvinism, it has always had its fair share of whoopee. Until 1950, when national chains squeezed them out of the market, it had always had at least one local brewery. Several pillars of the community informed me, with what almost seemed to be pride, that that area used to have one of the highest illegitimate birth rates in the nation. Half a dozen years ago, an enterprising pilgrim moved into Grand Rapids and opened a porno movie house and a porno book store, and was sent to prison for being a pioneer; but X‐rated movies these days can be viewed in three four theaters. There was a time when members of a (Dutch) Christian Reformed Church congregation, learning that the trolley line which passed in front of their church carried people to an amusement park on Sundays, went out at night and dug up the tracks by hand. But those were ancient rages, no longer applicable. The influence today is still pervasive, but quieter. Only a couple of years ago did stores start trying to do much business on Sundays. But there is really no way to tell where the Dutch churches' weight in such matters ends and the Baptists' weight, say, begins, for the latter are strong in Grand Rapids, too, as are Catholics and Methodists and Presbyterians — though all together they did not have the power, or perhaps the inclination, to keep “Deep Throat” away. Urban renewal went through the downtown area like a $50‐million glacier, leaving behind some imposingly cold, square, glassy buildings. In the renewed area, there is absolutely no mixture of architecture, old and new, and no mixture of purpose: no theaters, no coffeehouses, no cafes. After the bankers and the government workers go home, the downtown area of Grand Rapids, and especially the renewed portion, is as lifeless as the inside of the corner mailbox after the last pickup. Some citizens made a passionate effort to save the old city hall with its clock tower. They wrote Representative Ford asking what could be done and he replied that all they needed was the cooperation of the local developers (that is, hankers), but the developers said no. Mary Stiles, former wife of Jack Stiles, one of Ford's early campaign managers, The first real schism between Ford and the people of Grand Rapids didn't come until he took over as Vice President and went out defending Nixon. chained herself to the wrecking ball to delay the razing. But the developers outwaited her. That may sound as if they wound up with nothing but acres and acres of Russian‐style progress. But actually it doesn't look too bad. And the reason that Grand Rapids managed to be different in a way that one probably wouldn't anticipate in a place half way between Plainwell and Newaygo. They bought a Calder and plunked it right down in the middle of Vandenberg Center plaza. Not just a Calder but the most enormous stabile in this hemisphere: 42 tons of red metal that from a distance looks something like the propeller of the Queen Mary, 54 feet long, 43 feet high, 30 feet wide. It came about—as few major civic endeavors Grand Rapids do—in an almost offhanded fashion. Henry Geldzahler, curator of 20th century art the Metropolitan Museum, was in town to give a lecture. Mrs. LeVant Mulnix III, a tall, blonde, arts‐socialite dervish, was driving him around, showing him what the city was tearing down and what it was building. Geldzahler, sensing an impending barrenness, mentioned that Federal grants might be available for monumental civic sculpture. Mrs. Mulnix wrote Representative Ford; Ford leaned on Roger L. Stevens, then chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and five days later Stevens was calling Mrs. Mulnix to say that they had decided Grand Rapids should be the first city in America to receive a sculpture grant. The Federal Government came through with $45,000; private donations took care of the rest of the $125,000—and to Mrs. Mulnix's surprise, Alexander Calder agreed to do it at that bargain price. Most people in Grand Rapids seem to think La Grande Vitesse, as it is called, is the greatest thing that's happened to their town since the first furniture factory opened. The Chamber of Commerce puts out a brochure that assures visitors that to stand before this stabile “and gaze up, along its massive, sweeping planes is to catch something of the vitality, newness and progress that is Grand Rapids today.” Hard‐nosed businessmen get lyrical over it. One told me: “We had lost our identity. The Calder was like a great big heart bringing us to life again.” Another businessman said: “The Calder expressed something: That this town dared to do something. We weren't like Chicago that hired Picasso, who wasn't a sculptor, to do a civic sculpture. Grand Rapids went out and hired the greatest sculptor in the world. We didn't do the easy thing and go after the biggest name. We went after a particular genius. The town is proud of doing that.” As for Ford, the stabile has been a fabulous store of political riches. Until the Calder came along, Ford took a very dim view of the National Endowment for the Arts and voted against funding it. There's no reason to suppose he responded to Mrs. Mulnix's plea for help for any reason except that she and her family are important constituents (and maybe because Betty Ford was a classmate of Mrs. Mulnix's mother‐in‐law). But when he saw that most Grand Rapidians were ga‐ga over the sculpture, he became the most vocal artsy convert in Washington. When the National Endowment's budget next came up in. Congress he urged passage. It gave him a marvelous opportunity to pretend he was a bumbling jock feeling his way around in the world of eggheads—a role he plays very effectively. As President, he is still using the Calder to score that kind of image. In his first Presidential visit to the Kennedy Center for the 10th anniversary of the National Council on the Arts, made up of prominent figures in the world of the arts, Ford referred with pride to “the Alexander Calder mobile in my hometown. Mo‐beel. Is that the right pronunciation? [It is the right pronunciation for a different kind of Calder; this one is a stabile, as Ford was undoubtedly aware, but a little ignorance is part, of the of the show.] I point it out to all the visitors, including the Secret Service, and I tell them it's nothing they should worry about.” It got the usual laugh. “I am a converted individual. And I make no apology for it. Converts are known sometimes as better advocates than those brought up in the religion.” With everyone having such good time and benefiting so richly from this one work of art, it might be supposed that Grand Rapids's top people would rush on to find other community ‐ art pleasures, even if that meant spending their own money for them, instead of waiting to get a project primed with a Federal grant. But apparently that isn't the way things work in Grand Rapids, or at least not where the moneybags are concerned. The plain folks of Grand Rapids have not been stingy in supporting the standard sort of community development; in the past 20 years they have voted to tax themselves for everything that's been put on the ballot: a new airport, a new jail, a county hospital, a juvenile court center, a library. They voted to tax themselves to build the only county mental hospital in Michigan. They voted to strap themselves into a city income tax. But when it comes to community luxuries of the sort that must depend on heavy drafts of philanthropic dollars, the rich stratum of Grand Rapids society does not step forward enthusiastically. It's said that the city has more than 200 millionaires, the oldest of their fortunes having been built on lumber, foundries and furniture. Some of the founders of the great fortunes stole timber from their neighbor's property, stole logs that were being transported downstream and exploited indentured servants brought over from the old country. Their descendants no longer steal money; they simply sit on it and stare suspiciously at such new entrepreneurs as the two local gentlemen, Jay VanAndel and Richard DeVos, who, 16 years ago, started a soap business in the basements of their homes and today operate a veritable international empire under the name of Amway Corporation, headquartered in the Grand Rapids suburb of Ada. The company claimed sales of $210‐million in 1973. Each year it throws a big convention for its distributors; 10,000 or so show up; people such as Paul Harvey are hired to deliver rousing patriotic‐profits sermons to them. The old families sniff at such goings‐on. Anything new, in style or pace or substance, is critically analyzed. But new or old, the wealthy people of Grand Rapids generally have one thing in common: They don't exactly overwhelm anyone with philanthropy. There are exceptions, but only a few. (The very wealthy seem to prefer to give, if at all, to their churches. DeVos and VanAndel, for example, gave $100,000 to move their old parochial high school Christian Reformed Church school — out of the ghetto and reestablish it elsewhere.) “Grand Rapids hasn't fulfilled a Community Chest pledge in years,” said one middle‐aged executive. “It's a triumph if we come close.” I asked John Wood Blodgett Jr., who controls one of the lumber fortunes, if it was true, as I had been told, that he was about to give away many millions to a college. “For God's sake,” he gasped, “where did you hear that? Of course it's not true.” For decades, the people of Grand Rapids have really turned out for their Civic Theater productions. But these are performed in an old worn‐out ex‐movie house. The only toilet available to the actors is under the stage and can't be used during a performance because the flush can be heard in the audience. There's a drive now under way to collect about $2‐million to build a new theater on the bank of the Grand River, and once again the drive being headed by Mrs. Mulnix, who brought the Calder to town, and by her husband, whose family is old Grand Rapids but not among the richest. Their social peers are not chipping in. “This is not a very philanthropic town,” says Mrs. Mulnix. Some of the city's decay has been the resuit of the large influx of blacks. But the migratory torrent didn't commence until Ford had left town. In the picture of South High School's 1930 football team, on which Jerry Ford was an all‐state center, there is one black face, right in the middle of the team. This was Silas McGee, and for a number of years he was referred to as “the lost member,” because his teammates didn't know what had happened to him; then, at the 1970 reunion of the team, it was joyfully announced that Silas had been found: He was longshoring on the docks of San Francisco. When Ford was growing up in Grand Rapids, there was some de facto segregation, but there was also some integration. In any event, the race question was no big deal in those days, because, in 1920, blacks constituted only 0.8 per cent of the population. Two decades later, they still made up only 1 per cent—1,660 blacks in a city of 164,292. The heavy migration of blacks to the North during the war raised this to 4 per cent by 1950, and in the next 10 years the percentage doubled. Today it is pushing toward 15 cent. Racial tensions exist, of course, but so far there's been little racial panic. When Detroit was having its big race riot in 1967, Grand Rapids blacks threw a little riot of their own, but it was handled in a typically Grand Rapids fashion: quite a few arrests (150 or so) for a cooling‐off period, but no deaths and not many injuries. The most dramatic moment of the riot had a touch of humor, when the blacks were whooping and hollering and threatening, and Deputy Police Chief Francis Pierce just stood there smiling, talking to the mob, and leaning on his carbine as if it were a cane. Pierce Grand Rapids's authentic hero; he came off Iwo Jima with a Medal of Honor, and seems to have spent the rest of his life trying to recapture the thrill of that era. A couple of years ago, black people took Grand Rapids school officials into court and won an order to increase busing for racial balance; but when the order was handed down, it contained more praise than condemnation for the way Grand Rapids had been performing. The judge noted, among other things, that the facilities at the predominantly black schools had always been as good as at white schools; that Grand Rapids residents had not used private schools to escape integration; that the school board's efforts since 1965 to achieve racial balance were “impressive” and “dramatic”; that although the school boird may have been a bit reluctant, it had been hiring some black teachers for predominantly white schools even back in the nineteen‐forties, and between 1964 and 1967, when the push was really on to integrate everything, the board hired 98 per cent of the black teachers interviewed. Ford's boyhood home, a two‐story frame, has been abused by lack of tenants. Windows are broken, screens ripped out; the back porch has rotted; electric wires have been cut. If the atmosphere of the neighborhood where Ford grew up (through his junior year at South High) wasn't bon ton, it was a long way from being rundown. It was a neighborhood of storekeepers and railroad engineers and teachers—the good, substantial backbone of a city that then had a population of about 150,000. Today the neighborhood is almost totally black and some of the houses in nearby blocks are in poor shape, although it is still true, as a Chamber of Commerce official put it, “being dilapidated here is different from being dilapidated in New York City.” After his junior year in high school, Ford lived in East Grand Rapids, which has hung onto its whiteness, although the blacks are moving closer. Ford's earlier home, a two‐story frame, has been abused by lack of tenants. Windows are broken, screens ripped out; the back porch has rotted; the electric wires have been cut. Until a few weeks ago, the President's former home could have been purchased for $10,000; it had been on the market a long time with little prospect of being snapped up, because, the realtors said, “that is not a salable neighborhood.” The Veterans Administration owns the house by default but re portedly would be happy to give it to the city if it wanted to turn the place into a lowermiddle‐class shrine. Some residents think that would be a fine idea but the house should be moved to a safer neighborhood. To the restoration purists, that's a horrible suggestion. “Disastrous, absolutely disastrous, that's what it would be,” says Weldon Frankforter, director of the Grand Rapids Public Museum and officer in the Kent County Historical Society. “Imagine having that hole in the neighborhood, and people going by it and asking what happened to the house, and we'd have to say we moved it away from those people to save it.” Buchen, Ford's legal aide, has sounded out the locals to see what their attitude is toward restoring the house; apparently Ford doesn't want to do it unless there's some enthusiasm. Oddly enough, there is no great drive to save the house as yet, says Frankforter. As of early September, the City Commission hadn't expressed an interest. “But don't get me wrong,” Frankforter adds hurriedly. “When Mr. Ford's here, the Rotary Club, the Breakfast Club, everybody is really proud. He's ours. But this just isn't rah‐rah town.” Newspaper stories about the neighborhood and the condition of the old Ford house have made people in the block pretty mad. Next door arc Mr. and Mrs. Henry Jones, black people in their late 60's, he a retired teamster and she a retired domestic. They've lived there for 15 years, but Mrs. Jones was born and reared only a block away. She doesn't feel that she and the other blacks have “pushed in.” The neighborhood has always had some integration. Mrs. Jones went to Ford's high school about 10 years before he did. She walked to school with whites as well as blacks, she says. “We visited whites” homes. There were no locked doors. We had black the high ‐ school football team. “In those days, blacks worked only in foundries and in hotels and on the railroad. And of course they were domestics. I used to work for Dr. James Logie, physician. He's a cousin of Ford's. Ford was there for dinner a couple of times, but he wouldn't remember me. He might remember my apple pie. He loved it. My niece worked for Grandma Ford. We called her that. I worked for her, too, “Now blacks can work just anywhere. Grand Rapids is one of the greatest places in the world to live and raise a family. Nobody moves away. My daughter and granddaughters and great‐grandchildren live here.” Mrs. Jones's home — as every house on the block, except the Fords' and another on the corner that looks a bit seedy — is shipshape, inside and out. She insisted I come inside to see for myself. All homes but one on the block are owner‐occupied. The one white in the block, Sylvia English, who wishes reporters would stop listing her as 78 years old, “could just cry” for the way Richard Nixon was treated and remembers nothing about Ford except that “he used to swing on Georgia Hopper's clothesline pole.” Gerald Ford Sr., founder of the Ford Paint Company, brought home the Chamber of Commerce philosophy. He is dead now, and the word is that the family no longer has a controlling interest in the company, but the President's half‐brother, Dick does still manage the plant. In Dick Ford's office, the few photos on the wall are of himself and his brothers in golf togs, which is appropriate enough since most of the company's business these days is supplying paints and varnishes to golf club manufacturers. “Jerry has an 18 handicap,” says Dick. “I have a six handicap. When Jerry comes home, my brother Jim [a Grand Rapids optometrist] and I usually manage to get in a round of golf with him. We get somebody else to make up the foursome, but with the understanding that there will be no political talk. We are all very close. Jerry is 11 years older than I am, and he was a great brother. He was just the right age to introduce me to tennis and baseball and football. “Jerry does use me as a sounding board for some of his ideas, but I think I've already detected his moving to the left. I'm a right‐winger. He's too liberal for me. I've only written him about something political once in my life. “I think it was in 1969.1 told him I didn't think the draft dodgers and deserters should get amnesty. I don't remember whether he answered my letter. “By and large, life hasn't changed for me since Jerry became President. When he was sworn in, tears came to my eyes. I was proud of him. Bul nothing has changed for me. Not at all. When he was being considered for the Vice Presidency, some investigators for the House Judiciary Committee came by here, checking up on the paint company. I told them we weren't selling a single bucket to the Federal Government. told them we didn't even put in a bid when they were goik; to build the new post office here, They asked me why, and I said: ‘Because I knew some day there'd be some jokers like you coming around like this.’” Old‐timers say that the Ford Paint Company made its first killing selling paint to the state of Michigan. There's another half‐brother Tom who hangs out around Lansing as a minor state functionary. He used to represent part of Grand Rapids in the Legislature, but he was defeated in 1972. Asked to describe Tom, one city leader replied: “When he was on the library commission, some of the women felt East Grand Rapids should have a library and they came to him with that proposal. East Grand Rapids is where the Ford home is. Tom replied: ‘We don't really need a library out there. Everyone has his own books.’ Does that tell you about Tom? Eventually, they got a library, but Tom voted it.” The Ford boys—all good athletes—can perhaps be forgiven if the mark of the JackArmstrong‐boola‐boola era is still evident in their view of the world. They grew up when every young American boy was assured that if he did well in high‐school sports and respected his elders and went to church, God and the alumni would take care of him. The way to be different was to fit in the best. It was a generation that would have taken as a compliment the remark by the Rev. Donald Carey, former minister of the Fords church, Grace Episcopal: “Gerald Ford is a normal, decent God‐fearing man, but you can say that about a lot of people.” The Chamber of Commerce of Ford's youth advertised not only the existence of “150 miles of tree‐lined streets; 43 parks and playgrounds covering 1,273 acres,” but also “the only filtration plant in the country with a lecture room” and “the largest showcase factory in the world.” Today the Chamber mentions that one can shoot a deer within seven minutes of downtown and that Yamaha has placed its first U.S. assembly plant in Grand Rapids. It is this orderly, stable and commercial side of Grand Rapids, still very much alive, that is Ford's political umbilical. “Jerry Ford was fortunate enough,” says Tom LaBelle, an editor of The Grand Rapids Press, “to grow up in a town that rewarded virtue. An Eagle Scout was respected, and he became an Eagle Scout. Two of his three brothers were, too. A sports hero was respected—they weren't looked upon as jocks. They were genuine heroes. And Jerry Ford became one. There were two newspapers in those days and they posted football scores outside, by the quarter, and mobs showed up to keep in touch with the games. When Jerry chokes up today as he talks about football, he's reflecting the feeling toward football in his youth.” Being a high‐school hero, Ford received such special treatment that he hardly knew the Great Depression had hit. A cafe owner across from South High gave him $2 a week and lunch for waiting on tables; at about the same time, Ford's father was paying grown men at his paint manufacturing company $5 a week to raise their families on. But just because Jerry Ford has always been pampered by his hometown does not mean he's. Grand Rapids's ideal statesman. True, he always got more than 60 per cent of the vote, but that can't safely be equated with his district's ideology. Many who disagreed almost totally with his political philosophy voted for him because he performed superbly in getting Federal money for his district and in servicing constituent needs. Or sometimes they voted for him simply because they liked him. Just about everybody in Grand Rapids seems to have a fond memory of good old Jerry. Paul Dreher, director of the Civic Theater: “I'm a Democrat. I voted against him for the first eight years I was here. Then I said: ‘Hell, he's a great Representative for the district.’ And I started voting for him. I just wish he'd kept his mouth shut on some other things.” Which reminded Dreher: “Couple of years ago, a group here that was going to put on a Handel oratorio asked Ford to start each section with a five‐minute reading from the Bible. I coached him for a couple of hours on how the Bible should be read. Here he was, minority leader of the House, and yet he worked at it like it going to be his own funeral oration. He could have just got up there and faked it.” The Ford boys grew up when every American boy was guaranteed that he did well in sports, respected his elders and went to church, God and the alumni would take care of him. Dr. William Kooistra, fund‐raiser for the Democratic party and founder of Project Rehab for drug addicts: “Ford came by and visited one of our group therapies, flopped down on a pillow with some of our heroin users. If you had taken a poll beforehand, everyone there — they were blacks — would have been against him. You know how his record on civil rights would be received in the black community. But this group was impressed. They said this guy is O.K.” There's only one thing in Ford's career that puzzles Kooistra. Not long ago, he discovered, and hung up, an old 8 by 10 photograph Ford had given him when Kooistra was a kid of 12. The photograph was inscribed: “To Billy, with best wishes and good luck, Jerry.” The picture was of Ford in his Navy uniform. “Why,” asks Kooistra, “was Ford still handing out photos of himself in uniform three years after the war was over?” Dr. John Otterbacher, Democratic state representative from Grand Rapids: “I don't think people in this town knew what Jerry Ford voted for or against. The thing was, he helped his constituents. There isn't a person in this town who wasn't either personally helped by Ford or had a shirttail relative who was helped by Ford sometime during his Congressional career. The sonofabitch worked. He could have stood anywhere on any subject, just about, and the people here wouldn't have cared.” Editor LaBelle: “In a lot of ways, Jerry Ford, as Congressman, spoke for a conservatism that is present here, but it is not a conservatism that is pervasive. Jerry Ford spoke for himself. I understand he has been saying: ‘Don't look at my voting record. That was when I was representing the Fifth District. Now I'm representing 435 districts.’ Actually, he could have voted more pro gressively and got by with it in the Fifth District.” This is certainly true in regard to the war. Ford's hometown paper was one of only two major Michigan dailies opposing U.S. intervention in Vietnam as early as 1966. Gerald Elliott, then chief editorial writer at The Grand Rapids Press, says: “We represented the minority opinion in the community when we started out, but by at least 1969 or 1970 a majority of the community had joined us.” Ten years ago, when Ford's voting record was heavily right‐wing, the voters of his district went overwhelmingly against right‐winger Barry Goldwater and for Lyndon Johnson. In 1968, Ford's district gave Hubert Humphrey only 39 per cent of its vote—but that was as much as Humphrey received in the home district of House Speaker Carl Albert, a liberalto‐moder ate Democrat. Senator Philip Hart, who gets perfect or near‐perfect ratings from those standard liberal barometers, A.D.A. and COPE, has carried off strong pluralities in Ford's district in his last two elections. When Ford won office in 1948 by defeating Bartel Jonkman, a true‐blue hack and isolationist who made the mistake of opposing the United Nations and the Marshall Plan (which were put together partly through the good offices of Grand Rapids's native son and idol, Senator Arthur Vandenberg), he had the support and encouragement of not only most conservatives but of many New Deal‐type liberals, like Julius Amberg, special assistant to the Secretary of War in World War II and a Grand Rapids lawyer, Robert Kleiner, now Democratic district chairman, and Walter Reuther and Leonard Woodcock of the United Auto Workers who also supported Ford in his first campaign. “The first time Jerry made a speech in 1948, it was at the Fountain Street Church,” Kleiner remembers. “Internationalism was very much the key issue. My mother was very much involved in United Nations work. I remember she came out after hearing Jerry talk and she said to me and to Woodcock who was standing there with me: ‘You gentlemen will be sorry. This young man is ignorant.’ “That is the way Jerry turned out. He's not stupid, he's not dumb. He's ignorant. It's his illogical, excessive partisanship that sometimes makes him seem dumb. He has a lack of sensitivity. He would give a hungry child his lunch, but he can't understand that when he votbd against the hot‐lunch program he was taking lunches away from millions of children. Grand Rapids has progressed far faster than he has. The conservative Republican philosophy still dominates, but it has been forced to change by fiscal reality. Aid to Dependent Children and such things have forced the town to change.” Ford's roundabout attention to that Federal “fiscal reality” was one key to his popularity. He would vote against a school program, for example; and then, after it passed, he would scoop up a hefty share for Grand Rapids. Nancy Dempsey, a Democrat, an executive at a local television station and sister of William Seidman, one of Ford's economic advisers, says: “Jerry got lots of Head Start and Follow Through money for the schools. He got great grants for the local colleges. Wow! He made sure we got our share. When there was money going around in Washington, we got our share and more.” Ford voted against urbanrenewal money for the nation, but then helped swing millions of urban‐renewal dollars into Grand Rapids. The folks back home apparently didn't mind their Jerry's playing his ideological games, independent of his constituents' point of view, so long as he produced materially for them. There was a city referendum a few years ago on whether",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or not we should get out of Vietnam, and the referendum passed; Ford apparently gave it little heed, but the homefolks forgave him. In fact, the first real schism between Ford and the people of Grand Rapids didn't come until he took over as Vice President and went out defending Nixon against his critics. After Ford's first major speech as Vice President—in which he accused “powerful presure organizations” of using Watergate as a ruse t “crush the President and hi philosophy” and “dominat the nation”—his office received so many letters (mos of them bitterly opposing his sentiments) that for the first time in his career he an swered homefolks with a forr letter. “That was the first time h was really raked over th, coals,” Mrs. Dempsey re calls. “You should have sees the mail that came to the television station. I neve thought I'd see the day whet he'd be called a skunk.” Grand Rapids is caller “The Furniture City, just as San Antonic is called “The Alain( City, and New Jersey is called “The Garden State,” in memory of things past. The city's glories rose like the aurora borealis following its furniture‐exhibit successes at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition; orders poured in from all over the world. Some high‐quality furniture is still produced in Grand Rapids but compared to what it used to be, furniture is more a tradition than an industry. Much of the quantity production has moved to places like High Point, N. C., and Memphis, Tenn., where factory hands are cheaper. Furniture manufacturers had imported many of their craftsmen from the old country, making them promise that they would repay their masters by voting Republican and never joining a union. When auto manufacturers talked about moving into Grand Rapids with a plant, community leaders fought them off, fearing that the economy would be tainted by decent wages. It wasn't until 1936, when General Motors came in with a stamping plant, that this attitude began to be wiped out. Heavy unionism and higher wages did follow, and while this put a dent in the furniture industry, it created the kind of healthy labor pool that attracted other industries. It also created the base for what has been, for several years now, a real two‐party attitude in Grand Rapids. But still the notion that Grand Rapids is nothing but a furniture city persists. Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz made a speech not long ago in which he tried to make it sound as if Ford knew all about farm problems because he actually came from a town that was nothing but a small island of furniture factories in a vast sea of Michigan farmland. He said: “Take away a few furniture factories and strong wind could blow the rest of Grand Rapids into Canada”—or at least that's the quote that filtered back to the residents of Grand Rapids, and they considered it a pretty dumb remark. Hanging on just as stubbornly as the one‐industry image is the one‐party reputation. Grand Rapids is still thought of as “solid Republican” because the evolution into a two‐party city has occurred with so little rancor, and in such a clubby way, that the outside world hasn't noticed. Democratic district chairman Kleiner says he wasn't a partisan Democrat until the mid‐fifties, when Phil Hart, then Michigan's Lieutenant Governor, “persuaded me that's where I wanted to be.” A decade later, William Seidman, Kleiner's cousin, would be persuaded by George Romney to take on the Republican label and run for state auditor general. That's the way the power has often been divvied up in Grand Rapids, in a conversational “Ah, come on over and be one of us” way. No hard feelings. Before Democrat Richard F. VanderVeen decided to run for Ford's old seat this year, he made sure that Seidman wasn't going to run on the Republican ticket. VanderVeen likes Seidman a lot—“my favorite Republican” — and wouldn't have wanted to run against him. The growth of the Democratic party and of the progressive wing of the Republican party in Grand Rapids occurred so naturally that some sharp political technicians, including Ford himself, apparently didn't realize what was happening. Although VanderVeen's victory in the special election was an abnormality, to say the least —he was the first Democrat elected from that district since 1910—it was built on something much more solid than community‐wide disenchantment with, and sense of being betrayed by, the Nixon Administration. And it certainly was brought about by forces other than those blamed by Ford—“labor outsiders.” “I talked to Scammon [Richard Scammon, political analyst] before I took this job and asked if it was likely to be a short‐term job,” says Thomas Quimby, administrative asistant to VanderVeen. “He said the Fifth District is a swing district now and that this was obscured by Jerry Ford's incumbency.” (Quimby was one of Betty Ford's classmates at Grand Rapids's Central High School [Class of '36], in a well‐to‐do section of the city.) “VanderVeen,” Quimby notes, “is talking about campaign budget that would have once been inconceivable for a Democratic candidate—$100,000. Robert Pew, chairman of the board of Steelcase [the office‐furniture firm] is VanderVeen's main supporter. That will give you some idea of what's happening. “I understand that Ford got up before a group of Grand Rapids businessmen with VanderVeen's contribution list and shrieked: ‘You men don't know what you're doing. You don't know which side your bread is buttered on.” ‘[Ford] would give a hungry child his lunch, but he can't understand that when he voted against the hotlunch program he was taking lunches away from millions of children.’ Nowhere is the fascinating unpredictability of Grand Rapids better observed than in the Fountain Street Church. Its lineage is venerable. The first mission in Grand Rapids was Baptist and the Fountain Street Church was a direct descendant. It used to be affiliated with the Northern Baptists. But 10 years ago they kicked Fountain Street out of the fold. It suited the pastor, Dr. Duncan Littlefair, just fine. “The name Baptist was as emba'rrassing to us as we were embarrassing to them,” he says. “Now we are totally free.” He and his positions, including the promotion of abortion clinics, are “anathema,” he says, because “you wouldn't find the same kind of conservatism you find in Grand Rapids anywhere else outside the South.” Dr. Littlefair, who has Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago, does not follow what is generally thought of as normal Christianity and avoids using the term in church. Last year he wrote a book, “The Glory Within You,” which attempted to unhorse many of the accepted theological precepts. He got seven minutes on the Today Show to plug his book and the result was such an outpouring of anger from Christians across the country that N.B.C. officials quietly investigated to see if they had featured some kind of nut. Littlefair insists: My church would be considered different even in New York City.” Not long ago, Dr. Littlefair, in a sermon, declared that President Ford had done the right thing in pardoning Nixon and that “absolute justice” was the sort of distasteful thing that could be found only in a place such as Nazi Germany. The congregation gave him a standing ovation. Now there's a swollen rumor going around Grand Rapids that Littlefair was instrumental in convincing Ford to pardon Nixon. And yet, if the Fountain Street Church is so different, so radical and such an anathema, a visitor might wonder why its membership rolls include so many of Grand Rapids's leaders. Buchen is a member; in fact, he was chairman of the Fountain Street Church's board for a couple of years. He is also said to be the one chiefly responsible for encouraging Dr. Littlefair to write the scandalous book and, after its publication, became its biggest booster. If Ford's economic adviser Seidman goes to church anywhere when he is in Grand Rapids, he goes to Littlefair's church and he contributes to it, steadily. Top officials of both Democratic and Republican parties are members, so are labor executives and some of the most entrenched capitalists of Grand Rapids, as well as some editors and reporters of The Grand Rapids Press. Still, it is true that politicians who attend Fountain Street sustain a certain liability. Republican Congressional candidate Paul Goebel Jr., for example, has good reason to fear that his membership in the church may drive some conservative Calvinists into the arms of VanderVeen, a Presbyterian. How this kind of thing happens is beyond the probing of outsiders and remains, like the salmon run up the Grand River," something between the local residents and Heaven. ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wide Interest in Race For Grasso House Seat,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/wide-interest-in-race-for-grasso-house-seat-huge-lead.html,"BRISTOL, Conn, — In 1970, Thomas J. Meskill followed up two terms in Washington as the Representative of Connecticut's Sixth Congressional District with a victory as the state's first Republican Governor in 20 years. And Representative Ella T. Grasso, his Democratic successor in the district, seems about to use the same seat as a springboard to the Governorship this year. As a result, more attention than usual is being focused on the current race for Congress in this district in the northwestern corner of the state, an area with 500,000 inhabitants who vary widely from factory workers in cities like New Britain and Bristol to wealthy members of the New York intellectual set in the Litchfield Hills. Huge Lead And the race, although relatively quiet, is also attracting attention because of a successful “new politics” campaign that won the Democratic nomination for Toby Moffett, a 30‐year‐old former Ralph Nader associate. In a slick and polished effort aided by top national political consultants and pollsters, Mr. Moffett seems to have gained an insurmountable lead over his Republican opponent, Patsy J. Piscopo, the 47‐year‐old relatively unknown former deputy state bank commissioner. Mr. Moffett drew national attention in 1969 when he resigned as President Nixon's adviser on youth and student affairs in protest over the invasion of Cambodia and the subsequent Kent State shootings. Since then he has emerged as a popular and well‐known figure in the state, leading Mr. Nader's Connecticut Citizen Action Group in successful campaigns that fought utility rate increases, exposed the property‐tax benefits afforded one giant corporation, won enforcement of clean air and water regulations and discovered cheating in the testing of M‐16 rifles by the Colt Manufacturing Company.. In contrast, Mr. Piscopo was virtually unknown outside his home town of Thomaston when he was nominated by the Republicans; and his campaign has had to concentrate on increasing his recognition among the voters. Mr. Piscopo's major campaign success so far has been a radio commercial teaching voters how to spell his name. The commercial depicts the 49th contestant at a national spelling bee failing to spell Piscopo correctly, as had her predecessors. Then the announcer says “no matter how you spell it, Pat Piscopo will be your kind of Congressman. Pat Piscopo. P‐I‐S‐C‐O‐P‐O.” The tactic seems to have worked. His name was recognized immediately by most voters as he campaigned recently at a shopping center in suburban Avon, and many immediately began to recite out loud: “P‐I‐S‐C‐O‐P‐O” helped along, perhaps, by the candidates' large red name tag. The campaign has been relatively quiet so far, with Mr. Moffett and Mr. Piscopo debating on radio and television without real combat. Both candidates have been centering their campaigns on the “gut issues” of inflation, unemployment, housing and health care, with each predictably blaming the other's party for the nation's woes. The only real heat tin the contest so far came months ago, when Mr, Moffett upset a plan by Democratic leaders to name Stanley J. Pac, the Mayor of New Britain, as their candidate. Mr. Moffett, a dark and intense young man, recruited a cadre of campaign workers drawn to him by his work with the citizens' group and succeeded in getting them elected as local delegates to the district convention. To the surprise and shock of the party's leaders, he took the nomination away from Mr. Pac on the first ballot and then easily beat him in a primary. “I learned a lot from what other progressive candidates have done and how they bombed out,” Mr. Moffett said in explaining his primary victory. “People here are mostly concerned with the struggle for day‐to‐day survival, and if you start talking about abortion, amnesty and marijuana, they think you don't care about them.” Mr. Piscopo had no trouble getting his party's nomination, being assigned the spot on the ticket in preconvention dealings designed to minimize conflicts among the one‐third of the 250,000 voters who are Republicans and to avoid tarnishing the party's image among the one ‐ third who are independents. “We had all that worked out in advance so we wouldn't have to have a nasty primary,” Mr. Piscope said. While no one says so publicly any more, a major undercurrent in the campaign is the contrast between Mr. Piscopo, a veteran who spent 13 years as a local junior high school teacher and five more as head of the town government in Thomaston before becoming deputy state bank commissioner, and Mr. Moffett, a younger man who has risen rapidly by aggressively moving in and out of national political circles and who seems an outsider to some voters. “I think I represent the thinking of this district better,” Mr. Piscopo said, skirting politely around the issue. “I've lived here all my life. I've represented the people before as a town official, and I've served them and I know what they want.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A low‐level memoir of the Nixon White House,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/20/archives/a-lowlevel-memoir-of-the-nixon-white-house-a-place-peopled-by.html,"A few weeks after I joined Charles Colson's staff at the White House, right after my Yale graduation in 1971, Dwight Chapin called me up. He had heard about the memos I had written to President Nixon and Mr. Haldeman during my senior year at college and had been impressed by a piece of mine in The Wall Street Journal on campus unrest that Mr. Nixon had praised at a press conference; he wanted to get together with me. Several days later, I met. with Dwight in his office, a spotless, no‐papers‐on‐the‐desk, lime green Williamsburg room on the first floor of the White House West Wing. He struck me as polite, soft‐spoken, well‐meaning and not very broad‐gauged. He asked what issues I thought would be important in the 1972 election year. “Well,” I answered, “I've always thought that if we're really serious about the Middle‐American vote, we ought to be really pushing this consumer thing. You know, these businessmen don't mean a damn. They've got no vote and even if they did they'd have to be for us. Going after them on these consumer issues could really help us.” “By God,” Dwight responded, “that's absolutely right. Here's something I got in the mail the other day. [It was a tirade against Ralph Nader from a business group well to the right of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce.] I've been saying that for over a year now. People don't know where we stand on this Nader business. We need a stronger posture—be for it or against it, I don't care which, but one or the other....” Richard Whalen, who left Nixon after the Republican convention in 1968, once described being part of the Nixon White House as going to an eight‐year sales meeting. I don't know what it was like before I got there in the spring of 1971, but it certainly was as Whalen suggested after that. The Office of Management & Budget (O.M.B.), which is Civil Service except for the top level, ran the Government. Many or the rest of us spent the year‐and‐a‐half before election doing little that was remotely substantive. John Ehrlichman's shop was in many ways the most image‐oriented. Because Big John could gesticulate with his eyebrows, play up‐to‐the‐net tennis and think up great catch‐phrases (“This is a credit‐card Congress,” was my favorite), he was able to con the press into believing his Domestic Council was some kind of fulcrum for creative thinking. For the most part, it was not. Bud Krogh did accomplish a great deal in his areas of D.C. government, drugs and crime control, when he was not running the “plumbers” operation; many of Ehrlichman's people seemed to me to spend as much time on dreaming up new ways to spend the huge “administrative budget” he had somehow won for them as on anything else. Every time I talked to one of them, it seemed, they were asking whether I thought a royal‐blue or an emerald‐green carpet would look better on their office floor. Though himself a lawyer, Ehrlichman seemed to favor business‐school graduates and former advance‐men in hiring his staff. They, in turn, were biased toward technocratic management studies and reorganization plans in lieu of policy‐making. The substantive programs that received the Administration's strongest support — the SST, the Lockheed loan guarantee, the ABM — were invariably technological. The one major substantive program for which the Administration was able to work up enough enthusiasm to win legislative backing—revenue‐sharing—is really just another technocratic innovation, directed at changing by whom and not for what Federal money is spent. I worked on politics, P.R. and interest‐group liaison for Charles Colson until two months before the 1972 election, when I left to go to law school. For about half of this time, I shared an office suite with E. Howard Hunt Jr. Although he kept his door locked, and locked it behind him when he was in his office, I thought Howard was a nice enough, if somewhat foppish, sort, until one day when he told me about his great regret in life. When he was a C.I.A. agent presiding over the 1954 overthrow of President Arbenz of Guatemala, he had held a group of prisoners on the airstrip just as he was about to leave the country. He decided to show mercy and freed them. A few years later, he learned that one of the prisoners he had let go was Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary; he said that had been enough to convince him never to allow himself to become compassionate again. Aside from an occasional hello or good‐by, however, I didn't have much contact with Howard. One time he gave me a speech draft on the Diem overthrow in South Vietnam, which I reworked and successfully peddled to Senator Bob Dole; mostly, Howard worked in what I later learned was the “plumbers” headquarters in Room 16 of the Old Executive Office Building basement. I knew his duties included some investigative work in connection with the Pentagon Papers, but he was never present at any meetings I attended in Chuck's office, and I had no idea what he did specifically. I do owe him my one claim to having participated—however unwittingly—in the making of history: A few days after the Watergate burglary, I held open the door as aides of John Dean and Bob Haldeman wheeled Howard's notorious safe out of his office for reasons that only became clear to me later. Ilike Chuck Colson, so much so that I was very late in recognizing his responsibility for the collective squalor of Watergate. In contrast to his pubic image, he is a strangely vulnerable and, when he wants to be, even lovable rogue. When I first got to the White House, I took it upon myself, somewhat naively, to try to warm the place up, and was always trying to put together interstaff softball games and the like. In the same spirit, I held a large dinner party at the four‐story townhouse I shared with five housemates. Colson could not come, but apologized profusely and repeatedly; Haldeman's way of responding was to havé his secretary phone his regrets to Colson's secretary the day after the party held. Alone among the top‐level staff, Chuck ate in the staff mess rather than in his office, often with junior staff members and newsmen. Periodically, he and I would disturb the usual morose solitude of the room with raucous arguments about the President's latest maneuver, me accusing him of being a “fascist” and he, between outpourings into the phone receiver, which I became convinced was glued to his neck, retorting with uncontrolled gales of laughter. Chuck's strength and weakness is that he is something of an unguided missile. In the Nixon White House, where there was a tendency to devote too much time to reorganizational planning and public relations, Colson stood out as somebody who always kept in mind what was going on in East St. Louis, Boston's North End and St. Petersburg, Fla. He pushed hard, usually over Ehrlichmann's active or tacit opposition, for Presidential endorsements of such measures as aid to parochial schools, boosts in Social Security, pension‐protection and antibusing legislation which he thought would appeal to the “new majority” of Catholics, ethnics and blue‐collar workers. Unfortunately, he apparently pushed equally hard, and with greater success, for cops‐and‐robbers spy plans, organized character ‐ assassination, gimmicky P.R. stunts and a go‐for‐thejugular Presidential political strategy which, as much as anything else in the Nixon White House, made Watergate almost inevitable. Colson started out at the White House in November, 1969, with one secretary, as liaison to Washington‐based trade associations and specialinterest groups; he ended up with a staff of 30 as chief Administration strategist for the A.B.M., the 1971 postal strike and the creation of the U.S. Postal Service as an independent agency, the Haynsworth and Carswell Supreme Court nominations (both of which he had opposed internally), labor relations, the media and public television, and the 1970 and 1972 campaigns. His success in empire‐building was rooted in his ability to take over other people's responsibilities without lording it over them as he did so. (“Like a cobra,” one undeserving victim, Herb Klein, said after his media staff had been removed from his control via an “efficiency study” Chuck cooked up with Fred Malek, who was then White House personnel chief.” He never traveled with the President and rarely went to White House social functions. He was openly contemptuous of the way Ehrlichman exploited his position with his never‐ending round of Camp David tennis parties, Potomac yacht cruises and Presidential plane trips. Colson was a relentless practical joker. When James Doyle, then of The Washington Star‐News, wrote an unfavorable story about him, for example, he wrote a letter to Doyle threatening to “knock your goddamned block off” next time he saw him; Chuck didn't send the letter, but did send a copy to Ron Ziegler, who immediately ran over to beg Chuck to do anything necessary to the letter out of the mails. Colson used his studied grasp of the human ego to recruit people like TV newsman John Scali. Scali, who in those days was in charge of publicizing the Administration's foreign policy, was considered a pompous, posturing man by some of his White House colleagues. Chuck shares that impression of him, but also found him useful. “He's Italian, Doug, he's Italian,” Colson said gleefully when I protested Scali's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. “And besides, it's just a P.R. job and that's what he's good for.” He was always careful to feed Scali's gargantuan selfimage. “He's calling to have me congratulate him for the speech he gave yesterday,” Chuck told me one morning as he picked up his phone. “Yes, John, I'm glad you called. There was something the President asked me to tell you . . . Yes, I was talking to him right after he read the news summary . . . He thinks you were terrific, just terrific, John...” Ken Clawson, Nixon's last media heavy, is a formerly liberal Washington Post reporter whom Colson hired to run Herb Klein's communications shop because, Chuck told me, he knew Clawson was “an opportunist, a gunfor‐hire.” Mike Balzano, a onetime garbageman who worked his way to a Ph.D in political philosophy, was brought in to service ethnic groups and communities around the country. He spent virtually all his time traveling, to give speeches, hold press conferences and politick for Nixon; because Balzano was Italian too, and had won considerable publicity during his travels, Chuck talked Nixon into naming him head of the ACTION agency, which was probably not too hard since Balzano, each time he saw the President, told him, in a variation on Jack Valenti's comment to L.B.J., “I can't sleep nights until you are reelected.” Balzano was far from the only globe‐trotter in the Nixon White House. The Rev. John McLaughlin was hired as an aide by head speechwriter Ray Price over the strenuous objections of Chuck Colson and others. Within a few months, he had proved himself incompetent as a writer, at least according to his colleagues, and was disowned by the speechwriting department. Having literally no responsibilities at the White House, he took to the road full‐time. After an inspection tour of the Vietnam war zone, McLaughlin presaged his later comments on the Watergate tapes by declaring that American bombing was justified by Christian principles. According to members of the speechwriting staff, his travels were cut short, when, arriving by happenstance on the Asian subcontinent during the Bangladesh rebellion, he appointed himself, much to the dismay of the State Department authorities already on the scene, the President's personal emissary for refugee affairs. Staff members said he had been scheduled for departure from the White House when Watergate provided him with a new focus for his priestly ministrations. Whenever an O.M.B.‐interdepartmental task force came up with a piece of legislation, practically everybody on the staff got a chance to go on the road. New policy initia tives called for what was known around the White House as “laying on a donkey‐and‐pony show,” otherwise known as a “P.R. blitz” or a “media offensive.” The staff would divide itself up into teams of two or three and visit up to a total of 30 cities, sneaking before civic groups and appearing on the Iocal “talkies” (radio and TV talk shows). I hooked myself onto a few of these road shows, and they were great fun. You could be nothing at the White House but out in Seattle or Minneapolis or wherever, they didn't know one aide from another and actually believed the President was daily taking counsel with you. One reason a lot of low‐level people like myself enjoyed getting out was that being inside the White House was sometimes not so great. Past Presidents made do with three kinds of White House staffers: Special Assistants, Administrative Assistants and Staff Assistants. Under Nixon and Bob Haldeman, there were, when I was there, at least 12 different ranks, each with its own set of emoluments: Counselor to the President, Assistant to the President, Deputy Assistant to the President, Special Consultant to the President, Special Counsel to the President, Counsel to the President, Special Assistant to the President, Deputy Special Assistant to the President, Deputy Counsel to the President, Staff Assistant to the President, Staff Assistant, Staff Aide, plus auxiliary titles like Director of Communications, Deputy Director of Communications, Director of the Domestic Council, Deputy Director of the Domestic Council, etc. To the outsider, the distinctions between these titles were largely meaningless; to the insider, they were everything. Some people could park on West Executive Avenue between the White House and the Old Executive Office Building; others had to park on the Ellipse. Some could eat in the Executive White House mess; others could eat in the regular mess; still others could use only the Executive Office Building mess, and some only the cafeteria; and within each dining area there were different time periods for different classes. Trips on Air Force One, use of White House limousines, tickets to the President's boxes at the Kennedy Center, invitations to White House dinners or the entertainment afterward were all doled out ac cording to rank and privilege. Which really shouldn't matter, but did, because these measures of your importance determined, on the occasions you actually did something substantive, whether your phone call or memo would be answered. I mean, a guy with a Special Assistant's commission who was in the 1 P.M. shift at the Executive White House mess and went to a White House dinner twice a year wasn't very likely to answer a memo from a lowly Staff Assistant who ate in the E.O.B. mess and maybe got to go to an afternoon reception with the Girl Scouts once a year. Not that all of my memos, or anybody else's were that important anyway. For example, I used to get memos from Haldeman which read: “Oct. 15, 1971 /Time: 2:35 P.M. / MEMORANDUM FOR DOUGLAS HALLETT/FROM: H. R. HALDEMAN/By c.o.b. [close‐of‐business] Oct. 22, it has been requested that you send your thoughts on how Julie and Tricia can be more effectively utilized in indicating the President's concern for youth.” In response, I would sit down beside my Dictaphone and begin mouthing: “In response to your memorandum of Oct. 15, 1971, the following steps are recommended: (1) Bylined articles by both Tricia and Julie in magazines like Girl's Life and The American Homemaker; (2) A White House ‘rock party’ for Vietnam veterans; (3) A tour of vocational education schools; (4) Taking advantage of Julie's ability to speak Spanish by putting her before Spanish‐speaking youth audiences....” In most cases, the recommendations were interchangeable with the ones I had made the week before on using Mrs. Nixon to increase the President's identity with women, so it wasn't too difficult to get these memos in on time. And, besides, if I didn't, Larry Higby or Bruce Kehrli or one of Haldeman's other “beavers” would be in my office or on my phone screaming that “Mr. Haldeman” wanted my thoughts and he wanted them right now, and if I didn't get them in right now he would get somebody who could get them in right now. Two weeks after I came on board, at the height of the Daniel Ellsberg‐Pentagon Papers controversy, Chuck showed me a memo he had written to the President about “painting Ellsberg black” and tying him to the liberal Democrats in the Senate. (The memo, like most White House political memos, was addressed to Haldeman to preserve the President's deniability in case of any leaks; in turn, many Presidential memos were either signed by. Haldeman or unsigned altogether.) After I wrote a countermemo protesting both the ethics and the politics of Chuck's advice, he cut me off from most of what I guess was the underside of his duties. Once in a while, however, he did get me to do something which in retrospect I should not have done, and which keeps me from becoming too self ‐ righteous about what Jeb Magruder, Dwight Chapin and Bud Krogh did on a larger scale. For example, I unwittingly allowed Chuck to use me to spread dissension in the New Hampshire Democratic primary by baking to the McGovern campaign what appeared to me to be documents from files of the organizer of a Kennedy write‐in, which professed Kennedy financing for the effort. I later learned the papers had been drawn up by Colson himself. (It seems laughable now, but I believed Chuck when he told me the documents had been obtained with the organizer's consent.) On another occasion, I helped encourage the Commerce Department to release a study alleging grossly incompetent, unethical practices by an associate of Senator Muskie who was receiving Government economicdevelopment loans. Whenever the President made a television appearance, we called about 600 names from our in‐house “leader lists,” which were controlled by Colson and made up of prominent people who were invited to briefings, receptions and dinners or appointed to honorary commissions and boards. The rejects from this list, I have since learned, became eligible for the “enemies” lists, which John Dean drew up at Haldeman's request. The results of these calls, always highly supportive of the President because of the list's make‐up, were delivered by me to Nixon and Haldeman in the Oval Office. They would spend the rest of the evening reading the transcripts of the calls and complimenting each other on the “coup” and “triumph” they had just scored. After Nixon's speech in January, 1972, disclosing the secret Vietnam negotiations and calling for, in essence, a stand‐still cease‐fire, I decided to phone Yale President Kingman Brewster Jr., whom I had known as an undergraduate. The position Nixon had taken was exactly what Brewster himself had proposed in his last major Vietnam statement, and, half kiddingly, I got him to admit it. Proud of myself, I put down the phone and ran to Chuck's office, who then relayed the message to the President. The next morning, Colson told me that C.B.S. vice chairman Frank Stanton would give Brewster full‐scale Walter Cronkite coverage if he would repeat his sympathy with Nixon's course before the cameras. I called Brewster back, knowing he would refuse, which he did. The next day Chuck had another “great idea”: Why not write Brewster a letter bemoaning his unwillingness to say in public what he had said in private, and then leak it to The Times? I am ashamed to admit I too considered it a “great idea” for a couple of hours, before recognizing it as an unforgivable abuse of my relationship with Brewster. ‘I retain feelings of respect and affection for Colson even though I know he lied to me repeatedly during the last two years.’ Most of my time at the White House was spent helping Spanish ‐ speaking and youth groups in their problems with Federal agencies; writing “think” memos to the President complaining about the lack of a philosophic core to what we were doing and begging that more Pat Moynihan and less Spiro Agnew appear in our public posture; taking part in White House and campaign‐committee political and P.R. meetings, and preparing speeches and op‐ed articles for the Vice President, Cabinet officers and Congressional supporters of the Administration. I was viewed as more of a mascot than a fullfledged member of the staff, which had its advantages: Like Bob Finch, Bill Safire and a very few others on the staff, I was allowed to say pretty much what I thought. Chuck never censored me, even though I was usually critical of his advice. And Mr. Nixon kept requesting my thoughts, eben after I suggested in a memo which analyzed a David Broder article on the public's perception of him that he stop going around “as if you have a stick jammed up your—” The disadvantage of that role was that, also like Bob and Bill, I was usually excluded from the most important matters around the White House; I was definitely not on the up‐escalator within the Administration that carried Jeb Magruder, Gordon Strachan and others to such dizzying heights—and depths. My duties as a ghost ‐ writer of speeches and articles brought me into contact with Henry Kissinger's National Security Council staff, who provided welcome relief from the White House P.R. types. These contacts also gave me insight into the difficulties Kissinger faced with our end of the White House staff. Kissinger seemed to be insecure around the President, his staff members said, often compensating for this insecurity with elaborate, almost embarrassing, praise of all that Nixon said or did, delivered in tones heavy with historical weight. John Ehnlichman, always self‐confident beyond the point of cockiness, and, it was said, jealous of Kissinger's success, seemed to recognize Kissinger's weakness and exploit it. Like Colson, Ehrlichman was an inveterate prankster, and Kissinger was often the butt of his jokes. One Kissinger staff member tells the story of a meeting between the Secretary and Nixon in the President's section of Air Force One. A glass partition separates the President's office from the rest of the plane, and Nixon was sitting with his back to it as Kissinger faced him across a table. A curtain was drawn across the glass. Ehrlichman, in the rear compartment, taped up an overblown photo of actress Jill St. John facing through the glass and then sent a steward into the President's section to slowly open the curtain. Kissinger's face turned ashen, so the story goes, as the picture of his reputed “girl‐friend” revealed. And then there was the story of the great breakfast crisis. As I heard it, Kissinger was unable to get his usual breakfast from the mess one morning (orange juice, coffee, scrambled egg whites dyed yellow) and was in one of his not atypical foul moods. After much screaming and fussing, his secretary finally persuaded him to accept coffee and a hard roll. Ehrlichman, who had been in Kissinger's office, picked up the roll, examined it critically, and said: “Henry, you actually eat these things? I mean nobody, but nobody, around here can stomach them. . . .” The screaming resumed at full throttle, Kissinger demanding that the breakfast be removed from his sight and threatening the secretary with loss of her job. On a more serious level, Kissinger's staff sensed he was always afraid of being stripped of his power through the ignorance of the White House palace guard, which had no idea of what he was doing or why. Indeed, many staff members say the rise of Al Haig was due, in no small part, to his ability to explain to the President and others in the White House just what Kissinger was up to. Haig is not an impressively intellectual man. (Whenever he was going to speak at Blair House dinners—briefings held for leader lists at the President's guesthouse—our staff drew lots to see who would have to go; Haig delivered the same exact speech each time, as if it were memorized.) Even the President, who is supposed to have found it difficult at times to comprehend the subtlety and complexity of Kissinger's machinations, took to calling the plain‐spoken Haig before press conferences to explain “just one more time” (in the words of the Kissinger aide) how he should answer this or that question. His reward was to have Kissinger pace around him while he was talking on the phone with Nixon, whispering, in the account of his staff member: “Al, what are you telling him? What does he want to know?” Not having had much personal contact with the President, I had to rely on what people who did see him, particularly Chuck, would share. Most of us saw him rarely, and then usually on ceremonial occasions or to have a publicity photo taken “conferring” with him before we went out speaking. In contrast to aides like Colson, Ehrlichman and Kissinger, who, whatever else they were, had human qualities, Mr. Nixon had the same wooden, stiff image within the White House as he had without. Even so‐called working meetings with the President were highly formalized when more than two or three people were involved. At such meetings, his personal aide, Steve Bull, would enter the room—either the Cabinet or the Roosevelt Room—and announce as he opened the door, “Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States”; if it was just after some kind of announcement or decision, those in the room would stand and often even applaud as Mr. Nixon strode into the room. The substance of such meetings, especially large meetings, consisted of rambling monologues by Nixon; his two main topics were a glossy five‐minute tour of the globe and anecdotes from his political career. There was rarely any real exchange of views and even intimates like Colson seemed cowed in his presence. At one political meeting in the summer of 1972, the President wanted to know if his order that our staff coordinate with speechwriter Price's had been followed‐up. Colson assured him all was going well. I broke in to protest that Price's staff, most of whom seemed to me longer on intellectual pretensions than writing ability, thought they were “above” working with us and had flatly refused to do so: “Chuck and Ray may be coordinating,” I said, “but the people who do the work around here sure as hell aren't.” Colson put his head down and shook it from side‐to‐side; later he told me that it was out‐ofplace to tell the President that something he had ordered done had not been done. Nixon was capable of displaying human characteristics. Those closer to him than I say that on trips to Key Biscayne, and especially to his friend Robert Abplanalp's island in the Bahamas, he occasionally became quite convivial after a meal and a few drinks; one night at Key Biscayne an aide even saw him and Bebe Rebozo playing “king ‐ of ‐ the ‐ mountain” together on a rubber raft in his swimming pool. John Ehrlichman's son was the recipient of a warm letter of advice when he entered law school, and Nixon regularly called P.O.W. mothers, accident victims and other people he had read about in the papers. But the President rarely exhibited conviviality and human concern around the White House. I first met him at a White House reception; I had gone through the receiving line, but he did not recognize my name until later when Chuck reminded him that I was the kid from whom he had requested all those memos. Then, after sending a Secret Serviceman to fetch me from the shrimp bowl, he told me that in coming from Yale to the White House I was going from the ridiculous to the sublime. He laughed heartily at his own joke, though to this day I have not the slightest idea what he meant. Awkward remarks popped up constantly like his “This‐isa‐great‐day‐for‐France” comment at President Pompidou's funeral or his “Do‐you‐likeyour job?” question to a policeman who had suffered an accident during one of Nixon's Florida campaign tcurs and was awaiting an ambulance. Once, a woodcarver was ushered into the Oval Office to present the President with a chair he had fashioned from single piece of wood. When Nixon sat down in the chair, according to one of those present, it collapsed into pieces. Picking himself off the floor, the President asked, as if nothing had happened, “Well, how do you go about doing this kind of work?” Most memorable of all, at least to me, was shaking hands with Nixon. Each time I did, I had the eerie, even frightening feeling that nobody was there; face‐toface, hands clasped, yet no feeling, no feeling at all. There were compensating qualities. If he did not appear interested in the details of Kissinger's activities, nobody at the White House doubted that the broad outline of the essentially tactical Nixon‐Kissinger foreign policy was rooted in his own tactical instincts; he spoke privately of foreign policy with an assuredness, if not a compelling brilliance, usually lacking in his discussions of domestic choices faced by the country, and we were all aware of the several instances — the Haiphong mining, for example —when Nixon had tired of Kissinger's waffling and made a crucial decision on his own. His knowledge of American politics was incredibly detailed, and his judgments on people's motivations were faultless: “Yeah, sure Elliot Richardson is a liberal and an intellectual and all that, but he is also very, very ambitious,” 1 once head him remark. His language was as colorful as the transcripts of the Watergate tapes indicated, but his swearing, at least in my experience, was not directed vindictively against racial or ethnic groups. He did a great imitation of George Wallace: “We're goin' to have a bus'n' platform even of George won't be able to find fault with.” Working at the White House and seeing how programed the President's life was, I grew to suspect even these appearances of spontaneity. There were briefing papers for everything, elaborate question ‐ and ‐ answer books before each press conference, “talking papers” for every meeting, even “suggested conversations” giving him cues for telephone calls staff members were asked to recommend that the President make. After Ed Marinaro, then a Cornell running back, broke the N.C.A.A. rushing record, I sent in a “telephone‐request” form suggesting the President give him a call. That night, Nixon phoned me at my house to ask how to pronounce Marinaro's name. I was thrilled by the call, but, even as I hung up, wondered whether even that call to get information about another call had not been engineered by Colson to “stroke” me. Colson occasionally showed me memoranda the President had dictated to him; they were always highly political and often contained orders to “get” this opponent or that. On one occasion, Nixon wanted somebody brought in “full‐time” to “destroy” the press's image, as if people like Colson and Buchanan and Agnew were not doing enough of that already. Before Tricia's wedding to Eddie Cox, to which the groom had invited his former boss Ralph Nader, Nixon sent a memo around asking for suggested quips he could use in the receiving line. He sincerely believed that most liberals, particularly Kennedy Democrats, were self‐serving, even unpatriotic, and once asked me to prepare an essay for internal circulation depicting the Democrats as innately power ‐ seeking, duplicitous people compared with the essentially decent, privacyoriented Republicans. He viewed his own mission as making himself tough enough to master what he imagined liberal political tactics to be, so as to beat them at their own game and give other self‐made Middle Americans the chance at the helm they were too moral to struggle to win on their own. He saw established Eastern money interests as cowardly, allying themselves with the poor and the intellectuals to prevent the middle classes from winning positions of power in American life. He viewed the establishment's rhetorical backing of the peace movement, job quotas, ecology and poverty programs as cynical tricks, economically insignificant concessions made to bribe the intellectuals and the poor while insulting the values of the vigorous middle classes and restricting potential competition from them. Perhaps most of all, what I saw of his memos to Chuck indicated that Nixon wanted very, very much to be remembered as a President who had brought peace.

s rise in the White House hierarchy to eventual intimacy with Nixon began with his attempt to recruit Al Capp, the cartoonist, to run against Ted Kennedy on the Chappaquiddick issue in 1970. His success in emerging as the one and only close aide who had not known Nixon well before his White House days was rooted in the President's perception of him as somebody useful in handling the Kennedys. With an election‐eve mailing by 11 Massachusetts Democrats endorsing both John Kennedy and G.O.P. Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Chuck had helped re‐elect Saltonstall in the face of Nixon's overwhelming loss of Massachusetts in 1960; Chuck was always reminding me —and I presume the President as well—of that victory, and bragged that he was the only person in the White House shrewd enough to cope with Teddy. Almost up until the Democratic National Convention in 1972, Colson warned Nixon that Kennedy might become a candidate at any moment, and both men pressed me regularly for any gossip on Kennedy I could pick up. Chuck had liked and admired Ted Kennedy before joining the Nixon Administration. He still thinks highly of Kennedy's political dexterity and, even more important, of his macho, fun‐loving personal life. But under Nixon the social resentments he bore from his days as a scholarship student at the Brown‐Nichols School outside Boston took full flower; like Nixon, he seemed to derive an identity from them he could not find otherwise. He bragged about having turned down a full scholarship to Harvard to go to Brown, and wanted his son, a very bright young man who is now at Princeton, to go to a Southern school, preferably Duke, where Nixon had altended law school. He came back from sessions in the Oval Office talking about the need to “destroy” what Nixon viewed as a monolithic “Eastern establishment.” When he left the White House, he viewed the opening of his law firm and former Deputy Treasury Secretary Charts Walker's economic‐consulting firm, along with the planned transformation of the conservative American Enterprise Institute into a right‐wing Brookings Institution, as the beginnings of a movement to replace the spineless, degenerate Washington establishment. Largely because of Colson's prodding, Chuck claims, Nixon had become convinced by the time of the 1972 campaign that Roman Catholics represented “the real America.” He had taken positions on abortion, pornography and aid to parochial schools that suggested an identity with them, and Colson believes that the President even entertained the idea of converting to Roman Catholicism before the election. Chuck, however, told him it would be contrived and phony. As it was, Colson says, Nixon decided that he wanted Catholic in his Cabinet and appointed Claude Brinegar Secretary of Transportation primarily because he believed, mistakenly it turned out, that Brinegar was a Catholic. ‘Largely because of his prodding, Colson claims, Nixon became convinced that Roman Catholics represented “the real America.”’ Colson is very attentive to other people's feelings in his personal life. His wife, Patty, is an enormously warm and supportive individual with whom Chuck maintains a honeymoon relationship; they wait on and feed each other, embrace freely and affectionately, and share private sign language and jokes in a manner one rarely finds in a middle‐aged couple. At his best, these characteristics carry over into his professional life. At dinner one evening, Chuck's wife started criticizing John Dean. She had hardly begun when Colson pounded his water glass down on the table and shouted, “I won't have it. I won't have that in my house. If we do what we think is right, that's enough. He's doing what he thinks is right and if he's not he has to live with himself.” Chuck's “dirty tricks” reputation is highly over‐rated. I am quite sure that he did tell John Dean's sleuth, Jack Caulfield—as a joke—to firebomb the Brookings Institution; he fired me repeatedly during the 15 months I worked for him, lecturing me on how I had offended Haldeman or some Cabinet officer with such conviction that I actually believed he was serious. Many gutter tactics attributed to Colson, like the 1970 ad campaign identifying antiwar Democrats with radical violence, came from the President and Haldeman. The 1970 “smear” of Maryland Senator Joseph Tydings that Colson allegedly masterminded actually consisted of fulfilling Life reporter William Lambert's request that an A.I.D. official be asked to speak with him; Lambert, a highly respected investigative writer, dug up an influence‐peddling story involving an A.I.D. contract on his own, and it has never been refuted. On the other hand, in the summer of 1973, after I had left the White House, told Chuck that I thought he might well have considered forging a cable implicating the Kennedys in the assassination of President Diem of South Vietnam, had Howard Hunt draw up a phony cable and then reversed field by refusing to answer the calls of the reporter who had been shown the cable. He looked hurt—but did not deny it. While our shop did have the joking designation “department of dirty tricks,” I felt then that the “heavy stuff” (whatever it was) was in Haldeman's and Ehrlichman's domain, specifically under John Dean, and, because of that, within the bounds of law. Dean, after all, regularly sent around detailed memos on the improprieties of accepting even $5 Christmas gifts from lobbyists. I knew John had some kind of private in vestigative capacity. During the I.T.T:.‐ Kleindienst hearings, he had obtained the material to discredit the Dita Beard memo suggesting I.T.T. had agreed to a campaign payoff in return for which the Government would drop its antitrust suit against the company. Another time when I speculated on the personal finances of George McGovern, Chuck forwarded my inquiry to Dean. But Dean reputedly discouraged the more exotic ideas which floated around the White House, and I trusted him as the only senior staff member who always sought out the thoughts of juniors. I never heard the names Gordon Liddy, Tony Ulasewicz or Donald Segretti before Watergate broke, and I never had any indication from Chuck that he would sanction people like them. Like an Arthur Koestler figure, however, Colson was a man without ethical compass; there was an absence of fixed direction and conviction. He was proud of having worked his way up from practically nothing, and regarded himself as the living embodiment of the American dream. But in the White House he seemed to prove the political adage he rightly loathed most: that it is better to have people of old money and secure social position in high office who are not awed by power. When the President asked him to negotiate the deal under which John Connally became Secretary of the Treasury—and was guaranteed, in return, Chuck says, Nixon's support for a Connally Presidential candidacy in 1976 — Colson was so flattered and impressed by Connally's commanding presence that he became his chief booster, even though Connally's probusiness positions on tax reform, labor relations and other “new‐majority” issues were almost diametrically opposite Colson's. (“Standing on that airstrip of his, in that serape, he looked like some kind of god,” Chuck told me upon his return from one trip to Connally's Floresville, Tex., ranch.) From the winter of 1972 on, Chuck spent hours upon hours with the President; in the last six months of the year, he finally broke through Haldeman's gate and saw Mr. Nixon more than any other staff member. He would return from these sessions all fired‐up, demanding that I write a statement and “program” this or that Cabinet officer to blast McGovern, Muskie, Kennedy, or whomever. A few hours before Nixon announced the mining of Haiphong Harbor in the spring of 1972, Chuck delivered a 10‐minute harangue to his staff, ending with a demand that anyone who would not stand by “our leader” quit then and there. After the announcement, he called me down to his office and we had an excellent, even reflective discussion of the merits and demerits of Nixon's strategy in this war which Colson had opposed until he got to the White House. Colson's relationship with Elliot Richardson typified his multi‐edged personality. When both were working for Senator Saltonstall, they became so close that they considered starting a law firm together. And when Richardson was appointed Under Secretary of State at the start of the Nixon Administration, he tried to hire Chuck as Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations. Colson was hired as Special Counsel to the President instead. After he left the White House and became enmeshed in his legal difficulties, the loss of contact with Richardson was one of the few things he openly sulked about. (“Our wives still speak in the supermarket, so I guess that's something.”) Yet if Richardson was something of a big‐brother figure to whom he looked for approval, Colson could never bring himself to follow Richardson's lead and draw at least some lines about what he would and would not do for Richard Nixon. Bob Woodward, the Washington Post investigative reporter, observed to me at a dinner party during the height of the Ervin Committee hearings that he was surprised by the way everybody at the White House was taking sides with one or another principal aide, rallying to his defense and damning everyone else. It happened because there was no common body of consistent belief and principle which could bind us to something other than personalities, and not even personal loyalty to bind us to the President we scarcely ever saw. We were loyal only to “our guy,” the boss who pushed our careers, gave us “benes” like White House mess privileges, and defended our turf from the encroachment of other White House barons. Probably nobody at the White House thought of himself as subverting the legal process in the cover‐up. That is why many of the structural reforms now being bandied about for preventing its recurrence — appointing a permanent Special Prosecutor, measures to assure an independent Justice Department, reducing the size and power of the White House staff—seem so quixotic. Watergate was an almost organic outgrowth of a White House peopled by competitive political animals who were rewarded in direct proportion to their expressions of fear, suspicion and paranoia. And that is why I retain feelings of respect and affection for Chuck Colson, even though I know that he lied to me repeatedly during the last two years. He was human enough to let Watergate break him. Chuck shared his new‐found religious convictions with me when I returned to Washington after my first year at law school. I resented the “born ‐ anew,” “baby‐in‐Christ” language with which he and Senator Harold Hughes discussed them, because I felt it represented an implied comment on those of us who had found much to like and admire in Chuck long before his enlightenment. I was taken aback by the primitive, often foolish, form Chuck had adopted for his religious expression. But I soon came to accept it for what it was, the sincere expression of a strung‐out, unread, essentially unsophisticated man, who had nothing to replace the idols of success, money, power and Nixon which were crumbling all about him. I suggested that he read “The Confessions of St. Augustine,” and gave him Dietrich Bonhoeffer's “Letters from Prison” when he went to jail. Chuck's conversion, despite the understandable cynicism with which it has been greeted, did change him. He has lost his balance several times since he became serious about it, most notably when he accused the C.I.A. of engineering Watergate and the cover‐up in an effort to discredit Nixon. On the other hand, he has lost also a lot of the razor‐sharp resentment and unharnessed aggression which characterized many of his past dealings and periodically offended those of us who worked with him. Watergate also broke me. After I left Colson's staff in September,1972, to enter law school, we continued to talk and correspond regularly. I was outraged by the revelations of Woodward‐Bernstein in their second series on Watergate, just before the November election, and pleaded with Chuck to do something; the news of mass dismissals and the hard‐line attitudes emanating from the White House right after the election further convinced me that something was wrong. But when Watergate broke open in April,1973, I reacted out of personal loyalty to Chuck, my contempt for the selfrighteous piety of men like Lowell Weicker and Joseph Alsop and, not least, my fondness for a good dogfight. I soon became enmeshed in Colson's defense, offering him advice on which of my Harvard Law School professors he would do best with at the Special Prosecutor's Office, editing his planned Ervin Committee testimony, arguing his case before various investigative bodies and conferring with his attorneys, David Shapiro, his law partner, and James St. Clair, whom Colson later turned over to Nixon. Last year I became friends with former Special Prosecutor Cox when he returned from Washington to law school. He recognized me from my first‐year Constitutional Law class (spending most of my time watching the Ervin Committee hearings that spring, I was something less than a class luminary) and started sitting with me at the law‐school breakfast table. Only after about three weeks of talking Watergate virtually every day did it click with him that I was a former Colson staffer. Although I was somewhat nervous at how he would react, it turned out that we had more in common as Watergate aficionados than as partisan adversaries. Cox's tolerance of my advocacy of Chuck's case—in striking contrast to the White House's evident intolerance of him as Special Prosecutor —forced me to reconsider my own allegiances. By this time, the Watergate tapes had revealed that at the very least Chuck's awareness of the cover‐up had to be far greater than he had admitted to me. I was already convinced that whether or not Colson had foreknowledge of the Fielding break‐in (I think not), and whether or not he had the requisite criminal intent in the Watergate cover‐up (I think he did), he should bear some responsibility for what resulted. I do not believe the plea Chuck and Dave Shapiro negotiated with the Special Prosecutor's Office, a one‐count felony charge for conspiring to deprive Ellsberg of a fair trial by leaking defamatory material, really reflects what he, in fact, did intend in that endeavor, but I do believe the one‐to‐four‐year prison sentence he drew accurately measure his responsibility for the criminal environment he helped create within the White House. At its best, the intellectual challenge the Nixon Administration posed to established political dogma was easily the most comprehensive since Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal: a recognition in foreign., affairs that the post‐World War II “Pax Americana” was exhausted; a recognition in domestic policy that the Government could impose its moral conceptions and preferred living patterns on the people only at a moral cost; a recognition in politics that the will of the emergent middle classes could not continue to be disregarded. Given the overwhelming opposition to this challenge in the articulate sectors of the Congress, the press corps, the universities and even the business community, Nixon and his men were not totally wrong to have spent so much energy attempting to win him a massive re‐election victory and, thus, reshape the political character of the country before tackling extensive substantive implementation of their views. The best of men would have had trouble withstanding the hostility to which Nixon's Government was exposed as it sought to advance its ideas; something like Watergate might even have been inevitable in a country which has never had a lasting conservative tradition beyond economic selfinterest and fear of crime. But that we will never know, for the Nixon White House included few of the nation's best, and many there did not even try to endure in civility and decency. A country which for the first time in its history is being forced to acknowledge the outer reaches of its power over its economy, its environment and its fellow nations was ripe for a legitimate conservative movement. Rather than provide it, the Nixon Administration expended much of its energy on self‐defeating, vindictive political gamesmanship, at the last developing eavesdropping systems both inside and outside the White House that instead of exposing as never before, through the most advanced applications of American technology, the bankruptcy of the opposition and the brilliance of the President, ultimately revealed Nixon, Colson and the others for a fraud, and a shoddy," criminal fraud at that. ■"""
Funds Tight in Packwood‐Roberts ace in Oregon,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/21/archives/funds-tight-in-packwoodroberts-race-in-oregon-fundraising-problems.html,"SALEM, Ore.—A 51‐year‐old woman state legislator is seeking‐to upset Senator Robert W. Packwood here in a race that is drawing national attention as one of the better opportunities for a woman to win election to a high office this year. Betty Roberts, a three‐term Oregon State Representative and two‐term State Senator, was chosen by Democratic party officials in August to replace Wayne Morse after his death. The Democrats enjoy a 200,000 voter registration edge here. Since then, Mrs. Roberts has tried to reorganize a statewide campaign, a task, that, she frequently points out, her opponent had six years for. She is having some difficulty both with staff and money. Last spring Mrs. Roberts Tan second in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Supporters called her forceful; critics called her strident. But most politicians here were impressed with the quality of her campaign organization. By August, however, when Mrs. Roberts suddenly had a new office to run for, many of her earlier campaign stalwarts had other, commitments, either in politics or business. Fund‐Raising Problems Like candidates in other states, both Mrs. Roberts and Mr, Packwood say money is tighter this year. But as an incumbent Mr. Packwood says he has already raised $150,000, including $85,000 for news media advertising. As a challenger Mrs. Roberts now has about $50,000, she says. Mr. Packwood, who is also a former state legislator, expects to spend the $179,000 limit alflowed by state law. Mrs. Roberts is hoping for $100,000, of which about $70,000 will go into media advertising. Such promotion can go a long way in a state where one major television station reportedly offers a five‐minute spot for $150. Recently, Mrs. Roberts, who carries a pink biefcaser and the 42‐year‐old Senator, who favors suede jackets, began a series of debates, which observers generally considered ties. Mr. Packwood, who upset Mr. Morse by 3,445 votes in 1968, could draw on Washington experiences, votes and friends. For instance, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson made some appearances one day, being introduced as “a man of total integrity” and describing Mr. Packwood as “a pan of independent judgment” who defied President Nixon's Wishes on such votes as then nomination of Clement F. Haynsworth to the Supreme Court, the B‐1 bomber and the supersonic transport. Mrs. Roberts attacks Mr. Packwood and recalls her stands on past state issues, stands that earned her labor's support. Last weekend to help with fund‐raising the Roberts campaign threw In United States Representative Bella Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, for several appearances. But ruining in a state that has consistently elected a female Representative (Ediths Green) and had a female Senator (Maurine Neuberger‐1960, to 1967), Mrs. Roberts does not seem to have to convince many, voters that women are qualified) for political office in Washington. So far, no one single issue has dominated the campaign, in part at least because the moderate Republican and the moderate Democrat agree .on many matters, such as abortion (pro), military spending cuts (pro), tax loopholes (anti), amnesty (generally pro) pardon for Richard M. Nixon (anti), environmental improvement (pro) and inflation (anti). They do, however, disagree at times. Mrs. Roberts opposes capital punishment; Mr. Packwood used to but does not any more. And on the question of President Ford's proposed surtax the two disagreed—at least for a few hours. Mrs. Roberts opposed the proposal from the start. In appearance after appearance she drew prolonged applause as she called the surtax, “another despicable middleclass ripoff.” At the first debate Mr. Pack wood said he favored the plan. The next day, however, he witched his position and said, “Whatever I said that night I didn't mean it.” Mr. Packwood said he “misspoke” and that the same taxes could be gathered by ending the oil depletion allowance. But Mrs. Packwood seized on the change as “further proof” that the incumbent's views are based on “politics and not what is best for Oregon residents.” Polls by the candidates and newspapers indicate that Mr. Packwood leads Mrs. Roberts by 10 to 12 percentage points. Mrs. Roberts say's she is confident of victory and Mr. Pack wood admits to “a funny feeling in my stomach about this election.” “It's not beyond Betty's reach yet,” said one state official, “but her organization will have to get moving quickly. And at best it will be close.” In other races, two of Oregon's Congressional Representatives are retiring—Wendell Wyatt, a five‐term Republican, and Mrs. Green, a 10‐term Demcrat. Diarmuid O'Scannlain, 37, a state environmental official, seeks to keep Mr. Wyatt's First District seat in Republican hands, as it has been since 1892. His opponent is Les AuCoin, 31, a State Representative and Portland public relations man. In Mrs. Green's Third District, Robert Duncan, 53, a former Democratic Representative from another Oregon district, is facing John Piacentini, 44, a Republican and owner of a grocery store chain. The popular Governor, Tom McCall, a Republican, cannot serve a third term. So Victor Atiyeh, 51, a Republican leader and a rug store owner, is runping against Robert W. Straub, 54, a Demdcrat who has twice unsuccessfully sought the Governor's job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gadfly of French Cabinet Françoise Giroud,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/21/archives/gadfly-of-french-cabinet-has-a-tiny-staff.html,"PARIS, Oct. 20 —When the patrician Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was running for President last spring, during his “man‐of‐the‐people” period of playing the accordion and being photographed barechested in the locker room before a soccer game, a journalist named Françoise Giroud asked him on television what the price of a Paris subway ticket was. Woman in the News The embarrassed candidate didn't have the faintest idea, and he promptly abandoned that campaign approach for a loftier tone. Now the 58‐year‐old Mrs. Giroud, who voted and wrote against him is part of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's Cabinet as Secretary of State for the Condition of Women. It is believed to be the first post of its kind in the world. She has aroused great interest at home and abroad during three months in the post and is the only real star in the Cabinet. She is the second French Cabinet member to visit the United States—Foreign Minister Jean Sauvagnargues was the first—since the presidential elections. Mrs. Giroud arrived in the United States Friday and spent the weekend in Washington. Millions of Americans will see her on “Meet the Press,” “Sixty Minutes” and the “Today” show, among other forums, to judge for themselves why she has seized public attention. Mrs. Giroud held her first news conference earlier this month in Paris, announcing a series of Cabinet‐approved decrees to equalize the status of women in work, education and public life and under the law. Has a Tiny Staff She has a tiny staff and no budget of her own, and she must work for change through other ministries, such as Health, Labor and Justice. But she is not intimidated. “What I do is interesting but very difficult because the administrative bureaucracy is very heavy and hard to move,” she says. “Any one proposal needs the consultations of two or three other ministers at least. But I think that if one is obstinate, one can succeed.” She has been obstinate and has succeeded eventually in most of her life. A school dropout at 15, she knew famous men such as André Gide and André Malraux very early, worked as a script girl for Jean Renoir in the great film “The Grand Illusion,” was at one time at the edge of suicide, bore an illegitimate son, was imprisoned under the Nazis. Mrs. Giroud's son, XalainPierre, was born during World War II during the German occupation, when she could neither marry nor have an abortion. Her son died in a mountaineering accident in 1972. After the war, she married, had a daughter—Caroline Eliacheff, now Mrs. Jacques Nassif—and was divorced. Co‐Founder of L'Express As a journalist, Mrs. Giroud has shrewdly observed virtually every great personage of our time. She was cofounder of the popular weekly news magazine L'Express in 1953. All this is detailed in her autobiography, “I Give You My Word,” which is to be published in translation in the United States later this month. She planned her American visit partly to promote her book and also to show Americans a member of the new French Government. She is hardly a typical member of it. Mrs. Giroud publicly backed François Mitterrand, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's opponent and the candidate of the Socialist‐Communist alliance in the presidential elections. When Mr. Giscard d'Estaing narrowly won and fulfilled his campaign promise to create a secretariat for women, he asked Mrs. Giroud to take the post At first she refused because she felt Premier Jacques Chirac wanted to belittle the position. And besides, she wrote in L'Express in her account of the affair, she probably would be expected to install her office in the Cabinet kitchen, brewing coffee for the Premier's men. Persuaded to Accept President Giscard d'Estaing later persuaded her to accept the post on what were presumably her own terms. But Mrs. Giroud wrote in her farewell column in the magazine that it seemed absurd to treat women as “another category,” a kind of enclave within the nation. Even the idea of creating such a post would be shocking if it meant segregation, no matter how benevolent, she wrote. She described that kind of attitude as “let's be, good to the natives.” Mrs. Giroud hopes to change all that and to make women so much a part of political affairs that her ministry will simply disappear. In her book, speaking about women, she said: “It remains to be said that theories about women are one thing, while practice is quite another, especially when one is a woman. “I'll never send another woman to her death by urging her to live psychologically above her capacity, whether it be alone or divorced or having a child without being married, whether it means her feeling unhappy or guilty. Eroticism vs. Sexuality “You don't become Simone de Beauvoir‐Sartre because you, make up your mind to have an abortion and to live together without being married, any more than you become Brigitte Bardot because you use the same beauty cream she does.” Elsewhere in the book she said: “What's been happening today is not an explosion of eroticism; it's the presence, the omnipresence of sexuality. Eroticism—that is, what makes a man or a woman the noninterchangeable object of someone else's desire—has nothing to do with the mechanics of sexuality. “It would be funny, I think, if all of a sudden the primitive woman were to reemerge, the woman who had to be subjugated, muzzled, humiliated, imprisoned in one way or another so that men could have the strength to do something other than make what is called love and could concentrate on creating civilizations.” Most French commentators say that Mrs. Giroud has brought the women's rights movement from the fringes of public awareness to the center of attention, both because of the post she holds and her ability to explain and project the problems. Mrs. Giroud infuriates some people. On an 80‐minute show on Government‐run television she was made the butt of personal complaints from 17 women gathered there. She described the show on the air as “a second‐rate program.” ‘Wounded Self‐Pride’ The show's producer said later: “God knows she has charm, but this time it didn't work. As soon as she got put down, she had a typically aggressive feminine reaction of wounded self‐pride.” Recently, Mrs. Giroud assailed new French fashions as much too long and too full in a, world worried about scarcity. If made of wool, she said, they were likely to be imported and if synthetic they contributed to the energy crisis because they were derived from petroleum. The daily Quotidien de Paris shot back that Mrs. Giroud bought all her clothes at the top house of Yves SaintLaurent, where a little afternoon dress costs $1,000 to $1,700. These have been side skirmishes around her main battle, which is to upset points of view, be a gadfly, cross all ministries—“things that don't cost money but mean a lot,” she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Republicans Offer Little Opposition For Congressional Races in the Bronx,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/22/archives/republicans-offer-little-opposition-for-congressional-races-in-the.html,"Mario Biaggi borrowed hi greeting arm back from a thick et of voters' groping hands an draped it behind him on a gil sofa. With an exaggerated sigh of contentment, he summed up the election of 1974: “I'm afraid I'll still be a Con gressman next year.” If he had said “we,” Mr. Biaggi's understatement would equally have described his Bronx colleagues Herman Baditto and Jonathan B. Bingham For in the three Congressional districts—the 10th, the 21st and the 22d—that cover most of the borough, Democratic Re presentatives are assured of re election, against only token op position. “Will I campaign anyway?’ Mr. Biaggi said during a recent breather in his round of testimonial dinners and prayer breakfasts. “Of course. I'm always campaigning.” And Mr. Bingham, armed with printed shopping bags for his subway touring, said, “Can't let the voters think take them for granted.” Finally, Mr. Badillo: “I accept all the invitations I get.” Facing the Music For Robert S. Black, the only Republican running in any of the three districts, political reality is simpler. “I'm not campaigning,” said Mr. Black, a 44‐year‐old businessman who opposes Mr. Bingham in the 22d. “If I won, I would demand a recount.” The roots of that reality go back two years, to the redrawing of district lines by Republican legislators in Albany. Inevitably, they recognized, Democrats would dominate the borough. So the legislators were willing—according to liberal Democrats, whose charge was never denied—to make a deal with the county Democratic organization, cutting the cloth to fit a regular who faced a challenge from the party's liberal wing. What they tailored was the 10th District, a wedge of the East Bronx — plus some of North Queens, such as Astoria —heavy with Italian‐American voters in such neighborhoods as Throgs Neck, Morris Park and Belmont. The man it fits—still snugly—is Mr. Biaggi, a conservative Democrat who was a police officer for 23 years. Now seeking his fourth two‐year term, the 57‐year‐old Mr. Biaggi has Republican support, and his only certain opponent is a Liberal school principal, 50‐year‐old John P. Hagan. In the past Mr. Biaggi has run on the Conservative line as well, but in this year's primary, a 34‐year‐old challenger, Francis L. McHugh, captured the party's designation by seven votes. Charges of irregularities are now before the state courts, with Mr. Biaggi seeking a new ballot. While mapping Italian voters into Mr. Biaggi's district, the legislators were mapping Jewish voters out. They landed in the 12d, an F‐shape strip that runs up the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium to the southern edge of Riverdale, then eastward to Pelham Parkway and Co‐Op City. Two years ago, Mr. Bingham and James H. Scheuer—both Congressional liberals, and both magnets for the Jewish vote—had to battle for the district, to the delight of regulars. Mr. Scheuer became a former Congressman. And the 60‐year‐old Mr. Bingham—who entered Congress 10 years ago by unseating the county leader, Charles A. Buckley—now commands the Democratic and Liberal nominations. Besides Mr. Black, the fatalistic Republican, his only opponent is John DiGiovanni, a Conservative. In the South Bronx, largely black and Puerto Rican, Mr. Badillo, 45, is seeking a third term with Liberal as well as Democratic endorsement. The Republican spot on the 21st District voting machine is blank this year, and Mr. Badillo's lone opponent is Mary C. Lynch, a 34‐year‐old dental technician who is the county Conservative party secretary. Mr. Badillo has been working actively in Representative Hugh L. Carey's governorship campaign and Ramsey Clark's Senate campaign. In his own district—on Saturday, for example, at the Seabury Community Center on Southern Boulevard—he has called on President Ford to break with former President Richard M. Nixon and resume financing housing for the poor. His only campaign costs, Mr. Badillo said, are a few hundred dollars for extra travel to and from Washington. “I still have a deficit from my campaign for Mayor last year,” Mr. Badillo said. “This is a good year to run without a contest.” In fact, City Hall politics still seems to interest Mr. Badillo, who readily accuses Mayor Beame of “penalizing the poor” through budget cuts. Does Mr. Badillo foresee another Mayoral race? “I have time,” he said. “I'm still young.” For Mr. Bingham, “campaigning this year is kind of an investment in the future—my own future in the district.” Citing crime as the voters' No. 1 worry, Mr. Bingham stresses his sponsorship of a Federal study on violence in schools, and he argues for student identification cards in the high schools here. Mr. Bingham, a familiar figure in the district's synagogues, stresses his long‐standing support for Israel and the rights of Soviet Jews. “My most difficult issue may be abortion,” he said in an interview. Mr. Bingham supports the Supreme Court ruling that abortion is a matter of individual conscience. The stand is unpopular with Roman Catholics in the Irish neighborhoods of the West Bronx, south of Riverdale. Mr. Biaggi, with an eye on the Greek‐Americans in Astoria, takes a vigorous anti‐Turkish line on the Cyprus conflict. He also publicizes small, homey services to the community—finding a judge, for example, to marry a couple who had to move their ceremony because of illness in the family. Gives Voter a Pledge As Mr. Biaggi relaxed after the Columbus Day parade, a wizened Italian approached him in the East 69th Street town house of the sponsors, the Columbus Citizens Committee. Appealing to the “Onorabile” Congressman, the voter left with Mr. Biaggi's pledge to seek more bilingual clerks for the local unemployment ‐ insurance office. Rarely, Mr. Biaggi said, does a voter ask about one question that could be most embarrassing in a contested campaign. It is a paternity suit, pending in Bronx Family Court, filed against him by a worker in his mayoral campaign last year. Mr. Biaggi denies her claim. “I was nervous at first,” he said. “But when I arrived at banquet and they cheered me, turned and kissed a 65‐year‐old woman. And I said to the audience: ‘Catherine hugged me. You're all going to testify that that's all we did.’”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synod at Vatican Calls for Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/24/archives/synod-at-vatican-calls-for-human-rights.html,"ROME, Oct. 23—The Roman Catholic Synod of Bishops, still without agreement on the principal topic of its meeting, adopted a message to the world today that urges the right to life, to food, to social, economic, political and cultural Advancement and to religious liberty. The 200‐member synod, which also considered the first report from the Vatican's Study Commission on Women in Society and the Church, heard warnings that equality of the sexes was a Communist notion and titres told that the only perfect woman was the Virgin Mary. Though the commission, which is headed by an Italian Archbishop, is not empowered to deal with the thorny question of priesthood for women, it recommended study of “the constant and universal tradition excluding women from the ordained ministries.” The 1,200‐word message to the world on “human rights and reconciliation” was adopted without debate and with only three negative votes. Not a synod document, it emerged without advance notice as an action by Pope Paul VI “in union with the bishops assembled.” It seeks “to encourage those who work for human rights, to call upon those in authority to promote human rights and to give hope to those who suffer violations of their rights.” It attacks abortion, euthanasia, torture, war, the arms race, vast disparities of power and wealth, political oppression and racism. It calls for solidarity with the United Nations food conference next month. In it the church “offers pardon to all who have persecuted or defamed her and pledges openness and sympathetic understanding to all who question, challenge and confront her.” One who worked on the text — which went through seven drafts — said the word “pardon” was not used “in technical, canonical sense” and therefore did not revoke excommunications. The document originated in separate initiatives by John Cardinal Krol, Archbishop of Philadelphia, and Paulo Evaristo Cardinal Arns, Archbishop of São Paulo, Brazil. Cardinal Krol wanted a statement dealing with the food conference and Cardinal Arns wanted to stress socio‐economic liberation. In the often‐heated debate on the principal synod topic, “evangelization in the modern world,” the bishops sought agreement on a text to replace the one rejected yesterday as inadequate. By evening they had voted to prepare a message, to the world listing the main concerns that had emerged and had delegated to two working groups the drafting of texts for presentation tomorrow and vote Friday. Earlier the Most Rev. Jean Guy Rakotondtavahatra, Bishop of Ihosy, Madagascar, startled the assembly by declaring that it was a failure. “Let's admit it,” he urged, noting that there was an impasse between those who want to deal with problems and those who want to avoid them. The rejected document on evangelism was typical, he said, “of the mentality of avoiding problems”—it was a “cache‐misère,” that is, a cloak to hide shabbiness. Joseph Cardinal Malula, Archbishop of Kinshasa, Zaire, demanded to know the history bf the rejected document. Who prepared it? he asked. Was it true that there was a second document that had been suppressed? Let us see it, he insisted. On behalf of the synod's three presidents, one of them, Juan Cardinal Landázuri Ricketts, Archbishop of Lima, Peru, suggested that there was not enough time before the scheduled close on Saturday to prepare a new document. He proposed that the synod present the brief message to the world and leave elaboration of a text to the synod's seoretay or to the newly elected 12‐bishop council that functions between meetings. The Most Rev. Enrico Bartoletti, a titular Archbishop in Lucca, Italy, who is chairman of the 25‐member commission on women, gave the report on the 18‐month study. He was accompanied by two of the 15 women in his group, which meant that the number of women in the hall—the others are observers—rose from four to six. Archbishop Bartoletti, noting that “to deal with women separately leads to a dead end,” said, “We must study the human being, male and female.” It was the Most Rev. Maxim Hermaniuk, Ukrainian‐rite Metropolitan Archbishop of Winnipeg, who warned that equality of the sexes was a Communist notion. Karol Cardinal Wojtyla Archbishop of Cracow, Poland, echoed the view that the Virgin Mary was the only perfect woman. The Very Rev. Joseph Lecuyer of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit said the Commission for Women disturbed him. Why shouldn't there be a commission for men? he asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An eco ‐ freak for overnor?,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/an-ecofreak-for-governor.html,"DENVER, Colo.—Richard Lamm does not exude an iota of the cowboy image, a physical‐political quality which has tended to cling to the men who have been elected Governor of Colorado for almost a century. His voice snaps instead of drawls, and sometimes his fast‐moving tongue becomes tied up by his faster moving mind. Lamm's body is lean (he jogs) and his hair silver, but the almost cherubic contours of his face and his questioning eyes bear absolutely no resemblance to the weathered head and steely gaze of the Marlboro man. Yet Lamm, defying the traditional stereotype of the American politician and the conventional style of Colorado's political leaders, decisively won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in last month's primary election, and he has at least an even chance of defeating the incumbent Governor, Republican John D. Vanderhoof, next month. Vanderhoof, leathery‐faced and slow‐speaking, is a folksy politician who works in shirt‐sleeve casualness and who boasted about going fishing on the day of the primary election, in which he clobbered a millionaire who mounted one of the most expensive television campaigns in Colorado's political history. Out on the prairie farms of eastern Colorado and up on the mountain ranches of the state's western slope, “Johnny Van” is regarded as the kind of guy who can lean on a fence to talk wisely about the weather and sensibly about the economy. One Denver political sophisticate sums up Vanderhoof, a native of Rocky Ford who served 20 years in the state legislature, as a “shrewd rube.” The major force behind Richard Lamm's powerful challenge to John Vanderhoof is Lamm's identification in the state as a superenvironmentalist, or what his critics and some of his younger supporters call an “eco freak.” The 39‐year‐old attorney, law professor and state legislator, who didn't even move to Colorado until 1961, symbolizes a new movement in American politics, most evident in the West and most clearly discerned in Colorado. That movement, springing from an acute environmental crisis in Colorado, could most aptly be described as the “politics of survival.” In Colorado generally and through Lamm's campaign specifically, the movement represents several fundamental shifts away from traditional political habits and attitudes in the nation. They can be summed up this way: ■ Sheer survival—not just the old “quest for a better life”—is becoming the prime concern of more and more citizens. Inflation and recession are adding extra layers to the hard kernel of fear now felt by Coloradoans over threats to the fragile quality and supply of their biosphere. I think we may be doomed,” a Denver pharmacist says. “I'm old enough to remember the promise of a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage. Now I worry about lung cancer and whether or not we'll have water to cook the dinner.” ■ Growth is no longer central to the nation's political and economic gospel. “Bigger is not better,” Lamm says again and again to his receptive audiences. He argues to skeptical building‐and‐construction‐trades council leaders that he is not against “growth, per se,” but rather for “sensible and balanced growth.” (Despite some grumbling, the Colorado Building and Trades Council endorsed him for the Governorship.) In fact, Lamm's policies symbolize a radical shift of attiude in America away from a reverence for growth and expansion which has prevailed on this continent for two centuries. The spirit of George F. Babbitt is beleaguered throughout the nation, and that form business boosterism is likely to expire first in Colorado. ■ Some new political alignments are being created. Lamm is picking up scme support from rural independents and suburban Republicans who worry most deeply now about the dwindling supply of water and the spoiling of Colorado's beauties. Vanderhoof is gaining some support from construction workers, blacks and Chicanos who worry more about their immediate job prospects than about “some ecology problem 40 miles or 40 years away.” ■ A new type of states' rights attitude is dawning in Colorado. It is not related to civil rights or other Federal‐state struggles of the nineteen‐fifties and nineteen‐sixties, but rather to environmental issues and national needs for energy and other resources. A substantial portion of Colorado citi zens—and perhaps a majority of its voters—is feeling increased anger toward the political power of Washington and the corporate centers of New York and Los Angeles. Watergate has made it easier for politicians in Colorado and other areas to attack the abuses of centralized, national authority. In Montana last month, the young Governor, Tom Judge, sharply challenged the veracity of Exxon president Randall Meyer and the U.S. Department of Interior and their statements about plans for coal and oil development in his state, then added: “It is important that Western states work together in energy development; otherwise we'll get ripped off one at a time. We have to present a strong front to the Government and energy companies.” At the end of one long interview about Federal abuses of Colorado's environment, Lamm suddenly said, “I don't want to suggest that Colorado ought to secede from the union, but ...” After the dangling comment, Lamm explained his view that Colorado must begin to control its own future, rather than succumbing to Washington's plea that the state should be “a national sacrifice area” to provide for the nation's energy needs. Colorado audiences listen respectfully to the dire warnings of such outsiders as Ian McHarg, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania department of landscape architecture and a regional planner, who told a recent conference: “Colorado is about to be raped. Coming here to speak to you today is like coming to see some dying loved one just before he draws his last breath.” The West, McHarg said, is regarded by the rest of the nation as a “separate colony,” its resources coveted by Federal agencies, corporate giants and other “monolithic institutions hell bent on destroying you.” That's drastic luncheon rhetoric, but many Coloradoans do not think such frightening descriptions are exaggerated. The national abuses of Colorado seem all the more cruel and ugly because of the extraordinary beauty of the place. This state —highest in the nation in average altitude—encloses the scenes which inspired Katherine Anne Bates to compose “America, the Beautiful” 80 years ago and moved John Denver to strum “Rocky. Mountain High” just last year. Yet Colorado is becoming both a guinea pig and a sewer for the nation's technology. In the midst of an election campaign, Lamm is reluctant to appear a “doomsayer,” and he strives to avoid dwelling on what he calls “a chronicle of horrors.” But his voice crackles with indignation when he refers to some of the potentially disastrous Federal activities in Colorado. At the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, just a half hour drive northeast of Denver, the Army stores thousands of nerve‐gas arms. One Colorado scientist, Dr. Peter Metzger, estimated in 1970 that “3 per cent of what the Army has out there, administered effectively, could eliminate the entire population of the world.” Nerve‐gas bombs are still stored there, above ground—immediately north of one of the main runways of Denver's Stapleton International Airport and almost directly under the take‐off path of commercial jets. Less than 15 miles north of Denver, the Dow Chemical Company operates the Rocky Flats Nuclear Assembly Plant for the Atomic Energy Commission. The plant produces triggering devices for nuclear bombs. On May 11, 1969, the plant's supply cf plutonium spontaneously ignited. The $50‐million loss of plutonium (enough to build more than 70 Nagasaki‐size atomic bombs) and other equipment qualified for disaster as the most expensive industrial fire in the nation's history. The A.E.C. denied that the fire released any plutonium oxide into the air. But Dr. Edward Martell, a nuclear chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, tested nearby soil samples and concluded that there was signicant plutonium fallout contamination in the area near the fire. Nobody knows for certain what the long‐range health risks might be. There have been scores of other fires at the plant. Near the old mining town of Rulison in western Colorado and only seven miles from the Colorado River, the Atomic Energy Commission and private corporations conducted two separate tests with underground nuclear explosions. One of the tests exploded three nuclear devices at different underground levels. The purpose was to bust the ground loose for profitable mining of natural gas. The A.E.C. and the private firms have plans for thousands of more underground nuclear explosions, to be conducted if the results prove commercially feasible. In Grand Junction, the Atomic Commission for many years offered free uranium mine tailings to local contractors. Mixed with cement, the sandy material was used to build the foundations of more than 3,000 homes, plus school buildings and commercial structures. A few years ago, one report concluded that the homes and other buildings were radioactive. They are still standing, with “hot” basements, though the Colorado Health Department did succeed in halting the A.E.C's charity to the contractors. There are innumerable other examples of environmentthreatening practices that infuriate growing numbers of Colorado citizens: the Army pumping experimental, poison liquids into the soil northeast of Denver, later destroying the sugar beet crops of farmers; weather modification experiments, including cloud seeding, conducted in San Juan Mountains near Durango, in southwestern Colorado; deliberate setting off of simulated earthquakes for seismographic studies near the Rangely Oilfields in Rio Blanco County in northwestern Colorado. Lamm and his followers are even more concerned about the environment threats from two other seemingly inexorable forces. The first is the sudden, recent acceleration of the nation's demands for domestic energy sources. In the pure volume of those sources in the state and the potential dollar value they represent, Colorado must be labeled as the richest —and the most threatened—state in the nation. The conservative estimates are awesome: Colorado contains more than $70‐billion tons of coal, 100 trillion cubic feet of nat ural gas, and between 1.25 trillion and 3 trillion barrels of shale oil. Coal is already being produced by strip‐mining, which could leave some of the countryside as devastated as in the ruined portions of Appalachia. The production of the vitally needed natural gas could keep millions of homes throughout America heated, but it might also involve thousands of underground nuclear explosions that could keep the subsurface of western Colorado churning like a gigantic waterbed. The oil shale development—which has the potential of producing three times the oil of the known reserves in the entire Middle East — could fill many western Colorado canyons with dead mine tailings, drive the nation's largest herd of migrant deer to extinction, exhaust an already sparse supply of water and create what Lamm calls a “string of aluminum ghettos of mobile homes and a boom‐and‐bust economy.” The second major environmental threat to Colorado is tougher for Lamm to contend with, politically, and at least as potentially devastating to its beauty and good life. The threat is growth of population. In the past decade, Colorado's population has been increasing three times faster than the national rate. It is now edging toward 2.5 million people, up 25 per cent from 1960. Some state planners and demographic experts predict the state will grow to 14 million or more in the next several decades. People are pour;ng in for a variety of reasons: individual families fed up with the visible filth of other cities are attracted by the enduring reputation of Colorado and Denver as a pristine place with pure air, great fishing and good skiing. Hundreds of corporations, heeding the complaints of their executives over living conditions and pollution and high tax rates, have moved their headquarters to Denver and other cities on the north‐south spine of the state called the “front range.” The biggest employer of all—the Federal Government—has moved many of its regional offices here. As the people have moved into Colorado, many have been gradually disillusioned about its quality of life and many have anxiously concluded that maybe — in their need for water, land and cars—“the enemy is us.” Nearly 3,000 miles of Colorado's trout streams—almost a third of the state's total—are dead now, dry or unable to sustain fish. The air above Denver is filthy. New Yorkers long ago gave up the hope of breathing deeply without airconditioning or seeking visual horizons, and the people of Los Angeles are numbed after a quarter of a century of smog. The air pollution around Denver is both new—and thus shocking to those who remember its clarity just 10 years ago—and dangerous. It's not unusual for the magnificent view of the Rockies, just west of the city, to be obliterated by yellow haze. Denver and its suburbs have the highest carbon monoxide pollution level of any city in the United States. In the mile high location of Colorado, none of the emission control devices developed in Los Angeles, Detroit or the East Coast mean a damn. The internal combustion engine produces 60 per cent more carbon monoxide and 30 per cent more hydrocarbons than at sea level. Esthetically, Denver is a mess. Some of the marvelously natural red sandstone churches, office buildings, hotels and railroad sta tions survive, but the skyline of dark glassed, steel high‐rise buildings obscure them now from almost any view. While I was in Denver to research this story, I drove each day from the motel to the downtown Capitol area over the Speer Avenue Freeway, a major entry into central Denver. The sights over those few miles were typical of scores of cities around the nation: an interchange over an interstate highway (I‐25), a dying river, a rusty railroad right of way, a stack of junked automobiles soaring above the freeway and four huge billboards advertising two brands of whiskey, a beer and a bank. The national McDonald's hamburger culture has conquered Denver; 24 of those goldarched, gathering ‐ eating places are spotted throughout the city. A few years ago in the famous ski town of Aspen, the Mayor chaired a meeting of Aspen's leaders and permanent citizens to confer with the eager advanceman for the Safeway supermarket chain. He announced grandly that the corporation had decided that Aspen was ripe for one of its standard 28,000‐squarefoot stores with a parking area three times that size. Mayor Eve Homeyer listened politely, then told him in brittle voice: “Sir, you see in this room individuals of every persuasion — far right reactionaries and extreme leftists and everything between. There is only one thing which unites us: you are our enemy.” The Safeway advanceman's face turned white, and he fled town. In Louisville, north of Den ver and near the university town of Boulder, a land developer won approval from the town council for a new residential housing tract. But within a few weeks a majority of the town's citizens fought back with a protest petition. The council stood firm, but the developer disappeared. A year and a half ago, the old residents and the new people of Colorado Springs—near the Air Force Academy and for a long while the fastest growing city of the United States—transformed the balance of power of its elected council. A majority had been strongly and boosterishly in favor of annexation, expansion and growth, spreading the city limits far east to the prairie flatlands, west to the foothills of the Rockies and even around the famous Garden of the Gods. One of the new members, Luis Cortez, a counselor at a community college in Colorado Springs, says, “There's no question in my mind that growth was the real issue.” He and the two other newly elected members, both professors at Colorado College, adopted what they call “sensible growth” by five‐to‐four vote, defeating the old gung‐ho growth forces. The new council did approve one well landscaped shopping center, but, more important, it imposed a year‐long moratorium on new construction of homes in the city, because of an acute shortage of natural gas and the continuing worry about water shortages. The antigrowth attitude goes beyond the small hamlets and medium‐sized cities of Colorado. The year 1972 was a political watershed: In the spring of that year Denver voters rejected a bond issue for construction of downtown parking facilities; in the summer, they said no to a waterboard plan to tunnel in more Western water for future, growth‐assumed needs; in November, the state's citizens shocked the Denver Establishment, the international press and the sports jet set by rejecting the long‐planned loca tion of the 1976 Winter Olympics by a vote of 537,440 to 358,906. Denver's Mayor and other boosters were humiliated by the Olympics vote, and the site was changed to Innsbruck, Austria. Richard Lamm—who had fought since 1969 against an old “sellColorado” attitude and was one of the key leaders in the anti‐Olympics campaign—began to run seriously for Governor. No one could assume that the Republican incumbent “Johnny Van” — would be a pushover. John D. Vanderhoof, 52, served in the state House of Representatives, for 20 years, six as Speaker, was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1970 and succeeded to the Governorship in 1973 when John Love resigned to become (briefly, it turned out) the Nixon Administration's energy chief. Vanderhoof's syntax is folksy, and his governmental and economic philosophy is fundamentally conservative, but he is credited (even by Lamm) with a canny intelligence and he is not at all reactionary on environmental issues. He speaks often and eloquently about “a new ethic of conservation” for Colorado, and he appointed one of the state's most able legislators and environmental experts—former State Senator John Bermi;,gharr—as his chief environmental advisor. The Governor is simply not as fervid as Lamm in statements on the environment, and he is far less inclined than his young challenger to inject state authority into any program to protect Colorado's resources and beauties. Despite the rejection of the Winter Olympics and the growing legions of ardent environmentalists in the state, there are still powerful economic interests and many citizens who share Vanderhoof's attitude. His supporters are not confined to big‐business interests in Denver or Western‐slope ranchers who want the Government to stay off their backs. An auto dealer in Colorado Springs says, “I don't like this talk about how the state government should maybe slow down growth and expansion. My sales picture has already gone to hell.” A municipal garbage truck driver in Denver said as he prepared for work one recent dawn, “Environment? That's a big damn word. All I know is that the Governor seems like a good guy, so I may vote for him, if I vote.” The foreman of the garbage truck drivers in Denver's northeast yard, Otis Dicker son, was more expansive: “Yes, the environment is important. But most of my friends here on the job think that this issue will pass. Nothing much can be done about it. The whole growth thing will take care of itself. Most of us think we shouldn't tamper with it, and it ought to run its course. We just want to do our jobs and keep our jobs. Lamm has been confronted with two pesky criticisms. The first is that he is a “one ‐ issue candidate.” He scoffs at the charge. Much of his effort has gone into fights” for tough land‐use legislation and against additional transmountain water ‐ diversion projects, but Lamm argues that his work and achievements during eight years in the state House have been diverse. His legislative activities in some sessions were almost ubiquitous and he pioneered new laws for nofault auto insurance and therapeutic abortions. Politically, he now worries more about his 1967 law permitting abortions than about charges that he is a “one‐issue candidate” on environment. “There are a lot of people in the state who are still furious about that abortion law,” Lamm says. “They don't want to see the Adolf Eichmann of Colorado (me) become Governnor.” Lamm also suffers from the criticism directed against many prominent environmentalists—that he is an “élitist.” The assumption of critics is that most enviromentalists are wealthy, white, young individuals who are willing to sacrifice economic opportunities for the mass of citizens just to protect a few beautiful spots for expensively equipped backpack trips and prolonged ski vacations. The “élitist” charge doesn't significantly concern Lamm, for two reasons. “I'm not the stereotypical environmentalist,” he says with a chuckle. “Oh, I love the outdoors, but I can't tell one tree from another and I literally couldn't identify one species of bird from another.” Also, Lamm realizes that the environmental movement in Colorado—in contrast to some other areas of the nation—is a sophisticated coalition of people which cares deeply about much more than the preservation of the esthetic beauties of the Rocky Mountains. “I want my children (they are 6 and 3) to survice,” he says passionately. His wife, Dottie, expresses confidence that most Coloradoans realize that environment is as much an economic issue—“affecting everyone”—as anything else.” Lamm is not relying exclusively on environmental issues. Inflation, he knows, is a prime issue in Colorado as elsewhere, and he is convinced that the voters after Watergate value “honesty . . . integrity ... candor” above all else in the candidates they chose. Lamm has thus endeavored to establish himself as the leading “campaign reform” candidate. He boasts about the two‐and‐a‐half pound report he made public on his personal finances and campaign contributions. He has adopted the new political art form of reform candidates, first tried successfully by Senatorial candidate Lawton Chiles in Florida in 1970, of walking the length of the state. He showers his audiences with candid — often self‐deprecating — remarks. “That was a lousy answer,” headmitted to a group in a Denver synagogue after a rambling response to a precise question. “Sure, my campaign walk is a gimmick to get free publicity,” he says often and openly. “It's a gimmick to avoid having to spend $1,200 a minute for campaign commercials on Denver television.” Before. the primary election, the Colorado press discovered that Lamm had failed to include ownership of a small amount of mining‐company stocks in his two‐and‐a‐half pound financial disclosure statement, he didn't try to weasel out of the blunder. “We were stupid not to include that,” he told reporters. “This is devastating.” But the mining‐stock disclosure did not devastate the Lamm campaign. Less than a week later, he defeated an able and respected opponent, State Representative Thomas Farley, by 58 per cent. Apparently, Colorado voters — like most citizens nationally who are more indignant about the Watergate coverup than the Watergate burglary — were willing to forgive Lamm because he “fessed up.” Vanderhoof appears to be equally adept at the new politics‐ofcandor. One of his own staff assistants believes that the Republican Governor's greatest political strength is the ease with which he can say, after well publicized mis take, “Garsh, folks, I'm sorry I goofed.” Candor is also big in other election races in Colorado this year, though the other major campaigns are more bland. Gary Hart, who was campaign manager for George McGovern in 1972, is the Democratic nominee opposing incumbent U.S. Senator Peter Dominick. “Sure, we made some whopping mistakes in 1972,” Hart says, “but at least none of us wound up in jail.” But Hart's campaign slogan is a prosaic “Now It's Our Turn,” and Dominick—stressing the value of his seniority in the Senate —headlines his campaign advertisements with a slogan “Pete: For Colorado's Sake.” Hart emphasized inflation and other economic issues before the primary. But a few days afterward he was impressed by the results of a private poll revealing inflation as the major national problem identified by Colorado voters, but environmental issues as far exceeding all others as the major state problem. In the final weeks of the campaign, Hart has boosted environmental issues to equal standing with economic issues in his speeches. On the surface, Lamm and Vanderhoof seem to agree on most environmental issues. But beneath it, their policies, attitudes and emotional approaches do differ deeply. Vanderhoof, in the old frontier spirit, tends toward the notion that the best government is the least government. It is obvious that on such issues as land use legislation, he values “local control” — county boards, city councils and ranchers — well above the “ivory‐tower people” in state government. In another remarkable display of Colorado political candor, Vanderhoof's own chief environmental adviser, John Bermingham, ridicules the land use law which Vanderhoof pushed through the legislature this year. “You don't want a copy of that,” Bermingham told me. “It's a horrible bill.” Vanderhoof, despite his general statements against the traditional “sell Colorado” policy, often sounds a bit pleased about the importance and attention accruing to Colorado because of national demands for its energy resources. With a nuance of pride in his voice, the Governor spoke a few weeks ago to the annual convention of the Central‐Southeast Colorado Counties organization, about the future. Denver, he said, is going to become the “energy capital of the world”; all other areas of the state will be affected and “you had better doggone well get ready.” The nation suffers a severe shortage of fuel, the Governor told the local officials, and the “massive, untapped resources happen to lie, whether we like it or not, in the Rocky Mountain West.” With respectful awe for the prospect, Vanderhoof said that with oil shale extraction “we will be processing material equivalent to the Panama Canal every week.” Predicting the peak of potential coal mining in Colorado, the Governor said that “the amount of material to be worked will be like the Panama Canal every day.” “Like it or not,” he said in conclusion, “it's coming.” Richard Lamm doesn't like it. But in his need and keen ambition to win the election, Lamm is also saying in the waning days of his year long campaign that Colorado and Denver ought not to impose their authorities over local decisions about land use and oil shale by county officials, municipal councils and ranchers. Lamm is not a kamikaze liberal. As a crusading environmentalist and Democrat, as a “pragmatic idealist” (his words) in the John F. Kennedy tradition, he is profoundly and politically aware that Colorado's voters are neither pedantic nor partisan on the issues of survival. After 12 years of Republican rule in the state and a longer history of conservatism of attitude toward the role of state government, Lamm knows he must entice new support. Neither the Republican nor Democratic party claims a majority of Colorado voters. Recent figures released by the office of the Colorado Secretary of State show the following voter registration: Unaffiliated, 415,540; Democratic, 398,572; Republican, 320,214. For many decades, conservative Democrats and Independents have most often voted Republican. But Lamm and his supporters believe that a new coalition is forming the traditional Democratics being joined by thousands of new voters who are among the “sophisticated environmentalists,” people who are into the politics of survival. Lamm appeals to them (“They provide the shock troops of my campaign,” he says) because he is tougher, more passionate and more specific about what he will do to protect Colorado's environment than Vanderhoof. His rapid‐fire speeches besiege his audiences with statistics, legal technicalities, missionary exhortations and quotations ranging from Al Smith (“A politician can't get so far ahead of the band that he can't hear the music”) to a favorite Presbyterian hymn (“New occasions teach new duties/Time makes ancient good uncouth”). He emphasizes that he makes no assumptions of doom, and he insists that he isn't urgently calling for immediate austerity to save the environment. “I'm simply preaching a sense of reality,” Lamm says. “This state is semiarid. Colorado just does not have enough water to support ten million people.... I want to help prevent Colorado from becoming a colony of the United States, an energy colony. In my opinion, that's the way we're now headed. Whether it's Colorado or the Congo, colonies have certain things in common. The first is that outside people come in to exploit the place not for the benefit of local people, but for the benefit of others. Colorado has only five Congressmen in Washington. There are some 40 Congressmen from California alone. You know, there are 212,000 swimming pools in Los Angeles, and they are full of Colorado water right now.... I recognize that that's political rhetoric, but the point is that Colorado's people have to make sure that we set the conditions for the production and development of our resources.... “One of the most complex and controversial subjects in politics in the next 15 years will be the role of the state in the Federal Government, and what is the duty of the state to the nation. I very much believe in interdependence. Colorado is in the United States. We do have a duty. We will have to make sacrifices; we do want to put our shoulder to the national wheel. But, look, we're not going to sit back and be West Virginianized by the Federal Government.... We do not want to create an isolationism here, but rather an adversary system. I'm going to say to the Federal Government: If you want to do this or that, number one you've got to pay for it, and number two you've got to make sure that Colorado isn't ruined in the process.” Lamm is as harsh in his view toward the risks of technology as toward the unchallenged power of the Federal Government: “We've got to consider not only the odds of risk in some of these technological developments, but also the stakes. I was the chief trial counsel in our case against one of the underground nuclear explosions near Rulison. The Atomic Energy Commission came in and said that there was only a small likelihood that [radioactive materials] might get into the Colorado River system. But, my God, consider the stakes! Nerve gas stored at the end of the Denver airport runway doesn't make sense to me, not because I don't think they're trying to make every precaution to keep it safe, but because of the stakes involved. In the 20th century, we need new mechanisms to control and monitor techonology.... “Some of the construction workers think that I'm against growth. I'm not against growth. But I am against the kind of growth which is ruining the environment of the Denver area, while half the counties of Colorado are losing population and our rural communities are in decay. I'm trying to bring some new thoughts into the political arena. If I could inscribe anything over the state Capitol, as a word of wisdom to the legislators and other leaders, it would be this phrase: ‘Beware of Policies Appropriate to the Past but Disastrous to the Future’.” Those are tough thoughts, and Lamm expresses them to interviewers and audiences with uncommon intensity. His passion seems to defy the traditionally relaxed mood of Colorado's constituency and to shatter the conventional, slow‐drawling cowboy image of many of Colorado's past Governors and other leaders. But Lamm expects to win the election, because he believes a majority of the people of Colorado have had it with “policies appropriate to the past.” “If I lose,” he says in response to a direct question, “the reason will be my own limitations or mistakes—not any weaknesses of the environmental movement. “That movement is growing stronger and it is spreading. It will prevail—if not in my election, in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Line‐Up: 1 Institution, 1 Maverick—1 Spoiler?",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/the-lineup-1-institution-1-maverick1-spoiler-javitsclarkkeating.html,"The Ramsey Clark juggernaut was ready to roll. With a pained smile, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate in New York alighted from his battered Dodge van and ambled diffidently down Jamaica Avenue in Queens. He was in his usual uniform—a shapeless blue suit coat, skinny tie, levi pants, argyll socks and hush puppies. A couple of eager aides handed out leaflets; they were dropping to the ground. At the rear was Mr. Clark's wife, Georgia, wearing a turquoise Mexican peasant dress. She was unselfconsciously bending down and picking up the leaflets from the sidewalk. This is a juggernaut? Yes, because Mr. Clark, whose candidacy had the distinction of being taken seriously by almost no one last spring was by last week given It chance—just a chance—to end the long career of Jacob K. Javits. That durable Republican, given to wearing dark Brooks Brothers suits, has prevailed with Republicans and Independents upstate and in the suburbs, and Democrats in the big cities, in three previous. Senate races. The potential for a change in the record has received more attention nationally than, until recently, it has in New York, where political talk has been dominated by the gubernatorial race. Two weeks ago, for instance, Mr. Clark was on a walking tour, surrounded by a half‐dozen reporters, only one of them front a local news organization. The most recent polls showed Mr. Javits with sizable lead, but perhaps not entirely beyond reach. The campaign itself became acrimonious, almost bitter last week. And, as has happened elsewhere the post‐Watergate, post‐Nixon atmosphere, it has become personal; each man has demeaned the other's character and personality. Mr. Clark has continually spoken of Mr. Javits's alleged lack of integrity on a number of matters: for leaving belatedly (in 1971) resigned from his law firm, which represented businesses and banks affected by legislation Mr. Javits, as Senator, could influence; for having accepted sizable political contributions from bankers, corporate executives and unions, not to mention $15,000 from Vice President‐designate Nelson A. Rockefeller, all of whom are also affected in rather concrete ways by Mr. Javits's votes. In so doing, Mr. Javits acted not unlike most of his contemporaries in the Congress. Mr. Javits questions Mr. Clark's “judgment” such a way as to make it plain the Senator believes his opponent has none. The Senator says Mr. Clark used poor judgment and allowed himself to be ex ploited by the North Vietnamese during Mr. Clark's visit there during the war in 1972. Both candidates are running on records of many impressive accomplishments. With his Senate seniority, Mr. Javits is correct in saying that he's put his liberal stamp on a wealth of bills affecting foreign policy, health, education and housing. He has indeed made sure that expenditures don't bypass New York because of restrictive formulas. But his 18 years have also included compromise. “You can't have pious prounouncements alone,” he says, leading up to the Senator's refusal to denounce President Nixon except in limited terms throughout all the Watergate turmoil. Mr. Clark has seized on the, issue of compromise, brushing aside the fact that he freely admits to remaining United States Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson at a time when he was opposed to the Vietnam War. “I had a job to do,” he says. His record as Attorney General, controversial as it was in 1968, has not entered the public debate this year, perhaps surprisingly. He was a major force in the civil rights movement, particularly in the area of voting rights. And although he originated the strike force concept in prosecuting organized crime, his broader pronouncements on society and prison reform gave him an unwanted reputation for coddling crooks. However well‐earned this reputation has been, made him the symbolic target for a purge by Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential campaign. A Texan and son of the former United States Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, a conservative, he came to the Senate race circuitously. With Mr. Nixon's victory, Mr. Clark moved to Greenwich Village and took up variety of liberal causes, from Kent State to the Alaska natives; from Father Philip Berrigan to Fred Hampton. At the Democratic State Convention Niagara Falls, he had his name placed in nomination by the honest policeman, Frank Serpico, and the socalled leader of the Attica uprising, Herbert X. Blyden. That can fairly be described as starting from nowhere. And yet he went on to defeat the party's candidate in the primary election. A triumph by Mr. Clark now, improbable as seemed until recently, depends on a number of factors. The Conservative Effect The most important is the showing of the Conservative party candidate, Mrs. Barbara A. Keating, widow of a major in the Marines killed in Vietnam. With a campaign heavily financed by the “right‐tolife” anti‐abortion organization, Mrs. Keating has been campaigning mostly upstate, where she is likely to pick up votes that might otherwise have gone to Mr. Javits, But not necessarily: She and many others think she may pick up at least as many otherwise Democratic votes in the cities, especially among Catholic voters who share her views on legalized abortion, and who otherwise see the major party candidates as too liberal. The model for this year's contest may turn out to be Mr. Javits's 1968 race, in which he won nearly 3.3 million votes to 2.2 million for Paul O'Dwyer (a quixotic liberal in much the same mold as Mr. Clark) and 1.1 million for the then relatively unknown James L. Buckley. In order for Mr, Clark to win, Mrs. Keating will. probably have to do at least as well as Mr. Buckley did. Democrats feel that is likely, but a poll for Newsday two weeks ago showed her with only per cent; Mr. Buckley received nearly 17 per cent in 1968. Polls and pundits may be less reliable this year. Voter protest over Watergate may take the form of non participation. The high percentage of undecided voters this late in the campaign may actually reflect a high degree of indifference to the particular race, or disgust with politics in general. For Mr. Javits, whose campaign aides openly admit that they were slow to organize because they underestimated Mr. Clark's strength, the last‐minute strategy means trying to isolate Mr. Clark as an unstable, left‐wing Democrat, not part of his party's mainstream strength. For Mr. Clark, whose independence his never been in doubt the effort now is to link himself with the Democratic organization, and that inevitably creates some irony. Having attacked the influence of big money in politics, Mr. Clark nonetheless wholeheartedly supports the gubernatorial candidate, Representative Hugh L. Carey, whose campaign has been financed largely by a million dollars from his brother, Edward, an oil company executive. The Democratic organization gives signs of having come round to Mr. Clark, perhaps because there is no other choice. Last week he praised some of the Democratiç county leaders, the “bosses” held in such contempt by the party's reform wing. Ignoring for a moment the question of Mr. Javit's integrity, Mr. Clark said of the county leaders, “Those fellas have a kind of tough integrity.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Give You My Word,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/i-give-you-my-word-by-francoise-giroud-translated-from-the-french.html,"While this informal autobiography about the career of one of the most influential women in France was still on the best‐seller list, Frangoise Giroud turned around and, at age 57, launched a new career. She became France's first State Secretary on the Condition of Women, a newly created post and, to the best of my knowledge, the first of its kind in the world. Once the new president Valery Giscard d'Estaing decided to establish a special Government department for women, Madame Giroud seemed the obvious choice to head it. It was an appointment that automatically refuted any charge of tokenism beforehand, because she is a woman professional of acknowledged competence, not a professional woman with a reputation based on being assertively female. And it wasn't too surprising that she refused the job at first. That was not because she didn't want it, although she admitted it would be a fearful Wrench to give up the editorship of L'Express, the successful newsweekly she helped found 20 years ago. She refused, as she explained in her weekly column, because the French premier wanted to downgrade the title of the job and Madame Giroud felt that if she made any concession at the start, she'd wind up “in the cabinet kitchen making coffee for the ministers.” She won. A few weeks later, the post was hers on her own terms. Her book doesn't set down what she may do to change the position of women in France but it gives a compelling picture of what kind of woman she is and why she is likely to prove imaginative, energetic, stubborn if necessary, and above all, fair. Women, she has argued in her column, are not some kind of creature apart, but a crucial and neglected segment of society whose exclusion affects everybody, especially men. Noting at one point in her book that the “most explosive question of our time” is whether power can be shared, Madame Giroud says, “there are two detonators in the society of highly developed nations: women, and popular participation in the decision‐making process, both in business and in politics on the regional or local levels.” She has shared power and knows what it means. But this is not a polemical book, in political or feminist terms. It is a personal story, with the musings and insights provoked by reflection on an active life intimately involved with the events of an extraordinary era. It was not written, but dictated into a tape recorder in response to questions from a discreet and sensitive interviewer, so it is more like an evening's lively conversation than an organized account of her life and times. The method has advantages and disadvantages; a lightness and fluency of tone, but, by the same token, a skimpiness of detail and anecdote where memory skipped about. Nor does it satisfy the appetite for deeper explanation which Madame Giroud titillates with such provocative asides as this comment on why so much of France collaborated comfortably with the Germans during the Nazi occupation: “What made that collaboration so serious was the fact that it confirmed in a way the abdication of the ruling class from its posts and responsibilities. If that class had done its job between 1920 and 1940 and industrialized France, if it had worked and invested the way the 19th‐century bourgeoisie before it had done, it would have found the strength to defend its conquests rather than handing them over to the Germans on a silver platter.” Fascinating, but meager. Still, she lived through amazing events, a period which she says made “mutants” of those who have been through it, and she knew the talented, interesting and powerful French people of the time. Opportunity, persistence and her acute observation give her memories an illuminative value, showing what it was like to live the daily life behind the headlines. More, however, her painful personal experiences and her attitude toward it all add up to an inspiring, though unexpressed declaration of why it's worthwhile to keep going, first of all for a woman, and then for anybody. She had an illegitimate baby because the fall of France made marriage impossible, and there was no chance of abortion. The child was born with difficulty and was sick all his life, because ration cards were denied illegitimate children and she was ill herself. He died in a skiing accident in 1972. Born to a well‐to‐do family, she knew the special distress of unexpected poverty and the special burden of trying to be the family breadwinner as a young girl. She was abandoned by her lover and thought of suicide. Madame Giroud had triumphs, too, and she recounts it all with a refreshing, down‐to‐earth immodesty. There is no need to wonder whether she will understand what women really need as she organizes her new job. She knows, firsthand. She also knows, with straightforward honesty, that it would be foolish, frivolous or self‐defeating to set forth women's needs as something separate from, or in conflict with, men and a whole society. “I'm no saint, I'm no paranoid,” she says. “I can do it, I prefer to understand than to judge.” Although she says that sometimes she thinks understanding is a weakness, undermining the will to power, it is a weakness which she has learned to convert into a strength of character, of will and of achievement which make the righteous judges seem mere vaporous whiners. She has standards, and she has confidence in her convictions, but she also has the common sense and sense of history to be aware of their shifting value. She is no more afraid of changing her perceptions than of taking a stand. Remembering a prewar colonial exhibition “with black women on a platform,” she says, without vanity or guilt, “I sometimes wonder what it is we are doing today with the same kind of oblivious ease that in another 30 years will strike people as just as horrendous.” Her recorded conversation isn't history, or philosophy, or fustian argument. But it is a reassuring, even hopeful testimonial to the endurance of courage, soundness and healthy curiosity, in a world too quick to pity itself and seldom quick enough to pick itself up and cope. That is really Madame Giroud's message: Don't give up, nor waste yourself fighting windmills, because it is possible to cope if you try. Her own life has proved the point. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Senate Races,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/the-senate-races.html,"Several outstanding incumbents are seeking re‐election to the Senate in various parts of the country polls and other political indicators are correct, the Democrats in this category are running ahead of their opponents. Most of the tension and uncertainty involves incumbent Republicans. Among the Democratic Senators who are heavily favored and who, on the basis of their records, deserve to be are Alan Cranston of California, Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut, Frank Church of Idaho, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin and Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. Each has worked in the public interest on a wide range of issues, with Senator‐Nelson particularly notable as a spokesman on environmental issues and Senator Church increasingly, influential foreign affairs. Senators George McGovern in South Dakota and Birch Bayh in Indiana are involved in much closerrices. Mr. McGovern, having lost his home state in the national election two years ago, seems to be regaining the approval of a majority of his constituents now that he is no longer viewed in a Presidential context and is once egain seen as an experienced and competent legislator. His voice and his influence are greatly needed in the Onate. Mr. Bayh, who has been a force for good on the Judiciary Committee on many issues, strongly merits re‐election. Coloradans interested in the protection of their, matchless but threatened environment would be well advised to vote for Gary W. Hart, youthful Democratic chalInger of the undistinguished incumbent, Peter H. Dominick. Silnilarly, Arizona voters would perform a useful service in retiring Barry M. Goldwater, symbolic leader pf the Republican rightwing in the Senate, in favor of Jonathan Marshall, the Democratic challenger. Several Senate seats have opened up because of the retirement of incumbents. In two of these races, able young Congressmen are seeking promotion to the Senate. Representative Wayne Owens, Democrat Utah, has shown himself an intelligent and conscientious legislator; he would make a good Senator. So would Representative John Culver, Democrat of Iowa, a leader of the younger liberals in the House. Several members of the Republican party's small progressive bloc in the Senate are also up for re‐election addition to Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York, whose excellent record we discussed last week, those deserving new terms include Senators Charles Mathias of Maryland, Richard S. Schweiker of Pennsylvania, Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky and Robert W. Packwood of Oregon. Senator Mathias has been an energetic spokesman for campaign finance reform, shown a constructive Interest in urban problems, and demonstrated courage find independence in opposing the Nixon Administration. Barbara Mikulski, his feisty Democratic opponent, thas made a name for herself within her own party as proponent of rules changes to open up the political process; but she is not entitled to preference over Senator Mathias and his excellent record. When Senator Schweiker was elected in Pennsylvania six years ago in a hard‐fought campaign against former Democratic Senator Joseph S. Clark, he was the benificiary of support from the gun lobby and of a general backlash against Mr. Clark's unflinching liberalism. Despite those discouraging auspices, Mr. Schweiker has been a good Senator. In a potentially ironic turnabout, he is now threatened by a Democrat, Mayor Peter Flaherty of Pittsburgh, who on several issues such abortion and amnesty takes a more conservative stand and may outflank him from the right. Senator Marlow Cook of Kentucky is a good deal less liberal on many issues than Senators Mathias and Schweiker, but he is distinctly preferable to his undistinguished Democratic opponent, Gov. Wendell Ford. He has a much better record on environmental problems than the Governor, and he broke with the Nixon Administration in some important controversies such as the Supreme Court nomination of Harrold Carswell. In 1968, Robert Packwood, then a young political unknown, narrowly upset Senator Wayne L. Morse, whose fierce independence earned him the sobriquet, “Tiger in the Senate.” Until Mr. Morse died unexpectedly four months ago, this election was to be a re‐run of that earlier contest. Senator Packwood, now opposed by Democrat Betty Roberts, a state legislator, has an estimable record as a conservationist. On other issues, although he is no tiger, he has in his own quiet way been a constructive and usually progressive influence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 House Republicans Put on Defensive,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/27/archives/3-house-republicans-put-on-defensive-problems-for-ohioan.html,"Three of the most influential Republicans in the House of Representatives, men accustomed to winning re‐election on a smile and a newsletter, suddenly find themselves seriously threatened by Democratic women. With the campaign entering its final 10 days, all three have been forced onto the defensive and into far more ambitious, more costly campaigns than usual. It is a measure of their party's current low estate that one or even all three could conceivably be driven from office. The three are Barber B. Conable Jr. of upstate New York, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee; Samuel L. Devine of Qhio, vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, and Bob Wilson of California, a former chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee. Mr. Conable, whose district includes part of Rochester plus three rural counties, is highly regarded by his contemporaries in Washington for his work on the Ways and Means Committee and his advocacy of reform in the House. Named Among Best He is often named by other Representatives when they are asked whdm they consider the best Republican member. But all of that appears to hay cut little ice in the fate of Watergate, inflation and the energetic campaign of Margaret Costanza, an aggressive, 41‐year‐old liberal who was elected Vice Mayor of Rochester last fall. Only 5 feet tall but a fiery_ stump speaker, Miss Costanza is looked on by some as a kind of ombudsman and by others—as she herself says—as a “loudmouthed, pushy little broad.” She has forced Mr. Conable to hold the first fundraiser of his career (he has served five terms) and has prompted him to abandon his low visibility style for frequent public appearances and even some television advertising. John Riedman, one of his strategists, said that Mr. Conable would spend $50,000 on his campaign—more than two and a half times as much as he has ever spent before. A poll by The Rochester Times‐Union, published Friday, showed Miss Costanza with 30 per cent, Mr. Conable with 28 perpcent, and the rest either undecided or going to minor candidates, in Monroe County (Rochester), which accounts for two‐thirds of the district. The poll suggests that the outcome will, be close. Problems For Ohioan Another officeholder, Frances Ryan, a niember of the Columbus, City council, is providing the‐ problems for Mr. Devine. A moderate‐to‐conservative Democrat who opposes abortion—a rarity among women candidates—Mrs. Ryan was a backer of Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington for President two years ago. Mrs. Ryan, a former newspaper reporter, has pitched her campaign, as has Miss Costanza, to the theme that her opponent is a stand‐patter out of the past. She won a surprising endorsement of that view this week from The Columbus Citizen‐Journal, which backed her after having supported Mr. Devine in each of his eight previous races. Mr. Devine is a leader of the informal Republican conservative caucus in the House, called the Republican Regulars, and is also the ranking member of his party on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. New California District Mr. Devine may be hurt by the fact that both of the major Republican nominees this year in Ohio, Ralph J. Perk for Senator and James A. Rhodes for Governor, are expected to fare poorly. And Mr. Devine has less of a safety margin than Mr. Conable and Mr. Wilson; he has won his last two races by 22,000 votes—a comfortable but not overwhelming edge. Mrs. Ryan's own poll, just completed, shows the two candidates absolutely even. The California contest pits Mr. Wilson, a rather portly 11‐termer who ranks third among Republicans on the Armed Services Committee, against Colleen O'Connor, 29, a college history lecturer and former water ballet performer, in a redrawn district in an Diego. Mr. Wilson has used his committee membership to see to it that appropriations are ample for Navy installations everywhere, but especially in San Diego, the major Navy complex on the West Coast. He is fond of pointing out that the Navy pours $2‐billion a year into the local economy. Two conservative areas, Coronado and LaJolla, were excised from the district last year, and two blue‐collar areas were added, giving the district a Democratic registration edge for the first time. Miss O'Connor.is arguing that “22, years is long enough” and that Mr. Wilson, by refusing to emulate her self‐imposed limit of $42,500 in campaign spending, has shown himself insensitive to post‐Watergate political morality. He is selling his conservatism, his experience and his importance to the Navy. Many retired Navy people live in San Diego. Mr. Wilson is favored, but Miss O'Connor is given a solid chance by local political writers. She has drawn wide press coverage with a swim along the district's coast and a 125‐centsa‐plate taco and bean dinner that outdrew a $150‐a‐plate Republican dinner, attended by then‐Vice President Ford.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, the Mad Scientist Created an Airborne Division...",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/28/archives/meanwhile-the-mad-scientist-created-an-airborne-division.html,"SEATTLE—You can't pick up newspaper these days without getting scared to death over what the “mad” geneticists have in store for us. We read that if we fail to stop them, the human race will rapidly become band of organisms ruled by a few unspeakable tyrants. How real are the bogeymen of heredity? Take cloning. Most people think that that is frightening. Cloning involves the placement of a nucleus from an adult body cell into an unfertilized egg from the same species. The nucleus will then direct the development of the egg into a full‐fledged organism that is a genetic “carbon copy” of the donor of the nucleus. Cloning is easily accomplished with carrot seeds, but is only successful in about 3 per cent of attempts using frog eggs. Because mammalian eggs are so tiny, the procedure has not yet been performed in mammals; however, it's reasonable to assurne that the technological problems can in time be overcome. And then, we are led to believe, dictators will possess a truly awful weapon. Nonsense. Egomaniacal despots would not be inclined to run off carbon copies of themselves: The last thing a tyrant wants is competition. Nor will dictators clone large armies of slaves and soldiers: Who can afford to wait twenty years for an army to grow up? A much more likely application of mammalian cloning might involve increasing our stock of high‐grade beef and milk cattle. Another genetic bugbear is in vitro fertilization, the combining of sperm and egg in a laboratory, Vessel, Comparisons inevitably are made to the baby factories in Aldons Huxley's “Brave New‐World.” But in feet the truly Yeptileive aspect of “Brave New World” is not the innovation in the reproductive process itself but rather the control of reproduction by government. As with cloning, the fears of governmental misuse constitute a false issue. Rulers simply do not need highpowered genetic know‐how to perpetrate hideous atrocities on people. In vitro fertilization is a concept with great promise far beyond the obvious application to women who are sterile because of blocked Fallopian tubes. The study of eggs and very early., embryos could provide invaluable information concerning the causes of chromosomal diseases. In addition, we might eventually develop the ability to routinely recognize severe developmental defects in in vitro embryos during the two‐week interval between fertilization and implantation in the mother's uterus. Imagine a society whose normal reproductive practice involved in vitro fertilization and pre‐implantational screening. Then suppose a few individuals were to suggest that it might be nice to produce babies by sexual intercourse, a procedure known to carry a risk of 3 per cent of serious mental or physical impairment of the newborn. What kind of morality Would that be? All the benefits of genetics, however, are not theoretical and for the future. At this time some very serious birth defects can be diagnosed in the fetus early enough to permit abortion. In addition, genetic research has made possible the early diagnosis and satisfactory dietary treatment of phenylketonuria and galactosemia, two inherited diseases that formerly led to mental retardation and death. Certainly, there are potential problems associated with the application of genetic knowledge. We must stay alert for them, and as they arise we must deal with them in a thoughtful and reasonable manner. Very little comes without a price, and the cost of the new genetics seems low when compared with the possible benefits. The halls of our hospitals and mental institutions echo with the moans and shrieks of the many unfortunate losers of genetics roulette. But ethicists plead for moratoriums, clergymen warn against playing god, legislators impose restrictions on valuable research, and popular writers call on us to “stop them before it's too late.” Contemplative people will recognize in this rhetoric a thought far more frightening than any theoretical hazard of the new genetics: Like Depressions, Dark Ages may come more than once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poll Finds Economy and Taxes Are the Voters' Main Worries,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/28/archives/poll-finds-economy-and-taxes-are-the-voters-main-worries-second-in.html,"The low state of the economy and the high state of taxes are strongly preoccupying New Yorkers who next week will be choosing a Governor, a United States Senator, the state's 39 Congressmen and all 210 members of both houses of the Legislature. The two issues were cited as the main areas of concern by three‐quarters of 1,376 voters across the state questioned in a pre‐election survey commissioned by The New York Times. The findings of the scientifically drawn study, conducted by Yankelovich, Skelly and White, Inc., the publicopinion firm, mirrored, a nationwide concern over the economy that has been vei‐dent in political campaigns here and across the country. Second in a series. The overwhelming preoccupation of New Yorkers with high food prices, the soaring cost of living, taxes and the specter of unemployment is apparent in the major findings of the survey. ¶One of every two New Yorkers is seriously concerned about the economy, especially inflation, the possibility of a severe recession and high food prices. This concern is twice as great as the fears expressed in a Times ‐ Yankelovich survey conducted during the 1970 election campaign. ¶Nearly half of those voters surveyed (46 per cent) said they were seriously concerned about loss of their jobs and more than half (55 per cent) were very fearful they could not pay their bills, meet rent or mortgage payments or save for the future. Among blacks and Puerto Ricans, the rate of anxiety in both categories shot up to two‐thirds or more. ¶Exactly half of those interviewed said they did not expect a nineteen ‐ thirties type depression, but a substantial minority of voters (39 per cent) said they did. ¶Four of ten New Yorkers interviewed (43 per cent) said they expected the economy to worsen during the next two years. Only a third were optimistic about the economic future. The remaining 19 per cent thought the stagnant economy would remain the same. ¶One of three New Yorkers was concerned about taxes and called for tax reform. However, those interviewed were divided almost evenly on whether the real estate, income or sales tax was the fairest levy. The survey was conducted just before President Ford proposed a 5 per cent income tax surcharge for those earning $15,000 or more a year, so the survey aoes not reflect reaction to that proposal. The emphasis on the economy by state voters was so intense that it overshadowed the concern ‐ about ‐ crime issue that has been a virtual fixture as a major problem in recent campaigns. About one quarter of those interviewed cited crime as a major concern so that it ranked third as an issue statewide. But in New York City, one‐third of the voters expressed such anxiety about crime that the issue ranked second in the city behind the economy. Clearly, voters still remain upset about the inroads of crime in their communities. Crime was not the only issue eclipsed by the concentration on the economy. Four years ago, voters participatin in The Times's survey rated the war in Vietnam as the major issue, followed by the crime and economy/inflation issues. High taxes and tax reform placed sixth in the 1970 listing. Several other major concerns in 1970 were all but forgotten this year, an indication that today's burning issue can sometimes be tomorrow's burned out memory. Disappearing altogether from voters' 1970 priority list of concerns was anxiety over student unrest, the youth culture and hippies, pollution control and racial violence. The priority list of issues was developed by asking those interviewed: “As far as you are concerned, what are the two or three main problems facing people like yourself that you want to see the new governor do something about?” Trailing behind economy, taxes and crime were education, which was cited by 12 per cent of those surveyed; unemployment and jobs, nine per cent; problems of the aged, eight per cent; housing and welfare abuse, each seven per cent; transportation, six per cent, and government spending, five per cent. Other Key Findings There was almost no volunteered concern about such often heated issues as rent control, honesty in government, racial discrimination, busing of school children to promote integration, abortion and energy shortage. But prospective voters had decided opinions on several of these subjects when the interviewer raised the issues. Voter attitudes on these problems were elicited by asking for an opinion on a number of issues likely to arise at the next session of the State Legislature. Among these findings were the following: ¶Two‐thirds of those surveyed said the state should emphasize mass transit over highways. Even upstaters, usually more highway conscious, came down slightly on the side of mass transit by a 45 to 44 per cent margin over highways, New York City residents overwhelmingly favored mass transit by an 80 to 11 per cent margin as did 72 per cent of suburbanites. ¶Two‐thirds oppose the appointment of judges although there has been considerable pressure from good government groups to end the election of judges arid have them appointed by governors or mayors. ¶Half of those surveyed said they were satisfied with the state's liberal abortion law, which has been bitterly attacked by Right to Life groups. A third of those polled want a more restrictive law and 13 per cent a more lenient law. Roman Catholics, who have led the anti‐abortion campaign, were divided, with 47 per cent calling for a stricter law, 39 per cent satisfied with the present law and eight per cent favoring an even more lenient law. In contrast to four years ago, when pollution control ranked high as a priority concern, two thirds (65 per cent) of those interviewed now favor offshore drilling for oil despite the risk of oil spills. Even on Long Island, where there has been vocal opposition to offshore drilling because of potential damage to ocean beaches, a majority (56 per cent) support drilling. ¶Slightly more than half of the prospective voters favor state aid to parochial schools, with the largest majority (79 per cent) found among Catholics. Protestants and Jews opposed such aid, Protestants by a slight majority, but Jews by an overwhelming percentage of two thirds. ¶A slight majority of all voters opposed restricting beaches and parks to local residents, as most suburban communities of New York City now do. Two‐thirds of suburban residents favored such restrictions, while 56 per cent of all city voters and 59 per cent of all upstaters opposed such limitations. ¶A small majority (53 per cent) of all voters favored the extension of legalized betting to sports other than horse racing. About two‐thirds of Roman Catholics and Jews indicated support for such on extension, but Protestants, who have been traditionally more concerned about gambling, opposed additional betting by a 57 to 33 per cent margin. ¶Those interviewed divided almost equally over whether money for education should be derived from real estate, income or sales taxes. This may indicate some confusion on the issue—a confusion that has been carried over into the current state campaign as various candidates decry high real estate taxes without choosing a substitute tax to finance education. Candidates Cite Strategy The heavy emphasis in the survey responses on money —inflation, the economy, taxes—has been reflected in the current campaign by all leading candidates. The two major gubernatorial candidates—Governor Wilson, the Republican incumbent, and Representative Hugh L. Carey, his Democratic opponent—have repeatedly tried to hang “big spender” and “big taxer” labels on each other. Mr. Carey has cited the spending and taxing policies of the Republican state administration over the last 16 years. Mr. Wilson, has criticized the Democratic‐controlled Congress for its spending and taxing since Mr. Carey entered Congress in 1960. David Garth, the media consultant who is it principal architect of the Carey campaign, said in an interview that the candidate's own polls show a corresponding voter concern over inflation, taxes and crime. Mr. Garth, who is also advising Democratic candidates in Michigan, reported that the issues “don't change from state to state—our Michigan poll is the same as our New York poll.” Harry J. O'Donnell, Governor Wilson's press secretary and a principal strategist in his campaign, agreed with the survey findings, especially the deep fears about crime held by residents of New York City. Mr. O'Donnell noted that the Wilson television and radio commercials dealing with crime are being aired more extensively on New York City stations than they are upstate. The Paramount Issue But it is the concern with the economy that is paramount, cutting across the board, involving all groups of New York voters. Even those who describe themselves as liberals and conservatives and who often disagree on most political matters listed the economy as their major concern and taxes as the cond‐ranking issue when they were surveyed early this month. Typical of this concern was the reaction of a registered Democrat, Mrs. Carmen Peralta of Co‐op City in the Bronx. “Every day, prices are going much higher—food, clothing, everything,” Mrs. Peralta, sighed. Seventy‐five miles away in suburban Selden, L.I., a Republican, Mrs. Charlotte Mulligan, said, “We never had this problem. We could always pay our bills and have enough left over to go out to the movies; now we end up sitting at home and watching TV.” Among those most concerned about the economy were those in the 25 to 34 year age bracket, and, somewhat ironically, higherincome persons. Also particularly affected were suburbanites and those who call themselves moderates. This was a signal that inflation and economic fears have extended beyond the lower‐income and middle‐income voters to the more affluent segments of our society. Another measure of the economy issue was the response to a question exploring whether a voter considered himself “hard pressed” economically or was managing to “cope” with inflation. In families in which the head of the household was earning under $10,000, 48 per cent of those surveyed said they were hard pressed. The figure went slightly higher for voters under 25 years of age (54 per cent hard pressed) and those in the 25 to 34 age group (49 per cent). Geographically, New York City residents were more hard pressed financially (44 per cent) than upstaters (38 per cent) while politically, Democrats were more financially strapped (45 per cent) than Republicans (34 per cent). Blacks and Puerto Ricans departed somewhat from the general findings even though they, too, listed high prices as their major concern. For them crime was the second concern, just behind the economy, while food prices jumped to third place. Taxes were fourth on the issues list of blacks and Puerto Ricans. Blacks, Puerto Ricans and Jews also were more concerned by such “liberal” issues as education and housing. But even among these groups these issues trailed considerably behind the “ “bread‐and‐butter” economic fears. Black and Puerto Rican anxiety over economic issues was especially evident in a series of questions designed to determine how concerned, those interviewed were about their jobs, paying bills, paying rent or mortgages, of being able to save, and the possibility of a depression. Just under half of those surveyed were seriously concerned about the loss of their jobs, with another 17 per cent slightly less concerned. But among blacks and Puerto Ricans, three ‐ quarters of those interviewed were fearful about their jobs with close to 60 per cent seriously concerned. Similarly, nearly three quarters of blacks and Puerto Rican voters were seriously concerned about paying their bills, while among the general population, 53 per cent expressed apprehension. Blacks and Puerto Ricans also were more pessimistic than the average in their fears of another great depression. Women, too, were more pessimistic than men on this question. A slight majority of women predicted a depression while 59 per cent of male voters held an optimistic view. The breakdown of those surveyed by income category serves, in itself, to demonstrate the extent of inflation, in recent years. The largest single income category surveyed was those with incomes of more than $15,000 (32 per cent of those polled). The other income groups were $10,000 to $15,000 (one‐quarter of those polled); $7,500 to $10,000, (14 per cent), and under $7,500 (20 per cent). The remainder declined to provide their income. This income breakdown corresponds with census figures on income for the general population, indicating a rise in salaries in New York State.

CASE IS SETTLED BY WADDELL & REED,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/28/archives/case-is-settled-by-waddell-reed-poll-finds-economy-and-taxes-are.html,"KANSAS CITY, Oct. 27 (AP) — Waddell & Reed, Inc., of Kansas City, manager of one of the country's largest groups of mutual investing funds, has agreed to pay $1‐million into them in settlement of a fraud complaint brought by the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission. Another part of the settlement is dissolution of Kansas City Securities Corporation, brokerage subsidiary of Waddell & Reed. “We are pleased that the S.E.C. has accepted our offer of settlement,” said Ben Korschot, president of Waddell & Reed. “The major issues involved complex legal questions concerning the effect of negotiable brokerage commissions on the continuing relationship between our brokerage subsidiary and the mutual funds.

Women's Movement Is Scored By Mrs. Keating on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/30/archives/womens-movement-is-scored-by-mrs-keating-on-abortions.html,"Barbara Keating, the Conservative party candidate for United States Senator from New York, deplored yesterday some of the causes that she said the women's rights movement “has identified so exclusively with.” She cited, in particular, liberalization of abortion laws, and criticized the only other woman candidate for statewide office, Mary Ann Krupsak, the Democrat for Lieutenant Governor and a member of the State Senate. “Mrs. Krupsak voted in the State Legislature for abortion,” Mrs. Keating said. “She has announced her support for a statewide homosexual bill of rights presumably modeled on the infamous bill that was defeated in the New York City Council. She voted against measures to combat pornography.” Mrs. Keating, who was campaigning in Rochester, said that she would like to debate Senator Krupsak, preferably on television. Television of the paid variety is beyond the reach of the Keating‐for‐Senator campaign and so, to take advantage of free time, she cut short her upstate visit to return to New York City for a discussion with her two rivals on statewide public television. Here, Mrs. Keating struck another familiar theme of her campaign, criticizing busing that would take children away from neighborhood schools. She praised the antibusing role that she attributed to Mrs. Genevieve Sanchez Klein a member of the State Board of Regents. “Mrs. Klein has shown what a determined, dynamic woman can do in the public arena,” Mrs. Keating said. “Too often the women who have been active in our public life stand for all the wrong things.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inquest Under Way in Death of Fetus After Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/31/archives/inquest-under-way-in-death-of-fetus-after-abortion.html,"PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30—An unusual coroner's inquest began here today to determine whether a prominent obstetrician deliberately allowed a fetus to die when it might have been alive after an abortion. A jury of four men and two women was empaneled to determine whether criminal acts occurred last March 19 when Dr. Leonard E. Laufe, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at West Penn Hospital, performed a therapeutic abortion and hysterectomy on, a 26‐year‐old Erie woman. “This case involves what the District Attorney's office believes is a homicide,” District Attorney John J. Hickton of Allegheny County told the jury. A medical witness who has viewed a film of the operation suggested that the fetus might have been born dead, one of the critical issues that the coronet, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, charged the jury with establishing. The other issue, the coroner said, is whether the fetus, if born alive, was deliberately allowed to die. Dr. Rudy Sabbagha testified under cross‐examination by Dr. Laufe's attorney, James McLaughlin, that the only movement he had seen in the film was “one gasp.” This, he said, would fall within the definition of stillbirth put forward by the Amerlean College of Surgeons, which distinguishes between regular breathing and “fleeting efforts” at breath. Mr. Hickton read the jury a deposition from the woman, whose name is being withheld. She said she had been raped last Sept. 14, but had told doctors it actually occurred two weeks later, to further her chances of having a late‐term abortion. Dr. Maurice Cerul, a psychiatrist who examined the pregnant woman, said that having the baby would have caused her severe emotional distress. He told of receiving a “frantic” telephone call after the woman had been denied an abortion by one doctor. The unidentified caller said the woman was suicidal, Dr. Cerul testified. Dr. Terry Hayashi, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Magee‐Women's Hospital, said he and other physicians on his staff had refused to approve the abortion because of the lateness of the pregnancy. Mr. Hickton said the film, which will be screened for the jury, would show consternation among people in the operating room at the size and development of the fetus. Both Mr. Hickton and Dr. Wecht, a forensic pathologist and lawyer, cautioned the jury that they were not to concern themselves with the abortion itself, but the circumstances surrounding it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agreements on three‐year contracts have been reached with more than 120 the 150 companies involved by representatives of 5,000 6,000 employes. The new agreements call for a 31 per cent wage increase over a three‐year period, with a cost‐of‐living increase included.

East Siders Seek OTB Office Curbs Concerned over possible “creeping commercialism” their Upper East Side district, officials of Community Board 8 have called a meeting with officials of the Off‐track Betting Corporation for Wednesday on future site selection of wagering parlors. Mrs. Edith Fisher, chairman of the community board, said she had received a letter from the betting agency listing five “probable” sites in her district for branches. She said that the district, from 59th to 96th Street, already had two OTB branches and indicated that she was concerned over preserving the district's residential quality. A spokesman for the betting agency responded by saying that the operation was “an integral part of the New York society” and had “contributed meaningful money the city treasury.” He added: “We employ people and are nothing but good neighbors everywhere we have settled down.” Abortions in State Down 13% in 1973 The State Department of Health said in Albany that the number of abortions performed in the state dipped by 13 per cent in 1973, the year the United States Supreme Court lifted prohibitions for most abortions throughout the country. The Health Department estimated that 225,750 abortions were performed last year, about 48 per cent them for nonresidents. In 1972, there were 258,285 abortions in the state, 61 per cent for nonresidents. “The number of abortions did drop obviously as a result of the [Supreme Court] decision,” said a spokesman for the state agency, noting that thousands of women from other states used to come to New York for abortions because of the state's liberal abortion laws.

Democrat Confident,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/01/archives/democrat-confident.html,"SCHENECTADY, N. Y., Oct. 31—Representative Hugh L. Carey, his fellow Democrats flocking to his lengthening coattails, today brought his campaign upstate for a day. He was treated as a winner, and he acted as one. At a news conference here and at earlier stops in Syracuse and Albany, the Democratic candidate for Governor said hel hoped that “if we are successful, Governor Wilson will extend to us the opportunity to have people present at the budget presentations,” the working sessions that will soon let under way for the preparatio of the next state budget. Mr. Carey also called on Governor Wilson to “freeze jobs in place, with no lateral transfers.” He said he undertood that “some people” in the Wilson administration were now being moved from vulnerable appointive jobs to “more secure positions” in state government. Mr. Carey asked Governor Wilson to live up to his “comthitment to less government” by stopping the practice, a common one at the end of an administration. Mr. Carey was accompanied on the trip by Ramsey Clark, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, and Robert Abrams, candidate for State Attorney General. He was met at a rally at Bishop Ludden High School in Syracuse by Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, the candidate for Lieutenant Governor, who was on an extended campaign swing upstate,’ In addition, local candidates for everything from sheriff ‘to county clerk to Congress crowded around him. Mr. Carey startled his audience at the Roman Catholic high school in Syracuse by sud‐denly shifting from a general political speech to a lengthy explanation of his stand on abortin. He has said the same thing often enough before—that he does not like abortion, but he is sworn to uphold the Constitution and “under the Constitution the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy is ironclad”—but only in answer to questions. Here, he seemed to raise the issue himself. However, it turned out that the high school's principal, Msgr. Charles Eckermann, had asked him to discuss abortion. “He gave a forthright answer,” the monsignor said later. “I'm not completely satisfied, but many people here were saying that the congressman is proabortion, and he made it clear it that he is not.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Race Is a Muted Issue In State, Survey Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/02/archives/race-is-a-muted-issue-in-state-survey-finds.html,"Something of a quiet standoff is discernible in New York's race relations in this inflation‐ridden election year. A special statewide attitudinal survey of voters, commissioned by The New York Times, finds that whites generally are adamantly against special treatment for minority groups in the areas of jobs, housing and education while black and Puerto Ricans feel their grievances are largely ignored. But.the racial groups mostly agree at least that relations have not worsened in the last few years. And one of every four whites and blacks of the 1,376 registered voters participating in the survey believe things may even be improving. A’ lower‐key mood for this basic issue in the face of the more immediate problems of the pocketbook emerged from the survey of New Yorkers undertaken for The Times by the public‐opinion firm of Yankelovich, Skelly and White, Inc., during the first week of October. The potential for aggravation of race relations is clearly sketched in the survey, with whites generally unsympathetic to the special problems perceived by blacks and Puerto Ricans as a result of discrimination. But on the list of immediate issues of main concern, discrimination is cited by fewer than one of every ten blacks and Puerto Ricans interviewed, racial unrest is mentioned by only one of a hundred whites, and all groups cite the school busing issue, now consuming Boston, as negligible anywhere in the state. “Integration has been pushed in the background because of inflation,” said Morris Hattem, a black resident of Queens who participated in the survey. “When times are good you think more of others and when they're bad, you think, more of yourself.” And busing? “I'm against busing,” he said. “Better teachers are the real answer.” While the survey showed general disinterest in the issue of busing to achieve racial balance in the schools, Governor Wilson, the Republican candidate for re‐election, recently introduced a new television commercial based on the subject accusing his opponent, Representative Hugh L. Carey, of enthusiasm for busing, a charge the Democrat denies. The Times's survey, which has a margin of error of three per cent of the total sample, measured differences among other state groups, including the following: ¶Sex. Men participating in the survey in the main felt that women get a fair deal in politks. But general income data provided in the study, continue to show women underrepresented at the upper salary levels and overrepresented at the lower end. ¶ Religion. Criticism of the state's liberalized abortion law is strongest, as expected, mainly among Roman Catholics. But the survey notes that for each Catholic who wants a stricter abortion law (47 per cent), there is another Catholic who is either satisfied with the present law or thinks it should be even more lenient (a combined 47 per cent). ¶Income. Enthusiasm for public financing of political campaigns increases depending on how high up on the salary scale a voter is. ¶Age. Government concern for the problems of the elderly is an immediate, pressing issue for one of every four New Yorkers over 65 years old. But only one in 100 voters under 25 years old bothers to cite it as a main priority problem in the state. The basic reading of the current racial scene was provided in response to the survey question: “Do you feel that too much attention, too little attention, or just about the right amount of attention is being paid to minority groups these days?” Among whites responding, 43 per cent said too much attention was being paid to minority groups, 22 per cent said too little, and 32 per cent said the right amount, Blacks and Puerto Ricans felt the opposite, with blacks registering a bit more strongly and saying: 65 per cent too little, 8 per cent too much and 24 per cent the right amount. Voters also were asked about their local communities —“Have race relations improved in the last few years, stayed the same, or gotten worse?” Among blacks, the main feeling (45 per cent) was that race relations have stayed the same 28 per cent sensed a worsening, and 25 per cent found improvement. Among whites, some 55 per cent found a status quo in race relations, 27 per cent saw improvement, and 16 per cent thought relaticins had worsened. Whether the scramble for inflationary dollars has put the racial issue into a longterm limbo in the public mind can not be discerned by the survey, of course. But little sympathy among whites was found, at this time of high unemployment, for proposals that minority groups deserve an extra boost from government into the job market. Three of every four whites interviewed flatly disagreed when asked whether “minority groups have to be given special breaks when it comes to jobs.” Conversely 56 per cent of blacks said such breaks were needed. “I don't have any more of a chance than they do just because I'm white: said an upstate voter who participated in the survey, William Feltz of Medina, an opponent of special breaks. “I think they get a fair shake of things now, but not previously.” The same question of whether minority groups should be given special treatment by government was put in terms of education and housing and it was answered negatively by better than three of five whites and positively by a comparable ratio, of blacks and Puerto Ricans. The onie ideological group to offer even partial support to the minorities was those voters who described themselves as liberals. By a 56 per cent majority, the liberals said special breaks were needed by minorities in the schools; but the liberals would not extend extra treatment for jobs or housing. There were no significant differences on these questions between male and female voters, and the least sympathy for the proposals was expressed among theelderly, Protestants, niddle‐income workers, and residents of Staten Island. The concern that blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans have in common is the view that the failing economy dominates all the other issues. On the relative scale of things, however, blacks and Puerto Ricans rate crime nearer the top as a priority concern than whites do. Separate aspects of inflation bring out differences: one of four blacks and Puerto Ricans specify food prices as the prime problem, but only one in ten whites does so. Conversely, one of three whites points to tax reform as a pressing issue; only one in five blacks and Puerto Ricans agrees. Some survey findings hint repeatedly at something of a cynicism gap between the raraces and cynicism toward government and the criminal justice system generally. Whites, for example, are measured as expressing confidence at getting a fair trial: 45 per cent expressed “a lot of confidence” about this, compared with only 29 per cent of blacks. Similarly, almost three of five blacks had no confidence they could get to see their legislators, which was double the doubt expressed by whites. Such questions about faith in government also showed that most people—black and white—have no real confidence an apprehended thief would ever go to jail. Most pessimistic of all about this were Jews and outer borough residents of New York City. Also, the only groups expressing major confidence of getting a fair trial were white Protestants and upstate residents, both of which registered 50 per cent for “a lot” of confidence about this. Women were noticeably less confident than men about receiving a fair trial and being able to see, their legislators. ! On other issues, the quality of schools was of “serious concern” to more than half the Puerto Ricans and blacks interviewed, but less than a third of white voters polled. Concerns about neighborhood deterioration and the search for decent housing also showed a comparable disparity between the races. The income data provided by voters in the survey (which was scientifically drawn to approximate the census averages for the state) shows that salaryscale advantages cle?irly go to whites and to males. By over‐all average, 32 per cent of the survey group received salaries of more than $15,000 annually. However only 27 per cent of women were in this upper bracket, compared with 37 per cent of men. The disparity was greater on racial lines: against the 32 per cent upper income average, only 15 per cent of blacks were in this group, while 35 per cent of whites were. At the lower end of the salary range whites maintabled a similar advantage. The statewide average in the survey for jobs paying $7,500 or less annually was 20 per cent of the voters. But 38 per cent of blacks were in this et, compared with 18 per cent is of whites. And 22 cent of blacks were in this bracket, compared with 18 per cent of whites. And 22 per cent of women were in this bracket, compared with 17 per cent of men.

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/02/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-battle-for-a-senate-seat.html,"Your Oct. 25 editorial endorsement of Senator Javits, while not unexpected, was nevertheless disappointing. After carefully reading the editorial several times, my disappointment was all the greater. The tone of the editorial did not, to me, seem particularly enthusiastic. In fact, it sounded to me as if there was another editorial longing to “escape”—an endorsement of Ramsey Clark. I also found the editorial interesting in terms of what you chose not to talk about. I had decided during the preliminaries that led to Mr. Nixon's resignation that, if the Democrats offered a viable alternative to Senator Javits, I would seriously consider voing for that alternative. In the light of Watergate, it seems to me we should not only expect but demand more courage from our elected officials. None was forthcoming from Senator Javits. Then, too, I would like a clearer statement from Senator Javits about the gift from Mr. Rockefeller. One would have hoped he would return it. You chose to say nothing about the tone of the campaign conducted by Senator Javits. It has not been what one might describe as uplifting. Indeed, it has seemed like the campaign of a desperate candidate. Senator Javits has attempted to portray Mr. Clark's trip to Hanoi as sinister. I believe Mr. Clark had as much right to travel to Hanoi as Senator Javits did to to Cuba. I will vote for Mr. Clark without misgivings. MEL GARBAR Forest Hills, N. Y., Oct. 25, 1974 To the Editor: I see you have come out for Senator Javits. That is understandable. Javits, on his voting record, deserves your support. It's too bad that we must make a choice between two such good men; but we must. Clark in the Senate might put a jolt into that somnolent, moribund assemblage of tired old men. Sure he wants to reduce “defense” spending by $25 billion. But why worry? Even God could not reduce the Pentagon budget by 25 nickels. It looks as if we are going to have a lot of new blood in the Senate. It's about time. DAVID H, LANG New York, Oct. 29, 1974 To the Editor: The women's vote is likely to be pivotal in the coming election. I invite your readers’ attention to Senator Jacob K. Javits’ outstanding record in favor of legislation and programs which benefit women. The Senator: •Supported the Equal Rights Amendment and he has opposed all amendments to E.R.A. •Co‐sponsored legislation to outs law credit discrimination based on sex or marital status. •Together with Senator Williams of New Jersey authored the landmark pension bill, which, among other things, improves widows’ benefits. • Introduced legislation as early as 1971 which would fund Child Development Programs established by Community Child Care Councils. • Sponsored an amendment to the. Health Program Extension Act of 1973 which became law and which prohibits reverse discrimination for religious beliefs or moral convictions with respect to abortions. Supports, from his vantage point as a senior member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, all efforts to eliminate against women in the field of educaion. Senator Javits’ past legislative accomplishments and his ability to accomplish needed reforms by virtue of his seniority in the future are compelling reasons for the women of this state to support his bid for re‐election. (Assemblywoman) CONSTANCE E. COOK Ithaca, N. Y., Oct. 28, 1974 Our Wounded: Where the Abuse Begins To the the Editor: I have no quarrel with Mr. Schwalb's pointing out to us that the Vietnam war is not over (letters Oct. 25); I couldn't agree with him more. However, I have serious quarrel with his supporting his view by propagating the nonfact that there are “thousands of American wounded who lie malattended in hospitals.” From my experience, that is certainly not true. In the past three years I have worked in three of our Army's medical centers, have seen their orthopedic wards and talked to many American wounded. I've never seen any soldier receive anything but excellent medical and rehabilitative care. I believe any comments made to refute this are antimilitary insults made solely for their emotional value, not for their truth. The truth is that the maltreatment does not occur in our military hospitals but afterward, when these veterans meet you and me in everyday life. When we stare at a lost limb, won't spend extra dollars to adapt schools and public facilities to serve the handicapped or fail to make room for a wheelchair at our workbench or in our office, that kind of treatment I have seen. And we can be grateful, you, I and all the Mr. Schwalbs, that this is one part of the war that we can resolve if we want to. RUTH E. KAHRS First Lieut., A.M.S.C., U.S.A.R. Paramus, N. J., Oct. 25, 1974 In Lieu of a Surtax: Forced Savings To the Editor: A key element in President Ford's anti‐inflation program, the 5 per cent tax surcharge, has met with such political resistance that its passage is seriously in doubt. Many doubt that this Administration will be able to resist allowing expenditures to grow to match revenue. Yet it is critical that some means be found of reducing aggregate purchasing power. We would propose that the 5 per cent tax surcharge be changed to a compulsory savings plan, of the sort proposed by economists in the past and actually utilized in other countries. Under our plan, individual taxpayers would be given a special issue of Series H bonds, not redeemable at present, bearing regular savings‐bond interest rates and equal in amount (to the nearest $25) to the 5 per cent surcharge paid. The President would also be given the power to declare such bonds redeemable by the Treasury at any future date when, in his judgment, there was a need to stimulate, rather than restrain, consumer purchasing power introducing a muchneeded element of flexibility into fiscal policy. Such a proposal instituted now would accomplish almost exactly the same objective of curbing inflationary demand as the 5 per cent tax surcharge and should be politically more acceptable since individuals would acquire an earning asset rather than a receipt for taxes paid. Moreover, once the apparatus for administering the plan were in place, it could be used over and over again in future inflationary periods. HORACE 3. DE PODWIN W. GILES MELLON Newark, Oct. 10, ’1974 The writers are, respectively, dean and area chairman, finance, of the Rutgers Graduate School of Business Administration. Who Should Bear the Burden To the Editor: The President's proposal for a 5 per cent surcharge tax on incomes over $15,000 is clearly inequitable and should be discouraged. On the other hand, it is desirable to take some of the purchasing power out of the economy in order to decrease the inflationary pressures. It is important to realize that not all people are hurt by inflation. The people whose incomes rise faster than prices are clearly ahead of the game. It is these people who should bear the burden of increased taxation. The new taxes necessary to dry up purchasing power could easily be levied on the increase in 1974 over 1973 income. That would get at the root of the problem. CHARLES R. DEAN New York, Oct. 28, 1974 Carey vs. Wilson: ‘Our State Is in Good Hands’ To the Editor: Remember the last time a prominent liberal Congressman sought high executive office for which he was illequipped—and remember what shambles John Lindsay made of New York City? The Carey‐Krupsak ticket would bring the same sort of government to our entire state that has brought New York City to its knees. This year alone the liberal Democrats who control our city raised our sales taxes, raised our real‐estate taxes and imposed a new auto‐use tax. On the other hand, since Malcolm Wilson became our Governor last December, he has repealed the 2½ per cent surtax on our state personal income taxes as he reduced our state taxes this year by $138 million. Governor Wilson also established a new privately funded “Little Hoover Commission” for thorough review of all functions of state government and pledged prompt action on all reforms proposed. He supported efforts of “Inspectors General” of welfare and education to eliminate waste, mismanagement and inefficiency. I hope New Yorkers will not be foaled by liberal Congressman Carey as they were in 1965 by liberal Con gressman Lindsay. Our state is in good hands with Governor Wilson. DANIEL L. MASTER Oakwood, S. I., Oct. 28, 1974 Kuh: The Better D.A. To the Editor: Again, as in its primary endorsement, The Times has spoken highly of Richard H. Kuh, commended his forcerfulness and imagination as District Attorney—then endorsed his adversary [editorial Oct. 31]. Yet in his less than nine months as District Attorney, Mr. Kuh has been decisive and innovative. He has opened branch offices, toughened plea bargaining, chided judges for absurdly soft sentences, created a sex‐crime unit, hired and promoted women and blacks to a greater degree than ever before in the office's history and. worked tirelessly and wisely to clean up the suffocating court backlogs. Times reporters have catalogued all of this in their news pages. They have also chronicled Mr. Morgenthau's prosecution of draft resisters (to a degree some of us consider ruthless). Why then does The Times endorse Mr. Morgenthau? Surely it is not because of qualification for the office of Dist trict Attorney of New York County. While Mr. Morgenthau's experiencesolely as an administrator, innovator and investigative leader might qualify him for functioning in the capacity of a State Attorney General, it is not to be compared with the essential ingredient needed to be District Attorney, of trying criminal cases before the courts and juries of New York County. On this score Mr. Kuh is far to be favored over Mr. Morgenthau. S. HAZARD GILLESPIE New York, Nov. 1, 1974 The Case for Stephen May To the Editor: If we believe the polls’ indications that voters are fed up with all incumbents and skeptical of sacred cows, the people of the State of New York may be in for a mild surprise on the morning of Nov. 6. They may find they have chosen Stephen May Controller in place of Arthur Levitt. Despite Mr. Levitt's satisfactory performance in his twenty‐year incumbency, his retirement now at 74 would not be an ungracious rejection by present‐day standards, where 70 is considered the age beyond which persistent hanging on is to be discouraged. Should Mr. May succeed, it may be regarded as another example of that mysterious good sense of the electorate in quietly choosing a member of the opposite party to check on the party in power. In Mr. May's case they would also be choosing an efficient young Republican to start on cursus honorum in preparation for future campaigns. DANIEL G. KENNEDY Rochester, Oct. 28, 1974 Justice Greenblott's Record To the Editor: In your recent editorial endorsing Judges Stevens and Cooke for the New York State Court of Appeals, you noted the impressive record of a third candidate, Justice Louis M. Greenblott. By inadvertence, I am sure, you failed to note that Justice Greenblatt and Justice Cooke joined the Appellate Division, Third Department, on the same day in 1969 and that Justice Greenblott, as well as Justice Cooke, has “special knowledge gained from cases taken on appeal to the Third Department” of the Appellate Division. In the case of three such outstanding candidates as Judges Stevens, Cooke and Greenblott, the Court of Appeals and the people of the State of New York will be well‐served by the election of any two of these three jurists. ISRAEL MARGOLIS Binghamton, N. Y., Oct. 29, 1974 The New Republic Clarifies To the Editor: An advertisement in The New York Times of Oct. 31, urging the reelection of Senator Javits, carries the name of Martin Peretz and his title—chairman of The New Republic's editorial board. The identification was not intended to suggest any endorsement by this journal, which has taken no position on the contest between Mr. Javits and Ramsey Clark. GILBERT A.

Few Surprises Are Expected in Complex Election in Pennsylvania,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/02/archives/few-surprises-are-expected-in-complex-election-in-pennsylvania.html,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1—There is something for almost everyone in Pennsylvania politics this year. A middle class Irish Mayor, a wealthy Jewish Governor, an Anglo‐Saxon businessman with a comely wife, and a Republican Senator on the White House “enemies list” are all part of the 1974 campaign. As though that were not sufficient to hold the electorate's interest, out of the candidates’ pursuits has emerged an encyclopedic list of issues that includes campaign contributions, government reform, influence peddling, bribery, other assorted scandals in high places, intraparty squabbles, abortion and capital punishment. Still, as Election Day—next Tuesday—approaches, the pollsters and pundits of Pennsylvania are predicting few surprises. Schweiker vs. Flaherty Gov. Milton J. Shapp, the millionaire Democrat who was born Milton Shapiro, is expected to win re‐election over Andrew L. Lewis Jr. Lewis, a rich and handsome young executive who has promised enormous amounts of Republican integrity in state government. Similarly, Senator Richard S. Schweiker, a Republican named as an adversary by Richard M. Nixon's old Administration, is given a healthy chance to win a second term in his contest with Peter F. Flaherty, the boyishfaced, Democratic Mayor of Pittsburgh who won re‐election there last year as the candidate of both parties. Nevertheless, those odds—the consensus of polls and surveys conducted by candidates and newspapers across the state—have been generally qualified, and in this year of turmoil and trauma, neither of the frontrunners is breathing easy. Senator Schweiker, for instance, faces the unpredictable impact of the Watergate scandals and inflation, forces that in many states have spelled gloom and dismay for Republican incumbents. He has the endorsement of organized labor and has focused his remarks on the distance he maintained between him and the Nixon White House, but his aides privately express concern that voters may simply regard him as “just another Republican.” That is precisely the thrust of Mr. Flaherty's efforts. He has described the Senator as a part of the incumbent Congressional hierarchy and placed the blame for inflation on its doorstep, contrasting his own fiscal ly conservative record in Pittsburgh's City Hall as the type of approach most needed in Washington these days. The Mayor's hopes for victory are pinned to a large Democratic turnout, Republican apathy and the anti‐incumbent instincts of the independent voters in the state. ‘Pennsylvania Watergate’ Mr. Lewis, likewise, seems to be counting heavily on the disenchantment with those already in office as a major component in his pursuit of the Governorship. The Shapp Administration has been plagued in recent months by a succession of scandals that Mr. Lewis has called a “Pennsylvania Watergate.” While the Governor's involvement in the scandals has not been an issue, those involved were members of his team, and his people here and elsewhere in Pnnsylvania are attempting to counteract the damage by emphasizing Mr. Shapp's own personal integrity and his interest in campaign reform. The election is not expected to alter dramatically the margin in the United States House of Representatives, where Democrats now hold 14 of 25 seats. The huge Democratic majorities usually awarded in this city are also very important for any Democrat seeking statewide office. Of major concern this year to Mr. Flaherty and Mr. Shapp is an intercine struggle within the Philadelphia ranks of tlie party, a tension that could limit margins they need for a statewide victory. Peter J. Camiel, who runs the Democratic party here as one of the last, genuine “bosses” in America's urban politics, is feuding with Mayor Frank L. Rizzo, also a Democrat, and there is some speculation that a low Democratic turnout will result. My Margin Vital If the Democratic margins in Philadelphia are less than usual, the chances for Republican victory increase, since most of the rest of the state has shown Republican instincts in the past. If Democratic margins are large in Philadelphia, Democratic victories are practically assured. Consequently, both of the Democrats are working hard on Philadelphia, while both Republicans are concentrating much of their efforts on the rest of Pennsylvania. As they began to wind up their campaigns, though, some of their aides and workers were beginning to sympathize with the tired observation made by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alalbama after an exhaustive of Presidential campaigning in 1972. He had made appearances in Pittsburgh, Erie, Scranton, Wilkes‐Barre, Reading and Philadelphia and he had spoken to steelworkers and coal miners and Amish farmers and Quaker farmers and Great Lakes dock daythands and ethnic audiences, of all kinds and when he finished that night in a motel here, he was spent and confused. “Ooowee,” he sighed wearily, “a fella could campaign half his life in Pennsylvania and still not know what the hell he was doing.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javits and Clark Offer Voters a Study in Contrasts: A Pragmatic Sancho vs. the Idealistic Don Quixote,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/03/archives/javits-and-clark-offer-voters-a-study-in-contrasts-a-pragmatic.html,"For 28 straight years in elective office, the last 18 in the Senate, Jacob K. Javits, a liberal Republican walking on tiptoe between his party's dominant conservative wing and the state's Democratic majority, has mastered what he calls “the politics of conciliation.” But all during the present campaign Mr. Javits has been challenged by two candidates who say, viewing him from the perspectives of the left and the right, that he has stretched conciliation so hard and so long that it has lost its spring and become mere opportunism. Yesterday, for example, as the campaign entered Its final 72 hours, his Democratic opponent, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, underscoring his charge that Mr. Javits had failed to give “moral leadership,” asserted that the Senator had actively supported President Nixon throughout his political career. Sardonically echoing Mr. Javits's criticism of him, Mr. Clark said that the Senator's failure to speak on the Watergate scandal until after Mr. Nixon left office reflected poorly on his “judgment.” Mr. Javits, meanwhile, taking advantage of sunny skies and buoyed by polls that showed him comfortably ahead in the three‐way contest, genially greeted wellwishers and answered questions during walking tours and street rallies in Brooklyn and Queens. The Protest Symbol The Conservative party candidate, Mrs. Barbara Keating, war widow and mother of five, campaigned in Buffalo and Syracuse and continued to direct her heaviest fire against Mr. Javits, In her view both of her rivals are “ultraliberals,” but the Senator has cozened many Republicans into thinking that, deep down, he is one of them. Mrs. Keating is given no realistic chance of winning, and the two men tend to ignore her. Her major significance in the race, political observers agree, is as a means for conservatives of both parties to express a protest vote that is likely to be more damaging to Mr. Javits than to Mr. Clark. In the contest between the two men, questions of political style, philosophy and fund‐raising methods have tended to overshadow their differences on the issues, which, in many cases, do not appear to be vast. Mr. Clark, who set a limit of $100 a family on contributions in both his primary and general‐election campaigns, repotred yesterday that he had raised a total of $788,073. Of this, he said, $565,767 had come in since the primary. He contrasted his average contribution of $20 with that of more than $500 to Mr. Javits, whose staff reported on Friday total contributions of $984,000 and $20,000 in loans. Once again Mr. Clark took note of the $15,000 contribution that Mr. Javits had accepted from former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and the aditional $23,000 from associates and members of his family. Bad as accepting the contribution was, Mr. Clark says, it is even worse as a symbol of the “old politics”, in which legislators put themselves up for auction to competing special interests. Mr. Javits dismisses the notion that the contribution might sway his vote. Although he has enjoyed Mr. Rockefeller's benefactions in many previous campaigns, Mr. Javits acknowledged that he might have been wiser to reject it this year. Of Mr. Clark, who he says is incapable of believing that anyone but himself is honorably motivated, he warns, “Beware the selfrighteous man.” Since the campaign began, in fact, Mr. Javits, like a Senatoitial Sancho Panza, has been urging his opponent to step into “the real world” and acknowledge that it requires more than moral certitude to transform wishes for human betterment into laws. By way of example, Mr. Javits recalled at a street meeting in Brooklyn last week that his pension reform bill, which was signed into law on Labor Day by President Ford, was seven years in the making and the result of countless compromises, trade‐offs, gentle persuasion and armtwisting. In the unlikely event of Mr. Clark's election, Mr. Javits often says, he would inevitably become, because of his intransigence, one of the handful of Senators whose bills somehow never get out of committee and whose amendments are routinely voted down on the floor. Charges Are Traded Mr. Javits's trouble, Mr. Clark says, is that he is too ready to compromise. “The only way to lead is to lead,” he said one day recently. “You've got to fight for the things you believe in.” He added, “Take wage and price controls. If nobody is willing to fight for them, we'll never have them. Basically, Javits is not a fighter and I am. It's as simple as that.” Criticized by Mr. Javits for having shown “poor judgment” in statement he made during a trip to North Vietnam in 1972, Mr. Clark replies, “I don't see how the truth ever hurts.” After Mr. Javits made thetrip a campaign issue, Mr. Clark called him one of the “Nixon thugs” who tried to keep the American people from learning of the devastation that the B‐52 raids were causing in North Vietnam. When a reporter, a few hours later, showed Mr. Clark a newspaper clipping that quoted Mr. Javits at the time as having described him as “an honorable and patriotic American” who had the right to say what he did, although it might have been wiser to wait until he returned to this country, Mr. Clark shrugged it off. Israel an Issue Both men say they yield to no one in their support of Isreel and execration of the Arab states as aggressors and, lately, as extortionists. Mr. Javits stresses that lie has been demonstrating his concern throughout his long career. He has put Mr. Clark on the defensive by frequently referring to one of the Democrat's position papers that appeared, at least, to advocate the creation of a separate Palestinian state. Mr. Clark says that this interpretation is absurd and defamatory. Mrs. Keating, who says she speaks with the commonsense voice of Middle America, asks how her rivals can on the one hand pledge total support for Israel and on the other urge enormous cuts in the defense budget—$25‐billion in Mr. Clark's case and $10‐billion in Mr. Javits's. As it happens, the views of all three candidates are more or less faithfully reflected in their campaign style and way of life. Mr. Javits, who is 70 years old, has climbed high from humble origins as the son of an immigrant tailor on the Lower East Side. He and his wife, Marion, are often separated by their divergent interests, but when they are together they are fixtures at the right parties, premieres and restaurants here and in Washington. She and their three children, ranging in age from 17 to 25, have made only occasional campaign appearances with the Senator. Mr. Javits, tanned and energetic, drapes his stocky frame in well‐cut suits of sober hue and lustrous haberdashery. He keeps in shape with vigorous games of tennis and long swims in the Senate pool. If his preference for the avoidance of conflict and for practical solutions, good living, a smile and a snoeshine brings to mind Cervantee's earthly squire, it is possible to discern something of the Don Quixote in Mr. Clark. He was born 46 years ago in Texas, and has wandered far since then. If not of noble birth, he is at least an old‐stock American. His father, Tom C. Clark, was President Truman's first Attorney General and in 1949 was appointed to the Supreme Court. The elder Clark retired in 1967 so that President Johnson could appoint Thurgood Marshall as the Court's first black member. Soon after, Ramsey Clark, who had been brought into the Justice Department by President Kennedy, was promoted to Attorney General. Mr. Javits points out that Mr. Clark vigorously prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock and other war resisters, and did not begin to object strongly to the Vietnam conflict in public until after the Johnson Administration left office. He may have been a bit late in having his conscience awakened, Mr. Clark says, but he has more than made up for it since then. Recalls Nixon Attack Recalling that President Nixon made him a symbol of the coddling of criminals and draft evaders, Mr. Clark notes drily that it was Mr. Javits who introduced his successor, John Mitchell, to the Senate Judiciary Committee with glowing words of praise, and who, as late as 1972, was state co‐chairman of the Nixon‐Agnew campaign. Mr. Clark and his wife, Georgia, who often makes campaign appearances with him, and their two children, moved to New York in 1969, buying a condominium in Greenwich Village. Joining a law firm here, Mr. Clark has spent most of his time defending the same sort of people he had formerly prosecuted and speaking and traveling on behalf of victims of injustice, famine and bad Like the Don, Mr. Clark is tall‐6 feet 4—and rangy. His wide‐set eyes often seem focused on the middle distance. He is as unmindful as the Knight of the Woeful Countenance of his clothing — worn and mismatched schmattas that could be viewed as an affront to the city's needle trades and all that Mr. Javits's father stood for. He speaks with a pro nounced Texas twang, and at about a third of the speed of Mr. Javits's modified New Yorkese. Mr. Clark's speech is unadorned and almost uninflected, with pauses so long and frequent that words and phrases sometimes seem to be bobbing alone in an endless ocean of silence. But he can be an effective speaker, particularly addressing black audiences, with whom he can recall the days of the civil‐rights movement in the Kennedy years and the work of social reconstruction that remains. Contrasting Staffs Mr. Javits's campaign staff is small and professional, headed by John Trubin, a former law partner of his, and members of his Senate staff. Some are on leave and others are quite legally continuing to draw their Senate salaries. It is augmented by volunteers around the* state, many of whom have been working on his behalf for a generation. Mr. Clark's staff, on the other hand, is almost entirely amateur. It is headed by Victor Navasky, a former editor of The New York Times Magazine and the author of “Kennedy Justice.” Most of the others are in their early twenties. Their faces glow with Mr. Clark's reflected idealism and the spirit of fair play. While the two big guns boom away at one another, Mrs. Keating keeps up a steady rat‐tat‐tat of criticism that is heard more loudly in the suburbs than it is in Manhattan. If Mr. Javits is Sancho and Mr. Clark the Don, then Mrs. Keating can be viewed as a talent scout for the Inquisition, finding both of her opponents mired in the heresies of high taxes, permissiveness, welfarism, amnesty and legalized abortion. “I think she's more like Joan of Arc,” said Kieran O'Doherty, the vice chairman of the Conservative party, which is running her campaign. “Aside from that, the formula isn't so bad.” Money Woes Hurt An attractive, blond woman of 35 who studied briefly at the American Academy of Dramatic Art after her graduation from high school, Mrs. Keatingb looks more like one of the housewives who gets caught squeezing the Charmin than a hard‐line right‐winger. Nor does she see herself that way. “I'm an honest‐toGod, down‐to‐earth, tax‐paying individual,” she said few days ago. Mrs. Keating's husband, Marine Corps major, was killed in an ambush near Hue in 1968. Since then she has raised their children, the oldest of them 15, in a small, old house in Larehmont, where she was raised and met her husband, on pentions totaling about $900 a month. However, her message has been muted by the party's inability to raise money this year. The total stands at about $60,000, Mr. O'Doherty said. A maximum of another $60,000 has been earmarked by the Right‐to‐Life movement for a series of antiabortion commercials that are Mrs. Keating's only television advertising. Remarkably self‐possessed for a political novice, Mrs. Keating is undismayed by the shoestring operation the party has mounted for her. “I think the voters are interested in me,” she said. “They want to hear what I'm saying and I think there is groundswell of support that may surprise everyone on Election Day.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gallup Poll Finds Voters Back Conservatives on Some Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/04/archives/gallup-poll-finds-voters-back-conservatives-on-some-issues.html,"The strong Democratic tide that is expected in tomorrow's Congressional election does not reflect sweeping support for liberal programs according to the latest Gallup Poll. The survey indicated that a majority of Americans take a liberal position on such issues as limiting Federal spending for health, education and welfare programs, re‐establishing relations with Cuba and gun registration. But they voice strong conservative sentiment on such issues as busing to achieve better racial balance in schools, the death penalty and unconditional amnesty for draft evaders, according to the survey. The issues chosen for the survey were those that seemed to be key areas of voter concern, even though in some House contests the issues were seldom discussed. Thus, the result of many House races may not reflect voter sentiment on the issues selected for the survey. The 1,501 persons of voting age who were interviewed in the month prior to the election at 350 sampling places across the country were asked the following question: “Suppose that on Election Day, Nov. 5, you could vote on key issues as well as candidates. Please tell me how you would vote on each of these 14 propositions.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Burmese Leader Resists Birth Control Programs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/05/archives/burmese-leader-resists-birth-control-programs.html,"RANGOON, Burma, Nov. 1 —Not because of any cultural taboo or ??? opposition, but ??? of the decision of one man, Burma is the only Asian nation offering outright ??? to family planning ??? aimed at population control. That one man is Ne Win, the country's President, who is given to strong and fixed opinions. He believes that Burma need the opposite of population control because she is a neighbor of the two mast populous nations in the world, India and China. There are 30 million Burmese living in an area the size of Texas. The President is said to feel that Burmese security requires that this number be doubled by the end of the century, when India and China are each expected to have a population of more than one billion. Mr. Ne Win has banned the import of contraceptives, prohibited sterilization operations and abortions except in extreme medical need and blocked the promotion of family planning. Once a Major Exporter The view that Burma is underpopulated dates to just before World War II, when the predominantly Buddhist country had by far the world's largest exportable surplus of rice and a population only half what it is now. But since 1962, when Mr. Ne Win, then a general, seized power, the annual rate of population growth has increased from 2.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent. In the same period, food production has increased at less than one‐half of 1 per cent a year, if at all, with a result that the surplus appears to be wholly dissipated. By virtually all independent accounts and observations, the economy is in ruins and joblessness and landlessness have spread alarmingly, but population control remains a subject that no official dares to broach. Much that is forbidden soon shows up in the thriving black market. Condoms, smuggled from Thailand, can be purchased from hawkers on many sidewalks in downtown Rangoon. A number of doctors are known to have smuggled stocks of the intrauterine device known as the loop, which they sell for 25 kyats apiece ($5 at the official rate). It is illegal to import con??? but no law forbids doctors to insert the loop. The going fee is said to be 150 kyats, equivalent to the monthly wage of many an urban worker. As a matter of principle, some doctors perform the service without charge. Some Government doctors have actually persuaded the customs service to turn over to them loops seized from smugglers. After coming to power, the Ne Win Government forced the closing of a small family planning clinic that doctors were operating on a volunteer basis in the Central Women's Hospital here. A private family planning association was also forced out of existence. In 1963, a decree banned sterilization operations unless certified as necessary on strictly medical grounds. Sterilization Boards now sit in Rangoon and four other cities to review applications for the operations. Medical sources say that the boards are generally lenient toward women applying for the tying of fallopian tubes. About 1,500 such operations were performed in Rangoon last year but probably no more than 2,000 in all Burma. Vasectomies — male sterilization—are almost never authorized. The only legal ground on which a man can apply for a vasectomy is that a sterilization operation might endanger the life of his wife, as would the bearing of a child. But for a price (usually 300 kyats, or roughly $60) a vasectony can also be procured illicitly. President Ne Win is said to feel strongly that to allow men to have vasectomies would encourage promiscuity. No one in Burma has argued openly that population control might be desirable. But citing a rise in deaths from illegal abortions performed by unqualified midwives, physicians have been quietly urging the Government to ease its restrictions on contraception and sterilization. More than half the material mortality cases in Rangoon hospitals last year were connected with botched abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Javits Wins a 4th Term, Defeating Ramsey Clark",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/javits-wins-a-4th-term-defeating-ramsey-clark-javits-is-victor-in.html,"Jacob K. Javits won his fourth terin as United States Senator from New York yesterday, overcoming the anti‐Republican disaffection spawned by Watergate and the folksy challenge of Ramsey Clark, a Democrat who shaped his campaign to capitalize on the mood of antipolitics. Mr. Javits, the RepublicanLiberal, shifted the tone of the campaign in the closing days after Mr. Clark had attracted national attention with his $100 ceiling on contributions, by focusing his attack on Mr. Clark's record as Attorney General under President Johnson. The technique worked and last night the Senator squeezed through a crush of people in the Terrace Room of the Roosevelt Hotel to claim victory in what he said had been “a and sometimes difficult campaign.” Mr. Clark, in a rumpled blue suit jacket and the scuffed Hush Puppies that had become some thing of a trademark, told a disheartened crowd of young supporters in the Windsor Ballroom at the Commodore Hotel that his campaign had proved that “it's possible to run effectively without accepting big money.” With 8,342 of 13,757 dis tricts reporting the vote was Javits……… 1,305,426 Clark……… 1,171,529 Mrs. Keating…… 469,413 The Democratic candidate had spent the final days of the campaign on the defensive, ssso that Mr. Javits wal able to campaign as the man of the middle, against Mr. Clark on the left and the Conservative party candidate, Barbara Keating, on the right. Shortly after 10 P.M., Mr. Clark telephoned Mr. Javits to concede the race. At 10:30, the Senator, grinning broadly, adjusted his dark‐rimmed spectacles, glanced toward the cameras and read his brief victory statement. The 70‐year‐old Senator said that he would use the “pyramiding influence” provided by his Senate seniority to help “re‐establish the confidence of our people in their institutions of government.” Mr. Javits, speaking under the glare of television lights, said: “I believe we have the finest structure of government yet devised by man. Whatever our weaknesses, they can be overcome—by ideas, by hard work and by unshakable determination.” It was his second line that seemed to be giving Mr. Javits his victory margin as the numbers mounted. The totals in the first few hours showed that Mr. Clark, on the Democratic line, was running ahead of Mr. Javits on the Republican line, with the Liberal line making the difference. Within the over‐all numbers, according to some analysts, it appeared that Mrs. Keating was harming Mr. Javits far more than Mr. Clark; in predominantly Republican disttricet, her percentage were sharply higher than in Democratic districts. Afterward, he told a group of reporters that people had been “very troubled about the postWatergate situation” hut, he said, New Yorkers “knew my record and like the fact that I'm a lively fellow.” Mr. Clark appeared subdued. “I'd like to leave you with this one thought,” he said soberly to his young audience. “I think that this country needs some new gentleness.” A well‐dressed bearded youth turned to another in the crowd. “Well,” he said bravely, “tomorrow we start on Ramsey Clark for President.” His companion shook his head. “Not me,” he said. A member of the Clark campaign group analyzed the loss for reporters and cited the following factors: ¶The endorsement of Mr. Javits by The New York Times. ¶The publication of tapes that Mr. Clark had broadcast from Hanoi. ¶What the Clark supporters called Mr. Javits's “distortion” of the Clark position on Israel. ¶Mr. Javits's advertising blitz on television in the closing days. The Anti‐Establishment Mr. Clark, a former Attorney General, son of an Attorney General, the offspring of an Establishment family in his native Texas, ran an anti‐Establishment, antipolitics campaign that —in a year characterized by disgust with Watergate—captured public attention. From the candidate's nondescript narrow necktie to the handwritten slagons on the headquarters walls to the earnest bearded youths and longhaired women who ran the campaign there was a sense of left‐over hippy‐ism, a midnineteen‐sixties scene somehow preserved into the 1974 election. Confronting the haphazard Clark effort was the jaded professionalism of the Javits campaign (a musician preparing for a rally pinned a “Javits” button on his lapel and said, sotto voce, to a friend, “Remind me to take this off when we're finished"") and the zealous amateurism the Keating team. Mr. Clark ran far behind the top of the Democratic ticket. For example, in the 15th Election District in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge section, a middleclass Irish‐Catholic area of the 50th Assembly district, Mr. Clark got $87 votes while Hugh L. Carey, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, won 454. In Forest Hills, Queens, the 56th election district, composed mainly of middle‐income jews, gave Mr. Clark 235 votes in the 130th assembly district to Mr. Carey's 586. The Javits‐Clark exchanges turned tart in the closing stages and, on one of the campaign's lighter days, a three‐candidate meeting at a civic club lunch, Mrs. Keating won appreciative laughs when she said she thought the other two ought to “have their mouths washed out with soap.” Mrs. Kedting's television commercials were sponsored by right‐to‐life groups and showed, among other things, ominouslooking trays of surgical instruments. Her statements struck closer to standard Conservative issues—opposition to abortion and school busing, for instance —than the successful Conservative effort two years ago to elect James L. Buckley as Senator. Clark Draws Interest But it was the Clark challenge that attracted attention. The national press, many of them Washington based and all intrigued by the possibility of a successful antipolitics campaign for a Senate seat, came into New York to look at the Clark‐Javits campaign more than at the race for Governor. And Mr. Clark kept it interesting, He began by setting a $100 limit on contributions so that, in the words of one admiring aide, “fund‐raising becomes the campaign becomes fund‐raising becomes……” He appeared at the Democratic designating convention in Niagara Falls not to seek the designation, but to be nominated by Frank Serpicq, the former policeman whose charges of corruption rocked the New York City police, and to be seconded by Herbert X. Blyden, a former Attica inmate who is under indictment for murder. He traveled around the state collecting nominating petitions, and then campaigning, in a white Dodge camper van wearing wrinkled Levis, scuffed Hush Puppies and an air of righteousness that eventually stirred even the seasoned professional, Mr. Javits, to angry retaliation. A Face‐to‐Face Encounter In a three‐candidate debate at The New York Times, the Senator showed up, a sheaf of prepared material in front of him and, after waiting an hour and a half, he spun toward Mr. Clark, seated at his right, waggled his right index finger in Mr. Clark's face and deliv‐ered an angry lecture. “Beware the self‐righteous man,” he said, prophet‐like, at one point. Within a few days, he had dredged up an issue that most politicians had expected would Mr. Clrak—the Democratic candidate's 1972 trip to Hanoi, at the height ‘of United States bombing of North Vietnam, during which Mr. Clark's answers to questions were broadcast by Radio Hanoi. Mr. Javits's justification was that the broadcasts raised doubts about Mr. Clark's “judgment” which, according to Mr. Javits, was cast into doubt again by a position paper this year in which Mr. Clark advocated creation of a Palestinian state. Mr. Clark said that the Javits characterization was an out‐ofcontext exaggeration but to a New York electorate with a sizable Jewish minority, the issue was worrisome, even more than it might normally be, because the Arabs chose the week before election to legitimatize the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Javits Turns Tough In his three previous campaigns for the Senate, Mr. Javits had built a reputation as a formidable, but not particularly ferocious campaigner. Against Mr. Clark, he was rough. Just last Friday, he added to the asserted had “judgment” on foreign affairs the charge that Mr. Clark, as President Johnson's Attorney General, had done things—prosecuted draft resisters, cooperated in secret surveillance of political dissidents, ‘sat silent as the Vietnam war escalated—that he denounced after leaving office. It was an adroit perform ance; the challenger's record, rather than the incumbent's, became the major issue. Mrs. Keating, the third candidate in the race, is thought by Conservative party officials to the a valuable future political property. They think the 35‐year‐Old widow of a marine major killed in Vietnam may enter the Congressional race in her Westchester home in 1976. Senator Jacob K.

RIBICOFF WINNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/ribicoff-winner-ribicoff-winner-sweep-by-democrats-puts-first-woman.html,"HARTFORD, Nov. 5—Unitec States Representative Ella T Grasso was elected Governor of Connecticut today. The 55 year‐old Representative, whc has not lost an election in 22 years of political life, is the first woman to be elected Governor of any state in the Northeast. Mrs. Grasso led a Democratic sweep that regained control of the General Assembly for her party and brushed aside the Republican ticket headed by United States Representative Robert H. Steele as only imodest number of voters turned tout on this rainy day. In the race for United States Senate, Abraham A. Ribicofi won re‐election to his third six‐year term by a resounding margin over his Republican opponent, James H. Brannen 3d, a freshman member of the State Assembly. With 166 of 169 towns reporting, the vote was:,  Concession Statement At 9:30 P.M., 90 minutes after the polls closed, Mr, Steele conceded at a shopping center on the edge of Hartford. “I notice the name of the movie picture playing here to‐night: ‘Juggernaut,’ ” he said. “It's clear that is what was at work across the country today.” Mrs. Grasso made her victory statement at a hotel in Windsor Locks. “I think it's a tribute to the people of our state that on dark and rainy day they said that there is no apathy in the State of Connecticut,” she said. In most places the voting started a little slower than usual after the polling stations opened at 6 A.M. Mrs. Grasso voted just over an hour after the polls opened, at the Union School in Windsor Locks, where she lives. She stopped briefly at St. Mary's Raman Catholic Church to say a prayer before returning home to await the election results. Mr. Steele had been campaigning outside the Hamilton Standard factory in Windsor Locks from before daybreak. He went home to Vernon in the morning to vote in the elementary school, and then drove to Hartford to campaign until the lunch‐time crowds were gone. Previous Governors While Yoting was slow, it was also smoother than usual. There were a few worried telephone calls to the Secretary of the State's office when local constable and a state trooper both found themselves assigned to watch the same polling station in Beacon Falls. The trooper was withdrawn. “If you see two police officers, you begin to wonder what's going, on,” explained Amalia Toro, director of the Elections Division in the Secretary of State's office. Steven Mednick, an executive assistant in the Secretary's office, was assigned temporarily to the state's new Election Commission to help cope with the expected flood of complaints. “This place has been like ghost town,” he said in the late afternoon. The campaign in Connecticut had not been an exciting one, despite its early promise. Mrs. Grasso was the first woman to be nominated for Governor by either major party in Connecticut. It was also unusual in any state. Nellie Ross was elected Governor of Wyoming in 1925, the same year Miriam Ferguson was elected Governor of Texas, but both women went into office more or less on their husbands coattails. However, Mrs. Ferguson was elected again in 1933, after she established political personality of her own. In 1967 the late Lurleen Wallace was elected Governor of Alabama, succeeding her husband in office. At least seven other women in the United States ran for Governor today. Mrs. Grasso, who did not try to capitalize on her sex, had the support of women's groups, stand against abortion. When sex was raised as an issue, as it was with the proposed state constitutional amendment to prohibit discrimination because of a person's sex, Mrs. Grasso handled it in a comfortable and uncompetitive way. “I'm the grandmother of the Equal Rights Amendment,” she said. Mr. Steele made no real effort to capitalize on Mrs. Grasso's sex. “There's a fine line you cant cross,” Mr. Steele said between campaign stops today. “You caret look like you're hitting a lady.” He opened his campaign in April with a promise not to ac, cept any individual contributions of more than $100. It was a real departure for Republican, as most of the big givers seem to lean toward that party. At the Republican State Convention in July, Mr. Steele had to outwork and outmaneuver, the party Establishment to win the nomination. His obvious independence in the party ought to haN helped him break free of the national trend toward the Democrats. But instead of capitalizing on his independence, he concentrated on what he regarded as the lavish promises by Mrs. Grasso of social and educational reforms. He also focused on what he perceived as the worry among voters that the Democrats, if given power, would pass an income tax. In one of the major points in her campaign, Mrs. Grasso acused the three major utilities, the state of overcharging cheir customers by $19‐million fuel‐adjustment costs. She joined a lawsuit to block permanent increases that the Public Utilities Commission had awarded the companies. Mr. Steele called her a demagogue, contending that the real issue was the disparity in oil prices in various parts of the country. For his part, he sued the Federal Energy Administration to force the equalization of prices. Although.Mr. Steele Predicted that Washington would announce the equalization of prices before Election Day, the announcement has not come. Mr. Steele held out hope that the wide support he received for his campaign—he had 9,658 contributors, three times as many as Mrs. Grasso—would be reflected in the vote. By the end of last month he had raised $282,769 and Mrs. Grasso had raised $259,422. Mrs. Grasso counted on her own popularity as reflected in the public opinion polls, on the national trend and on the widening edge Democrats have over Republicans in voter registration. For this election there were 574,238 enrolled Democrats in Connecticut, 420,821 Republicans and 566,531 unaffiliated voters. Ella T.

Elmhurst Director Warns of Cutbacks,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/elmhurst-director-warns-of-cutbacks-programs-affected.html,"Unless the city comes up with at least $2 million by next Monday to finance operations at the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst, Queens, the center will dismiss 21 physicians and 65, nurses and other backup employes, according to its director of medicine. The director, Dr. Stanley G. Seckler, said this would effectively terminate many key medical programs. Dr. Seckler, vice president of the hospital's board until its members resigned their administrative responsibilities Monday to protest budget cuts imposed by the city, said that the dismissal of personnel had been planned for last Friday but that the action had been postponed at the request of the City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which controls budgets for the 19 city hospitals. “But the situation is now chronic and we can't go on promises,” Dr. Seckler said. “If, we don't have new sources of funds by the 11th, the personnel cuts go into effect.” Programs Affected He said that among the key programs that would not be able to function would be abortion, special dental care for children with mental and other medical problems, respiratory intensive care for the elderly, blood bank and cervical cancer detection program for women. Dr. Seckler also said the personnel cut at the 1,000‐bed hospital would mean that during evening hours surgery would be performed without the supervision of senior physicians. The hospital, at 79‐01 Broadway, serves about 750,000 people in northwestern Queens, most of whom are indigent or almost in that category Dr. Seckler said. The hospital's fiscal problems stem from budget cut ordered this year by Mayor Beame for the entire city hospital system. According to the administrator at Elmhurst, Jack Koretsky, the hospital had asked for a 10 per cent increase over its 1973 supply budget because of sharp increases in fuel, food and other supplies, which he said, would cost the hospital $700,000 more this year than last. “Instead, we were ordered to reduce our costs by $624,000,” Mr. Koretsky said, but there just isn't any fat.” He said the hospital began a job freeze last year that was temporarily halted in July but reinstated in August when the city mandated a budget cut of $900,000 whichcovered an affiliation contract with Mount Sinai Hospital. Dr. Seckler, in explaining why the entire 25‐member medical board resigned its administrative duties, said the board felt that the hospital was not getting a fair share of funds from the Health and Hospitals Corporation. He referred to a confidential internal report by the corporation, made public in January, that found that there was no relation between a hospital's productivity and its budget allotment. The study found Elmhurst to be the most underfinanced city, hospital and recommended that its budget be increased by $8.7‐million. The hospital was ranked eighth among the city hospital in terms of productivity. Dr. Seckler said that even though the hospital handled 8.5 per cent of all in‐patient and outpatient care in the city system it received only 7.2 per cent of the budget for city hospitals. He said that the hospital was allowed a reimbursement of $134.45 a day for patient use of faciities while less‐productive hospitals, according to the Hospital Corporation's report, got more than $250 a day. He said that although the members of the medical board were refusing to perform administrative duties, they were performing their medical duties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The New Lieutenant GOvernor.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/the-new-lieutenant-governor-mary-anne-krupsak-other-politicians-in.html,"There may have been people who doubted, as they watched her trying to run an underfinanced state‐primary campaign out of her husband's one‐bedroom apartment this summer, that Mary Anne Krupsak would ever be the Lieutenant Governor of New York State. Woman in the News If so, State Senator Krupsak was not among them. With a self‐confidence that came from years of upset victories and a lifetime spent close to politics, the intense 42‐year‐old legislator predicted that she was going to win and then went on to do so with 42 per cent of the vote in the three‐way primary. In the process, she managed to change the minds of traditional male political leaders who had dismissed her candidacy not only as unlikely but also because she was a woman and a liberal—as a potential liability to the statewide Democratic ticket. By the end of the generalelection campaign, Hugh L. Carey was telling enthusiastic audiences that he was proud‐ to be appearing as “Mary Anne's surrogate,” and there were often more Krupsak buttons than Carey buttons among upstate crowds. Other Politicians in Family Although she benefited from the interest, this year in women in politics, Senator Krupsak, as she herself frequently points out, is no overnight creation of the women's movement. The daughter and granddaughter of successful local politichans in the upstate city of Amsterdam, Mary Anne Krupsak began her political apprenticeship in 1953 when she took a job in public relations with the State Department of Commerce in Albany. She soon became involved in W. Averell Harriman's campaign for the governorship and, after his victory in 1954, joined the Governor's staff as a program associate. In that job, she helped set up what is now the Office of Local Government. Four years later, when Governor Harriman lost his bid for re‐election, Miss Krupsak, went to Washington as administrative assistant to Representative Samuel S. Stratton. Saw Advantage in Law In Washington, she decided that “the only women who are taken seriously in government are lawyers,” so she left the next year to enter the University of Chicago Law School, After graduation, she practiced law briefly, including a stint as executive assistant to Howard J. Samuels when he was vice president of Mobil Chemical. She then returned to Albany as an assistant counsel on the Senate staff. Running for office was the natural next step, and in 1968 Miss Krupsak won a narrow victory as a Demo crat in a heavily Republican Assembly district northwest of Albany. She was re‐elected in 1970 and two years later, when her seat had been redistricted out of existence, she defeated a former Republican county chairman for election to the State Senate. In the Legislature, she earned a reputation as a fiery orator, a skill she attributes in part to her early training as a singer at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music. Her most difficult moment in elective office came four years ago, when she voted in favor of the bill to ease the state's abortion law. A prac ticing Roman Catholic, Senator Krupsak was denounced by Catholic clergymen, in cluding her local Bishop, who arrived on the Capitol steps to say she was “in need of prayer.” Senator Krupsak's husband, Edwin Margolis, is Jewish: they were married in Jerusalem four years ago. Mr. Margolis teaches law at Hunter College and is a counsel to the Assembly Democrats. The couple have a house in Canajoharie, 30 miles west of Albany on the barge canal, in Senator Krupsak's district. They also have an apartment in the Lincoln Towers complex in Manhattan. Senator Krupsak was born in Amsterdam, N. Y., on March 26, 1932. Both her parents are pharmacists, and they have kept the original Polish spelling of the name, Krupczak. Her parents were Polish immigrants, and Senator Krupsak has always identified strongly with PolishAmerican activities. Many Women on Staff “A zloty saved is a zloty earned,” says a sign on a door in her campaign headquarters. Women—a combination of movement activists and old political hands—held almost all the important positions in Senator Krupsak's campaign. She was once regarded as something of a latecomer to the women's movement, and in fact her political career predates the’ movement by so many years that she learned long ago to work comfortably with her male colleagues. Soon after the primary, at a joint appearance, Senator Krupsak was praising Mr. Carey so effusively that one man in the audience exclaimed in a loud stage whisper: “My God, she's fallen in love with him!” It may not: be love, but it has certainly been a mutually beneficial relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Defeat Places Wilson In Unaccustomed Role,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/defeat-places-wilson-in-unaccustomed-role-defeat-unaccepted.html,"In 1958, when they were New York's Republican gubernatorial ticket for the first time, the new politician, Nelson A. Rockefeller, and the veteran of 20 years of legislative infighting and compromise, Malcolm Wilson, toured the state in an unadorned limousine with the seasoned politician driving and talking, and the newcomer riding and listening. At each stop Mr. Rockefeller was in the spotlight and Malcolm Wilson held his coat. But Mr. Rockefeller acknowledged his running mate. “Frankly if it were'nt for Malcolm, I wouldn't be here,” he told audience after audience. “And if I weren't here, Malcolm would be.” The former Governor was only partially correct. He resigned last December and Mr. Wilson, his shadow for almost 15 years, became Governor. But he lacked the public flair of a Rockefeller: and after a grinding, but lackluster, campaign, he finds himself this morning a lame‐duck Governor. All day yesterday and until well after the polls closed, Mr. Wilson refused to believe that his 35 years of personal public service, was over, that 16 consecutive years of Republican state and would end this Dec. 31 and that for the first time in 15 tries he lost an election. He was buoyant as he attended Mass at Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church in Scarsdale yesterday morning and as he voted shortly after, despite his bulging left cheek, the effects of an abscessed tooth that was drawn later in the day. He told some aides with a grin, “I honestly don't believe the polls,” and one remarked, “He's got faith with a capital Defeat Unaccepted The Governor's refusal to accept what virtually every politician in the state and his own staff firmly believed was inevitable was for a time reflected at his Roosevelt Hotel campaign headquarters. But soon the shouting and laughter gave way to the inevitable as the Carey lead On the seventh‐floor headquarters, the floor was littered with discarded Wilson‐Caso shopping bags, crushed Oreo cookies, and telephones pulled from the walls. Wilson Workers stood in the corridors drinking. One of them, 21‐year‐old Bill McCabe said, “It's like a wake in there, but I'm not leaving, not while there's two bottles of Scotch left,” Other workers went over to the Lefkowitz offices on the same floor because they heard there were sandwiches there. Two 14‐year‐olds from Brooklyn sat on the Grand Ballroom dais dividing up bags, buttons and campaign literature that “some lady said we could go ahead and take,” said Jordan Davis. And Mary Ellen Brick, listened to the band in the room playing “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and said, “We didn't get the right Irishman.” Their hired band, led by Greg Raffa, repeatedly played such things as “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and “This Could Be the Start of Something Big” and Mr. Wilson's favorite song, the Fordham University fight song and Mrs. Wilson's favorite, “I Could Have Danced All Night.” Mr. Raffa said the band went on overtime at 11. P.M. and “I'm not sure we'll make any tonight, but we'll be here as long as they want us.” Daughter Called Bitter Few of Mr. Wilson's supporters moved into the Grand Ballroom, where later he was to make his concession speech. Meanwhile, the Governor and his family had a quiet cocktail at the Park Avenue home of his former Welfare Inspector General, George F. Berlinger, where the steadfastly festive mood was broken only by a bitter statement from his daughter, Mrs. Katherine Conroy, according to someone who attended. She said she was angered that “in the year of the Watergate climate, the fact that a man whose integrity was unquestioned, whose legislative work was the best of any Governor, in this climate he loses to the fraud of all frauds, Hugh Carey.” But that was the only evident bitterness of the evening. State Republican Chairman Richard Rosenbaum said, as he looked over the empty ballroom, “I'm delighted to see such a tremendous number of dedicated people here tonight.” And Mrs. Helen Gleason, wearing a Rockefeller button, told anyone who would listen that “Rocky's still No. 1, but I guess I have to be for Wilson.” And Mrs. Bobbie Preiser said she enjoyed the Lindsay party nine years ago “a lot more, because he was winning.” But Malcolm Wilson was not winning and he did not win, and in his wake, and in the wake of the Rockefeller years in Albany, is left such remembrances as the expansion of the State University, the bloodiest prison rebellion in the country's history, building of a monumental mall in Albany, controversial antidrug legislation, and legalization of abortions,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Anti‐Establishment Mr. Clark, a former Attorney General, son of an Attorney General, the offspring of an Establishment family in his native Texas, ran an anti‐Establish ment, antipolitics campaign that —in a year characterized by disgust with Watergate—captured public attention. From the candidate's nondescript narrow necktie to the handwritten slagons on the headquarters walls to the earnest bearded youths and longhaired women who ran the campaign there was a sense of left‐over hippy‐ism, a midnineteen‐sixties scene somehow preserved into the 1974 election. Confronting the haphazard Clark effort was the jaded professionalism of the Javits campaign (a musician preparing for a rally pinned a “Javits” button on his lapel and said, sotto voce, to a friend, “Remind me to take this off when we're finished”) and the zealous amateurism of the Keating team. M. Clark ran far behind the top of the Democratic ticket. For example, in the 15th Election District in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge section, a middleclass Irish‐Catholic area of the 50th Assembly district, Mr.Clark got 287 votes while Hugh L. Carey, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, won 454. In Forest Hills, Queens, the 56th election district, composed mainly of middle‐income Jews, gave Mr. Clark 235 votes in the 30th assembly district to Mr. Carey's 586. The Javits‐Clark exchanges; turned tart in the closing stages and, on one of the campaign's lighter days, a three‐candidate meeting at a civic club lunch, Mrs. Keating won appreciative laughs when she said she thought the other two ought to “have their mouths washed out with soap.” Mrs. Kedting's television commercials were sponsored by right‐to‐life groups and showed, among other things, ominouslooking trays of surgical instruments. Her statements struck closer to standard Conservative issues—opposition to abortion and school busing, for instance —than the successful Conservative effort two years ago to elect James L. Buckley as Sena tor. Clark Draws Interest But it was the Clark challenge that attracted attention. The national press, many of them Washington based and all intrigued by the possibility of a successful antipolitics campaign for a Senate seat, came into New York to look at the Clark‐Javits campaign more than at the race for Governor. And Mr. Clark kept it interesting. He began by setting a $100 limit on contributions so that, in the words of one admiring aide, “fund‐raising becomes the campaign becomes fund‐raising becomes … ” He appeared at the Democratic designating convention in Niagara Falls not to seek the designation, but to be nominated by Frank ??? the former policeman whose charges of corruption rocked the New York City police, and to be seconded by Herbert X. Blyden, a former Attica inmate who is under indictment for murder. He traveled around the state collecting nominating petitions, and then campaigning, in a white Dodge camper van wearing wrinkled Levis, ??? Hush Puppies and an air of righteousness that eventually stirred even the seasoned professional, Mr. Javits, to angry retaliation. A Face‐to‐Face Encounter In a three‐candidate debate at The New York Times, the Senator showed up, a sheaf of prepared material in front of him and, after waiting an hour and a half, he spun toward Mr. Clark, seated at his right, waggled his right index finger in Mr. Clark's face and delivered an angry lecture. “Beware the self‐righteous man,” he said, prophet‐like, at one point. Within a few days, he had dredged up an issue that most politicians had expected would Mr. Clrak—the Democratic candidate's 1972 trip to Hanoi, at the height of United States bombing of North Vietnam, during which Mr. Clark's answers to questions were broadcast by Radio Hanoi. Mr. Javits's justification was that the broadcasts raised doubts about Mr. Clark's “judgment” which, according to Mr. Javits, was cast into doubt again by a position paper this year in which Mr. Clark advocated creation of a Palestinian state. Mr. Clark said that the Javits characterization was an out‐ofcontext exaggeration but to a New York electorate with a sizable Jewish minority, the issue was worrisome, even more than it might normally be, because the Arabs chose the week before election to legitimatize the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Javits Turns Tough In his three previous campaigns for the Senate, Mr. Javits had built a reputation as a formidable, but not particularly ferocious campaigner. Against Mr. Clark, he was rough. Just last Friday, he added to the asserted had “judgment” on foreign affairs the charge that Mr. Clark, as President Johnson's Attorney General, had done things—prosecuted draft resisters, cooperated in secret surveillance of political dissidents, ??? silent as the Vietnam war escalated—that he denounced after leaving office. It was an adroit perform ance; the challenger's record, rather than the incumbent's, became the major issue. Mrs. Keating, the third candidate in the race, is thought by Conservative party officials to he a valuable future political property. They think the 36‐year‐old widow of a marine major killed in Vietnam may enter the Congressional race in her Westchester home in 1976.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shapp and Schweiker Win Contests in Pennsylvania.,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/shapp-and-schweiker-win-contests-in-pennsylvania-for-senator-for.html,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 5—Gov. Milton J. Sliapp, a Democrat, and Senator Richard S. Schweiker, a Republican, won re‐election today by comfortable margins. The Governor, the first to be re‐elected here in a century, defeated Andrew L. Lewis Jr., a Republican. Mr. Schweiker, who was on the Nixon White House “enemies list,” defeated Peter F. Flaherty the Democratic Mayor of Pittsburgh. With 84 per cent of 9,618 precincts reporting, the tally was: FOR SENATOR  FOR GOVERNOR  Neither of the races seemed to whet the public's interest, although all four men waged intensive campaigns. Mr. Lewis, virtually unknown in the state when he began his drive two years ago, focused much of his campaigning on recent scandals within the Shapp administration, promising voters a tough conflict‐of‐interest law and constant vigilance against graft and corruption. The 42‐year‐old Republican, a wealthy businessman from soburban Philadelphia, also accused the 62‐year‐old Governor of fiscal ineptitude and wasteful spending, vowing substantial budget cuts and a decrease in the size of state government. Governor Shapp's campaign was essentially aimed at convincing voters that he had served them well in his first term and, therefore, deserved a second. He responded to his opponent's criticism by conceding that while there had been some improprieties, he had not been personally involved, he had dismissed those who were, and he had emerged unscathed from three days of testimony before a Republican‐dominated state legislative committee. The Senate contest, similarly, seemed almost devoid of issues, with both candidates taking firm stands against inflation, recession, big spending by the Federal Government and abortion on demand. Moreover, both men proposed tax cuts and the reinstitution of capital punishment for certain crimes. Senator Schweiker was endorsed by the political committee of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Mayor Flaherty sought to turn this hiS advantage by contending that he had the support of rank‐and‐file union members.

RIBICOFF WINNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/article-5-no-title-mrs-grasso-wins-connecticut-race-previous.html,"HARTFORD, Nov. 5—United States Representative Ella T. Grasso was elected Governor of Connecticut today. The 55‐year‐old Representative, who has not lost an election in 22 years of political life, is the first woman to be elected Governor of any state in the Northeast. Mrs. Grasso led a Democratic sweep that regained control of the General Assembly for her party and brushed aside the Republican ticket headed by United States Representative Robert H. Steele as only a modest number of voters turned out on this rainy day. In the race for United States Senate, Abraham A. Ribicoff won re‐election to his third six‐year term by a resounding margin over his Republican opponent, James H. Brannen 3d, a freshman member of the State Assembly. With 153 of 169 towns reporting, the vote was:  Concession Statement At 9:30 P.M., 90 minutes after the polls closed, Mr. Steele conceded at a shopping center on the edge of Hartford. “I notice the name of the movie picture playing here tonight: ‘Juggernaut,’” he said. “It's clear that is what was at work across the country today.” Mrs. Grasso made her victory statement at a hotel in Windsor Locks. “I think it's a tribute to the people of our state that on a dark and rainy day they said that there is no apathy in the State of Connecticut,” she said. In most places the voting started a little slower than usual after the polling stations opened at 6 A.M. Mrs. Grasso voted just over an hour after the polls opened, at the Union School in Windsor Locks, where she lives. She stopped briefly at St. Mary's Raman Catholic Church to, say a prayer before returning home to await the election results. Mr. Steele had been campaigning outside the Hamilton Standard factory in Windsor Locks from before daybreak. He went home to Vernon in the morning to vote in the elementary school, and then drove to Hartford to campaign until the lunch‐time crowds were gone. Previous Governors While voting was slow, it was also smoother than usual. There were a few worried telephone calls to the Secretary of the State's office when a local constable and a state trooper both found themselves assigned to watch the same polling station in Beacon Falls. The trooper was withdrawn. “If you see two police officers, you begin to wonder what's going, on,” explained Amalia Toro, director of the Elections Division in the Secretary of^State's office. Steven Mednick, an executive assistant in the Secretary's office, was assigned temporarily to the state's new Election Commission to help cope with the expected flood of complaints. “This place has been like a ghost town,” he said in the late afternoon. The campaign in Connecticut had not been an exciting one, despite its early promise. Mrs. Grasso was the first woman to be nominated for Governor by either major party in Connecticut. It was also unusual in any state. Nellie Ross was elected Governor of Wyoming in 1925, the same year Miriam Ferguson was elected Governor of Texas, but both women went into office more or less on their husbands’ coattails. However, Mrs. Ferguson was elected again in 1933, after she established political personality of her own. In 1967 the late Lurleen Wallace was elected Governor of Alabama, succeeding her husband in office. At least seven other women, in the United States ran for Governor today. Mrs. Grasso, who did not try to capitalize on her sex, had the support of women's groups, stand against abortion. When sex was raised as an issue, as it was with the proposed state constitutional amendment to prohibit discrimination because of a person's sex, Mrs. Grasso handled it in a comfortable and uncompetitive way. “I'm the grandmother of the Equal Rights Amendment,” she said. Mr. Steele made no real effort to capitalize on Mrs. Grasso's sex. “There's a fine line you cant cross,” Mr. Steele said between campaign stops today. “You caret look like you're hitting a lady.” He opened his campaign in April with a promise not to accept any individual contributions of more than $100. It was a real departure for Republican, as most of the big givers seem to lean toward that party. At the Republican State Convention in July, Mr. Steele had to outwork and outmaneuver the party Establishment to win the nomination. His obvious independence in the party ought to have helped him break free of the national trend toward the Democrats. But instead of capitalizing on his independence, he concentrated on what he regarded as the lavish promises by Mrs. Grasso of social and educational reforms. He also focused on what, he perceived as the worry among voters that the Democrats, if given power, would pass an income tax. In one of the major points in her campaign, Mrs. Grasso accused the three major utilities in the state of overcharging their customers by $19‐million in fuel‐adjustment costs. She joined a lawsuit to block permanent increases that the Public Utilities Commission had awarded the companies. Mr. Steele called her a demagogue, contending that the reali issue was the disparity in oil prices in various parts of the country. For his part, he sued the Federal Energy Administration to force the equalization of prices. Although Mr. Steele tredicted that Washington would announce the equalization of prices before Election Day, the’ announcement has not come. Mr. Steele held out hope that the wide support he received for his campaign—he had 9,658 contributors, three times as many as Mrs. Grasso—would be reflected in the vote. By the end of last month he had raised $282,769 and Mrs. Grasso had raised $259,422. Mrs. Grasso counted on her own popularity as reflected in the public opinion polls, on the national trend and on the widening edge Democrats have over Republicans in voter registration. For this election there were 574,238 enrolled Democrats in Connecticut, 420,821 Republicans and 566,531 unaffiliated voters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DOLE EDGES ROY IN KANSAS CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/dole-edges-roy-in-kansas-city-exgop-chairman-holds-senate-seatrace.html,"TOPEKA, Kan., Nov. 5—Senator Robert Dole, a former Republican National Chariman scored a narrow victory today over Representative William R. Roy, a Democrat. In the race for governor, the state attorney general, Lavern H. Miller, a Democrat and Robert F. Bennett, Republican president of the State Senate, were in a tight contest. With 73 per cent of 2,836 precincts reporting, the tally was: FOR SENATOR  FOR GOVERNOR  In the bitterly fought Senate campaign, Senator Dole told Kansas voters they would lose his potential power in Congress unless they returned him to Washington. He would be the ranking Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee in the next session of Congress, he constantly reminded voters. He also hammered away at what he called Mr. Roy's liberalism, and linked the doctor to pro‐abortion views and to what he termed the efforts of “leftwing” labor to “gain another Senator.” Representative Roy pointed to Senator Dole's relationship with former President Richard M. Nixon and attacked the Senator's Congressional record, saying it was out of step with the views of most Kansans, a charge that Mr. Dole also made against his opponent. Further, Dr. Roy accused the Senator of paying more attention to national affairs and personal ambitions than to the problems of Kansas. Each side accuses the other of mud‐slinging. Despite the bitterness, the two candidates appeared on the same platform numerous times and held several debates. On Sept. 25, polls by Kansas television stations and a private research organization gave Dr. Roy a 50 per cent to 42 per cent lead in the race. Admittedly shaken by those findings, Senafor Dole left Washington immediately and spent the entire month of October campaigning across the state. Mr. Dole served as Republican National Chairman for two years and was a stanch defender of the former President. Because of Republican discontent with the Watergate scandal and worsening economic conditions, his political base was weakened. According to Senator Dole, President Ford's pardon of Mr. Nixon, the amnesty program and modification of the grain deal with Russia did not help his campaign. However, aides to the Senator believe that a trip to Kansas this past weekend by President Ford “probably helped.” Some Kavans believe the political alignment in the election would have been completely different had not the administration of Gov. Robert C. Docking been rocked by scandals. The popular Democrat was expected to challenge Senator Dole, and was considered a formidable contender. However, Governor Docking refused to run after an aide and his brother were charged in connection with kickback schemes. In the governorship race, Mr. Miller was the favorite, but the effective campaigning by Mr. Bennett closed the gap. Mr. Miller, a former sheriff, was regarded as a good lawman. Mr. Bennett is considered an expert in state government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
State Changes Due,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/06/archives/article-6-no-title-carey-triumph-time-for-state-and-party-changes-a.html,"Representative Hugh L Carey's victory will have farreaching ramifications in the government and politics of a state that has been dominated by Nelson A, Rockefeller and the Republican party for nearly a generation. Governmentally, there will be vast changes in state office personnel. There will be some new proposals hut, because of the poor economy, undoubtedly less than promised. There will be the same struggle to keep the state budget under control There will probably be new taxes, but they will fall more heavily on business and high income New Yorkers. Politically the faction‐ridder Democratic party will be unifled and prosper under a Governor who is thoroughly familiar with Democratic clubhouse and knows how to wield political power. In national politics, Mr. Carey's victory in the nation's second‐largest state makes him ??? instant Vice‐Presidential candidate and, some politicians say even a dark‐horse Presidentia possibility. In addition, the New York Democratic party will now ??? able to play a major role in the national party, a role it has no had since the death of Senato Robert F. Kennedy six years dent‐designate Nelson A. Rockefeller will not have a unified, prosperous New York Republican party supporting his national aspirations. These are the assessments of politicians who know Mr. Carey and generally agree that beneath the quick smile and the equally quick blarney lies a hard‐nosed politician, who, like Mr. Rockefeller—with whom he got along so well—is more the pragmatist that the ideologist. A New Deal Liberal Mr. Carey's brand of liberalism is the bread‐and‐butter, New Deal, pro‐labor liberalism of John F. Kennedy, Hubert H. Humphrey and Robert F. Wagner rather than the issue oriented liberalism of George McGovern, Eugene McCarthy or Ramsey Clark. As a result, he is more likely to be concerned about the minimum wage and revenue sharing than amnesty or abortion. The politician he speaks most of is Robert F. Kennedy, but Many observers of Mr. Carey see only a wisp of the zeal and intensity that characterized the late Senator. Mr. Carey, who became the front‐runner the day he defeated Howard J. Samuels the Democratic gubernatorial primary, decided not to strew the landscape with pledges of specific programs. But he has made enough promises and left enough clues in hundreds of speeches to provide at least the outlines of a Carey administration program. Specific Pledges Cited Among the specific pledges —many with action promised for the first 100 days of his administration—is legislation to provide for appointing rather than electing judges. This is a move that will almost certainly involve a struggle with the patronage‐starved Democratic organization. Screening and thorough investigations of prospective judges is another pledge. Also promised is the repeal of the controversial rent‐control law, although there have been no specifics about an alternative; the partial public financing of political campaigns through a state income‐tax checkoff; full financial disclosure by all state officials in the over ‐$30,000 ‐ a ‐ year salary bracket; the elimination of “noshow” jobs, and the curtailment of the many state commissions where, it has been charged, three men do the work of one. Yet some of Mr. Carey's devoted supporters hold such jobs on bipartisan commissions. One is Berpnard Bloom, a Brooklyn district leader and a “seldomshow” $26,735 director of servicemen's voting. The moratorium on pension improvements for civil servants —most notably Victor L. Gotbaum's State County and Municipal Employes Union —will ill almost certainly be ended as the price of strong support for Mr. Carey by many Civil Service unions. Some of these pledges can be redeemed almost by the stoke of a pen by the new Governor, but others will require legislation, which, in turn, will provide early tests of Mr. Carey's reputed ability as a legislator and, compromiser in Washington. Big Spending Unlikely In other areas, Mr. Carey has been less specific but has still indicated his thinking. On narcotics, for example, he has said he favors the decriminalization of marijuana — treating it as a health problem rather than as a criminal problem. He also has advocated drug‐free therapy programs rather than methadone maintenance. On fiscal matters, he obviously leans to the traditional Democratic tax philosophy of soak the rich and big business. Governor Wilson tagged Mr. Carey a “liberal big spender,” but the Governor‐elect is not likely to start expensive new programs that will require broad‐based taxes. Mr. Carey, a member of the inner circle of the House of Representatives, will look to Washington for more money, and presumably knows how to go about it. But with a conservative Republican President, it is questionable whether Mr. Carey's Washington connections will produce anything more than “old boy” pats on the back. More state money for New York City seems to be equally doubtful, despite Mr. Carey's association with Brooklyn, his long‐time acquaintance with Mayor Beame and his liberalism. It is questionable, too, whether Mr. Carey, with a depleitled treasury of his own, will be able to give the Mayor ore than a sympathetic ear. Again Mr.Carey is likely to look to Washington to bail out the city. The Governor‐elect, unlike the last Democratic Governor, W. Averell Harriman, is likely to control the state Democratic party tightly. Mr. Harriman, to his eventual regret left the politics to Carmine G. Sapio. Key Carey Backers The closest thing, to a De Sapio in the new administration is likely to be Mr. De Sapio's conquerer, former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who has been the top political adviser to Mr. Carey and who has already been scouting talent for the Carey administration. As a result, the “talent” is likely to be liberal, and ostensibly nonpolitical, at least in the highly visible posts. The Democratic organization will likely be pacified with lower, less‐visible jobs, Mr. Wagner's eventual reward for his jump aboard the Carey bandwagon, when it looked more like a horse and buggy, could be the Governor's support for a Senate bid in 1976 against incumbent lames L. Buckley. Another former Mayor and Senate possibility, John V. Lindsay, came aboard late and was all but ignored in the Carey campaign. Other New York politicians with Carey “chits” because they were early believers include Borough President Donald R. Manes of Queens, who is also the new Queens Democratic leader; Mayor Erastus Corning 2d of Albany and his political mentor, Dan O'Connell; Dominic Baranello and Patrick Cunningham, the Suffolk County and Bronx Democratic leaders, and Harold L. Fisher, the influential Brooklyn lawyer and member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who was an early adviser to Mr. Carey and backed up his advice with more than $50,000 in contributions. Other major Democratic leaders, including Stare Chairman Joseph F. Crangle and Mr. Carey's home county leader, Meade H. Esposito, were late‐comers to the Carey cause. Mr. Crangle has tried to make amends by personally guaranteeing a $50,000 loan to the Carey campaign. In reality, Governor‐elect is likely to act as the Democratic state chairman. As leader of the Democratic party in the nation's second most‐popeloos state, he will thus have a major voice in the selection of the Democratic national ticket in 1976 and could well be on that ticket himself. He could be particularly appealing, not only because of the state's huge electoral vote but also because he is a Roman Catholic, an Easterner and a non‐Senator at a time when the Presidential competition is largely Protestant, non‐Eastern and froth the Senate. The new Governor has obviously come a long way since last January, when he unofficially began his gubernatorial campaign with a trip to Binghamton. At the time he was so obscure that he had to introduce himself with the repeated line, “Hello,” I'm Hugh Carey.” FRANK LYNN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parched State Democrats Enter A Promised Land of Patronage,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/07/archives/parched-state-democrats-enter-a-promised-land-of-patronage-a.html,"In the waning days of his campaign, Governor Wilson could always get a laugh from partisan Republican audiences when he quoted to them a phrase he attributed to Joseph F. Crangle, the state Democratic chairman. “Joe Crangie says the Democrats have been wandering in the desert these past 16 years and are now about to reach the promised land,” the Governor would say. “Well, let me tell you, he doesn't mean the Promised Land promised to Moses in Chapter 33 of Exodus. No, he means all those guys who've been waiting all this time for jobs on the state payroll.” Now the Democrats have arrived, and they will probably find that the promised land is not quite as fertile as it looked from the desert. The jobs are there, certainly, ranging from several dozen $47,800‐a‐year commissionerships down to “no shows” that pay a few hundred dollars a year while protecting the job holder's state pension rights. A Shrinking Patronage But the jobs do not appear to exist in anything like the numbers that Governor‐elect Hugh L. Carey would pull out of the air during the campaign to score a debating point. The figure he often cited as being at the disposal of the Governor was 8000 jobs. Knowledgeable Democrats, for whom the word “patronage” is not an expletive but a part of their working vocabulary, think the real figure is considerably Itss. These politicians are also inclined to regard with less than total seriousness Mr. Carey's campaign promise to sweep the so‐called “no show” jobs from the state payroll. According to the State Department of Civil Service, 1,507 of the 192,032 jobs on the state payroll are exempt from Civil Service. These include 160 jobs within the executive branch itself, including seven jobs that pay more than $40,000 a year for such appointees as the counsel and the secretary to the Governor, the Budget Director, the press secretary and executive and special assistants. Also within the Governor's own office are such relatively invisible, but high‐paying, jobs as director of the state's Washington office, $37,453 a year; director of the women's unit, $33,557; the appointments officer, $39,217; the proclamation officer, $29,540, and the Governor's official stenographer, $30,595. Each executive department, in addition to its commissioner, contains a number of exempt executive positions. The Department of Labor provides a good illustration. Seventeen of its top officials are in the exempt, appointive category, ranging from the Industrial Comissioner, who receives $47,800 a year, plus $3,000 in lieu of expenses, to two deputy commissioners at $38,533 each and nine assistant commissioners in charge of district offices around the state, whose salaries vary from $23,900 to $27,284. Democrats on Prowl Good politics has required the Democrats to be extremely circumspect about their job hunting, even after their party's victory seemed virtually assured. But they have been hunting nonetheless. One Republican state official said the other day that an old Democratic friend had come to him for help in preparing a resume. I gather he wanted a long‐term job in which people would not know whether he was alive or dead,” the official recounted with some amusement. Patronage, however, is not a simple game, Mr. Carey will not be able to touch all the jobs in the exempt category even if he is so inclined. For example, in the most recent superstructure of expensive jobs created in Albany—the Racing and Wagering Board that Governor Wilson, in a candid moment soon after taking office, termed “an abortion”—only one of a large number of highly paid officials serves at the pleasure of the Governor. This official is the chairman, now Bertram D. Sarafan, a long‐time Republican trouble shooter, who receives $55,000 a year. The chairnan, in turn, can remove one other official, the Commissioner of Wagering Systems. This $46,816‐a‐year job is now held by Ronald Maiorana, a press secretary to former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, But the board's other top officials all have protected terms of office, running in some cases until the end of the decade. These include Mr. Sarafan's two colleagues on the hoard, Joseph H. Boyd, trusted aide to former Governor Rockefeller, and Eugene J. Keogh, a former Democratic Representative, each of whom receives $42,500. The others who have longterm appointments are members of the five three‐member commissions that were technically superseded by the new Racing and Wagering Board but that were kept in existence to offer “assistance and advice.” These are the State Racing Commission, the Harness Racing Commission, the Quarter‐Horse Racing Commission, the Lottery Commission and the Offtrack Betting Commission. Some Valuable Holdovers Each of these commissions has a $35,440‐a‐year commissioner, plus two other $100‐a‐day slots. All of these jobs are beyond Mr. Carey's reach, unless he wants to go on the public‐relations warpath and demand resignations. But the Governor‐elect, a practical politician, has never said that he would demand a wholesale housecleaning. He has, in fact, said kind words about some Republican officeholders, including Raymond Schuler, the Commissioner of Transportation, and James Biggane, head of the Department of Environmental Conservation. Some Democrats expect Mr. Carey to keep some Wilson staff members whose extensive knowledge of the budget process and its politics makes them prized possessions. Among those mentioned in this category are Howard (Red) Miller, a deputy budget director who is himself a Democratic holdover from the administration of Gov. W. Averell Harriman, and Richard C. Marron, a deputy secretary to Governor Wilson. In some cases, although, the Governor cannot dismiss an officeholder, he can demote him. Several appointees now also hold high Civil Service grades, to which they would automatically drop back if they lost their commissionerships. Alfred E. Kahn, the sometimes controversial new chairman of the Public Service Commission, has a protected six‐year term as commissioner, but the Governor could designate another commissioner to serve as chairman of the agency. Similarly Governor‐elect Carey could remove Laurance S. Rockefeller, a brother of the former Governor's, from the State Council of Parks and Recreation by stripping him of the presidency of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, although Mr. Rockeller would still be a member of that commission. Alexander Aldrich, a Rockefeller cousin who serves as Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, is expected to be replaced. G.O.P. Security Cited Republicans who have spent their careers and, in some cases, almost all their adult lives in Albany during the Rockefeller regime need not feel completely bereft. The State University system and the various state authorities are, in large measure, insulated from the Governor's control. The university and the authorities were born or underwent their greatest expansion during the Rockefeller years, and Republican officeholders have many friends in power there. Just last week, for example, the Republican‐dominated Thruway Authority adopted a resolution pointedly reasserting its power to make appointments to exempt positions. The authority technically had that power already but traditionally had served as a rubber stamp on appointments handed down by the Governor's office. Some politicians, surveying the hordes of patronagestarved Democrats and looking skeptically at Mr. Carey's pledge to abolish all “no show” jobs, some of which pay handsomely while requiring minimal attention, are saying: “Carey's real problem will he not in ending patronage, but that there's not enough to go around.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Idleness a Burden Now For Villagers in Cyprus,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/08/archives/idleness-a-burden-now-for-villagers-in-cyprus-in-a-very-bad-way.html,"BELLAPAIS, Cyprus, Nov. 3 —There is a lovely old tree in the town square here called the Tree of Idleness. The villagers used to boast that they were the laziest in Cyprus, preferring the shade of their tree to the heat of the Mediterranean sun. The boast has turned sour. When Turkish troops invaded Cyprus last July, Bellapais and dozens of other Greek Cypriote villages were trapped behind enemy lines. Many people escaped, but some remained, prisoners in a war they did not want or understand. Now idleness is the curse of Bellapais. A man named Ioannis, who had worked for the Government, put it this way: “Morale is very low, we sit here all day and do nothing. Not even the coffee shops are open. They do not have any coffee or sugar or any gas to heat the stove. Besides, nobody has enough money to buy a coffee.” Bellapais, only a few miles from Kyrenia, the main city in the Turkish‐controlled sector, is much better off than other ethnic Greek villages in more remote areas. The United Nations force is urging the Turkish authorities to give it more access, though its movements remain severely restricted. ‘In a Very Bad Way’ “Many of the Greeks are older people, and they don't make a viable community,” a United Nations spokesman said. “Certain pockets of them are in a very bad way, living below the subsistence level.” The Turkish Army is so strict that before the United Nations force can move an ill person, he must be examined by a doctor and certified as an emergency case. The United Nations also has reports that Greek women caught behind the lines are being forced into prostitution for the soldiers. Last week, it is said, 30 from one village required abortions after their release by the Turks. About 1,000 people are trapped here in Bellapais, half from the village and the rest from surrounding towns. Most of the time they are not allowed to leave. Once or twice busloads of refugees were taken home to salvage a few things, and some found Turkish Cypriotes living in their houses. Recently people, were permitted to pick olives in the surrounding hills, but they have no way to market the crop. The biggest problem is money. Some villagers had small savings tucked under their mattresses, but those are running out. A few civil servants still receive their salaries by devious means, and several women are employed as maids by foreigners in a nearby community. The small grocery store has run out of meat, milk, vegetables, matches, and aspirin. Most villagers, unable to afford the potatoes, onions and flour still on sale, have to depend on the Red Cross. Quarrels Over Bread Recently the weekly Red Cross delivery was already two days late and half the villagers seemed to be waiting around for the truck. They had rationed their bread for a week, but now most of it was gone too, and several fights had broken out over what was left. Describing the debilitating existence, a British woman in a nearby village said: “They're sitting on their backsides doing nothing. They want to get going, but there's nothing much they can do. They're like ex‐prisoners who can't fend for themselves. They become despondent and want things done for them.” The villagers agree. “We can't go on living off other people like this,” Mr. Ioannis said. For most the future looks bleak. “Most of us are waiting to go back to our homes and jobs,” he said. “But what tomes and what jobs? There's no more building in the area, the gardens have dried up, the cultivation and irrigation equipment is gone. One man saw his tractor, and it had been stripped clean.” As he talked a Turkish Army truck pulled up with four squealing pigs. As Moslems the soldiers do not eat pork and were donating the animals to the village. Everyone crowded around as they were transferred to another truck and carted off for slaughter. Then the excitement was over and the people went back to their chairs under the Tree of Idleness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coroner's Jury Clears Doctor Of Negligence in Abortion Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/08/archives/coroners-jury-clears-doctor-of-negligence-in-abortion-case.html,"PITTSBURGH, Nov. 7 (AP) —A coroner's jury today exonerated a doctor of allegations that a baby was allowed to die on a hospital table after surviving an abortion. The jury found that the baby was stillborn, and that there was no criminal negligence by Dr. Leonard Laufe, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Western Pennsylvania Hospital, where the abortion was performed March 19. District Attorney John Hickton had asked the coroner's jury to hold Dr. Laufe for grand jury action on homicide charges. After seven days of testimony and one hour of deliberations, the Allegheny County jury ruled that since the child was stillborn, there was, no homicide. Dr. Laufe had testified that the baby was stillborn, disputing the testimony of others that there had been signs of life. “I checked the umbilical cord and found no pulsation; I knew that I had a stillborn fetus,” Dr. Laufe said. His attorney, James McLaughlin, said in summation that the testimony against Dr. Laufe had come from a staff nurse he characterized as unreliable and a noted obstetrician he said was not credible because of his stanch antiabortion stand. Mr. Hickton, in his final remarks, said that the evidence pointed to a live birth. The inquest was called after reports were published that hospital staff members, including Dr. Laufe, had not tried to keep the baby alive. But Dr. Peter Safer, an antisthesiologist, testified that the procedures conducted in the abortion would have irreparably damaged the child's brain, and it would have been ethically wrong to revive it on the table. He said that at best the child would have lived only a few days or weeks. The abortion, performed in the eighth month of pregnany along with a vaginal hystereotomy, had been granted on the ground of mental distress after the woman said that she had been raped. However, at the hearing, a deposition from the woman, identified only as a 27‐year‐old mother of four from Erie, indicated that she had lied about her mental state and the date her last menstruation to ohtain the abortion. In his testimony, Dr. Laufe conceded that he should have recorded the gestation period as 29 weeks instead of 20,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Number one tells how Lieut. Charles Wyndham, while commanding an Indian Army outpost on the Afghanistan border, manages to get himself cashiered for armed robbery and murder. It isn't easy. Two depicts prison life on the Andaman Islands, where Wyndham is sent after conviction. And from which he escapes in an outrigger canoe after such complications as you wouldn't believe. Three deals with his new identity, or two new identities. One as a probationary foreman in the Kola gold fields. And the other as a dacoit, or bandit, in cahoots with indigenous hoods who have practiced their art for centuries.

By Berkely Mather. 376 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $7.95. Amo By Alice Denham. 244 pp. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan. $7.95. Amo Coove is a young woman on her own in New York, trying to make her way as a novelist and short story writer. In her imagination, she is from the planet Maruvia, a nicer place than Earth, with which she communicates by “Wrist Radar.” In reality, she works as a nude model in a storefront studio, as “a way to support her writing.” In her heart she longs for love as well as art. But nobody on Maruvia has advised Amo that posing in a pornographic life class will introduce her only to psychological cripples. Maybe this is because she is listening to a visual medium. (Even Dick Tracy is smart enough to have a wrist radio). O.K. So Amo is fated to hang out with freaks who try to strangle her or beat her up or tie her up or vent their aggressions. Amo calls this male component “The Gobbling Deficiency” and makes it the title of her novel in progress. The Gobbler supreme is a psychiatrist who rewards Arno's trust by improvising a nearly fatal abortion. But there are plenty or close runners‐up. Like the publisher of a magazine that features naked girls in its centerfold, who doublecrosses Amo by not publishing her short story, just her picture. From her experience as an Earthwoman, Amo concludes that all men are Gobblers, and gives this feeling a global projection. (“In Boston, men rape girl hitchhikers. Yesterday in New York a man threw two women out a hotel window. Vietnam, the Middle East, there's always a war. If war solves nothing, why do men keep fighting?”) The spirit of the novel is effervescent, however simplistic its ideology. Reflections on A Mountain Summer By Joanna M. Glass. 307 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $6.95. It's a story as old as Lady Chatterley. Rich, sex starved matron finds ecstasy in the arms of a hairy type who is close to the soil. Laura Rutherford is 40, burdened with a sense of inferiority, but buoyed up by an independent fortune in old timber money. Her husband Jimmie is an effete character purchased by the family zillions. In 1932, when their only son Jay is 14, they take possession of a summer lodge on a hillside in Alberta. Enter Wenceslaus (“Winger”) Burns, ex‐farmhand, ex‐stevedore, day laborer and night laborer even more. Exit Jimmy Rutherford back to Grosse Pointe. When Laura finds that Winger refuses to be a clandestine lover, she throws out her husband and installs the handyman in his@place. But Winger, it turns out, has a very short attention span, and leaves the Rutherfords abruptly, just as Laura is tooling up a divorce and Jay is anticipating a virile new dad, It takes forever for Jay to get the thing out of his system. And Laura is in and out of a sanitarium before she eventually switches from being a madwoman to a mere eccentric. Joanna M. Glass chooses to tell her story from the viewpoint of young Jay Rutherford, who grows to manhood blighted by his pubescent experience. If Mrs. Glass intends to depict Jay as a fussy, lackluster man, she succeeds too well. Jay is a bore who is tedious to the point of tears. There is more rhetoric than encounter in his reflections. The Exploiters By Samuel Edwards. 369 pp. New York: Praeger Publishers. $8.95. This one is tricked out with topical stuff about the oil shortage and unrest in the Middle East. But deep inside is machinery that has been clanking away since the dawn of the pulps. Will the naked girl secret agent be able to outrun a diving falcon, as the mad sheik watches? Will she and her soldier‐of‐fortune accomplice be able to escape from the sheikdom after a perilous political assassination? Plenty of disguises may be necessary to make one's way from the bazaar to the oasis to yet another secret identity. Samuel Edwards shows how the best laid plans to expropriate and to subvert can go dramatically awry. Only the profits of the big “American‐Arabian Petroleum Co.” keep rolling on—which lends a needed touch of realism. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Soviet, Ingenuity Is Needed to Find an Apartment",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/11/archives/in-soviet-ingenuity-is-needed-to-find-an-apartment.html,"MOSCOW, Nov. 10—Just off Prospekt Mira in one of the older sections of Moscow, people gather on gray fall afternoons near the Rzhevsky bathhouse, milling around for hours like pickets outside a factory on strike. On Sundays, hundreds of people, hands thrust into their pockets and scarves wound tightly against the cold, carry placards around their necks or hand‐scrawled signs pinned to their sturdy cloth coats. Occasionally, they pause to converse quietly in twos and threes and then walk on. But these are not Soviet strikers, they are walking want ads Muscovites advertising apartments for exchange, eager to improve their living quarters. A modish young couple offers an attractive “split” —the exchange of a four‐room apartment, large by Soviet standards, for two smaller ones be cause the newlyweds want to escape living with in‐laws and are eager for a place of their own. An elderly woman tries to coax a man in a dark fedora to take single rooms in two different communal apartments in return for his separate one‐room flat with kitchen, bath and phone. At the far end of the lane, students and officers swarm around a few landlords offering a room, a bed, or a small apartment for rent. Some students turn up their noses at a two‐room unit in an old building with gas heat but no indoor plumbing. But a middle‐aged woman and a married couple, less fussy, compete for it. In minutes, the apartment is gone for fifty rubles ($66.50) monthly, paid a year in advance. The housing exchange and 29 other exchanges in Moscow plus many more in cities across this land of 250 million people, are reminders that despite tremendous gains in housing construction in recent years, adequate accommodation remains a central and acute problem for millions of Soviet citizens, far more essential than the fuss of a tiny minority over getting a car. Paradoxically, housing is a realm of both triumph and of tragedy for the Soviet leadership. The achievements have been staggering. Since 1956, roughly 42 million new units of housing have been built by the state, private and cooperative builders — more than any other country of the world, according to Henry W. Morton, a housirg expert at Queens College in New York. In the 1971–75 Five‐Year Plan, Finance Minister Vasily F. Garbuzoy said last year, the state is allocating 35 billion rubles ($48‐billion) for housing construction. This year alone, he forecast, more than 11,000,000 people will improve their quarters. More than half are supposed to get new dwellings. Rows of Buildings Impressive The visible impact of the Soviet housing program is striking to foreigners returning after a decade of absence. They are impressed by the rows of prefabricated 9‐story, 11‐story and 14 — story apartment houses nominating the outskirts of Moscow and other Soviet cities. Almost anywhere the traveler goes he encounters scholars, engineers and workmen boasting of new apartments, however modest by Western standards, that have provided the key to a new standard of living for their families—a break from the cramped conditions of the late nineteen‐fifties or early nineteen‐sixties when they were jammed into communal flats sharing kitchen, bath and toilet with other families. Yet so massive and aching is the Soviet housing problem that Gertrude Schroeder, an American economist who specializes in Soviet affairs, wrote earlier this year that this country remained “the most poorly housed of any major country in Europe — and poorly housed also by comparison with the [Soviet] Government's minimum standard for health and decency.” The Soviet “sanitary housing norm” was set back in 1920 by the Russian Government. It decided that nine square meters of living snare to a person—equal to 10 feet by 10 feet—was the minimum target. And yet, more than half a century later, Mr. Morton wrote in a new study, the great majority of Soviet petiole in urban arers have not reached the 1920 minimum level.” Many in Communal Housing By Soviet accounts, somewhat over 25 per cent of urban iwellers still live in communal tpartments and some Western cholars suspect that a third or nore of this country's city iwellers still live conuriunally. In 1972, the last year for which figures are available, the rational average was about 7.6 iquare meters of living space per person in Soviet urban treas—roughly half the averige in Western Europe and one third that in the United States. But the problem is more hunan than statistical, as a number of Soviet writers have shown. Yuri Trifonov, a well mown fiction writer, published story, “Exchange,” in which a son and daughter‐in‐law callously played on the housing space of a dying mother to exand their quarters before she died and Her flat reverted to the State. Playwrights have portrayed families crumbling into divorce —and still forced to live in the same room after divorce—for lack of alternative housing, or have shown frustrated young people unable to marry because they cannot get, an apartment and their parents have no room to spare. Individuals tell of cases of people marrying to get better apartments or to, be registered as residents in a favored city like Moscow. One couple from out of town divorced married persons who lived in Moscow, later divorced them and remarried once they had obtained their Moscow housing—a process that took several years, a Moscow intellectual reported. Russian demographers, concerned by the falling birthrate among ethnic Russians, in contrast with other Soviet nationalities, put part of the fault on tight housing space and inadequate room to raise more than one child in a family. Komsomolskaya Pravda, the youth paper, carried an article, in February, 1973, reporting on extensive research that families in the industrial town of Vyshny Volochek were forced to keep families small end some women preferred abortions beCause they lacked space for children. When they get an apartment, many have reached the age of 30 and feel it is too late to, have children. Several Soviet publications have attributed high labor turnaver in Soviet industry to the failure of enterprises or construction projects to provide housing. The housing situation differs markedly from city to city and factory to faetory. A series of articles by the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta in late 1972, comparing heavy industrial plants and consumer goods factories in a‐ dozen cities showed that workers in the heavy‐industry factories consistently received more housing than those in the consumer sector. Professor Morton of Queens College developed a series of comparisons from Soviet statistics that showed not only that Moscow was favored far above all other Soviet cities in housing investments but also that the average housing space per person in the “European” group of cities like Moscow, Kiev, Riga. Tallinn, Vilnius and Minsk was a third more than in the Central Asian group including Tashkent, Baku Yerevan, Alma Ata, Frunze, Dushanbe and Ashkhabad. The main reason for the continuing squeeze, in spite of the construction program under Nikita S. Khruschev and Leonid I. Brezhnev, is the appalling legacy of the Stalin period when housing got very low priority. Much housing was destroyed in World War II. Population Increasingi Too Moreover, much effort has gone into merely keeping up with population growth and migration. While 42 million new housing units have been built since 1956, the population has increased by 42 million. Millions have moved into cities from the countryside, multiplying pressures on urban housing. Demand for housing Also remains heavy because Soviet rents, heavily subsidized by the Government, are very low. A modest two‐room apartment will en for 6 to 8 rubles ($8 to $11.30) a month, including some utilities. A four‐room apartment wil rent for 14 to 16 rubles ($18.20 to $22.30). Apartments in more modern buildings cost more because of additional services. The result is that despite impressive statistics on housing construction, the backlog of applications for new apartments is tremendous. A five‐to‐seven year wait is still not considered uncommon. “It takes two to three years at one of the best factories around Moscow, which has a very; substantial housing program for its Workers,” a, young worker said. “It is worse in other places. Not surprisingly the Soviet press occasionally reports cases of bribery and “hard‐core profiteering” by hoilsing officials. In September, Pravda the Communist‐ party daily, reported that. A. A. Konstantinov, chairman of the housing committee in the Frunze District of Moscow, had‐taken 17 bribes totaling 2,517 rubles ($3,498) in a short period, and that several of his aides had been discovered taking thousands more in bribes. Another problem cited last year by Pravda is line‐jumping and influence — peddling by people in public posts, athletes, entertainers and various minor authorities. Too often the decisive factor is not the waiting list,” Pravda remarked in February, 1973, “but a sudden telephone call. At one place, they suddenly give apartments to families of prospective’ football players and the whole queue is forced back. At another, they decide to award apartments to ‘activists’ working on a so‐called altruistic basis, and the line is pushed back again. In some cases, apartment hunters are encouraged either to take temporary jobs in housing offices or actually to participate in the construction of new apartment buildings. In one case an engineer‐physicist reported having quit his regular job for a year and a half to help build a new apartment building outside Moscow to escape the communal apartment where his family of three was sharing a nine‐room apartment with 54 other people. Eventually, the family got their two‐room apartment with a modest kitchen, bath and toilet. But they found the new housing area largely bereft of stores and convenient public transportation. A daily commute to old jobs near the city center took nearly two hours each way. Because of such inconveniences, the family gave up after a couple of years and moved back to their old communal apartment near the center. By then the number of people in the communal apartment was down to roughly half the former number. Complaints about the quality of Soviet construction are common in the press. Two years ago, Pravda carried a bitter article from the Armenian capital of Yerevan camplaining that construction agencies were in such a hurry to fulfill quotas, based on floor space, that new tenants had to spend much of their own time and money repairing taps, burners and switches, rehanging doors, fixing plumbing, installing light switches, fixing windows or doing plastering that was all supposed to have been done by the construction teams. One outlet for more affluent families in the last decade has been the development since 1962 of cooperative apartment groups at governmental agencies, enterprises, scientific institutes, writers’ organizations and other work collectives. Normally, Soviet practice requires a 40 percent downpayment and then 15 years to pay the balance. But as demand has risen, along with construction costs, so have prices. Muscovites complain that an apartment of three rooms with kitchen, toilet, bath and hall—comfortable and large by Soviet standards. —that used to cost 6,000 to 6,500 rubles in an outlying southwest region of Moscow in 1966, now costs from 8,500 to 10,000 rubles in a new cooperative. Even within cooperative groups, the wait can be tedious. One novelist got a new two‐room flat this year after waiting for five years in a one‐room flat. Moreover, cooperatives provide an outlet only for more affluent members of society. They account for only about 3 per cent of all urban housing. Nonetheless, private construction generally has been far more crucial for coping with the housing squeeze than most foreigners, or Russians, realize. Professor Morton developing estimates from Soviet statistics, has written that since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, more housing space has been provided by private and cooperative construction than by state programs. This is essentially because of the relative neglect by the state before the nineteen‐fifties. New restrictions on private construction in cities and the frustrations of long waits for new public housing are what push hundreds of thousands of people annually into the housing exchanges. So huge is that market that Moscow prints a 64 — page weekly booklet “Rooms and Apartments for Exchange.” Many other people prefer to go to the exchange to negotiate directly. Even a “find” however, loes not always provide quick results because the finder must work out an intricate or contorted exchange involving three, four, five, eight or even twelve others. In a recent “musical chairs” exchange, a couple with a two‐room apartment wanted more space because of a new baby. They had no luck so they persuaded the parents of one to throw their four room apartment into the bargain, in hopes of getting two three‐room apartments. That, too fell through but they did find a desirable three‐room apartment for one family. The problem was that it was then being used as a communal dwelling by two families and a single elderly man. So the young couple set out to help these people find suitable dwellings. When they finished the exchange involved six apartments and eight families, The elderly man, not entirely happy, had to be paid 500 rubles to agree to move. Then the entire arrangerrient had to be registered with sity authorities who scrutinized each move to insure that no one was violating the Byzarn tine restrictions of maximum and minimum living space for different categories of people and the police rules that all be legally registered Moscow residents. “It tooke an enormous amount of time and effort,” the young husband told friends “But it was worth it in the end We got a very nice apartment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of such inconveniences, the family gave up after a couple of years and moved back to their old communal apartment near the center. By then the number of people in the communal apartment was down to roughly half the former number. Housing Quality Deplored Complaints about the quality of Soviet construction are common in the press. Two years ago, Pravda carried a bitter article from the Armenian capital of Yerevan camplaining that construction agencies were in such a hurry to fulfill quotas, based on floor space, that new tenants had to spend much of their own time and money repairing taps, burners and switches, rehanging doors, fixing plumbing, installing light switches, fixing windows or doing plastering that was all supposed to have been done by the construction teams. One outlet for more affluent families in the last decade has been the development since 1962 of cooperative apartment groups at governmental agencies, enterprises, scientific institutes, writers’ organizations and other work collectives. Normally, Soviet practice requires a 40 percent downpayment and then 15 years to pay the balance. But as demand has risen, along with construction costs, so have prices. Muscovites complain that an apartment of three rooms with kitchen, toilet, bath and hall—comfortable and large by Soviet standards. —that used to cost 6,000 to 6,500 rubles in an outlying southwest region of Moscow in 1966, now costs from 8,500 to 10,000 rubles in a new cooperative. Even within cooperative groups, the wait can be tedious. 11 One novelist got a new two‐room flat this year after waiting for five years in a one‐room flat. Moreover, cooperatives provide an outlet only for more affluent members of society. They account for only about 3 per cent of all urban housing. Private Building Dominant Nonetheless, private construction generally has been far more crucial for coping with the housing squeeze than most foreigners, or Russians, realize. Professor Morton developing estimates from Soviet statistics, has written that since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, more housing space has been provided by private and cooperative construction than by state programs. This is essentially because of the relative neglect by the state before the nineteen‐fifties. New restrictions on private construction in cities and the frustrations of long waits for new public housing are what push hundreds of thousands of people annually into the housing exchanges. So huge is that market that Moscow prints a 64 — page weekly booklet “Rooms and Apartments for Exchange.” Many other people prefer to go to the exchange to negotiate directly. Even a “find” however, sloes not always provide quick results because the finder must work out an intricate or contorted exchange involving three, four, five, eight or even twelve others. In a recent “musical chairs” exchange, a couple with a two‐room apartment wanted more space because of a new baby. They had no luck o they persuaded the parents of one to throw their four room apartment into the bargain, in hopes of getting two three‐room apartments. That, too fell through but they did find a desirable three‐room apartment for one family. The problem was that it was then being used as a communal dwelling by two families and a single elderly man. So the young couple set out to help these people find suitable dwellings. When they finished the exchange involved six apartments and eight families, The elderly man, not entirely happy, had to be paid 500 rut bles to agree to move. Then the entire arrangment had to be registered with fifty authorities who scrutinized each move to, insure that no one was violating the Byzan tine restrictions of maximum and minimum living space for different categories of people and the police rules that all be legally registered Moscow rest idents. “It took an enormous amount of time and effort,” the young husband told friend “But it was worth it in the end We got a very nice apartment.” Muscovites gather near Prospekt Mira to exchange apartments. The signs that they carry describe their needs. In a Moscow factory, construction workers build prefabricated bathrooms which will be taken to newly built housing sites. Although the Soviet Union has built more housing units than any other country, since 1956, the housing situation is still critical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"France, With Smiling‐Giscard at Helm Showing the Symptoms‐of Mal de Mef",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/14/archives/france-with-smiling-giscardat-helm-showing-the-symptoms-of-mal-de.html,"PARIS, Nov. 13—The Mood of France, particularly Peris, could be compared these days to the mat liner named after this country, whose passengers ate, and drank her out of existence. The liner France, one of the most luxurious and carefree places in a forbidding world, was recently taken out of service. Despite all the pride, work and love invested in herr the France, after a comparatrvely brief life, had become hopelessly unprofitable. President Valery Giscard d'Estaing has warned that the curves are leading us to catastrophe” during the Worldwide economic crisis. He has asked the country, smiling the While, to give him time and, somehow, everything will work itself out. He has been dubbed “the happy Cassandra.” Joy Unconfined If some of the faces in the Paris subway are glum, the stores and sidewalks are full of people lugging bulging plastic shopping bags The nch continue to amuse themselves lustily. They queue hp for movies —especially those that are erptic or Violent. They pack restaurants, and cafes, and conceits and art shows and flood the highways with their cars. A week ago, at the end of the three‐day All Saints holiday, returning automobiles stretched bumperto‐bumper for 30 miles on thp superhighway from the south. Yet it is alsti obvious that the French are discontent withobt being panicky. They see no clear‐cut approaches by their Government to ristng prices, falling employment and strikes that have paralyzed mail delivery and other essential services. The Socialist‐Conununist left warned last spring, after barely losing the presidential election, that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing would have labor trouble in the fall, And he has. Strikes are a seasonal feature of autumn here, like rain in April and political threes in summer. But these strikes, engaging by turn railway, gas and elettricity workers, civil servants, bus drivers, coal miners, printers, broadcasters, fueloil distributors and, for a month now, the entire postal and telecommunications system, are becoming fiercer and more political than before. The unions last month won a historic agreement that guarantees wage earners a year's pay if they are laid off for economic reasons. Still, this does not seem to reassure the French who have been repeatedly described by labor experts as “neurotic” at the thought of losing their jobs. The National Institute of Statistics, however, has just confirmed that the economy is indeed slowing down. People are responding in droves to “help wanted” ads. More than 500,000 workers in a force of 20 million are unemployed, up 20 per cent from last year. That seems low by American standards but France had long, been used to almost zero unemployment. President Giscard d'Estaing is being attacked from all sides. Employers are worried by the proposed new tax on inflationary profits. Small and medium businesses have said they are being crushed because of severe credit restrictions. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing has insisted that time is working for France. Jose Bidegain disagrees. He is the head of the National Employers Association and deplores the “lack of backbone” in the Government's reaction to the crisis. What appears to'be unsettling the French in, every quarter is the President's “wait and see” attitude. He is accused of procrastinating and of substituting style for substance. He changes the tempo of the “Marseillaise,” he goes to De Gaulle's grave to show he is faithful to the general's credos, he spends 24 hours aboard an atomic submarine to affirm his faith in France's nuclear deterrent force. “What does he take us for — a bunch of dumb clucks?” one old woman rhetorically asked another on a Paris street corner this week. Bertrand Fessard de Foucault, an old‐line Gaullist commentator, attempted to define the drift in an article in the Paris daily Le Monde headlined: “France Without Guidelines.” He noted that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing appeared to be indecisive alinut major problems—inflation, job security, Eutepean unity, the energy crisis — while increasingly taking power into his own hands. The President and his closest aide, Minister of State Michel Peiniatowski, have a finger in everything, no matter how minute. The President's interest in detail extends even to ordering potted orange trees to be placed in the courtyord of the Elysee Palace, his official residence. When “a cold snap arrived, he had than removed. Who's in Charge Here? Mr. Poniatowski; in theory only the Minister of Interior but the nearest thing France has to a Vice President, has been recently conducting foreign policy in Warsaw, Quebec and Algiers: He has also made pronouncements on everything from abortion proposals, to prison reform and labor relations, All these questions are in the of other ministries. The press reacts as the man in the street reacts by being more critical than ever. The President's campaign slogan last spring was “Giscard to the helm. The French are beginning to wonder, as their disgruntlement grows, where the captain has gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Officials of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and some private groups also have attacked the legislation on humanitarian and administrative grounds. The measure, a Senate amendment to a $33‐billion appropriation bill says: “No part of the funds appropriated under this act shall be used. in any manner directly or indirectly to pay for or encourage the performance of abortions except such abortions as are necessary to save the life of the mother.” The Library or Congress study concludes that court rulings clearly raise serious constitutional questions about the measure, which it said would violate both the fifth and 14th amendments to the Constitution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miss Hearst Still a Fugitive 6 Months After Reaffirming Allegiance to Kidnappers,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/19/archives/miss-hearst-still-a-fugitive-6-months-after-reaffirming-allegiance.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 18—Spring and summer are long gone and, with Thanksgiving near, there is still no trace of Patricia Campbell Hearst after six months. The last public word‐from the 20‐year‐old woman came in May in a tape recording in which she proclaimed anew her commitment to the so‐called symbionese Liberation Army, which says it kidnapped her in February. In a strident monotone, she also proclaimed her love for William Wolfe, a tonirade who, like six other members “of the S.L.A., had just been killed in a gun battle with the LOS Angeles police. At that time, 375 ‘Federal agents were on her trail. Only 20 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation work on the case these days the agency reports, and Randolph A person Hearst, Publisher and editor of The San Francisco Ex aminer, and his wife, Catherine, have withdrawn the $50,000 reWard they had offered: for their daughter's safe return. ‘Have CompleteFaith' “We love Patricia and have complete faith in her,” they said in their recent announce Ment. “We are prepared to do all in our power to help her, protect her and defend her.”' Although Miss Hearst and two fugitive companions have not been caught, the‐Six months have been rich With rumors, speculation and gossip. In addition, it has led to Changes in the lives Of the people she left behind. Steven A. Weed her former fiance, with whom she lived for almost two years, has abandoned his philosophy, studies ‘at the University of California, Berkeley, and is writing a book about his experiences with Miss Hearst. ,. One of her younger Sisters has left California to attend school elseWhere, reportedly under an assumed name and another sister has Moved to London. The Hearst family mansion in Hillsboro, where five daughters Once lived, is now almost empty and has been put up for sale. Alone at Family Retreat The longtime Cook an housekeeper moved away and Miss Hearst's parents have spent much of the last few mountains at a family retreat Months alone together in the oalled Wyntoon. There are reports from associates that they are having financial difficulties. The more persistent rumors that have arisen in this Period include theories about where Miss Hearst is hiding and allegations that she knew kidnappers long before they barged into her apartment Feb 4. Some have pictured her dead. There have been Sports that she is in Guatemala hiding out with the rebels in the hills or is in the college community around Santa Barbara: She has been rumored to be in the radical suburbs of Berkeley and Oakland across San Francisco. Bay and some say she has been sighted in Idaho, Canada and the Middle East. Some reports have it that Mr. Hearst and Mr. Weed have been in indirect contact with her and have even arranged togive her money. Some persons have said that the two men have traveled to Central” America:, and the Middle East to see her, or, at least; in hopes of seeing her., In addition, unattributed, sources have been quoted in local newspapers here saying, for example that the F.B.I. is looking for clues to her where abouts in abortion clinics in Texas and in fishing vessels that ply between Southern California and Mexico. The police have found the 1964 gteen‐and‐white Chevrolet that was used to kidnap her and a one‐story bungalow in the San Francisco suburbs where the say she was held after the kidnapping. James L. Browning, the United States Attorney here, Who is in charge of the somewhat dormant grand jury that is still investigating the kidnapping, says, “Who knows, we may never know what happened to her.” “I doubt” he added in an interview, “that we'll ever find her.” Although Mr. Browning hinted that the authorities knew more about the kidnapping and the S.L.A. than the public does, he Said that he remained firmly convinced Miss Hearst had no warning that she would be taken captive. One of the most complicated and persistent rumors surrounding Miss Hearst is that she secretly had a brief love affair with Mr.Wolfe about a year before the kidnapping. This theory Was pieced together by private detectives in Los Angeles Who said they had sources inside the prison where the Slain S.L.A, leader, Donal. DeFreeze, had been held. According to the story, Miss Hearst accompanied Mr. Wolfe on one of his many visits to Vacaville Prison, where he was involved in group activities with some of the prisoners. There, it is said, she met other S.I.A. members. According to the investigators, who concede they have no proof of this theory, Mr. DeFreeZe boasted to other inmates that he knew Miss, Hearst. The Story continues that around this period Miss Hearst briefly met some of the other S.L.A. members and even jokingly discussed political kidnapphigs with them later, the rumor goes, on the night of Feb. 4 she recognized her kidnappers and cried‐out “Oh, no, not me” Mr. Browning said that of all the many anonymous letters the authorities had received about the case, only one struck him as true. Cautioning that his belief rested on “intuition alone.” he said that the handwritten letter was signed “Tanya,” which Miss Hearst chose as her name. Tanya wrote, we said, that she did not know why everyone Was so confused about her rapid conversion to the S.L.A. She had, after all, known and loved Mr. Wolfe long before, she The F.B.I., Mr. Browningsaid, has discounted the authenticity of this report, too, and so, he said the status of the case remains open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SENATE PANEL,9‐0, BACKS ROEMER FOR CONFIRMATION",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/23/archives/senate-panel90-backs-roemer-for-confirmation.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22—The Senate Rules Committee voted unanimously today to recommend to the full Senate the confirmation of Nelson A. Rockefeller as Vice President, The vote was taken as Mr. Rockefeller began to undergo a second day of questioning before the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate committee's vote of 9 to 0, announced after.a closed meeting that lasted slightly more than an hour, imposed no conditions on the approval of Mr. Rockefeller. But two of the members, Senators James B. Allen of Alabama and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, said that they had not decided whether they would defend the nomination on the Senate floor. Mr. Byrd, who was Mr. Rockefeller's most challenging and persistent questioner at the committee hearings, said that he had initially proposed that the nomination be sent to the full Senate with no recommendation—neither approval nor disapproval. Seeks to Avoid Prejudice He decided, however, that this might “prejudice the nom ination, and I did not want to leave that impression.” Mr. Allen, a conservative and a supporter of Gov. George C. Wallace, issued a statemen that despite his disagreemen “with much of Governor Rackefeller's philosophy, I, realize that it would be impractical for me to expect a nominee with whose views I wholly agree.” He said that he was there fore voting for confirmation “the national interest.” Senator Howard W. Canno of Nevada, a Democrat who the committee chairman, said that the committee's written report would be filed by Dec. 3. He said that it was still undecided whether the Senate would wait for the conclusion of the House hearings beforetaking a vote. Shortly before the Senate committee's vote was announced, Mr. Rockefeller started his second day of interrogation by the 38 members of the Judiciary Committee, which is also believed certain to confirm his nomination, but not unanimously. Cardinal Sends Letters Later, at a news conference in downtown Washington, it was announced that John Cardinal Cody of Chicago, chairman of the pro‐life committee of the National Council of Catholic Bishops, had sent identical letters to Senator Cannon and to Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House committee. The letter urged both men to ascertain from Mr. Rockefeller “that he will not use the office of the. Vice‐Presidency.to promote a positive viewpoint on permissive abortion."" In the House Judiciary Committee, although there was questioning so varied as to seem almost random, there was a concentration on certain issues—the Attica prison uprising, the economic interdependence of the whole Rockefeller family and the extent of its power and Mr. Rockefeller's relationship with L. Judson Morhouse, the former chairman of the New York State Republican party. The surprise questions about the Morhouse matter came toward the close of the seven hours of questioning when Jerome Zeifman, the majority counsel to the committee, asked Mr. Rockefeller: “Were Mr. Morhouse's lawyers advised by a member of your staff not to submit a formal application [for commutation of Mr. Morhouse's prison sentence] until it was reviewed formally by Mr. Douglass?” The Mr. Douglass referred to was Robert W. Douglass, then a counsel to the Governor. Mr. Rockefeller replied, “No, sir.” Mr. Zeifman then asked if he knew that his staff had been advised that the prison in which Mr. Morhouse was on inmate had “adequate facilities to care for him.” “I don't know, sir,” Mr. Rockefeller said, “not to, my memory.” Asked what arguments were presented to him against commuting Mr. Morhouse's sentence, part of the required procedure, he said “I don't remember.” Mr. Zeifman said that he had further questions on the matter that he would submit to Mr. Rockefeller in writing. Sources on the committee said that there was documentary evidence that Mr. Morhouse's lawyers had been told to have their formal application reviewed by Mr. Douglass. But they also said that it was not certain that Mr. Rockefeller was aware of the true situation. Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who was formerly a member of the State Assembly, questioned Mr. Rockefeller about his handling of the prison uprising in Attica in 1971, in which 39 hostages and prison. ers were killed in the recapture of the prison. Mr. Rockefeller was also asked about his appointment to the State Liquor Authority of Martin Epstein, whose acceptance of a bribe from Mr. Morhouse to obtain a liquor license for a client led to Mr. Morhouse's conviction. Mr. Rockefeller admitted that he had not read either of two reports on Mr. Epstein by the state police Bureau of Criminal Investigation, both apparently containing material deleterious to him, before making the appointment Yesterday, Mr. Rockefeller disclosed that he planned—whether or not Congress requested it—to place all the securities he owns outright in blind trust and have the two family trusts of which he is the beneficiary treated on the same blind basis. In such trusts, the owner exercises no control over his securities. He does this to avoid any possible conflict of interest. It became evident today, however, that for some of the committee's 17 Democratic members, this was a purely symbolic gesture that did not allay their fears about what has repeatedly been referred to as the “wedding” of Mr. Rockefeller's great economic power with the political power of the Vice‐Presidency or, conceivably, the Presidency. Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas said that the conflict‐of‐interest worries were “not allayed” either by the blind trust or by Mr. Rockefeller's additional undertaking, to request that he not be informed either about his family's investments. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas called the acts “unrealistic window‐dressing for ordinary integrity,” the presence or absence of which was not affected. And Robert W. Kastenmeier of Wisconsin said that he appreciated Mr. Rockefeller's motive but felt that “more openness” and “no concealment, not even from yourself,” was what was really needed. Mr. Kastenmeier also supported a proposal made previously by Representative Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, who has consistently expressed concern about the scope of the Rockefeller family's economic power and the impossibility of separating one member from the whole. List of Gifts Sought He asked Mr. Rockefeller to “ask your brothers to make available their securities and holdings and trusts,” suggesting that such a move would “dispel the suspicions” that there was a pattern of economic control by the family. He also said that he would like Laurance S. Rockefeller to supply the committee with a list of his gifts and loans. Laurance Rockefeller was singled out because he financed a 1970 campaign biography of Arthur J. Goldberg, Nelson Rockefeller's gubernatorial opponent, and in 1959 made a $49,000 loan to Mr. Morhouse, who was instrumental in Mr. Rockefeller's early political successes. Mr. Rockefeller, who has previously seemed very reluctant to involve family members in this political procedure, said, “I will discuss it with members of the family. I will do my best.” On the second round of questioning, with each member allocated only five minutes, several members cut off Mr. Rockefeller's discursive replies. But occasionally he was brusque, as when Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, Democrat of Brooklyn, asked him if he felt that President Nixon had had the right to lie to the American people about the secret incursion into Cambodia. Mr. Rockefeller indicated that these were questions “too loaded” for him to answer, but that he assumed Mr. Nixon had taken that action to “protect American lives.” ¶uestioned About Gift Miss Holtzman also questioned Mr. Rockefeller about gift listed by him as having been made to Mr. Douglass, beneficiary who, Mr. Rockefeller said, was not a state offia lawyer, for an unnamed cial. She said that the beneficiary—not identified by her, but known to be Oscar Ruebhausen, a lawyer—had been chairman of the New York State Special Commission of Insurance Holding Companies and the state's Advisory Cornmission on Atomic Energy. Mr. Rockefeller said that Mr. Ruebhausen—whom he did not identify by name either—did not know of the trust, because he “would never allow me to do anything” for him. He said that the two posts to which he had appointed him were unsalaried, and he did not, therefore, consider him a public official. Mr. Ruebausen, who sat beside Mrs. Rockefeller at the morning session, learned of the trust only shortly before Representative Holtzman brought up the matter. He is, a senior partner in the New York law firm of Debevoise, Plimpton, Lyons & Gates and has handled Mr. Rockefeller's affairs for more than 30 years, according to Hugh Morrow, Mr. Rockefeller's press secretary. He is a member of Mr. Rockefeller's critical choices commission and has headed Democrats for Rockefeller in several of Mr. Rockefeller's campaigns. The question of Mr. Morhouse was raised again today by Representative. Joshua Eilberg, a Pennsylvania Democrat. Mr. Eilberg said that between 1957 and 1962, Mr. Morhouse had an annual income of about $50,000. He also said that Mr. Morhouse had been unable to explain the “family emergency” that Mr. Rockefeller said had prompted $100,000 loan to him, which was forgiven in 1970. In 1970, also Mr. Rockefeller commuted Mr. Morhouse's prison sentence for bribery, on the basis of severe health problems. Mr. Rockefeller also said that he could not recall precisely the details of the loan beyond the fact that Mr. Morhouse had “asked for it.” Jerome R. Waldie, the California Democrat who was yesterday's sharpest and most'; critical questioner, asked Mr. Rockefeller whether there was not a pattern to his gifts and loans to state officials. “You give gifts at the beginning of the employment,” he said, and at the end, when the beneficiary is no longer in state employ. In the interim, “you make a loan that is sub sequently invariably forgiven.” He asked if this was done “to avoid the narrow interpre tation” of state laws that pro hibit such gifts. Mr. Rockefeller first said no, and then, in response to another question, that he had made loans instead of gifts because tof the law. “That's exactly what I've said,” Mr. Waldie said, waving aside attempts at further ex planation. “Your answer satisfied me.” Mr. Waldie also said that Mr. Rockefeller “Forsook the trust” of the people of New York State when he resigned as Governor last December and criticized the “lightness of the responsibility” he felt for the office to which he had been elected. “That, sir, is your opinion,” Mr. Rockefeller interrupted angrily. “It is not my opinion.” The committee is planning to question Mr. Rockefeller again after hearing witnesses next week and the week after. The two days of questioning were less critical than had been expected and produced little that had not been disclosed either during the eight days of Senate committee hearings or in the press. In part, this may have been because the members received the bulky staff report only the day before the heal ings opened. Some member urged the chairman to delay the hearings still further for additional investigation. Laurance Rockefeller is the only member of the family known to be scheduled to testify. Monday, when the hearings resume, will be devoted to testimony from representatives of various groups in support of or in opposition to the nominee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surprise questions about the Morhouse matter came toward the close of the seven hours of questioning when Jerome Zeifman, the majority counsel to the committee, asked Mr. Rockefeller: “Were Mr. Morhouse's lawyers advised by a member your staff not to submit a formal application [for commutation of Mr. Morhouse's prison sentence] until it was reviewed formally by Mr. Douglass?” The Mr. Douglass referred to was Robert W. Douglass, then a counsel to the Governor. Mr. Rockefeller replied, “No, sir.” Mr. Zeifman then asked if he knew that his staff had been advised that the prison in which Mr. Morhouse was on inmate had “adequate facilities to care for him.” “I don't know, sir,” Mr. Rockefeller said, “not to, my memory.” Asked what arguments were presented to him against commuting Mr. Morhouse's sentence, part of the required procedure, he said, “I don't remember.” Mr. Zeifman said that he had further questions on the matter that he would submit to Mr. Rockefeller in writing. Sources on the committee said that there was documentary evidence that Mr. Morhouse's lawyers had been told to have their formal application reviewed by Mr. Douglass. But they also said that it was not certain that Mr. Rockefeller was aware of the true situation. Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who was formerly a member of the State Assembly, questioned Mr. Rockefeller about his handling of the prison uprising in Attica in 1971, in which 39 hostages and prisoners were killed in the recapture of the prison. Mr. Rockefeller was also asked about his appointment to the State Liquor Authority of Martin Epstein, whose acceptance of a bribe from Mr. Morhouse to obtain a liquor license for a client led to Mr. Morhouse's conviction. Mr. Rockefeller admitted that he had not read either of two reports on Epstein by the state police Bureau of Criminal Investigation, both apparently containing material deleterious to him, before making the appointment. Yesterday, Mr. Rockefeller disclosed that he planned—whether or not Congress requested it—to place all the securities he owns outright in blind trust and have the two family trusts of which he is the beneficiary treated on the same blind basis. In such trusts, the owner exercises no control over his securities. He does this to avoid any possible conflict of interest. It became evident today, however, that for some of the committee's 17 Democratic members, this was a purely symbolic gesture that did not allay their fears about what has repeatedly been referred to as the “wedding” of Mr. Rockefeller's great economic power with the political power of the Vice‐Presidency or, conceivably, the Presidency. Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas said that the conflict‐of‐interest worries were “not allayed” either by the blind trust or by Mr. Rockefeller's additional undertaking, to request that he not be informed either about his family's investments. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas called the acts “unrealistic window‐dressing for ordinary integrity,” the presence or absence of which was not affected. And Robert W. Kastenmeier of Wisconsin said that he appreciated Mr. Rockefeller's motive but felt that “more openness” and “no concealment, not even from yourself,” was what was really needed. Mr. Kastenmeier also supported a proposal made previously by Representative Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, who has consistently expressed concern about the scope of the Rockefeller family's economic power and the impossibility of separating one member from the whole. List of Gifts Sought He asked Mr. Rockefeller to “ask your brothers to make available their securities and holdings and trusts,” suggesting that such a move would “dispel the suspicions” that there was a pattern of economic control by the family. He also said that he would like Laurance S. Rockefeller to supply the committee with a list of his gifts and loans. Laurance Rockefeller was singled out because he financed a 1970 campaign biography of Arthur J. Goldberg, Nelson Rockefeller's gubernatorial opponent, and in 1959 made $49,000 loan to Mr. Morhouse, who was instrumental in Mr. Rockefeller's early political successes. Mr. Rockefeller, who has previously seemed very reluctant to involve family members in this political procedure, said, “I will discuss it with members of the family. I will do my best.” On the second round of questioning, with each member allocated only five minutes, several members cut off Mr. Rockefeller's discursive replies. But occasionally he was brusque, as when Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, Democrat of Brooklyn, asked him if he felt that President Nixon had had the right to lie to the American people about the secret incursion. into Cambodia. Mr. Rockefeller indicated that these were questions “too loaded” for him to answer, but that he assumed Mr. Nixon had taken that action to “protect American lives.” ¶uestioned About Gift Miss Holtzman also questioned Mr. Rockefeller about gift listed by him as having been made to Mr. Douglass, a lawyer, for an unnamed beneficiary who, Mr. Rockefeller said, was not a state official. She said that the beneficiary—not identified by her, but known to be Oscar Ruebhausen, a lawyer—had been chairman of the New York State Special Commission of Insurance Holding Companies and the state's Advisory Commission on Atomic Energy. Mr. Rockefeller said that Mr. Ruebhausen—whom he did not identify by name either—did not know of the trust, because he “would never allow me to do anything” for him. He said that the two posts to which he had appointed him were unsalaried, and he did not, therefore, consider him a public official. Mr. Ruebausen, who sat beside Mrs. Rockefeller at the morning session, learned of the trust only shortly before Representative Holtzman brought up the matter. He is, a senior partner in the New York law firm of Debevoise, Plimpton, Lyons & Gates and has handled Mr. Rockefeller's affairs for more than 30 years, according to Hugh Morrow, Mr. Rockefeller's press secretary. He is a member of Mr. Rockefeller's critical choices commission and has headed Democrats for Rockefeller in several of Mr. Rockefeller's campaigns. The question of Mr. Morhouse was raised again today by Representative. Joshua Eilberg, a Pennsylvania Democrat. Mr. Eilberg said that between 1957 and 1962, Mr. Morhouse had an annual income of about $50,000. He also said that Mr. Morhouse had been unable to explain the “family emergency” that Mr. Rockefeller said had prompted $100,000 loan to him, which was forgiven in 1970. In 1970, also Mr. Rockefeller commuted Mr. Morhouse's prison sentence for bribery, on the basis of severe health problems. Mr. Rockefeller also said that he could not recall precisely the details of the loan beyond the fact that Mr. Morhouse had “asked for it.” Jerome R. Waldie, the California Democrat who was yesterday's sharpest and most critical questioner, asked Mr. Rockefeller whether there was not a pattern to his gifts and loans to state officials. “You give gifts at the beginning of the employment,” he said, and at the end, when the beneficiary is no longer in state employ. In the interim, “you make a loan that is subsequently invariably forgiven.” He asked if this was done “to avoid the narrow interpretation” of state laws that prohibit such gifts. Mr. Rockefeller first said no, and then, in response to another question, that he had made loans instead of gifts because tof the law. “That's exactly what I've said,” Mr. Waldie said, waving aside attempts at further explanation. “Your answer satisfied me.” Mr. Waldie also said that Mr. Rockefeller “Forsook the trust” of the people of New York State when he resigned as Governor last December and criticized the “lightness of the responsibility” he felt for the office to which he had been elected. “That, sir, is your opinion,” Mr. Rockefeller interrupted angrily. “It is not my opinion.” The committee is planning to question Mr. Rockefeller again after hearing witnesses next week and the week after. The two days of questioning were less critical than had been expected and produced little that had not been disclosed either during the eight days of Senate committee hearings or in the press. In part, this may have been because the members received the bulky staff report only the day before the hear ings opened. Some member urged the chairman to delay, the hearings still further for additional investigation. Laurance Rockefeller is the only member of the family known to be scheduled to testify. Monday, when the hearings resume, will be devoted to testimony from representatives of various groups in support of or in opposition to the nominee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bishops Ask That Congressmen Question Rockefeller on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/23/archives/bishops-ask-that-congressmen-question-rockefeller-on-abortion.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22—Eight Roman Catholic bishops asked the chairmen of the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Rules Committee today to make sure that Nelson A. Rockefeller “will not use the office of Vice President to promote a personal viewpoint on permissive abortion.” The request was made by the Pro‐Life Activities Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, headed by John Cardinal Cody of Chicago, in letters sent to Representative Peter W. Rodino, a New Jersey Democrat, chairman of the House committee, and Senator Howard W. Cannon, a Nevada Democrat, chairman of the Senate panel. Both panels have been holding hearings on Mr. Rockefeller's nomination. The sending of the letters was authorized yesterday at a closed session of the bishops’ annual meeting in the Stetler Hilton Hotel. The five‐day convention ended this afternoon. At a news conference following adjournment, John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, retiring president of the conference, insisted that the letters did not constitute a formal action by the 250 prelates. He made it clear that he was appearing before the press at the insistence of the conference's communications executives, but insisted that he would not “betray the rules of an executive session.” He indicated that he was aware that news of the letters had been disclosed to some reporters. The Cardinal emphasized that the bishops avoid endorsing or apposing candidates for public office, but speak only to the issues involved. He said the letters could have been regarded as unprecedented had the bishops made a personal attack on an individual. “It is not unusual for the church to call attention to man's record on public issues,” he asserted. “Our concern is to speak for the common good.” Cardinal Krol refused to divulge the vote on the authorization. The Cardinal said he expected “no backlash” on the matter and predicted that “the public will take it in truth and not in interpretation.” The letters ask that Mr. Rockefeller be questioned “on his present position on providing legal protection for unborn life, and to ascertain that he will not use the office of Vice President to promote a personal viewpoint on permissive abortion.’ Mr. Rockefeller, a Governor of New York, vetoed legislative attempts to repeal the state's law permitting abortion. Pro‐Life Committee members, in addition to Cardinal Cody, are Bishops George W. Ahr of Trenton, Juan A. Arzube of Los Angeles, Walter W. Curtis of Bridgeport, Conn., Francis J. Dunn of Dubuque, Iowa, Timothy J. Harrington of Worcester, Mass., Andrew J. McDonald of Little Rock and Harold R. Perry of New Orleans. In discussing report of the conference's Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs that hailed the growing reapproachment between Protestants and Roman Catholics, Cardinal Cody voiced concern over “not just a few priests” who had “defected” and joined the Anglican Communion, He said he was aware of four who had done so. The Cardinal also said he was disturbed by the ordination last summer of 11 women as Episcopal priests. He called the ordination “a scandal and threat to ecumenism.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INDIA OVERHAULS BIRTH‐CURB PLANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/24/archives/india-overhauls-birthcurb-plans-100-million-fertile-couples-linked.html,"NEW DELHI, Nov. 23—India, a nation growing by 13 million people each year, is overhauling her shaky birth‐control program. The policy shift comes at a time of food scarcities, economic drift and a widespread acknowledgment among officials and population experts that India's birth‐control efforts have faltered in recent years. Critics say that there has been an absence of economic and political commitment to population control in India, the most populous nation in the world after China. The new program seeks to integrate family planning with other health services and to send teams to villages to deal with child and maternity care, malaria and smallpox control as well as family planning. Previously, 80,000 workers dealt solely with family planning and provided villagers with contraceptives and advice on birth control. These workers are now being retrained. Within the next five years, a total of 130,000 “multipurpose” field staff: members are to serve the Government. A two‐day national family planning conference, the largest of its kind in India, will be held next month in New Delhi to shape the program. Linked to Health “Linking health and nutrition with family , planning is the key,” Dr. Karan Singh, the Health and Family Planning Minister, said in an interview. “If children have a better chance of sirrviving, if health conditions improve, then family planning, we. hope, will take effect.” “Often there's no real incentive to reduce the number of children,” Mr. ,Singh said. “Children arrive. Sortie die. Some survive. People who are poor often have no interest in accepting, family planning. It's only after a certain economic and education and health level that you accept family planning.” Mr. Singh,. an exuberant 43‐year‐old former maharajah of Kashmir and an authority of Sanskrit and Urdu poetry, said that India's budget cuts in family planning last year had stirred unfair foreign Criticism. “The syndrome that India is no longer interested in family, planning is totally false,” he said. “Our foreign critics also’ say that there is not a political commitment. That is also totally. false.” In the 1974‐75 fiscal year, which ends in March, India will probably spend about $72‐million on family planning, compared with $71‐million last year. In 1972‐73, India spent about $106‐million. The previous strategy in family planning centered on mass sterilization and vasectomy camps at which each participant received an incentive payment of as much as $12. Nearly 14 million people have been sterilized at the camps. Since then, however, Government officials have become somewhat uneasy about sterilization, mostly because numerous older people, beyond the reproductive age, were appearing at camps, there were rumors of coercion and fraud, and several persons died as a result of inept operating techniques. India's population, nearing 600 million, is expected to reach one billion by the end of the century. Critics here insist that the Government has not viewed family planning with urgency and that the problem has become alarming because food production has been disappointing in the last few years. “The priority for family planning is just not there, said one expert, who asked to remain unidentified. “There's high priority for developing industry, for steel mills, for defense. The population problem is given lip service, and that's it.” 100 Million Fertile Couples India's population is increasing by 2.1 per cent a year, and the country has more than 100 million fertile couples. Only 15 per cent of these fertile couples, who range in age from 15 to 44, practice family planning. Yet fertility studies point out that that a large proportion of Indian couples would prefer to have fewer children than they do. Moreover, there are believed to be between 5 million to 7 million “clandestine abortions” each year in India, indicating that the Government is not meeting the demand for birth‐control devices. The current birth rate is 35 per thousand, compared with 39 per thousand five years ago. Mr. Singh says that he hopes to reduce the figure further, to 30 per thousand by 1979. “It's a question of education, health, electricity, roads, development.” Mr. Singh said. “You won't stop the population growth unless you have effective development.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clout,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/24/archives/clout-a-womans-guide-to-the-mans-world-of-the-media-compiled-by-the.html,"Most reporters have a favor ite assignment, a Story That Made Me See the Light: for many women the place that mattered this decade was Miami Beach, 1972 —site of the Democratic National Convention. The largest female press corps in modern times covered the largest female delegate group in modern times. There and then we lost our innocence and began to understand—and sometimes gain —clout. I remember the steamy, noisy atmosphere: elation over women operating film cameras; women's stories getting front‐page play; confusion among members of the male press corps, who had to ask their female colleagues to explain certain events (highlighted by Walter Cronkite's misinterpreting one key credentials vote and wondering aloud why “the ladies” were angry). And, after the abortion plank lost and George McGovern was nominated anyway, when a lot of women felt double‐crossed, I remember a Massachusetts delegate telling me she was voting for Sissy Farenthold for Vice President that “this kind of garbage is never going to happen again.” That was wishful thinking, of course, but Miami Beach was at least a turning point. Female reporters had covered politics, not tea parties, and had trod the line dividing feminism and journalism. Female politicians had experienced the beginnings of real power, and, as the Tolchins point out, they “returned from Miami Beach to circulate nominating petitions, not for male candidates but for themselves.” What happens after that kind of awakening is the subject of all three of these books. They are about power, and women, and the kind of garbage that still keeps them apart. In “Clout: Womanpower and Politics,” Susan and Martin Toichin describe the growing liberation of the ballot box in lively, well‐documented and often revealing narrative. They make no attempt to disguise their distaste for what they call the “phallocentric bias” of politics —the kind of thinking that has let ?? politicians get away with gems like these: “Honey, whatever women do, they do best after dark” (John Lindsay); “Women do the lickin’ and the stickin’ while men plan the strategy” (New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu). At a time when women are running for public office in unprecedented numbers, the Tolchins tell us how they got there and why, in some cases, they have failed. The examples cover a wide spectrum of women in politics: Massachusetts's Margaret Heckler in her understated gray flannels; Colorado's Pat Schroeder, campaigning with her baby and squelching a Congressman with the quip, “Yes, have a uterus and a brain, and they both work” Boston's Joie Prevost, who hands out patronage jobs for Mayor Kevin White. Through them, and others, the Tolchins report that the party is often harder to convince than the voting public, and that female candidates often have to it alone. The Tolchins point to the absence of women in Watergate as a positive factor for female candidates, and of all their advice to timid would‐be office seekers, this is my favorite: “Legislators are not as uniformly expert as they have portrayed themselves and the field is wide open for women willing to move in.” With its breezy style, however, “Clout” occasionally suffers from cliché phrases that do little to enlighten. For instance, the scene of Bella Abzug and Priscilla Ryan campaigning, in “bright new winter wools, a colorful melange of elegance and chic.” And we never do get a satisfactory exploration of an important issue: competition among women candidates. They say that “it remain's a mystery” why Bella Abzug “has been reluctant to endorse and promote women candidates within her own citywide party organization.” In a book brimming with revealing interviews and insights, the mystery is why they didn't find out. “Women in Politics” is a collection of 19. studies, most of which were originally presented at meetings of the American PolitiCal Science Association, here edited by Jane S. Jaquette. While much of the writing is academic, and therefore less than riveting reading, the book is nonetheless both necessary and pioneering as a textbook. As Emmy E. Werner and Louise Bachtold point out, the source material to date is sparse: “A search of the ‘Psychological Abstracts’ from Volume I (1928 to the present) showed more index entries under‐‘gold‐fish’ than under ‘government—women.’ “ And so women have been dumped into the goldfish bowl, here, with some fascinating results: an analysis of female voting patterns; an eye‐opening study of women oiling the machine of Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley; studies of women in Allende's Chile and Lenin's Soviet Union. Again, it is just a beginning. Fishbowl studies are still limited because, as Elsa Chaney, referring to the world at large, writes, “Nowhere is woman's absence more marked than in government.” Except, perhaps, in the power‐wielding ranks of the media, where the second‐class status of female employes has relegated them to the unprestigious “Rooms With No View” of editor Ethel Strainchamps's book. This volume is also a collection —71 essays compiled by members of the Media Women's Association, and written by many women who chose to remain anonymous to keep their jobs. The book attempts to tell what it's really like for women to work in television, newspapers, magazines and book publishing. The clear temptation, if you're in the business, is to turn instantly to the essay on your own company; or, if you're at all successful, on your ex‐company. Unfortunately, the satisfactions not be equal. The essays are uneven, and suffer from the committee approach; some are brisk and punchy, others boring and repetitious. They range from a fine (and shocking) tale of women's woes at the Reader's Digest; to a sober assessment of life at Scholastic Magazines (“Personnel chooses to ignore the fact that 50/50 is not equal when 40 per cent of the women have clerical jobs”); to a sophomoric and ponderous fable that masks the problems of public television; and to a bitter, hopeless view of life as a woman at Simon & Schuster. Another problem, probably unavoidable, is carefully dealt with by Editor Strainchamps in her preface. Many of the essays were written in a burst of spirit two years ago; but after a round of publishing horrors that exemplify women's problems, some have simply become outdated. And yet, there are sharp and timeless insights here, several of which have nothing to do with misogyny. For instance, the essay on E. P. Dutton reveals that “the myth that publishing is not a big business, but a higher calling, is a pernicious one that enables publishers to keep the salaries of women (and men) below those of other industries.” And this quote passed on by a contributor to Vogue: “You don't have to have a title or a name like Consuelo to work on Vogue, but it will help you get there.” Along the way, this book can best be regarded for its historical value, a picture of what has been, and in some cases, still is. The appendix, with reprints of landmark documents by groups of women at Time, Inc., Newsweek, CBS and the Associated Press, makes it an even more valuable handbook for women in the media trying to get real power. With any luck, and continued hard work, it will all be as outdated as ladies’ auxiliaries some day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Issue Stirs Trenton,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/24/archives/abortion-issue-stirs-trenton-forcing-governors-hand-little-hope-of.html,"TRENTON—A highly controversial measure that would prohibit poor women from receiving Medicaid payMents for abortions “ has cleared the Assembly's Committee on Institutions and Agencies. Although efforts in other states to restrict the use of public funds for abortions have been consistently struck down by the courts, the Medicaid ban here is expected to clear the Legislature easily. Governor Byrne has already said he would sign the measure into law. Last year the United States Supreme Court ruled that no state or governmental agency could interfere with the right of a woman to have an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Forcing Governor's Hand Since then there have been nationwide efforts to circumvent the Court's decision. For example, a constitutional amendment sponsored primarily by the antiabortionist Right to Life organization would effectively bar governmental sanction of abortions. Essentially the Medicaid plan, which the Assembly committee approved last Monday by a vote of 6 to 2, would negate a year‐old ruling by the State Attorney General that authorized the use of state. Medicaid funds for abortions. As a result, payments providing almost $300,000 for such operations have been made. Last June when the State Senate approved a measure identical to the one that cleared the Assembly committee last week, its sponsor, Senator Joseph P. Merlino, Democrat of Mercer County, said it was intended to force the hand of the Governor in interpreting the Supreme Court's abortion decision. Since the bill that cleared the Assembly committee was sponsored by Assemblyman Robert C. Shelton, Democrat of Sussex County, it would have to be merged with the Merlino measure and returned for final concurrence In the Senate. At a news conference Mr. Byrne said he would sign the Merlino bill although he did not deny that he had some doubts about its constitutionality. “Some questions are better left to the courts to decide,” the. Governor said at the time. Little Hope of Compromise In fact Mr. Byrne said much the same thing last month, when he signed another bill that would give nonreligious hospitals and medical personnel the right to refuse to take part in abortions if they opposed them on religious or moral grounds. Unlike many other emo tionally charged issues that have split the Legislature here the abortion one does not hold out the hope of any compromise. This is because opponents of abortion regard such operations as murder, while advocates contend that it is the undeniable right of a mother to decide whether or not she should have a child.. Moreover opponents of the bill banning Medicaid contend that it is discriminsy at the very least, in that it would punish poor women, many of them black, who cannot afford abortions or have access to them, as wealthier women can and do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vatican Reaffirms Strong Opposition To Any Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/26/archives/vatican-reaffirms-strong-opposition-to-any-abortions.html,"ROME, Nov. 25—The Vatican reaffirmed its strong opposition to abortion in a document made public today. The declaration, asserting that “the first right of the human person is his life,” stated that “never, under any pretext, may abortion be resorted to, either by a family or by the political authority, as a legitimate means of regulating births.” The 4,500‐word paper, which also dealt briefly, with the women's liberation movement, was called “Declaration on Procured Abortion.” Franciscus Cardinal Seper, secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and approved by Pope Paul VI, and made public in an English translation. It was believed that the declaration was prompted by recent efforts in Italy and France to legalize abortion. “A Christian can never conform, to a law which is in itself immoral, and such is the ease of a law which would admit in principle the lawfulness of abortion,” the declaration said. The declaration rejected such circumstances as poor health of the mother, or the burden of an additional child as justification for abortion, stating: “None of these reasons can ever objectively confer the right to dispose of another's life, even when that life is only beginning. Life is too fundamental a value to be weighed against even very serious disadvantages.” However, social reforms such as improved adoption laws and help for unwed mothers are necessary, the paper continued.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giscard Reassures French on Economy; Says Growth Will Resume Next Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/27/archives/giscard-reassures-french-on-economy-says-growth-will-resume-next.html,"PARIS, Nov. 26—President Valery Giscard d'Estaing went on television tonight to reassure a nation frightened of unamployment and to defend himself against growing personal criticism. Special to The New York Times The President, at the end of his first six months in office spoke of “difficulties” that he said France had “the will and the means” to overcame. Promising that economic expansion would resume in 1975, he said that the Government would right unemployment, devise special means to help businesses in trouble and at the same time continue to slow inflation. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing explained carefully that inflation was partly a result of forces beyond France's control—“the disorder of the great currencies” and the sudden increase in the price of oil, which he likened to a foreign tax of nearly $400 imposed on every French citizen. Though he said there were also domestic causes for the nation's economic troubles, the President did not list them. “We are not in a situation of great crisis, great depression, where one could fear a massive fall in production,” he said. Help for Auto Industry He promised special help to the automobile industry and some others, a special emergency economic program by next Tuesday and an over‐all program of reform for next spring. Workers in those categories that have been particularly hard‐hit, he said, in an apparent reference to garbage collectors and possibly postal workers, will get extra consideration. A poll published yesterday showed deep national pessimsm and a sharp drop in public confidence in President Giscard d'Eitaing's ability to deal with a turbulent crisis. The poll, conducted by Figaro‐Sofres, showed that 77 per cent of Frenchmen expected things to get worse, compared with less then 50 per cent last summer. Sixty‐three per cent thought there could be a repetition of the political upheaval and violence that occurred here in May, 1968, during the next two or three months, compared with 52 per cent in September. Only 42 per cent said they thought the President could ace up to such a situation, while 38 per cent said he could not. This compared with 54 per cent who were confident in September and 27 per cent who doubted his capacity. Unemployment moved ahead of inflation as the task to which those polled wanted the Government to give priority attention. Forty per cent expressed prime concern over unemployment, as against 38 per cent over inflation. More Layoffs Announced Meanwhile, Citroën announced the layoff of 2,700 more workers. Major labor unions called for another day of “national action’ next Tuesday, although their attempted one‐day general strike last week drew only lukewarm response from workers, as Mr. Giscard d'Estaing noted with satisfaction in his speech. The President, in his address, spoke briefly on the abortion reform bill presented to the National Assembly today, a hotly debated measure that will provide his administration's first serious test in the Assembly. The Government has proclaimed a “vote of conscience” and will not take a rejection of the bill—which is considered unlikely—as a vote of no‐confidence. While he did not spell out his economic plans, the President answered in some detail a series of personal criticisms that have been mounting in the press, including an unusually sharp front‐page article today in Le Monde. Under the heading, “A Certain Solitary Exercise of Power,” France's most respected paper said the President was as secretive as his predecessor but that this was to hide his personal life rather than a fatal illness, as was the case with the late Georges Pompidou. “His staff seldom knows where he is,” the paper said, noting that the President has not moved his family into the Elysee Palace but sometimes sleeps there after dining out. On weekends, Le Monde said, he leaves a sealed letter saying where he can be found in case of emergency. Rumors of Accident Cited Le Monde referred to an accident in which Mr. Giscard d'Estaing reportedly crashed a car into a milk truck at 5 .A.M. on the Champs Elysees some months ago. It noted that the incident had been denied but said the report had spread so widely had that it become “a political fact.” The paper did not mention that, according to the rumor, the car that the President was driving alone belonged to Roger Vadim, the film director who launch the career of Brigitte Bardot, but if alluded to Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's insistence on a “private and personal” life. The President, in his speech, sought to reassure the public on how his “responsibility for the fate of France and for your fate will be carried out.” He said that France was “a republican democratic state” and that he provided, a “collective leadership” with the whole society. “I consider all Frenchmen the same, engineers and streetsweepers,” he said, evidently in response to charges that he snobbishly prefers the company of aristocrats to that of politicians and high civil servants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$33‐Billion Fund Bill Approved; President Is Expected to Sign It,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/27/archives/33billion-fund-bill-approved-president-is-expected-to-sign-it.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 —The Senate and House gave final approval today to a $33‐billion appropriation bill for the department of Labor, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and other agencies. The measure had been worked out in advance with the White House, and President Ford is expected to Sign it. The House passed a $29‐billion appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare five months ago, but enactment was stalled by differences between President Ford and Congressional leaders over amounts in the bill. Those were resolved in discussions between Senate and House leaders and the President. Senate and House conferees last week shopped $1.2‐billion in funds for welfare payments from the bill, but supplemental public assistance funds could be provided if they were needed as a result of increased unemployment that might result from poor national economic conditions. But today's version of the bill directs that if the added Welfare money is needed, it come not from new legislation but froth other Federal programs as a result of cuts in those programs made by the White House. Congressmen opposed to abortion tried but failed to add an amendment that would have prohibited use of Federal funds to pay for such operations. The Senate voted such an amendment in its version of the bill two months ago, but it was deleted by the conferees on the ground that an “appropriation bill is an improper vehicle for a controversial and far‐reaching legislative provision.” The conferees also deleted House‐approved language designed to limit the use of Federal funds to bus schoolcbildren for the purpose of racial desegregation. Furthermore, the conferees specified that sex discrimanation tion laws should not be applied to prevent such organizations as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and fraternities and sororities from functioning at schools and colleges. Other sections of the H.E.W.Labor bill provide largeamounts of money for manpower assistance, the National Institutes of Health and higher education. New York By‐Passed The final bill was cleared by the House by a vote of 352 to 25 and by the Senate by a vote of 68 to 17. Also passed by the House was the $3‐billion military construction appropriations bill to pay for armed forces projects around the world. Virtually none of the money goes to the New York metropolitan area. Among the appropriations is $18‐million for the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean and $100‐million for the construction of facilities for the Navy's Trident submarine program. The bill passed 341 to 33. Water Bill Voted WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 (UPI) — The Senate passed today a $156‐million, three‐year bill to establish stringent Federal standards to protect public drinking water supplies. The measure was approved by voice vote and sent back to the House after the Senate accepted an amendment by Senator Philip A. Hart, Democrat of Michigan, to allow each state eligibility for at least 1 per cent of the Federal grants provided to implement the new standards. The House Passed the original bill Nov. 19. Senate Approves Delay  WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 (AP) —The Senate adopted today a resolution to delay the convening of the next Congress from Jan. 3 to Jan 14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/28/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"Shafiq al‐Hout, who heads the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beirut, announced yesterday that the organization had arrested 26 persons in Lebanon and other Arab countries on suspicion of involvement in the hijacking of a British airliner to Tunis last weekend. He said at a news conference that they would be tried in open court and that such incidents harmed the Palestine cause. [Page 1, Columns 1–2.] THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1974 International Criticism of the tentative arms control agreement reached by President Ford and Leonid I. Brezhnev has begun to develop in Washington, with some Administration officials expecting a fight in Congress. The chief focus of the critics was on letting each side place multiple warheads on more than 1,200 of its missiles. Since the Russians have developed larger land‐based missiles than the United States, some experts said that with multiple warheads they might be able to endanger American missile sites. [1:4.] By a 56‐to‐54 vote, the General Assembly decided to let the Cambodian Government of President Lon Nol keep its seat in the United Nations in the face of a campaign to seat the representatives of Prince Sihanouk's rival government‐in‐exile. [1:3.] Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard, the South African heart transplant surgeon, is encouraged but not yet reporting success for the operation on Monday in which he gave a patient a second heart. In a telephone interview at his Cape Town home, he said he was eager to do the same operation on a waiting patient as soon as a suitable donor is found. He said the two hearts beat independently at different rates. [1:1–2.] National Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, predicted a “permanent decline of our nation's economic and political power” unless world oil prices could be forced down, mainly through a new oil conservation effort in this country. In grim testimony before a Congressional committee, he suggested as possible approaches to energy conservation “a sizable tax on gasoline, or on imported oil, or on automobiles according to their weight or horsepower.” [1:8.] James F. Neal, chief prosecutor at the Watergate cover‐up trial, wound up his long and often bitter cross‐examination of former Attorney General John N. Mitchell with the charge that he was “stonewalling” and hiding the truth. Mr. Mitchell heatedly denied the charges. In answering many questions he said that he could not recall; to others he said that some allegedly perjurious testimony was “literally true.” [1:1–2.] An official recount in New Hampshire of the United States Senate vote showed the Democratic candidate, John A. Durkin, the winner by 10 votes over Representative Louis C. Wyman, a Republican, Mr. Wyman said he would appeal the decision to the state's three‐member Ballot Law commission. [1:1–3.] Metropolitan Eight fire companies, in four boroughs, will be closed by Dec. 14 as part of a Fire Department cutback to save $8.3‐million. Other reductions, in auxiliary services, will enable the department to cut costs enough so that it will not be necessary to close a total of 12 companies, as Mayor Beame had announced last Friday. The closings were strongly denounced by the firefighters’ and fire officers associations. [1:5.] James F. Regan, president of the Board of Education, said that the board was willing to trim $45‐million from its $1‐billion budget in response to Mayor Beame's efforts to reduce the city's huge budget deficit. He pledged “no essential classroom services” would be lost. A separate response is being prepared for the Mayor by the community school boards. [1:6] According to a participant from the Board of Education staff, Joseph Monserrat, a member of the board, attended meetings here and in Puerto Rico involving the board's $211,660 contract with a manpower training company that was paying him as a public relations consultant. This account by Bernard Esrig, personnel and research administrator, appeared to conflict with Mr. Monserrat's statements that he had nothing to do with the 1971 award of the contract to the company, which paid him $21,000. [1:7.] Burton N. Pugach, who was convicted 13 years ago of hiring three thugs to blind his girlfriend, Linda Riss, so that “no one else will want you,” married her yesterday. She had terminated their engagement when she found out that he was married. While he was in prison his wife divorced him. Released in March, he proposed marriage to Miss Riss on a television program she saw. The lye attack left her legally blind, but she reportedly has some sight in one eye.

Legal‐Abortion Bill Advances in France After Heated Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/29/archives/legalabortion-bill-advances-in-france-after-heater-debate.html,"PARIS, Friday, Nov. 29—The French National Assembly early this morning passed a bill legalizing abortion through the 10th week of pregnancy. By United Press International The vote, after three days of heated debate, came at 3:40 A.M., Paris time (9:40 P.M. Thursday, New York time.) In favor were 284 Deputies, 38 more than the necessary majority of 246. There were 189 votes against the measure and 17 abstentions or absences. The abortion bill now goes to the Senate, where it is scheduled to be debated next month. If it is passed there, it comes back to the Assembly for a final vote. Unlike in the United States, President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing does not have to sign it and lacks veto power. The bill would permit a woman to have an abortion through the 10th week of pregnancy, replacing a 1920 law that outlawed all abortions except where the life of the mother was endangered. That law is seldom enforced, and some 300,000 illegal abortions are estimated to be performed in France annually. Support for the bill cut across party lines and came mostly from the Left. Many of the President's own IndependentRepublican or Gaullist allies voted against the measure. During the final night of heated debate, during which time several amendments to soften the bill were voted down, heated and sometimes abusive charges were exchanged. One opponent shouted at the bill's sponsor, Health Minister Simone Veil, “Then do you want to send our children to the cremation, furnaces?” Mrs. Veil said that antiabortion forces had flooded. Parliament with “dishonorable pamphlets,” sent out Nazi emblems and annoyed ministers at home with telephone calls. Foes of the liberalized abortion measure included a Deputy who played a tape of the heartbeat of a fetus and a Premier under Charles de Gaulle, Michael Debré, who argued that easy abortions would further reduce France's birth rate and place her in danger from Asian and North African countries. “When the demographic imbalance between these groups of nations and ours becomes too great,” Mr. Debré asserted, “peace will be threatened.” The Vatican, in an attempt to sway opinion in Roman Catholic France, made a strong antiabortion declaration on Monday, saying that nothing not even the risk to a mother's life justified abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/news-summary-and-index-national-metropolitan-index-to-the-other.html,"India and Pakistan moved to end their 10‐year ban on trade relations—dating from the 1965 war over the Kashmir issue—with the signing of a protocol stating that the ban would be lifted Dec. 7. The decision to end the ban fulfills a crucial aspect of the peace agreement signed by the two countries in July, 1972, that provided for a renewal of relations broken when the two countries fought over the new nation of Bangladesh. Indian and Pakistani officials told newsmen that the question of resuming diplomatic relations was being considered but the resumption of trading need not wait for that. [Page 1, Columns 2–3.] SUNDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1974 The Day—Section 1 The Major Events of International Two armed Arabs seized a house in the village of Rihaniya in upper Galilee, shot an Israeli Moslem dead and later surrendered to Israeli forces. Military headquarters in Tel Aviv said that the gunmen were infiltrators from Lebanon and that they apparently believed they were in a Jewish village. [1:2–3.] Egyptian officials said that Arab governments in their contacts with the United States have been pressing for February as the time when they want the peace conference in Geneva reconvened. The United States and Israel would like to have the conference called at a later date, but many Arab diplomats regard February as a deadline by which the United States must produce another Israeli military withdrawal. An Egyptian official said “the rush for Geneva is on, we are trying to expedite it, we think it is urgent, we need it to give new momentum to the search for a negotiated settlement.” [15:1.] Secretary of State Kissinger flew back to Washington from Tokyo after briefing Japan's Foreign Minister, Toshio Kimura, on his talks with Chinese leaders in Peking. President Ford's visit to China next year was discussed together with international problems involving China, according to Japanese Foreign Ministry official, who said that Mr. Kissinger also had promised Mr. Kimura that Japan would be kept adequately informed about future United States policies toward China. [1:1] National Members of the United Mine Workers' largest and most politically volatile coal‐field district hooted disapproval and honked automobile horns in a protest caravan through Beckley, W. Va., as union leaders appealed to them to ratify a proposed strike settlement with the mine operators. In a secretballot contract ratification vote that will be held tomorrow among most of the union's active members, the miners are to have the last word on whether the mine operators have offered enough in their tentative agreement with Arnold R. Miller, the union's prsident, who has insisted the companies have no more to give. [1:4.] Pioneer 11, after a coasting journey of almost two years, is plunging at ever increasing speed toward its crack‐the‐whip trip around Jupiter tomorrow night. It imaging system is sending excellent pictures and is expected to provide views of Jupiter's polar regions that are a prime goal of the encounter. Early Tuesday morning, 22 minutes after midnight Eastern standard time, Pioneer 11 will come within 26,600 miles of Jupiter—one‐third the distance of the flyby of its predecessor, Pioneer 10—and it will be traveling at 107,000 miles an hour relative to the planet. [1:3–4.] QUOTATION OF THE DAY: “My own conviction is that the public will understand the dimensions of the crisis, will react well to candor and leadership, and will acknowledge the need for significant cuts in spending.”‐City Controller Harrison J. Goldin, warning that the city faced a deficit of $650‐million. [1:8.] College fraternities and sororities, which fell on hard times during the social activism of the nineteen‐sixties are enjoying a resurgence on many campuses. The organizations are different from those that many students shunned a decade ago: Fraternity and sorority life is now marked by more academic seriousness and even social consciousness, a survey of a dozen campuses from East to West finds, [1:5.7.] The historic egalitarian purpose for which Congress established land‐grant colleges more than a 100 years ago is being eroded by steeply rising tuition fees and inflation. The traditionally high quality, low‐cost college education offered by land‐grant colleges and universities is something that not even relatively affluent middle‐class families can. afford. College administrators all over the country, confronted with the prosepct of raising tuition fees even higher in the face of declining enrollments, are watching with keen interest the fate of an unusual proposal by the president and regents of the University of Wisconsin that tution fees be shharply cut. John C. Weaver, the president, believes the taxpayer should pick up the tab for rising costs. [58:1.] Metropolitan Controller Harrison J. Goldin informed Mayor Beame in a letter that the deficit piling up in this year's city expense budget under recessionary and inflationary pressures would total $650‐million, not the $430‐million the Mayor predicted three weeks ago. Mr. Goldin said he was forecasting the higher figure on the basis of a new analysis actual spending and revenues in the first four months of the fiscal year, which began July 1, and on projections for the remaining seven months of the year. Responding for Mr. Beane, who is vacationing in Florida, First Deputy Mayor James A. Cavanagh rejected Mr. Goldin's figures as “inaccurate,” and said the letter was no help because it made no suggestions on how to make new economies. [1:8.] Budget officials in the Beame administration said that they had made widespread gains in improving productivity of many city programs, and they announced new goals for improvements in performance by end of this fiscal year. Many of the goals announced reflected shifts in priorities away from those established by former Mayor John V. Lindsay in sanitation collection, consumer affairs and street repairs.

RIGHTS SUIT SEEKS TO BAR DATA PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/rights-suit-seeks-to-bar-data-plan-aim-is-to-prevent-abuses-2-girls.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 30—Two 15‐year‐old girls who had abortions under Medi‐Cal, the California program of medical aid to the poor, have filed a civil rights suit in Federal District Court here to stop the state from violating their right of privacy by mailing detailed medical statements to their homes. The statements are part of Federal program attempting to stop fraud by doctors participating in the Medi‐Cal program. The Complaint, filed this week, said that the two girls, identified only as Mary Doe and Susan Roe, fictitious names used to avoid disclosing their identities because of possible embarrassment, had abortions within the last month. Both contended that mailing the notices to their homes would make this information available to their parents. California law provides that minors can receive such care Without the, knowledge or consent of the parents. In January, the Federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the California. Department of Health plan to begun a program called Beneficiary Explanation of Medical Benefits. The suit contended that this program would make available to third parties, such as parents, confidential and privileged medical information under the guise of verifying physicians' claims for reimbursement. Aim Is to Prevent Abuses The idea is that the patient will inform the state if the statement he receives lists services that were not performed and that it will thus help prevent abuses in the Medi‐Cal program. In a pilot program in September, the suit said, such notices were sent to 4,000 recipients' in 14 California counties. Notices for all Medi‐Cal recipients of a single household were sent in one envelope. The suit contended that this showed there would be “a particularly acute” invasion of privacy where recipients were minors, spouses or individuals living in multiple households. Returns in the pilot program were low and have led to no prosecutions fraud thus far. The plaintifs, who also include the San Francisco Interagency Pregnancy Council, the Coalition of Medical Rights of Women, and the Berkeley Wo men's Health Collective, said that the program would dis courage poor people from obtaining necessary medical services such as veneral disease treatment, contraceptives, pregnancy or abortion services, drug and alcoholic treatment or psychiatric counseling. The suit was filed on behalf of all such recipients as a class. The motivation for the state to institute the program is largely financial, the suit contended. The Federal Government encourages states operating Medicaid programs to institute mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems. The Federal Government agrees to provide states with 90 per cent of the costs of developing such computer systems. Additionally, the law provides that 75 per cent of the cost of operation of such a system shall be paid by the Federal Government if the participating state meets certain conditions, including implementing the beneficiary explanation program. Thus far, the state of Michigan has had the fullest experience with the program. Paul Allen, director of Medicaid for Michigan, said that over a four‐month period the state had sent out 1.7‐million beneficiary explanation forms and had got back only 2,100 in which the recipients raised questions about the services they allegedly received. “I think the program is overdone,” Mr, Allen said; adding that it had not “proved cost ef fective.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/the-world-the-i-r-a-is-outlawed-in-britain-nothing-is-easy-not-even.html,"The disputants in the Middle East if were maneuvering for superior position last week but whether for renewed peace talks or renewed fighting was not clear. Here is what the parties did: The Syrians: A principal cause of anxiety in the last two weeks had been reports that Syria would not renew the mandate permitting United Nations forces to patrol a buffer zone between Syrian and Israeli forces on the Golan Hights. The Syrians did agree to the renewal, but after a trip to the area, the United Nations Secretary General, Kurt Waldheim, said he feared war could resume. unless a breakthrough is made in peace negotiations before next spring. The Israelis: The recent decision of the United Nations General Assembly to grant official diplomatic status to the Palestinian Liberation. Organizetion had caused dismay in Israel. Earlier, the conference of Arab leaders in Rabat had recognized the P.L.O.,as spokesmen for all the Palestinians. Together, the two actions created great pressure on Israel to meet at peace talks face to face with the P.L.O., which could form the nucleus of a government for any land that Israel agrees to relinquish on the West Bank of the Jordan River Israel has refused to meet with the P.L.O. ‘Fortress Jerusalem’ Perhaps to emphasize the point that Israel will not give up the West Bank easily, it was announced last week that a major new industrial center will be built on the outskirts of Jerusalem on what used to be Jordanian territory. The Israelis have already built an almost unbroken line of apartments, schools and army installations around the city and the new installation will complete what the newspaper, The Jerusalem Post; calls' “fortress Jerusalem.” The Palestinians: The P.L.O. was seeking to present a newly moderate profile. It denounced the hijacking of a British airliner to Tunis and said it had taken 26 persons in Lebanon into custody for a later trial for conspiracy in the event. In Moscow, where the P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat conferred with Premier Alexei Kosygin, there were reports that a principal item of discussion had been the formation of a Palestinian government ‐ in ‐ exile composed of moderates prepared to negotiate with, rather, than to fight Israel. A high P.L.O official said in Damascus that his group would recognize Israel if she withdrew to the boundaries set in the 1947 United Nations partition plan for Palestine. Other Palestinians continued with violent ways, however. On Friday five guerrillas were killed by Israeli forces as they tried to infiltrate northern Galilee from Lebanon. The Israelis said the guerrillas were armed with rockets, bazookas and Kalashnikov rifles. Tanaka Is Out But His Influence May Linger Kakuei Tanaka has resigned as Premier of Japan as expected, but he will have a major role in his party's choice of a successor and it is probable the new Government will have a different style but policies much the same as the old one. Mr. Tanaka's inability to cope with economic problems along with burgeoning reports of unrefuted charges of personal corruption had brought his popularity to a low point just as he was receiving President Ford on the first visit to Japan ever made by a sitting American President. Mr. Tanaka's successor is likely to be either Takeo Fukuda, who lost a race for the Premiership in 1972 or Masayoshi Ohira, Mr. Tanaka's Finance Minister. A ‘House Cleaner’ Mr. Fukuda is a straightforward man with a wry sense of humor and little pretense. He would he decisive and articulate in expressing his policy objectives, more openly pro‐American than Mr. Tanaka's. He is conservative on economic issues, only mildly enthusiastic about Japan's growing ties with China and anxious to improve his country's strained relationship with Taiwan. Because he broke with Mr. Tanaka's leadership of the LiberalDemocratic party after it suffered badly in national elections last June, Mr. Fukuda is in a position to at least appear to be cleaning house in the party. This would not be true for Mr. Ohira, who is close to Mr. Tanaka, still defends his administration and needs his continued support to become Premier. Mr. Ohira is an advocate of the “equidistant policy” of maintaining equal distance from Washington, Moscow and Peking, and advocates aggressive expansion of Japan's ties with China. There are several other contenders, including Etsusaburo Shline, a former Foreign Minister who might become a caretaker Premier to hold the party together until the next regular elections in July. The I.R.A. Is Outlawed In Britain To combat terrorism in England by the Irish Republican Army, the British Government has given the police broad powers of arrest and detention imposed tighter controls over travel between England aid Ireland, and outlawed the I.R.A. The Government had been moved to emergency action by an I.R.A. bomb attack on Oct. 21 on two pubs in Birmingham where 19 persons died and nearly 200 were injured. It was the most severe single incident in a campaign started in 1972 by the I.R.A. to shock the British public into demanding a British withdrawal from Ulster. New Bombs At least 44 persons have died in the attacks which continued last week as new bombs went off in mailboxes in London, injuring 20 persons. As the new measures were rushed through. Parliament, they were generally applauded. Conservative leader Edward Heath, giving the Opposition's full support, said that “in a free democratic society we would prefer not to take such powers,” but “the present situation demands this.” But in Parliament and among the public there was some skepticism about the effectiveness of the plan. The I.R.A. his long been outlawed without much success in the Irish Republic and in Ulster, where the recurrence of sectarian strife between the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority has been embittered by both I.R.A. and Protestant terrorists. And the longer period police can offically hold suspects before charging them will not mean much change since the law has always been blurred. Nothing Is Easy, Not Even Talks On Barents Sea Norway and the Soviet Union have opened what ought to be relatively routine negotiations concerning control of an area of 58,000 square miles in the Barents Sea, but the talks may become complicated. The area involved is potentially rich with oil; an old treaty may give 28 other nations a claim to that wealth, and the Soviets are concerned not only for the oil but for the security of a major naval base nearby. The legal question involves the boundary of Norway's continental shelf and that of the Spitsbergen Islands, which she governs. Although the Russians have not yet made their claims known, it is believed they want the boundary marked closer to Norway and Spitsbergen and farther away from the Soviet shore. The disagreement was confined to the two, nations until the recent discovery of oil and natural gas beds under the shallow water around Spitsbergen. The treaty under which Norway governs Spitsbergen gives 28 other nations the right to exploit the islands' natural resources. Among those nations are several that may want to do so. That possibility is of special concern to Russia because her largest fleet is based at Murmansk and has ice free, year around passage through the Barents Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Russia reportedly seeks to influence Norway during the negotiations to use her administrative powers over Spitsbergen to prevent a foreign presence. For her own reasons of oil exploration and security, Norway may be ready to agree. The World Continued In Summary New Food Talks, Same Question: Who Will Pay? The nations that produce excess grain and those that want it met in Rome last week and agreed on what was needed: 7.5 million tons costing $1.8‐billion. But they could not agree on how to get the food to the estimated 500 million persons in the world who face starvation or malnutrition without it. The meeting, arranged during last month's United Nations World Food Conference where two similar discussions also prov,ed inconclusive, will resume this week in New York. The earlier meetings had been attended by the Soviet Union and China. This time they did not show up, though no one would say why. The grain producers at last week's meeting, the United States, Canada, the Common Market, Australia and Argentina, were able to assure the most seriously affectéd countries, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and several African nations, that there is enough grain to meet the immediate crisis. The question is who will pay for it. Before this week's New York session, Kurt Waldheim, the United Nations Secretary General, and Raoul Prebisch, head of the United Nations Emergency Operation, are to approach the Middle East's newly rich oil nations for help. The United States has long been the world's largest grain producer and it had been hoped that Washington would provide much of the help. But last week it was revealed that previous estimates of how much American grain would be available had been over‐optimistic. Estimates in September suggested there might be as much as 3.3 million tons. Last week the Administration said that, based on latest crop reports., there might be only one million. Giscard Appeals To Increisingly Skeptical French Responding to strong evidence that the French are disenchanted with his handling of the economy, President Valéy Giscard d'Estaing has taken the unusual step of defending his past performance on national television and, while doing so, promising new and strong action soon. The day before he spoke, a poll conducted by Figaro‐Sofres reported that 77 per cent of the French expect unemployment and the 17 per cent inflation rate to get worse. The poll also showed that 38 per cent of the respondents doubted Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's ability to cope with the economy; the figure in September had been 27 per cent. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing promised to make public this week an emergency economic program to provide help for business, particularly the auto industry. Citroën, France's third largest automaker, announced new layolfs last week.Major labor unions have called for another day of “national action,” a general work stoppage, this Tuesday. The criticism of the President extends beyond economic matters to his personal life. Le Monde; France's most respected paper, said in a front‐page article“His staff seldom knows where he is” The paper said that on weekends the President leaves a sealed letter telling where he can be reached in an emergency. The paper also mentioned reports. denied by authorities, that a car driven by the President had crashed into, a milk truck on the Champs Elysées at 5 o'clock one recent morning. The Abortion Furor Adding to the political uneasiness was a rancorous debate in the National Assembly over legalizing abortion through the 10th week of pregnancy. The bill, to repeal a rigorous 1920 law that mandated heavy fines and jail sentences for those performing abortions and those undergoing them, finally passed by 284 to 189, with 17 not voting: The bill now goes to the Senate. The measure was sponsored by Health Minister Simone Veil, who is Jewish, and it was bitterly opposed by Catholic deputies, one of whom shouted at Mrs. Veil: “Do you want to send our children to the cremation furnaces?” But, with 300,000 illegal abortions now performed annually and tens of thousands of other women going abroad for the operations, the proabortion, forces had arguments that/prevailed. Abroad, too, there has been disenchantment with Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's performance. Reports from Bonn last week said West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, once regarded as a strong supporter of the French leader, now believes he lacks sufficient domestic political support to cope with France's difficulties. The chief source of Mr. Schmidt's disappointment has been the French Government's failure to end labor unrest and its hesitation about joining concerted Western efforts to combat rising oil prices. Some officials in Bonn believe that as a result, West Germany may abandon her effort to woo France back into a united European front and instead will cooperate more closely with American efforts to dee with the international financial dislocations caused by the high price bf oil. U.N. Vote Lets Lon Nol Drift Another Year The Cambodian Government headed by Marshal Lon Nol has survived a vote, by the narrowest of margins, to oust it from the United Nations and replace it with the exile regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. However, as New York Times correspondent Sydney H. Schanberg reported last week, the diplomatic victory meant little in Lon Nol's capital, Phnom Penh, Although Phnom Penh is no longer under immediate military threat from Communist‐led insurgents, as it was a year ago when rockets and artillery shells struck the city frequently, people. of the city now seem more pessimistic. Inflation is running above 250 per cent, people are eating less and selling belongings and seeking extra jobs. Robberies are frequent, married women of poor families are turning to prostitution and there are reports that starving refugees are eating rats and dogs. The internal decay of the Lon Nol regime was not, enough to bring success to its enemies in the United Nations. A drive led by China, Algeria and Yugoslavia to oust the Lon Nol delegates was defeated by a vote of 56 to 54, with 24 abstentions. Misgivings about China's intentions in Cambodia (Prince Sihanouk lives in Peking) were given as a principal reason why several key Asian nations, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, failed to support the proposal. The outcome was the one sought by the United States, which provides most of Lon Nol's support. In recent General Assembly votes, most notably on the issue of recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization, the United States position was overcome by a coalition of African, Asian and Arab countries. This time the coalition fell apart. Death in Ethiopia, But Why? Ethiopia's new military rulers, who have promised reforms to relieve their country's feudal poverty and oppression, unexpectedly executed 60 former military and civilian leaders last week. The sudden mayhem has raised what are for now unanswerable questions about the kind of government the new leaders want, and about how much help they can expect from other nations in improving the quality of their citizens' lives. The executions were called an “act of justice” by the Provisional Military Administrative Committee, which rules the nation. Among those who died was Lieut. Gen. Aman Andom, the committee's leader until a week before. It is believed that snooting began when he resisted an attempt by other Soldiers on the committee to have him arrested for refusing to send troops to quell guerilla activities in Eritrea, a northern province; Gen. Aman was an Eritrean. It is not known whether Gen. Aman was killed or committed suicide rather than be captured, but after his death, the committee, apparently decided to execute the other victims in order to minimize reaction. He was said to be popular with ordinary Ethiopians, who remained generally quiet. Other nations, however, condemned the, killings and also reports, apparently unfounded, that the committee planned to execute former Emperor Haile Selassie. A grandson of the emperor was said to be negotiating with the Eritrean dissidents in an effort to challenge the junta; disaffection in the northern province seemed not to have been diminished when Brig. Gen. Tafari Banti, a close friend of Gen. Aman replaced him. When the committee of soldiers took over Ethiopia in, late summer, they were described as largely idealistic, committed to constitutional reform, education for ordinary Ethiopians and an end to the oppressive rule of an absolute monarch. It is still not certain what they want or how they mean to achieve it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/the-nation-marking-time-on-rockefeller-late-returns-an-unfair.html,"The question of whether Richard Nixon would ever testify at the trial of his former aides has now been answered, at least tentatively: He probably will not. A team of three doctors appointed by Federal Judge John J. Sirica to examine Mr. Nixon reported that the former president is too ill even to give legal depositions in his home before January 6. The doctors said they had examined Mr. Nixon at his estate in San Clemente, where he is recuperating from surgery for his phlebitis, with the former President's consent and cooperation,” and that they had also interviewed his surgeon and examined all the pertinent medical records. They concluded that while they could not be exact about when Mr. Nixon could travel “without excessive risk,” that should be possible by midFebruary, assuming he continues his current rate of recovery. Given that same recovery rate, they said, he might be able to testify in person near his home by Feb. 2 and by deposition by January 6. Judge Sirica has said he hopes the trial will end this month. Mr. Nixon's testimony has been sought by John D. Ehrlichman, who claims it is vital to his defense. It is not yet known what Mr. Ehrlichman will do in response to the doctors' report; he may seek to have his trial separated from that of the other four defendants. It is also possible that Judge Sirjca will rule that the trial can proceed without Mr. Nixon's testimony in any form. Now The Defense The defense is now underway. The prosecution rested its case against the five defendants last Monday and Judge Sirica denied, with two minor exceptions, all defense motions for directed verdicts of acquittal. Technically, that meant Judge Sirica agreed, and was so ruling, that the Government had established over the last eight weeks a prima facie case for 10 of its 12 charges against the defendants. The two counts dismissed by the Judge, one against John N. Mitchell and one against John D. Erhlichman, were based on a law making it a crime to give unsworn false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Most observers believe that 28 prosecution witnesses and 30 of Mr. Nixon's unedited tape recordings have made a strong case against the Watergate cover‐up defendants. The attorneys for all five defendants are expected to try to convince the jury that while a conspiracy may have existed, their clients were not part of it. Each defendant may try to lay blame on the others, and perhaps on Mr. Nixon. The former President has been pardoned by President Ford and is beyond the reach of the law for any crimes he committed in office. All five defendants are expected to testify. Mr. Mitchell and H. R. Haldeman have already done so. The other defendants are Mr. Ehrlichman, Robert C. Mardian, former Assistant Attorney General, and Kenneth Wells Parkinson, former attorney for President Nixon's 1972 re‐election committee. All are charged with conspiracy and all but Mr. Mardian with obstruction of justice. The Oil Pressure On Ford Is Going Up Rapidly President Ford, seemingly alone in his Administration in his opposition to strong, mandatory energy‐saving measures, is coming under increasing public pressure to abandon his stance. The normally cautious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Arthur Burns, has urged the Government to plan immediately for mandatory action on an “austerity” level as the only way to bring oil prices down. Dr. Burns, whose position is legally outside a President's administrative control, offered three frequently mentioned ways of drastically reducing oil consumption: A sizable new tax on gasoline, a tax on oil imports or a tax on the weight or horsepower of automobiles. Mr. Ford may well be getting similar advice soon, if he has not already, from Frank G. Zarb, nominated by the President last week to become the Federal Energy Administrator. He is a Wall Street management expert who has been serving, and will continue to serve, as executive director of the Energy Resources Council. Mr, Zarb and other members of thecouncil must help the President prepare a major statement on energy policy to be delivered to Congress in January. The Project Independence report released two weeks ago is the basic working paper for the policy‐makers, and it was generally read, to mean that mandatory measures to reduce consumption of foreign oil are inevitable. Such measures are also, contemplated by all industrialized consuming nations who subscribe to the new International Energy Agency, a loan‐fund “safety net” to” aid countries paying huge sums for oil. An Unfair Burden? The agency was created largely on the initiative of Secretary of State Kissinger, who has warned that neither the Arab oil. producers nor other consuming countries would be much impressed by appeals' to Americans for voluntary oil saving. The President, however, said once again last week, through his press secretary, that he is against such steps. In the past, Mr. Ford has stressed that he is unwilling to impose such measures until it is clearly proven that voluntary measures will not. work. A higher gasoline tax, in particular, Mr. Ford argues, would impose an unfair burden on certain segments of the population, such as independent truckers and the millions of Americans who must use cars to get to work. There also may be a political calculation involved in Mr. Ford's opposition. Many Republicans in Congress, as well as the big oil companies that still wield great influence on energy policy, oppose mandatory measures. If Mr. Ford holds out long enough, there is the chance that his economic advisers will make mandatory measures seem imperative, or the. Democrats in Congress will institute such measures on their own. If that happens, the onus for what may will be a politically unpopular measure will not fall on Mr. Ford. Marking Time On Rockefeller The House Judiciary Committee heard Nelson Rockefeller's, ideological opponents denounce him from the right and left last week, but it has not yet explored fully the question of his family's fortune and any connection it may have to his confirmation for the Vice Presidency. Several members of the committee want to know the details of the Rockefeller fortune, and not merely Nelson Rockefeller's holdings. They contend that is the only way to judge whether there are serious hazards in combining Rockefeller wealth with national office, and also the only way to determine whether the family wealth has been used properly in advancing his political career. Mr. Rockefeller has promised to consult with other members of his family who he said have always been reluctant to become publicly involved in his career in government and politics, but he has not yet told the House committee whether they are willing to make available the requested information. Last week, a number of witnesses attacked Mr. Rockefeller for his role in suppressing the Altica rebellion, favoring abortion reform, raising taxes and budgets in the state and for his political philosophy in general. He is not expected to resume his testimony before the House committee until this week. The committee was not disposed to push matters last week, particularly in view of the pressures on him as the result of his wife's surgery. Mrs. Rockefeller, who recently had her left breast removed when it was found to be cancerous, had her right breast removed last week when it too showed traces of malignancy. She was reported to be recuperating well. Late Returns Revised election returns show that the net gain of three Senate seats achieved by the Democrats has been increased to four, and that the Republicans unseated the Democratic Governor of Alaska. John A. Durkin, a liberal Democrat who apparently had lost the New Hampshire Senate race by 528 votes, is ahead by 10 votes in a recount. The result may change again; Republican Representative Louis C. Wyman will challenge the recount. In Alaska, State Senator Jay Hammond has unseated Democratic incumbent Gov. William Egan by 287 votes. Gov. Egari appeared to have won by less than 200 votes before the recount. He will not challenge the new results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nine City Workers Cited for Outstanding Service,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/04/archives/nine-city-workers-cited-for-outstanding-service.html,"Every army has its decoration day—an occasion for recognition, when officers and rank 'n file soldiers are summoned forward to be cited for extraordinary acts that may serve as inspiration for others. With the city's municipal army—350,000 employes who run everything from drugtreatment programs to sanitation trucks—it is no different. And so, nine civil servants were singled out yesterday as “representatives of the best of New York City's career employes” and presented with awards for their performance—lucite plaques and checks for $5;000, tax free. Those honored ranged from the mighty to the obscure, from Joseph J. Christian, who worked his way up from $840‐a‐year clerk to become chairman of the vast Housing Authority at $41,000, to Catherine Mantovi and Harold Carlson, two gardeners on Staten Island who are so dedicated to nurturing plants that they come to work on their days off. The Public Service Awards are given by the Fund for the City of New York, a private foundation. The fund's seven‐member selection panel, headed by Cyrus R. Vance, president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, chose the recipients from a list of 25 nominees offered by its staff director, Warren Moscow. The presentation, was made at an afternoon ceremony in the Terrace Room of the Hotel Roosevelt. Among those in attendance was Mayor Beame, the prototype of the civil servant who made it to the top. The intent of the awards, said Benno S. Schmidt, chairman of the trustees of the fund, is to serve as a “career incentive” and morale booster for the Civil Service “by calling public attention to the high quality of many of the men and women who serve the public year in and year out in city jobs.” This is the second year that the fund has given the awards. Last year 11 were presented, and they tended to go to top‐echelon civil servants, people like James A. Cavanagh, then deputy director of the budget, and Harry I. Bronstein, then personnel Director, and John T. O'Hagan, then Fire Chief. Most of them have prospered in the new administration — Mr. Cavanagh, for example, rising to top Deputy Mayor — Because Mr. Beame has made a point of relying more upon the Civil Service than did his predecessor, John V. Lindsay. At first, Mr. Lindsay's aides disparaged long‐time career employes as old‐fashioned and obstructionist, but they conceded their mistake by his second term. Now, with a sluggish economy and rising unemployment drawing a flood of applicants—despite a city job freeze and expected layoffs—the Civil Service is thought to be in for a renaissance that might produce a talented crop of city employes similar to that recruited during the Depression. The employes honored yesterday represented, as Mr. Vance noted, “a more varied mix” than the year before. Among them, for example, were Charles Nixon and John Del Percio, two police officers operating as a team in the Bronx for the last six years. Both men, who will share their prize money, are high school dropouts who went into the Navy and were initiated into police work at the Simpson Street Station in the South Bronx. Their awards came largely for their work with SERA, a drug treatment program in the Bronx. As warrant officers, they first went to the program looking for fugitives. They became so involved that they frequently went to court on their days off to plead on behalf of those with old, drug‐related charges. Also sharing an award were Miss Mantovi and Mr. Carlson, Park Department employes who run, the Silver Lake greenhouse and conservatory on Staten Island, which supplies plants to Manhattan and Brooklyn. With the crew there down from nine people to five, the two report for work on days off. On weekends, they use Miss Mantovi's station wagon to travel about the borough, collecting ivy trailings from churches, homes and cemeteries, to transplant and raise for parks and public buildings. Another winner was Eugene J. Bockman, the 51‐year‐old director of the Municipal Reference and Research Center, the city reference library. Mr. Bockman is well known to several generations of political reporters, for the ease with which he guides them to reports squirreled away in the 22d floor of the Municipal Building. “Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to help the Fourth Estate,” remarked. Two of the winners come from the city's Health Department: Dr. Robert Newman, the director of the methadone maintenance program, and Dr. Jean Pakter, rirector of maternity services and family planning. Dr. Newman, who is 37, began in 1970 to oversee the methadone treatment pro gram that now runs 39 maintenance clinics treating 11,500 patients and five detoxification centers servicing 20,000. Dr. Pakter, who has headed the maternity division that became a full bureau since 1951, prepared and enforced health and hospital standards after the abortion law in 1970. Irving Weinberg, another award winner, entered city service in 1970 when he answered an ad in a newspaper calling for an “expert” to put a “large trucking fleet” back on its feet.

With the city's municipal army—350,000 employes who run everything from drugtreatment programs to sanitation trucks—it is no different. “And so, nine civil servants were singled out yesterday is “representatives of the best of New York City's career employes” and presented with awards for their performance‐lucite plaques and checks for $5,000, tax free. Those honored ranged from the mighty to the obscure, from Joseph J. Christian, who worked his way up from a $840‐a‐year clerk to become chairman of the vast Housing Authority at $41,000, to Catherine Mantovi and Harold Carlson, two gardeners on Staten Island who are so dedicated to nurturing plants that they come to work on their days off. Vance Heads Group The Public Service Awards are given by the Fund for the City of New York, a private foundation. The fund's seven‐member selection panel, headed by Cyrus R. Vance, president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, chose the recipients from a list of 25 nominees offered by its staff director, Warren Moscow. The presentation was made at an afternoon ceremony in the Terrace Room of the Hotel Roosevelt. Among those in attendance was Mayor Beam, the prototype of the civil servant who made it to the top. The intent of the awards, said Benno S. Schmidt, chairman of the trustees of the fund, is to serve as a “career incentive” and morale booster for the Civil Service “by calling public attention to the high quality of many of the men and women who serve the public year in and year out in city jobs.” This is the second year that the fund has given the awards. Last year 11 were presented, and they tended to go to top‐echelon civil servants, people like James A. Cavanagh, then deputy director of the budget, and Harry I. Bronstein, then personnel director, and John T. O'Hagan, then Fire Chief. Most of them have prospered in the new administration — Mr. Cavanagh, for example, rising to top Deputy Mayor—because Mr. Beame has made a point of relying more upon the Civil Service than did his predecessor, John V. Lindsay. At first, Mr. Lindsay's aides disparaged long‐time career employes as old‐fashioned and obstructionist, but they conceded their mistake by his second term. Police Officers Cited Now, with a sluggish economy and rising unemployment drawing a flood of applicants—despite a city job freeze and expected layoffs—the Civil Service is thought to be in for a renaissance that might produce a talented crop of city employes similar to that recruited during the Depression. The employes honored yesterday represented, as Mr. Vance noted, “a more varied mix” than the year before. Among them, for example, were Charles Nixon and John Del Percio, two police officers operating as a team in the Bronx for the last six years. Both men, who will share their prize money, are high school dropouts who went into the Navy and were initiated into police work at the Simpson Street Station in the South Bronx. Their awards came largely for their work with SERA, a drug treatment program in the Bronx. As warrant officers, they first went to the program looking for fugitives. They became so involved that they frequently went to court on their days off to plead on behalf of those with old, drug‐related charges. The Gardening Team The Gardening Team Also sharing an award were Miss Mantovi and Mr. Carlson, Park Department employes who run the Silver Lake greenhouse and conservatory on Staten Island, which supplies plants to Manhattan and Brooklyn. With the crew there down from nine people to five, the two report for work on days off. On weekends, they use Miss Mantovi's station wagon to travel about the borough, collecting ivy trailings from churches, homes and cemeteries, to transplant and raise for parks and public buildings. Another winner was Eugene J. Bockman, the 51‐year‐old director of the Municipal Reference and Research Center, the city reference library. Mr. Bockman is well known to several generations of political reporters, for the ease with which he guides them to reports squirreled away in the 22d floor of the Municipal Building. “Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to help the Fourth Estate,” remarked. Two in Health Department Two of the winners come from the city's Health Department: Dr. Robert Newman, the director of the methadone maintenance program, and Dr. Jean Pakter, director of maternity services and family planning. Dr. Newman, who is 37, began in 1970 to oversee the methadone treatment program that now runs 39 maintenance clinics treating 11,500 patients and five detoxification centers servicing 20,000. Dr. Pakter, who has headed the maternity division that became a full bureau since 1951, prepared and enforced health and hospital standards after the abortion law in 1970. Irving Weinberg, another award winner, entered city service in 1970 when he answered an ad in a newspaper calling for an “expert” to put a “large trucking fleet” back on its feet.

New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/06/archives/new-jersey-briefs-cocounsels-named-for-ronan-inquiry-hearing-set-on.html,"Co‐counsels were named in Trenton to a legislative inquiry into the $625,000 given to Dr. William J. Ronan, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, by Vice President‐designate Nelson A. Rockefeller. The gift was disclosed in Washington during Congressional hearings on Mr. Rockefeller's nomination. Mr. Rockefeller said the money was given to Dr. Ronan when he was head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City. Shortly after the disclosure, Assemblyman Michael P. Esposito, Democrat of Hudson County and chairman of the Assembly Transportation and Communications Committee, said there would be an investigation and Dr. Ronan would be called to testify. The hearings will be scheduled after preparatory research. The co‐counsels are Prospero De Bona of Rumson and Monroe J. Lustbader of West Orange. Hearing Set on Car Insurance Rise State Insurance Commissioner James J. Sheeran announced a hearing for Dec. 18 on the request of the Hartford Insurance Group for an automobile insurance rate increase. The company filed an application last June for an application last June for an over‐all 18 per cent auto rate rise in New Jersey. The application was questioned by the Department of insurance and the Hartford submitted an amended request for an over‐all increase of 9.9 per cent. The company writes 3.5 per cent of the auto insurance policies in New Jersey, with earned premium of about $21‐million a year, Mr. Sheeran said. Last month, the commissioner announced that insurance companies handling about 70 per cent of the state's auto insurance business had been given rate increases ranging from 3.3 per cent to 16 per cent. A.C.L.U. to Appeal Abortion Ruling The American Civil Liberties Union has appealed a Superior Court decision holding that private hospitals can refuse to allow abortions. Stephen Nagler, executiev director of the New Jersey A.C.L.U. chapter, said the appeal would go forward although the case was not relataed to a new state law establishing the right of all hospitals to refus eto perform abortions. The law was passed after the case began. Mr. Nagler said the Civil Liberties. Union would challenge the law separately, and go ahead with arguments on whether a private hospital had the same right to conscience that the A.C.L.U. holds a doctor or nurse had in refusing to participate in an abortion. Jersey City Man Dies in Blaze at Home A man was killed in a predawn fire that forced the evacuation of three families from a three‐story frame tenement in Jersey City. The body of the victim, Bernard Smith, 50 years old, was found near a front window of his thirdfloor apartment, according to fire officials. Authorities said the one‐alarm fire apparently had begun in Mr. Smith's apartment, but fire officials said the cause of the blaze had not been determined. In another Hudson County fire, Thaddeus Adamcik, 67, was rescued from a closet in which he took refuge during a fire in his apartment. He was admitted to Bayonne Hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation. Cold May Cut Some Gas Service The Public Service Electric & Gas Company may be forced to interrupt natural gas service to some customers if the state has a cold winter, Robert I. Smith, president of the utility, said at Jamesburg. “We have advised our interruptible customers to anticipate 100 to 130 days of interruption in normal winter, and 160 to 180 days in the event a colder than normal one,” he said. Although Public Service produces natural gas at two plants in Harrison and Linden, it has suffered a continuous decline of gas reserves. Since 1970 it has been unable to purchase any additional gas supplies from pipeline companies, Mr, Smith said. Atlantic City Seeks Canadian Tourists Atlantic City Mayor Joseph. F. Bradway Jr. met with Canadian officials in an effort to increase tourism in the shore resort. Mayor Bradway met with Mayor David Cromby in Toronto and planned a reception for Canadian travel agents and provincial tourism ministers. Mayor Bradway, who wants to bring an International exposition to Atlantic City by the end of the decade, also was to meet with officials of the Canadian National Exhibition to discuss the possibility of arranging an International event in Atlantic City.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parent and Child,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/08/archives/birth-without-violence-parent-and-child-a-french-pediatrician-eases.html,"“I believe that birth is too important an event to be left to the obstetricians, that a newborn and his mother need a loving artist's attention, not the impersonal manipulation of a highly trained engineer.” These are the words of Frederick Leboyer, a French obstetrician who has perceived and practiced a controversial new method of child delivery that many people believe has had a profoundly beneficial effect on children he has delivered. Leboyer, 56, who graduated trom the Faculté de Médecine in the Université de Paris in 1937 as an advanced scholar and later attained the rank of chef de clinique with teaching privileges before he set up his private practice, has brought an estimated 1,000 children into the world by this radical technique. His critics regard it as, It best, foolish, at worst, dangerous; his followers think it may well be an important new contributing factor to good human health. By the Leboyer method, the first moments of life are strikingly different from those of the traditional childbirth though the differences are achieved with utmost simplicity, by three particularly nontechnical innovations. First, the delivery chamber is kept shadowy and dim, as an unlit room at twilight, and silence is maintained by everyone present. In this way the baby's eyes are not blinded by the sudden onslaught of harsh surgical lights, and its ears are not suddenly violated by strident sounds. Second, when the baby is born, it is not picked up by the heels and slapped on the behind, but, instead, laid softly on the mother's stomach—umbilical still unsevered—where for the next four or five minutes it is tenderly massaged. Finally, at the end of this peaceful time, the cord is cut and for another few minutes, the baby is gently bathed in a basin of warm that is all. to it. Neither during the nine months preceding delivery nor afterwards is the fetus or baby treated any differently than in standard medical procedure. In January, Leboyer described his method and, to him, more important, the unscientific attitudes behind it, in a book called, “Birth Without Violence,” which is a kind of prose poem dedicated to what he regards as the light that has come to him from India and the East. The book was a best seller in France, has been translated into a dozen languages and is due to appear in the United States in March. It reads like Dante's “Inferno,” and Milton's “Paradise Regained” set side by side, a tale of horror of what Leboyer thinks most deliveries are actually like, and a poem of beauty about how they can be. His fundamental thesis is that babies are people, not tiny nonentities, with a full complement of sensory and psychological vulnerabilities. Indeed in many ways Leboyer's book is an extended anthropomorphization of the birth trauma; a few excerpts from the Inferno portion: Yes, hell exists. It is not a fairy tale. One indeed burns there. This hell is not at the end of life. It is here. At the beginning. Heil is what the infant must experience before he gets to us. . . . This tragic brow, these closed eyes, eyebrows raised and knotted. This howling mouth, this head which rolls back and tries to escape. These hands which stretch out, implore, beg, then rise to the head in a gesture of calamity. These feet which kick furiously, legs which bend in to protect a tender stomach. This flesh which is but a mass of spasms, starts, and shakes. He doesn't speak, the newborn? Why his entire being shouts out, ‘Don't touch me! Don't touch me!’ And yet at the same time, imploringly, begging ‘Don't leave me! Don't leave me!’ ... This is birth. This is the torture, the Calvary. From this sort of premise, it is easy to see how Leboyer's method follows. The infant's whole psychic future may depend upon how hastily the surgeon cuts the umbilical cord. To do it too early “is an act of the greatest cruelty whose negative effect one can hardly measure.” The newborn cannot with impunity leap from the state of “unity” in which he lived in the womb to the “independence” of this world. Leaving the cord intact for four or five minutes (until it stops pulsating) may require a virtual “re‐education” of profit‐minded obstetricians eager to run off to the next delivery, but it is the only way, says Leboyer, to permit the baby to “graduate” peacefully from prelife to life. During the bathing, “the child floats!” Leboyer says in “Birth Without Violence”: Once again immaterial. Light. And free as in the distant good old days of pregnancy when he could play, move around freely in a boundless ocean.... What might have remained of fear, stiffness, tension now melts away like snow in the sunshine. Everything in the baby's body which was still anxious, rigid, and blocked starts to live, to dance.... Beyond any possible doubt, a human being is there. Who was hiding behind fear. And we realize that it was terror which had kept his eyes closed. To help get across his message, Leboyer has made a 21‐minute, blackand‐white film, called simply “Birth.” It is not a cinematographic record of a single Leboyer delivery, as it seems, but rather a work of art filmed during many deliveries. Like the book, it depends upon its artistic imagery to strike a resonant chord in the viewer, especially the female. There are no speaking parts; the “narrative” is simply occasional printed passages projected on the screen. The background music, not surprisingly, is a Japanese flute played by a Zen monk. The entire effect — the chiaroscuro images, the hypnotic music and above all the infant wreathed in smiles, or lying peacefully on his mother's stomach—is indeed impressive as art ... or reality, for that matter. Virtually the entire medical Establishment, however, is distinctly not impressed. Substantively speaking, Leboyer's changes hardly constitute a major advance in obstetrics on a par with the development of the forceps by Dr. William Smellie in the seven‐teen‐fifties or the childbirth techniques of Dick‐Read in Britain and Lamaze in France. Leboyer's method hardly amounts to more than a gentle set of loving hands. And yet his unusual vocabulary and concepts, along with their implications for science and medicine, have produced a polarization of refractory, passionate and often exaggerated opinion. His critics accuse him of everything from shamanism and mysticism to outright quackery. To some, clearly, his chief sin is against the Establishment itself, in failing to show it sufficient reverence, or at least in failing to worship properly the gods of science. To others he is guilty of more serious offenses. Prof. Claude Sureau of Paris's Hospital St. Vincent de Paul maintains that some of what Leboyer advocates is dangerous, and that what there is of value is not new. “Many infants are born calm and beautiful without Leboyer's help,” he says, adding that most modern delivery rooms are kept reasonably quiet. Furthermore, infants are kept under infrared lamps to keep them warm, and “Leboyer's ideas about bathing are romantic, almost old‐fashioned. Lifting the baby in and out of the water became a game, and that's a bit silly.” As for the dimly lighted room, Sureau scoffs: “What if difficulties arise? We have to be able to see the baby's color.” He also favors cutting the umbilical cord rather early: “You cannot leave it there forever. There is a risk of infection.” The stroking of the baby on the mother's stomach is acceptable, says Sureau, “but it should not last long. A baby's contact with his mother cannot be eternal. It is unhealthy to want to associate children to all their mothers' activities.” Lastly, the professor, “like most of my colleagues,” believes “a good hearty scream” is important to hear from the baby to make certain he is breathing forcefully. Dr. Claudine Escoffier‐Lambiotte, medical columnist for Le Monde, is favorable to “any ideas which humanize or personalize medicine.” But she nevertheless feels Leboyer has gone too far. “He is a mystic who believes that the outdated notion of the birth trauma is at the center of humanity's problems.” The attacks from other prestigious obstetricians are numerous: He's absurd. . . . We have enough problems without having to invoke a lot of incantatory reveries.... If the high number of accidents at birth in France is to be diminished, it is important to train a larger number of gynecologists and obstetricians and midwives, and I don't think that standing in a shadowy room, preparing a warm bath, and making ‘maternal love’ to the infant would he the proper first stage.... The most painful moment of birth is the period of uterine contractions—not the moment of first cry or breath. . . . No obstetrician enjoys torturing the newborn but there are necessary rules of security. . . . Everyone knows that on the quality of fetal oxygenation in the first minute of life will depend the ‘quality’ of a future human being. At 16 years of age, it is better to have been delivered properly oxygenated and screaming than anoxic and caressed. ‘Village idiots’ are often smiling after all. There are no figures on village idiots or on how many babies were lost in Leboyer's years of practice, but it is unlikely that the man could have practiced in a major city with enormous success for many years if his method was producing dead fetuses or retarded children. Even his most unrelenting critics have not hinted that this is the case—only that it could be. Some of Leboyer's colleagues are not above ad hominem reflections on the controversy. “Everyone knows he is out to make money,” says one obstetrician who wishes to remain unidentified. “He is the grocer of obstetrics and well‐known for it. Moreover he has published no important scientific papers.” In fact Leboyer has been retired for well over a year from all clinical work; but even while he was in practice, his fees were no higher than those of any other successful obstetrician. And, in fact, since his time‐consuming method permitted fewer deliveries at a time, he made rather less money than some of his assembly‐line colleagues. Furthermore, as in the United States, private practitioners in France almost never pursue research or publish papers. I asked about some of the specific points of criticism made by others in his profession. “They mock me,” he says, “by pushing my method to the extremes. And they pretend that much of what I do is not new when in fact it is very new—just take a look at the gleaming impersonality of their delivery rooms and styles. Of course I don't work in a pitch black room. Certainly I am attentive to a baby's coloring. Of course if there is the slightest complication or emergency, I use all the resources of modern medicine. But this is all beside the point. Their real com plaints are unspoken. They know it and I know it. At the heart of the matter is the fact that I am not simply offering another method or two, a new wrinkle or two in postmodern scientific obstetrics, but am challenging their whole world view. I am offering an alternative means of conceptualizing not just birth, but self, life, others.... “If a baby is born with his umbilicus wrapped around his neck, it is obvious that we don't sing a mystical song. We cut it. If a baby's life is in danger because he has difficulty in breathing, we reanimate him immediately, of course. And we turn the lights on. And if a baby is seen to spit up heavy mucus substances, naturally we suck them out with a probe. What we do not do is to employ all these instruments as a matter of routine as other doctors do ‘just in case.’ All this technical monkey business during birth represents only our own fears of being inadequate should trouble arise. This is selfish because the baby is highly sensitive in the first hours after birth to all these fears which we and our instruments and anxiety project onto him. . . . I don't go into the delivery looking for opportunities to display and use my technical wares, Other things on other planes are more important.” What about cardiac surveillance during labor? “No, of course I'm not against it as such, but I disapprove of the attitude to technology that it represents. This is research for research's sake without a moment's concern for how the baby feels, how his mind reg isters.... What some of my colleagues have a resistance against is that my ideas have nothing to do with technique. They change nothing on that level. But it is precisely that level which is least interesting and least important once we are sure the baby is breathing and healthy.” Isn't it important to get the baby breathing strongly at once? “It is important, and I agree that his first hearty cry is also vital. What we are trying to avoid is that he should carry on crying and screaming at length. That means the baby is suffering. Nobody wants to admit this simple fact. It is too humiliating to admit something so simple.” What's the purpose of the bathing? Leboyer looked very moved as he answered: “Bathing is so simple and yet it makes such a difference. I hope people are going to accept the idea soon. It is not just a question of getting the child used to the idea of changing from the liquid environment of the womb which he knew as a fetus, but also of getting rid of those tensions in the spinal cord which are responsible for so many later deformities in our bodies, like teeth that stick out or ears, though admittedly these are relatively minor.” Odile Herdner, an anesthetist who used to work with Dr. Leboyer during many of his deliveries, also addressed herself to the criticisms. “All I can say is that everything is interesting and nothing is categorical. Before the baby is presented, everything is done in the normal way with the latest equipment, and that often includes surveillance. You can add fantasies and play the games afterwards, even sing mystical songs. It's a matter of choice and can be very interesting and helpful under certain circumstances. It's really a matter of personal choice. If problems arise, we switch on the lights and act as any team would in emergency.” Mlle. Herdner is clearly a believer, but she says, “Mothers should not necessarily be encouraged to ask for a ‘Leboyer method’ delivery. Of course it can be a good thing, but it is highly personal and every mother is a special case. If she reads his book or sees his film and feels, ‘This is for me,’ then she should look into it. Some deliveries run quite smoothly and calmly without using Leboyer's method, while other babies have been seen to scream during one of his deliveries. I can only repeat that everything is interesting with Leboyer and nothing is categorical.” In the world of Leboyer mothers, opinions run just about as strongly and uniformly as in the medical Establishment, only in the opposite direction. Here he is revered as elsewhere he is reviled. Marie‐France Han, 33, a sales manager for a French film company, met him at a dinner party in 1971. She shared his interest in things Oriental (she is married to a Chinese), and she found his ideas on childbirth congenial. When, a short time later, she became pregnant with her first child, “it seemed natural to put myself in his hands. “During the months of pregnancy, Dr. Leboyer treated me no differently from the way my friends were treated by their obstetricians. I enrolled in a class of natural birth techniques, and Dr. Leboyer did advise me that if I chose to, it might be a good idea to study yoga. I agreed and did so. But this was definitely not a ‘must.’” Her delivery, said Mme. Han, was lust like the film version. And in fact seeing the film made me want to do it over again. “I lay in the delivery room quite conscious and aware. The room was dim, but it was dawn and you could see the sun coming through the window. The atmosphere Dr. Leboyer created was quiet and meditative, like a church. Things were serious but joyous. I felt as though a ritual were going to take place. The doctor was marvelously helpful during labor, but at the moment of birth he became just as interested in my baby as in me. When I cried out in happiness and excitement, he quickly calmed me because it is not good for the newborn to hear loud noises. I must be serene and quiet to welcome baby, he told me. “Then he put my daughter on my stomach for as long as the umbilical cord continued to function. He massaged the baby and he let me help with my own hands. During the whole time Dr. Leboyer was singing a soft, repetitive Indian melody of some kind. Gradually I could feel my baby relax under his soothing massage and become calmer. She cried only a little bit. Then he gave her a long bath in warm water. The delivery was one of the most important, happiest moments in my life. I'll be so sad if I can't go back to Dr. Leboyer when I'm pregnant again someday.” Marie‐France Han's daughter is now nearly two years old. Her mother, a strong believer in the significance of the birth trauma, believes much of the infant's “sweetness of disposition” is due to Leboyer's handling at her birth. She and her husband are very impatient with the “raking over” which the obstetrician has received from his peers. “I won't claim that all children who are born via this method will grow up perfectly,” says Mme. Han, “but I guarantee Leboyer's way is as safe and secure as any other, and far more beautiful. I found his book beautiful, but totally unscientific. It's a poem on birth and his colleagues just aren't poets, I guess.” Another “Leboyer mother” was a working woman of humble origins whose first childbirth six years ago was so traumatic for her as well as the baby that she resolved never again to have another child. When she became pregnant a second time, it took weeks for her friends to perRiede her not to have an abortion. Without knowing Leboyer beforehand,. she agreed reluctantly to be delivered by him. The results were a replica of Mme. Han's experience, even to the extent of “wishing I could have more children delivered by Dr. Leboyer.” Rather more significant is the fact that she and her husband as well as all their friends and a clinical psychologist have remarked on the “dramatic difference” between their two children: the elder one is tense and insecure, moody and often hard to get along with; the younger is gay, open and easily satisfied. Aclinical child psychologist, Dr. Danielle Rapoport, who teaches at the Sorbonne, has undertaken a follow‐up study of a sampling of 50 Leboyer‐delivered babies ranging in age from 8 months to 4 years. Though several years away from completing her report, Dr. Rapoport was willing to share some of her tentative discoveries and conclusions. “There is no question in my mind, these children are noticeably different from others who were delivered in the ‘classical’ way,” was how she‐ summarized her finding. “The children I have studied have been spared nearly all of the major and minor psychopathologies—of eating, sleeping, maternal relations, etc—of infancy. They show a markedly greater precocity of interest in the world and in people. They use their in telligence in more positive and socially adaptive ways than other babies do.” She gave the older children in her sampling a French version of the Gesell Baby Test which measures “adaptivity” and they scored significantly higher than average. Medical‐Establishment reaction to Leboyer: ‘He's absurd .... We have enough problems without invoking a lot of incantatory reveries.’ Rather neutral in the Leboyer controversy, Danielle Rapoport feels that “Leboyer's problem is that he tries to antagonize his colleagues and makes himself disliked by taking stands and using language which are incomprehensible, if not inimical, to the medical world.” EscoffierLambiotte, Sureau and others are fighting battles for fundamental improvements and humanization of medicine, notes Rapoport, and Leboyer's mystical vocabulary—his (to them) archaic and “unscientific” attachment to Freudian notions like the birth trauma —strike them as ridiculous and obscurantist. On the other hand, says the clinical psychologist, many obstetricians are simply “threatened by Leboyer's disavowal of the accepted goals and style of medicine” and react “in a childish and malicious way.” Leboyer himself thinks he has been “excommunicated” but not disproved. He lives in simplicity now in Montmartre, having sold his luxurious 16th Arrondissement house, is writing a book, in collaboration with a swami, about Indian music and is thinking of moving to India. Despite his protestations, it is clear that he has been hurt by the campaign against him. “I tried to transform births into nativities,” he said as he showed a guest prints of El Greco, Rembrandt, Raphael and La Tour nativities. “See how the light shines from the Infant Christ's face?” he asks. “There is no reason why that cannot happen for all babies. But first we must stop treating them as mere squalling digestive tracts.” There is something profoundly dissatisfying to the AngloSaxon mind about a story of a controversy, especially a medical controversy, where there is finally no right or wrong, just different views and levels and styles of explanation. Many of us still believe unquestioningly in the ethos of science and technology, and in their empirical testability. For these people, Leboyer is retrograde. Others may have come to doubt the omniscience of medicine and science and to search beyond for intuitive, psychological or spiritual truths. For them, Leboyer may speak a healing, helping word. Ultimately perhaps Mile. Herdner, Leboyer's assistant, was probably correct when she said that the doctor's “method” is right for some, but not for all, mothers. But right for whom? Only the would‐be mystics among them? Several of the women interviewed for this article are not the “spiritual type,” do not know the first thing about Oriental philosophy or religion, and in general tend to accept what Leboyer would call “the scientific myths” of our time. And yet these same women were profoundly impressed by the doctor‐artist's manner and methods, and would happily go back to him a second time if they could. Certainly it would be unnerving for a prospective mother to read the unanimously and often mockingly critical reactions of Leboyer's colleagues. But the problem is the men who make them do not themselves subscribe to the basic sine qua non behind “Birth Without Violence”: the existence and significance of the birth trauma and the belief that a newborn baby is mentally a human being. If you do not accept this, then Leboyer's ideas are so much superfluous mumbo‐jumbo. If you do, then you don't have to be an Orientalist or a mystic to support of make use of his methods. In sum, a prospective mother is well‐advised to read extensively about Leboyer's method before requesting it. In any case, there will be little chance of her getting her request because her obstetrician is not likely to realign his views and change his practice — unless the poetry, the concepts, philosophy and, in small though intriguing degree, the results of “Birth Without Violence” persuade him or others to carry on where Frederick Leboyer left off. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 38th First Lady: not a robot at all,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/08/archives/forward-day-by-day-the-38th-first-lady-not-a-robot-at-all-betty.html,"Pretty surreal, all this. Look at them. He has the hardest job in the world. She is recovering from radical surgery for cancer. He will be 62 in July, she 57 in April, but there they are beaming on the balcony of their new house, like carefree juniors at a prom. Tennessee Ernie, also surnamed Ford, is serenading them below. Television cameras whir as he sings “Anniversary Waltz”—hardly a tune to make liberals hark back to the days of Camelot, but an apt one all the same. Elizabeth Bloomer married Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. 26 years ago Oct. 15, and was a dancer before she ever heard of him. More than three decades ago, she danced on the stage of Carnegie Hall, in the troupe of the exalted Martha Graham, but it's been a good while since she has appeared in leotards. Now her style is more ballroom: tangos and waltzes. When the Prime Minister of Israel protested, as the music began after a September state dinner in his honor, that he didn't know how to dance, his hostess reassured him: “That's all right, I used to teach dance. I'll teach you now.” She did, too. Nobody thought she would take so readily to White House life, this 38th First Lady of the Land. She publicly hoped not long ago that her husband would at last retire from Congress, so that they could have some long‐postponed, nonpolitical time to themselves. “Alone at Last!” she wrote in wistful jest across the back of a snapshot of the two of them, taken at Disney World in Florida just after the Miami convention hall had rung with shouts for “FOUR MORE YEARS!” of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew. On the night 14 months later when Gerald Ford was named to replace Agnew, he asked a neighbor to “see if you can get some food in Mommy's tummy.” Mommy, whose lifelong dream all this most assuredly was not, sighed and said, “Well, if they just wind me up and point me in the right direction, I'll be there.” But she rallied. The way things turned out she wasn't a robot at all. She was more like Cinderella. Onstage again, after 26 years of wifely obscurity and motherly sacrifice, it was as if she were picking up where she left off when she said good‐by to Martha Graham. “It's her turn now, bless her heart,” said one of Mrs. Ford's friends, “and now that she doesn't have to worry about things like whether the beds are made, she's loving it.” After a while, she even got used to the omnipresence of Secret Service agents, grim‐faced companions charged with shielding her from all external harm. Not cancer, though. Cancer was beyond them. Two hours before Betty Ford checked into Bethesda Naval Hospital, she had Mrs. Lyndon Johnson and her daughters to tea so they could see the house they used to live in. They had no idea where their hostess was going next. “We were stunned when we found out,” Lynda Robb said later. So was everybody else. The next morning's announcement that Mrs. Ford's right breast had been found malignant and removed shook the nation as much as any event since Watergate. “I was astonished bow much I cared,” wrote a male historian from Iowa. “I was as shocked as I'd earlier been by the Revelations, the Resignations and the Pardon.” In less than two months, Betty Ford had unobtrusively become a myth. “She seems to have just what it takes.” observed Marshall McLuhan, who is skilled at observing such matters, “to make people feel at home in the world again. Something about her makes us feel rooted and secure—a feeling we haven't had in a while. And her cancer has been a catharsis for everybody. Cancer isn't just a disease, you know: it's a speeded‐up, hotted‐up, intensified form of life. Our lifestyle creates the ideal climate for it. All of us play Russian roulette with cancer, whether “Maybe my having it,” Mrs. Ford muses, “was a blessing in disguise.” Maybe so. If she achieved nothing else during her husband's Administration, the light her trouble has shed on a dark subject would be contribution enough. The Cancer Society had been one of Betty Ford's causes before the disease struck her. Causes have always meant more to her than card‐playing luncheons. No man in the 81st Congress had a more energetically public‐spirited wife than Jerry Ford. Her interests ranged from the International Club, not a favorite among Midwesterners, to fashion shows. “Don't ever say no if you're asked to model in a style show,” she once cautioned another Republican wife, “because the Democrats always pitch in. We must, too.” She knew a thing or two about Democrats. Her social life had centered on, but by no means been confined to, the elephant‐filled living rooms of the Grand Old Party's Chowder & Marching Society. “I've often been tempted to split my ticket,” she said a while ago—not an admission you'd expect from the wife of the House Minority Leader. Dwring her televised serenade, Mrs. Ford wore a convalescent's bathrobe. She was smiling, and her reddish hair was well‐coiffed, but her face looked worn. The tendons on her throat protruded. She looked for all the world like the most ordinary of women, the sort you might find lined up with a loaded cart at a supermarket's checkout counter, or bringing a stuffed toy to the brand‐new baby across the street. In many ways, she is ordinary, well‐schooled in the Midwestern arts of assuaging and consoling. Her thankyou notes are prompt and heartfelt. Nice gestures come naturally. “I think I ought to call Pat,” she told one friend just before Nixon resigned, “to tell her we aren't all just waiting in the wings for them to move out.” “Betty Ford was nice to me,” recalls the ex‐wife of one controversial Senator, “when other people weren't. But she's not just nice.” No. The merely nice bypass the truth when it makes them or anyone else edgy, and that's something Betty Ford doesn't do. She never has. “I just don't know how to lie,” she has told reporters. When the President promised “straight talk among friends” in his inaugural address, he was speaking at least as much for his wife, whose low‐key candor quickly surpassed his own. She was full of surprises, this kindly matron from Michigan. It turned out she supported the Equal Rights Amendment, of all prickly issues, and had been divorced, and thought there might be time to abort (in cases of rape and incest, say) as well as a time to refrain from aborting. She saw no reason why women shouldn't be priests or Presidents, and further reckoned, when someone asked, that her children probably at some point must have tried marijuana. When Tennessee Ernie came to the line “Angels were singing a hymn to your charms,” the First Couple kissed each other as if they meant it. They need no workshops in nonverbal communication, these two. “Isn't it nice the way they touch each other?” asks a Congressman's widow who has known the Fords for decades. “They hold hands whether or not anybody's looking. Their lutes are in tune.” Not to say that there isn't occasional discord. “She gave me a hard time about a couple of things,” the President told newsmen after one evening's visit to Bethesda, “so she must be feeling “I don't hesitate to tell him when I disagree with something he's done or said,” Mrs. Ford said, “unless he looks as if he's had a hard day. When he looks that way, I wait. You get so you notice things like that. A sense of timing is pretty important if you love somebody.” And there was the business about their bed. One bed. As soon as the Fords moved into the White House, she let it slip that, contrary ‘to custom, she and her husband meant to sleep, as they always had, not only in the same room but under the same blanket. This morsel of homey news was generally regarded as cheering, “but one woman wrote in,” the First Lady laughed, “to say she thought it was disgrace She was showing me around that very bedroom in what one veteran Washingtonian calls “the world's most elegant railroad flat.” Here were the weights her husband lifts to keep in shape, there the hated Exercycle he must now use in place of the swimming pool they left behind in Alexandria, there a picture of his mother as a young woman, there one of their only daughter, Susan, as a baby. Upstairs was the billiard room, from which the clonking noise had recently been muffled with a new rug. (“At first,” she said, “we thought it might be Lincoln's ghost.”) Downstairs, in plain sight, was the Oval Office where her husband was working. “It's funny, but I see a lot more of him now than I did before we got here,” she said. “I can call him whenever anything important happens and he'll come right up—but I'm not the sort of wife who tends to do that. “Jerry's a morning person,” she said, “and I'm not at all, so sometimes I ask him if he'll flick on the light just as he leaves, to wake me up. When we moved in here and he did that one morning, the light he flicked on was a chandelier!” And she told how vexed she had been, just after they moved, not to find the atlas. “What do you mean it's in storage” she recalled asking. “How can I get along without an atlas and a globe?” On a coffee table were Celebrity Register — not a book she probably read much before she moved in—and an issue of Town & Country. She also had a copy of a book I had written and sent, in which she graciously asked for an autograph. Even more graciously, she agreed to fetch some White House stationery and on it wish a happy 12th birthday to my nephew, in a hand amateur graphologists later pronounced “conventional, but determined.” (My nephew thought it was terrific.) Except for summer dance sessions at Bennington in Vermont, Betty Ford never went to college, but her mind is curious and well‐informed. When she and Mrs. Hale Boggs accompanied their husbands on an official visit to China, they insisted on having their own separate briefing session “because we didn't want to get it all second‐hand from the men,” Mrs. Boggs says, “or to arrive there and have nothing to say but ‘Oh, we just adore Chinese walls!’ Betty was just fascinated with everything.” “Jerry's always turned to Betty for the sensitive point of view,” an old friend says. “He's often said she was the smart one when it came to politics because she sees the forest instead of the trees.” “She's no dummy,” adds another friend. “She's smart enough to have raised four children to be a credit to them, and have a husband who's still in love with her after all these years. In this day and age, I call that not only smart but practically brilliant.” In China, acupuncture especially interested Mrs. Ford. She figured it might help her neck. A pinched neck nerve, before cancer, was her severest medical problem. It had nagged for years, causing chronic pain at the base of her skull. There had been talk of surgery, but that talk made her shudder. “The incision would have to be made through the mouth,” she said, “and chances would only be 50.50. Acupuncture might be much easier. In China, I watched eight different acupuncture operations, including one for an ovarian cyst” where the girl drank tea the whole time. “Would you like some iced tea now?” Try though Mrs. Ford did to make this encounter natural, it was uphill work. You don't just drop in at the White House. You first make a dozen or so logistical phone calls and then, when you arrive at the gates, you are quizzed, all but X‐rayed, photographed, bedecked with a plastic badge and passed upstairs by a string of pert aides who probably mean to be disarming, but who I kept thinking were going to thank me for flying TWA. Spontaneous it isn't, not even in the Ford Administration. The Hotel Europa in Belfast is easier to get into, and the Vatican might be more cozy. The simplest event on Betty Ford's schedule must now be orchestrated like an audience with an emperor. In East Wing argot, even a quick hello to a Salvation Army fashion luncheon in a Washington hotel ballroom becomes a “Drop‐by,” with mimeographed instructions to be gone over in a three‐car motorcade: “12:55, down 20 steps. Turn right. 12:58, remarks. Press opportunity. 1:03, conclude remarks. 1:05, up the same 20 steps. Depart.” If she walks into such a scene with her husband, a band plays “Hail to the Chief.” If she arrives alone, she must affect delight at the opening strains of “Betty Coed Has Lips of Red” or, in homage to the President's alma mater, “Hail to the Victors.” The Fords are victors, all right, without ever having fought a Presidential battle. One of her size 6 gowns will one day hang in the Smithsonian, along with those of Dolley Madison, Mary Todd Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt and all the rest. Her name will automatically topple Golda's or Coretta's or Ethel's or one of the other stand‐bys from the next annual list of Most Admired Women. “Kings and queens have always focused people's feelings,” says the anthropologist Margaret Mead, “and since we're not very far from a monarchy, the President's wife, whoever she is, has little choice but to serve as our queen.” Maybe Richard Nixon had something when he called us a nation of children. Watching Mrs. Ford become First Lady, it was as if we were all siblings with a new stepmother to get used to. For her part, like it or not, she had to learn to become an icon. There's a souvenir shop at the corner of F and 15th Streets in Washington that still features postcards of the Nixons — he grinning, she tight‐lipped—but it won't for long. The icon machine works fast. Back on Crown View Drive in Alexandria, the Fords' former neighbors are already busy laminating their clippings of the peculiar time when Secret Service agents and big‐name newscasters walked among them. Crown View Drive, if it could somehow be shrunk and freezedried, would make a perfect diorama for some future museum of suburbia. Only the Virginia license plates in its driveways distinguish it from streets on the outskirts of Houston or St. Paul or either Portland. Its mortgages are held by decent citizens who seem now out of a John Updike novel, now one by Sinclair Lewis. They prefer homemade cookies and even homemade ice cubes to the store‐bought kind, and never weary of telling how wholesome, natural and, most of all, how normal a family they lost when the Fords moved away. The way they say The Fords do personify that threatened species, the nuclear family. It is chic and in some quarters thrilling to foretell the doom of such families, but even Simone de Beauvoir, in all her wisdom, cannot think how to replace them. While they last, they transfix and reassure us. To the televised adventures of the Waltons, the Bunkers and the Louds, we now can add those of the newly mythologized Fords, about whom no folksy bulletin is too trivial to broadcast. We crave, or some of us do, to hear how Steve, that rascal, once picked his mother up and carried her all over the Crown View house, a house which had no dining room, and how he and his older brothers (“all male chauvinists,” their mother supposes) discolored their laundry by mixing Jeans in with Steve, who is 18, wears torn Levi's and drives a yellow jeep, and decided to stork for a year on a Utah ranch before beginning college. Michael, at 24 the eldest, is the divinity student in Massachusetts whose new bride, Gayle, looks blond enough and healthy enough to have been a Ford by birth. (“I know about all the rumors that Gayle's pregnant,” the First Lady says, “but those rumors are news to Gayle and Mike. Oh, well, I guess Julie and Tricia never had a moment's freedom from that sort of speculation, either.”) Was it Mike who told how “Dad always taught us to be good stewards of our bodies,” or was it his brother John? Jack, as the second son is called, is 22 and learning to be a forester at the University of Utah. “He's a deep, thoughtful person,” his mother says, “who likes to spend a whole day by himself in the wilderness. All our children were brought up to think independently, the way “I was the third child and only girl, spoiled as perhaps we spoil Susan. Her brothers don't, though. They're very protective, they want to know what she's up to and with whom. Sometimes they've asked, ‘Is she still going out with that ...?’” Susan, the most relaxed White House daughter since Caroline Kennedy, seems to be taking the advice of Alice Rousevelt Longworth, who also moved in at age 17. Mrs. Longworth sent Susan a message to “just have a hell of a good time while you're there.” Susan is, Apart from giving up babysitting, which she often did In Alexandria, she leads as normal a high‐school senior's life as any 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue resident could hope to, and will have her class's senior prom at the White House. She denies that the family's move has changed anybody. Mrs Ford, she said fondly toward the end of one state dinner, is “still the same old Mother.” Only briefly was Susan called on to replace the First Lady at affairs of state. At one white‐tie reception during her mother's convalescence, when there were hundreds of diplomatic hands to be shaken, the girl stood gamely by her father and shook them with such aplomb that a photographer remarked, “Susan, wonderful!” “That,” said the President, “is the way she was brung up.” “Don't you take all the credit,” replied his daughter, with some reason. In the years when his children were growing, Ford was “away right much,” as a family friend tells it, obliged to go off 200 nights a year to help keep Republicans in Congress. “I like to travel, too,” Mrs. Ford says, “but not the way Jerry does it. He feels he's got to go up and down as many times as the airplane can stop.” Even when he was home, they were sometimes expected at official functions as many as 14 nights in a “But Betty's a good egg,” as a friend says. “It's fun to razz her. The last place she'd ever want to be is on a pedestal.” At birthday parties in those days, there were joke presents, like funny bathing suits and the alarm clock Mrs., Ford once got, tied to a string, to twit her for her unpunctuality. There was that holiday at Disney World, after the convention, and a lot of afternoons watching the Superbowl with friends. “They were over here to see the Dolphins cream the Vikings,” recalls Barbara MacGregor, wife of the former Minnesota Congressman who managed Nixon's 1972 campaign. “Jerry'd just as soon have watched the game at home, but Betty wanted to come. Oh, we've all had some wonderful times. Don't you think she's Sometimes there were sorIties, never for very long, to Caribbean beaches, and once to Hawaii. Always the family had its two‐week Christmas reunion at its condominium in Vail, Colo. In the Fords' case, the bromidic old joke —“my wife likes the seashore and I like the mountains so we compromise and go to the seashore”—is reversed. That's not the way Betty Ford was raised,. Her generation's credo was: If he likes the mountains, go to the mountains. If he's a politician and you don't much care for politics, smile. Smile she did, but she also ate and drank too much, gaining 20 pounds. Later, she dieted off not only those 20 but another 10 as well, becoming so thin that one alarmed friend kept bringing over an Adelle Davis potion called Pep‐Up. “Pep was what Betty needed, all right,” a neighbor remembers. “It must have been very rough for her ali those years, with Jerry gone so much and four kids pulling her in four different directions. They ‘had a housekeeper five days a week, but it was still Betty who had to get everybody to Scouts, Sunday school, football practice and doctors' appointments.” Some of the doctors were her own. The pinched neck nerve wouldn't go away. It kept her on tranquilizers and off the slopes at Vail. “I tried skiing with a whiplash collar on, and it wasn't so bad there on the mountain, where I always had to be watching out for icy slopes and moguls, but the next day it would hurt terribly.” Thinking the tension might be psychosomatic, she sought the help of a new kind of doctor. “I saw my psychiatrist once a week, at the most, for a period of a year and a half. I didn't lie on a couch or anything like that, I'd just sit and talk, and it seemed to help, too. After all, if you have an abscessed tooth, you go to the dentist, don't you? This was during the time when Jerry was away so much, and I needed a sounding board to talk to. Somebody had to tell me what that doctor did: that I shouldn't just live for my husband and children but ought to do something for myself, too.” She tried. She signed up for modern‐dance lessons and did what she could to avoid metaphorical moguls at home. When the children provoked her, she mixed discipline with affection. “I tried to remember how, when I was their age, I'd pull the same wool over my parents' eyes.” An ashtray‐emptier by nature, she recalls “a sort of turning point in my child‐rearing philosophy when the boys were little and ran their toy cars all over a favorite coffee table I didn't want scratched. decided it wasn't worth it to worry over that—you can always buy new furniture, but you can't replace your chil Not one for vivid syntax, Mrs. Ford volunteers that her favorite tea, for all the efforts of a brother to convert her to more exotic brews, is Lipton's. Her favorite flower is the Peace Rose, and the hymn that stirs her most is “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” especially when sung by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. (A number of the Fords' best friends seem to be Latter‐Day Saints.) Her own faith, low church Episcopal with no incense, runs deep and strong. “I have a son who thought he was an agnostic,” she says —as bemusing a notion, to the First Lady, as if the lad had toyed with a career in haruspication. The morning doesn't go by but what Betty Ford spends at least 20 minutes studying that day's recommended scriptural passage in a pamphlet called “Forward Day by Day.” Most mornings the passage is apt enough. On Sept. 27, for example, the eve of her radical mastectomy, the verse was “Thou has turned my laments into dancing.” The next day it read “Be strong and take courage.” But on Aug. 9, when she became First Lady, the verse must have given her pause. What it said, in the prose of the Living Bible she prefers to the King James version, was from Psalms 39:1: “I will keep a muzzle on my mouth.” A muzzled mouth is her “That's what I've found most refreshing about her,” says Nancy Hanks, chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts, who has been conferring with Mrs. Ford about projects she might officially support, particularly those involving underprivileged and handicapped children. “Her approach is solid and very American, without being in the least provincial. Her style is not to teach people to love and revere American arts and crafts, but to show them, by her own example, how important these things are. And whenever mention something she's not well‐versed in, like regional differences in pottery or weaving, she'll stop me and say, ‘Now just a minute, what in the world are those differences?’ She's never for a moment pretentious. What she thinks, she says.” Representative Shirley Chisholm, whom few would regard as a likely soul sister of the First Lady, commends Mrs. Ford for her candor, as do such disparate others as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who says, “I like her very much,” and the syndicated household hints columnist, Heloise. Heloise, who gets hundreds of thousands of letters a year from housewives, reports that of late her mail has included a deal of praise for the new President's wife. “The gals love the way she comes out and says what she thinks. They feel as if she's their next‐door neighbor, just one of the bunch. She doesn't seem a bit stuck‐up. And she's done a world of good being Only the hopelessly genteel take issue with that. Margaret Mead, not exactly one of Heloise's “gals,” welcomes the attention Mrs. Ford's mastectomy has brought to what until recently was a furtive secret sorority. Jacqueline Susann, who wrote four best‐selling novels in the 12 years she lived after having the same operation, may have been the last victim to regard breast cancer as a shameful “social disease.” Knowing sympathy rushed to Mrs. Ford from Marvella Bayh, the Indiana Senator's wife who had been crusading since her own mastectomy, and from Alice Longworth, who before she turned 90, cheerfully called herself the “topless octogenarian.” On the Today Show, Barbara Walters used herself as a model to show how to check for symptoms. Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller's life, along with hundreds of others, may quite possibly have been saved by Betty Ford's simple decision not to hide her news, nice though it wasn't. “That's the part that's just thrilled her,” says Mrs. Ford's good friend Peggy Whyte. “I talked to her when she was still in the hospital, and I've never heard her bubble so in all the years I've known her. To think that her misfortune is helping other women just makes her feel very beholden —she says she can really sense all those waves of prayers.” Many or the prayers have been secular, in the form of what Betty Friedan calls “the energy and power of the women's movement. She's done so much good for the movement, speaking out as she has for things like the Equal Rights Amendment, hope some of our strength can flow back to her.” Nobody opposes the E.R.A. more fervently than Phyllis Schlafly, whose Illinois‐based campaign against the amendment Mrs. Ford can certainly have made no easier. “She doesn't seem to realize,” Mrs. Schlafly protests, “that if the amendment were to pass, we'd have coeducational washrooms, and girls like her own daughter would have to be drafted.” But the First Lady realizes these facts very well. She and her personal assistant, Nancy Howe, discuss them often. “They've had coed facilities in the Far East for years,” Mrs. Howe says, “and rape is a lot less common there than it is in our prudish societies.” “And if men have to serve in the military,” says Mrs. Ford, “I don't see why women shouldn't too, the way they do in Israel. Why, if this had been an issue in my own time, I'd probably have been the first to enlist.” She might have, at that. It was scarcely less startling for her to leave Grand Rapids to go to New York and become a John Robert Powers model, which she was for a while and, worse yet, a dancer. If it hadn't been for her mother, she might have made dance a lifelong career. Hedi Pope, in whose Alexandria modern dance studio Mrs. Ford enrolled, says that “even having hail four children, she was still the best student in my classes. I could see how she might once have been very promising. But a dance career means total immersion or nothing. Those gals who go to New York to dance seriously have to forget about everything else. It must have been a huge decision for her to make.” It must have indeed, with Martha Graham on one hand encouraging her to stay, and Hortense Bloomer on the other saying what nice showers and weddings other girls her age were having back in Michigan. Her mentor and her mother didn't actually wage an outright tug‐of‐war for young Betty's future, but they might as well have. Mrs. Bloomer won, in any case, and her daughter came home, in what must have been more a trudge than a pirouette. Before long she had a wedding of her own, but not to Gerald Ford. The bridegroom's name that time was William Warren. “We've just giggled and giggled about that,” says Nancy Howe, who seldom is far from the First Lady's side. “When somebody wanted to know what the date of her first wedding was, she couldn't remember for the life of her. That's how little it mattered.” That five‐year marriage, such as it was, ended emotionally long before the divorce was official. “It taught me,” says Mrs. Ford, “that there are some people you just can't change.” Resuming her maiden name, she taught dance to handicapped and black children, coordinated fashions for a Grand Rapids department store called Herpolsheimer's, and took up with the dazzling blond bachelor lawyer and former star center for Michigan's football team. Their wedding had to wait until just before November. Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer. All First Ladies get a lot of mail. Even those who just smile ornamentally and keep out of the way can expect a couple of thousand letters in a routine week. They also get a good many phone calls. Phones in the East Wing don't ring, though, they chime. Their ladylike two‐tone chime belies what, in Mrs. Ford's case, can be angry urgency at the, other end. If today she says mildly that we all ought to fight inflation by eating less beef, or buy cheaper cuts of it anyway, you can be sure that tomorrow plenty of cattlemen in places like Montana will dial 202‐456‐1414 to register their ire. Answering such calls is one of the tasks of the First Lady's staff of 28, a dedicated lot who usually lunch, if at all, from vending machines in the White House basement. Some of them plan state dinners, some keep schedules, some juggle the incessant pleas of the press. Nine work full‐time to answer her mail, much of it, by necessity, with form letters. “They think she's magic, they think she's Santa Claus,” says Tom McCoy, who has been analyzing First Ladies' mail since the days of Mamie Eisenhower. “Sometimes they write to say their child is dying, sometimes just to say they wish she'd drop by for coffee. Oh, there are just all kinds of And all kinds of answers. How nice that you're having a rummage sale. Here is a steel engraving of the White House for your auction. How thoughtful of you to share your original song (or poem) with the Fords. Here is your autographed picture, complete with pawprint of Shan, the First Cat of the Land. Happy birthday, if you're 80 or older. Happy anniversary, if you've been together for at least 25 years. Mrs. Ford is pleased to hear that you share her views (or interested that you don't) on abortion, or marijuana, or psychiatry, or the E.R.A. Lately, a task force of volunteers has helped mail out thanks for some 50,000 messages wishing the First Lady a quick recovery. These wishes, it would seem, are being granted. “She's had occasional transitory letdowns, like all cancer patients,” says Dr. William M. Lukash, the White House physician, “but I'm optimistic. Her surgery was highly successful, and she has a really ‘up’ attitude, an extraordinary determination to carry on.” “I, feel great,” Mrs. Ford said on the phone one recent morning, and she sounded it. “Probably it helped that stayed in the hospital a full two weeks, until the scans were clear and I'd been through all the tests. Jerry was traveling then and didn't want me to leave Bethesda till he was back, and when did come home, I wasn't even wearing a bandage.” A chemotherapy regimen obliges her to take four pills each day one week out of every six. Three times every day she stops whatever she's doing for a five‐minute ritual of exercises to insure full mobility for her right arm and shoulder. “It's a stretching, circling, lariat‐type motion,” Mrs. Ford says. “Being righthanded probably makes things easier, too.” The pinched neck nerve has given her no recent trouble. On weekends at Camp David, “a very relaxing spot where it's almost impossible to think about work,” she goes for long walks with Liberty, the family's new golden retriever. She gave up plans to go with the President to Japan, but both the seashore and the mountains are on their calendar for this month. They will go to Martinique to meet with the President of France and later, of course, to Colorado for the traditional Christmas reunion. Every week she does more. “Betty had pizza and beer along with everyone else when she dropped by here the other day,” an Alexandria neighbor says, “and her face looked radiant, but I thought she seemed too thin.” Dr. Lukash, however, isn't worried; he reports that the First Lady's weight is holding steady between 105 and 110 pounds. “Oh, I clean my plate,” she says. “I even manage‐liver and onions, a favorite of Jerry's I'm not especially fond of.” At the November state dinner for the Chancellor of Austria, she finally corraled her husband upstairs from the dance floor at 1 A.M., “not because I was tired, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ut he was.” At seven the next morning, she was up for a meeting with her staff. “I'm way behind in the work I've got to do, and there are so many new people in my life, I've been neglecting old friends,” Mrs. Ford says. “When I retire, I'm going to lobby for a salary for First Ladies, because it's much more of a 24‐hour job than anyone would guess.” Diplomatically, she declines to say which of her predecessors most inspire her, “because now that I realize what they've had to put up with, I have new respect and admiration for every one of them.” Nor will she ponder aloud about the business of being an icon. Whatever the public may think, that's not how she sees herself. “I just hope to leave my mark as a very human person interested in America as a country and in its people particularly. I don't feel that because I'm First Lady I'm any different from what I was before. It can happen to anyone. After all," it hus happened to anyone.” ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Look at Sex Roles In Blue‐Collar Jobs,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/09/archives/a-look-at-sex-roles-in-bluecollar-jobs-by-enid-nemy.html,"A long‐range research program to restructure the labor market to accommodate women workers was one of five major points agreed on at the first national conference on women in blue‐collar industrial and service jobs. The two‐day conference, which concluded Friday, was sponsored by the Ford Foundation. It brought together 45 women involved in research and women's projects, representing a variety of educational, community, union and social science institutions across the country. The conference agreed, as well, to: ¶A program of sex role reeducation to end the imprinting of sex stereotypes on behaviors and on job classifications, ¶To encourage the pursuit of all available research on occupational health hazards. ¶To monitor job lay‐off patterns of women workers during the current recession. ¶To reaffirm support of working women for affirmative action programs and full employment, with jobs in the public sector provided as needed. “The female work force, with its special characteristics, is rarely referred to,” said Alice Cook, professor emeritus at Cornell University, in her closing remarks. Mrs. Cook, who still lectures at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, noted that the life cycle of most working women included an entry, an exit and a re‐entry into the work force. “This is a special problem,” she pointed a out, “because women's work is interrupted and men's is not.” She emphasized and that the labor marshould be geared to thinking in terms of people who have varying life patterns. She said, too, that unless sex discrimination was eliminated at an early age, with textbooks rewritten and teachers retrained, as had been done in Sweden, “it will be taken as given that women must bear a double burden, that they must be housewives and work.” “Over the short haul, we must take this view,” she said. “But we must have a long view as wel.” A panel on white blue‐collar workers and feminism concluded that “if we wish to make feminism more significant to the blue‐collar worker, we must leaven it with some class analysis.” “Not every issue is purely male‐female,” said Sheila Tobias, associate provost of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. “Most issues impinging on blue‐collar workers, male and female, may very well be class.” She also noted that many blue‐collar women wanted to be disassociated from welfare, perceived the feminist as putting down child rearthe and the home, and feared the word “sisterhood.” Other differences included the blue‐collar belief that many family breakups were attributable to the women's movement she said, and added that abortion, sexuality and life styles were issues that aliented some blue‐collar workers from feminists. “We feel there is some misperception as to what feminist goals are,” she said. Unemployment Plight Concern about the young black woman was voiced by Jean Fairfax, director of the Division of Legal Informalion and Community of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund. The group that suffers most from unemployment is the young black female from said to “The years es age,” she said. The figures are absopens staggering. What happens never this black woman who never gets into the work force when she should? What happens 10 years later?” The conference, convened to collect information on the blue‐collar information women establish an infotmation network and define the kind of programs needed for this segment of the population, also stressed the importance of a national health bill that would take into account the growing set of problems in mental and emotional health, occasioned by increasing stress as women entered the job market. It also suggested a viable system of child care that would meet the needs of women who worked on shifts and urged better counseling and guidance information for blue‐collar women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H.E.W. Bars Full Matching Aid For the Poor in Abortion Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/09/archives/hew-bars-full-matching-aid-for-the-poor-in-abortion-cases.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (AP) —The Department of Health, Education and Welfare proposed today that sterilizations, but not abortions be considered family planning services for which the department will pay 90 per cent of the costs for poor people. This represents a turnaround from a June, 1973, proposal which, because it did not define family planning services, would have included abortions in the higher Medicaid matching reimbursement to states. Dr. Louis M. Hellman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs, said there was no indication that Congress intended to include abortions in the 1970 Family Planning Act or the 1972 Social Security amendments that increased the matching grants to 90 per cent. Under the new proposal, open for public comment the next 30 days before it can be put into effect, the department would pay 90 per cent, and states 10 per cent, for family planning. Family planning is defined as “any medically approved means, including diagnosis, treatment, drugs, supplies, and related counseling which are furnished or prescribed by or under the supervision of a physician for individuals of childbearing age including minors who can be considered to be sexually active for purposes of enabling such individuals freely to determine the number and spacing of their children.” The department said that states could continue to receive Federal matching funds for therapeutic and nontherapeutic abortions as a medical service at the current rate ranging from 50 to 81 per cent. The percentage is based upon per capita income in each state, with Mississippi receiving the highest percentage. Dr. Hellman said the department's refusal to pay 90 per cent of the costs of abortions “is not going to make one bit of difference.” He estimated that the department was financing between 222,000 and 278,000 abortions each year for poor women, most of them on welfare, at an average cost of $180 each.

Appeal Due in Abortion Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/appeal-due-in-abortion-ruling.html,"TRENTON—As the Assembly prepares to vote on a measure that would bar Medicaid payments to poor women for abortions, the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is preparing to appeal a Superior Court decision upholding the right of private hospitals to prohibit physicians from performing abortions in their operating rooms. Stephen M. Nagler, the A.C.L.U. executive director for New Jersey, contends that most hospitals are public institutions and, as such, fall within a United States Supreme Court decision that no state can interfere with a woman having an abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Nagler and others who have participated in efforts to liberalize New Jersey abortion practices conceded that any physician, nurse or patient could refuse to participate in an abortion on religious or moral grounds. However, said Mr. Nagler, it is unconstitutional for a hospital to rule that it has the right to make this moral, or religious decision in behalf of its staff. In a decision handed down In October, Superior Court Judge Herbert. Horn ruled that any law requiring a “hospital to act contrary to the community conscience, as well as the conscience of its management, would itself be contrary to the public good.” He made his ruling in rejecting an A.C.L.U. suit that sought to force the Bridgeton Hospital Association in Cumberland County, Salem County Hospital and Newcomb Hospital in Vineland to allow abortions to be performed in their institutions. The hospitals involved permit abortions only when the life of the mother is threatened. Judge Horn did not rule specifically on a recent law signed by Governor Byrne. It provides that “no hospital or other health facility shall be required to provide an abortion or a sterilization facility.” The measure also says that physicians and nurses have a moral or religious right to refuse to take part in abortions. The new law has generally, been regarded as applying to both public and private hos pitals. However, even Governor Byrne raised questions himself about the laws constitutionality, and the A.C.L.U. already has succeeded in striking down a similar regulation in Boston. In that action, the United States Supreme Court, in effed, upheld a lower‐court ruling that Bosten Could not ban abortions in a city‐operated hospital. To do so the decision said, would “violate Wonian's right to privacy.” As far as private, voluntaryhospitals in New Jersey are Concerned, the New Jersey, Hospital Association believes that every institution should make its own abortion policy. In its suit, the A.C.L.U. contended that virtually every hospital, private or not, fell within the Supreme Court ruling ‐ on abortions. However, Judge Horn rejected that argument, asserting that the state's involvement in private institutions was not substantial enough to alter what the court regarded as the fundamental rights of private hospitals. As for the impending vote on the bill to ban Medicaid payments to poor women, Mr. Nagler said that the A.C.L.U. would file a suit contesting: the measure's constitutionality “before the ink from the Governor's pen was dry on the bill.” The Medicaid ban cleared the Assembly's Institutions, Health and Welfare Committee by a 6‐2 vote on Nov. 18. Thus, it is now in a position to be voted on when the Assembly returns for its special tax session, this week REMEMBER THE NEEDIEST",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vatican's Many‐Front Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/vaticans-manyfront-battle-catholic-countries-are-defying-dogma.html,"The movement toward change in Roman Catholicism—authorized, in the form of liturgical renewal, and unauthorized, as in attitudes toward birth control — is expanding into two more areas: marriage, with its tight proscriptions against divorce and remarriage; and abortion, with its total prohibitions against the direct termination of fetal life for whatever reason and at whatever stage. As with other changes since the papacy of John XXIII (1958–63) and Vatican Council II (1962–65), happenings that opened modern Catholicism to change, impetus comes from different parts of the world and a variety of forces. The changes range from evolving theology to new civil laws, such as those that have made divorce possible in Italy and, as of this month, abortion legal in France. Catholic theology does not equate morality with the law, as Connecticut Catholics were reminded last August when their bishops imposed excommunication on all who take part in abortions, including physicians and nurses. Nevertheless, Catholic leaders know from past experience how difficult becomes the holding of old lines when public law and popular practice move in another direction. Hegemony Weakening The Vatican, as the seat of Catholic leadership, is experienced at grappling with legal contraventions in officially secular countries, like those of Eastern Europe, and countries like the United States with strict policies of separation of church and State. Now, however, the Vatican has to cope with radical legislative change in places where Catholic influence has historically predominated, as in France, and where Catholic ascendency was thought to be protected by concordat, as in Italy. The Vatican exchanges diplomatic representatives with 77 countries, and with several has negotiated concordats that in the past have given the Vatican influence on social and moral issues—not only in Italy, but also in other countries such as Spain, Portugal, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. The complication for today's church is that Catholic hegemony is weakening in the once‐surest of religious situations so that the effort to maintain Catholic values is now largely a nation‐by‐nation struggle involving governments on one level and people on another. In some places, old traditions are holding firm—as in Ireland, where a bill that would have legalized the sale of contraceptives to married persons was defeated last July. But change is discernible in other countries of strong Catholic orientation on cultural as well as legal levels. In Brazil, for example, legal separation is reported to be spreading. Brazil, like Spain, Paraguay and Ireland, still bars divorce. As between divorce and abortion, the Catholic Church is unquestionably more open about divorce. In fact, it is apparently willing to let theological and canonical development take its course. Officially, the church's position remains steady: marriage is permanent, except in narrow invalidating circumstances, such as physical or psychic impotency, in which cases annulment is possible. The inequity of Catholic marriage norms has long been under attack in theological circles, and the Catholic leadership has of late shown willingness to ameliorate old and hard rules. Last June, for instance, the Vatican extended the innovative United States marriage‐annulment processes that in five years' time have resulted in a 10‐fold increase of annulments over 1969. This year Catholic marriage tribunals in the United States will grant, by one estimate, more than 7,000 annulments. Numerous dioceses in the United States and elsewhere have quietly instituted programs whereby “good conscience” Catholics of stable second marriages—those able to justify in conscience personal situations at variance with official church discipline—are readmitted to the sacraments, something once unthinkable. Some priests now take it upon themselves to perform remarriages of Catholics, even though the circumstances might violate the letter of church law. Much of this occurs with higher authority looking the other way. There is no looking the other way, however, where abortion is concerned. When a New York Jesuit priest, the Rev. Joseph O'Rourke, last August baptized in Marlboro, Mass., a baby whose mother had taken a public stand in favor of an abortion clinic, the case reached to Rome and Father O'Rourke was dismissed from the Jesuits. Signs of a cemented position are multiple. Last February there was the instruction of the American bishops condoning civil disobedience to “any civil law that may require abortion”; last March there was the blocking from North German Broadcasting of a film dealing with abortion, an action led by Julius Cardinal Doepfner of Munith and Freising; and last month there was the letter from a committee of the United States bishops addressed to the House and Senate committees considering the Vice Presidential nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller. The letter urged the committees to ascertain that Mr. Rockefeller will not use his office “to promote a personal viewpoint on permissive abortion.” A Strong Document The strongest evidence of Catholic adamancy on abortion came Nov. 25 in a 4,500‐word document from the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Approved by Pope Paul, the document made Catholic opposition to abortion unqualified and unequivocal. It specified that neither threat to a mother's life nor extenuating circumstances may justify abortion, thus shortcircuiting budding Catholic opinion that would favor abortion in hardship cases, such as a damaged fetus, rape and incest. The document added that Catholics “may never take part in a propaganda campaign” to legalize abortion laws, nor vote for them. The latter prohibition is apparently aimed at the school of Catholic thought that would place the abortion question within the context, of the pluralistic society, and argue therefrom that Catholics have a right to oppose abortion and seek to persuade people on the issue, but no right to force others to accept the Catholic viewpoint beyond the point of persuasion. Authority has the situation in hand. But among the generation coming along, it may be a different story. A 1972 survey of the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago gauged approval of legal abortion among Catholics under age 30 at from 32 to 89 per cent, depending upon such conditions as threat to life, hardship and rape. In 1965, those percentages were from 8 to 66. And last year a survey at George. town University showed 64 per cent of the respondents approving abortion during the first three months of pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MANILA SET BACK ON BIRTH CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/mania-set-back-on-birth-control-fewer-women-cooperating-in.html,"MANILA, Dec. 14 — The Philippines, whose population of 39 million is expected to double in the next two decades is running into problems in her voluntary campaign to reduce births and educate Filipinos in family planning. Last year, according to the Population Institute of the University of the Philippines, 60,000 women a month were cooperating in the program, but incomplete figures for this year show a significant decrease. On the plus side, the institute reported, the birth rate has been cut 5 per cent since the campaign was begun four years ago. The Government, private agencies and the Agency for International Development, the United States organization that administers foreign aid abroad, are cooperating in it. Thus far the drive has cost some $40‐million—“just about the cost of four jet fighters,” a family‐planning expert here said. The cost is shared by the Government and AID. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities and several private foundations are supporting smaller, parallel programs. Today, not only are fewer people enlisting in the cam paign, Government officials said, but many who have joined in have discarded such “highly effective” methods as birth‐control pills and intrauterine devices for the less reliable “rhythm” system and male prophylactics. Some experts said that women had either had unfavorable experiences with the pill and the intrauterine device, or were too freightened to try them. Another problem, according to Dr. Rafael Esmundo, who heads the Government Commission on Population, was that “people did not relate family planning to their real needs.” When the Government took the leadership role in the program in 1970, it created a network of 2,200 Village clinics, each staffed by a physician, a nurse and a “motivator”—an expert who would educate those cooperating in birth control and family planning. Dr. Esmundo said that the campaign should be keyed more closely to the development needs of the Philippines by showing parallels between it and food, production, irrigation and manpower training, among other things. “We must show married couples that fewer children will mean adequate food, clothing, shelter, and education for every one,” he said in an interview. When it became apparent that the drive was slackening, a private organization, seeking to revive it, sponsored a seminar on abortion, and there were explosive reactions from the Philippines' Roman Catholics. Abortion is illegal here. In a pastoral letter read aloud in all churches, the Most Rev. Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, reminded the Islands' Christians of the concern of the church for the unborn. To placate the Catholics Dr. Conrado Lorenzo, an officer of the Government's Population Commission, publicly restated he Government's official stand against abortion and condemned it as a method of birth control. And he emphasized the voluntary nature of the national asking Christian groups to join in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ideas &Trends Education, Religion, Privacy",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/15/archives/ideas-trends-school-files-the-law-went-too-far.html,"An exhibit of Chinese archeological finds has opened at Washington's National Gallery of Art, but without the usual press preview. The gallery, on the advice of the State Department, canceled the preview rather than accede to Peking's demand that it control the guest list. The People's Republic had wanted to bar newsmen coming from Nationalist China, South Korea, South Africa and Israel. Peking does not recognize the Taiwan or Seoul Governments; South Africa and Israel have also become targets in China's effort to make an impact on the Third World. The invitation list, thus purged on ideological grounds, was a violation of the concept of freedom, of the press. The gallery refused to issue it, and the Chinese asked that the preview be canceled. The gallery and the State Department agreed cancellation was the solution. Another Accommodation A different kind of accommodation was made public last week. According to Ross Y. Koen and other East Asia specialists, the 1960 publication of Mr. Koen's “The China Lobby in American Politics” was suppressed by the publisher, Macmillan, after objections by the Chinese Nationalist Embassy. Advance copies were recalled from libraries and reviewers, and the print run of 7,500 was destroyed. Only a few copies survived. Among the offending passages was an assertion that high Chinese Nationalist officials and some Americans had collaborated in illegal narcotics traffic. Officials at Macmillan, Inc., successor to the Macmillan Publishing Company, said last week they could not find records of the incident. The book has been reissued by Harper & Row and Octagon books, with the offending passages included. School Files: The Law Went Too Far The Senate has approved legislative changes designed to eliminate “unintended” consequences of a new law giving parents and older students the right to inspect and challenge school records. The proposed changes must now be considered by a Senate‐House conference committee. Colleges have complained that the law, which went into effect Nova 19, would force them to show students existing letters of recommendation that were solicited under promise of confidentiality. Another controversial point was that college students would have access to their parents' income tax statements submitted as part of requests for financial aid. Senator James L. Buckley of New York, who introduced the original legislation, has said he did not foresee the consequences that have provoked the criticism. Last week he and Senator Claiborne Pell, of Rhode Island introduced amendments that would guarantee the confidentiality of letters of recommendations in the files, permit students to waive the right to see selected documents and restrict the right of students to see parents' financial statements. The law was intended to end abuses such as the case of, a young boy who allegedly returned hurriedly and unzippered from the bathroom and had the observation put into his file that he showed “exhibitionist” tendencies. It also was aimed at allowing students to become more knowledgeable about the elements involved in decisions made about them by school officials. The legislation, which applies to schools at all levels receiving Federal funds, also restricts the rights of institutions to release the content of students' files to outsiders. The parents' right of inspection and challenge passes to the children themselves when they turn 18 years of age. Abortions for Poor: States To Pay More In a reversal of a previous position, the Federal Government has decided that sterilizations but not abortions should be considered family planning services for which the Government would pay 90 per cent of the costs for poor people under Medicaid. States would pay the other 10 per cent. The effect of the decision, which is open to public comment for 30 days before it can be enforced, is to place more of the cost burden on the states for abortions for the poor. The decision distinguishes between a family planning service and a medical service. Because there is no fetus involved, sterilization is classified as family planning, whereas abortion is regarded as a medical service. The classifications are significant in that they determine the Federal reimbursement to the states. A family planning service carries the 90‐10 matching reimbursements; a medical service calls for reimbursement of from 50 to 81 per cent based on a state's per capita income. As announced last week by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the new decision clarifies a June, 1973, proposal which, because it did not define family planning services, would have included abortions in the higher reim bursement category. H.E.W. said that states could continue to receive Federal matching funds for abortions as a medical service. Guaranteeing Candor in the Guarantees At a time when a cost‐conscious public is making increasing consumer complaints, Congress is moving toward new legislation that would set Federal standards for product warranties and, improve Government consumer‐protection. A Senate‐House conference committee last week agreed on proposals that would require specific language in warranties for such purchases as cars and appliances, and distinguish between a “full” warranty and a “limited” one. A full warranty would require the manufacturer to repair the product promptly and without charges. A socalled “lemon” provision would give buyers the right to a refund or a new item after the manufacturer had tried and failed a “reasonable” number of times to fix it. The Federal Trade Commission would decide what was “reasonable.” If the company wanted to limit the duration of the warranty, it would have to insert the term in the heading: for example, “full 90‐day warranty.” Companies that wanted qualifications in their guarantees would have to label them clearly as “limited” warranties. This is intended to eliminate ambiguous terms and to clarify confusing requirements, such as sending in a card. Correction It was incorrectly reported in this section last week that a one‐year moratorium on mining Federal coal in the West was part of a compromise worked out between the Senate and the House on a bill to curb strip mining. The moratorium was not on the mining of coal, but on the leasing of Federal coal deposits in the West for one year. Mining would continue on lands already leased. Ideas & Trends Continued Mother Seton, An American Saint Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, a pioneer in parochial education and charitable institutions in the United States, has been recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as the first Americanborn saint. The Vatican completed the long canonization procedure last week when it approved the legitimacy of a miracle attributed to Mother Seton. Pope Paul VI announced that her formal induction into sainthood would take place next September. Mother Seton's supporters have been working in her behalf for 92 years, and the Vatican has been officially pursuing her cause since 1940. The canonization process involves painstaking scrutiny of biographical records and efforts to confirm the miracles necessary for sainthood. Mother Seton lived from 1774 to 1821. Beatification, the last major step toward canonization, was bestowed on Mother Seton in,1963 after the Vatican approved two miracles—one a cure of cancer, the other a recovery from leukemia—attributed to her intercession with God after her death. Last week Pope Paul waived the requirement for two snore miracles for sainthood, accepting a single case of recovery from meningitis. Though more significance was perhaps attached to sainthood in earlier days of the church, canonization is still widely regarded by Catholics as symbolic of heroism and inspiration. Soviet and U.S. Finally Agree on Words and Music The Soviet Union will now be paying in dollars for at least some of the American music it permits to be played in public. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which acts as agent for 16,000 composers and lyricists and their 5,700 publishers, has signed an agreement with Russia's new Copyright Agency. As of Jan. 1, an ASCAP member starts earning royalty from the Soviets for each live performance of an orchestral or vocal work published after May, 1973. ASCAP will DO NOT FORGET THE NEEDIEST! represent Russian musicians here. In the past, the Soviets had set aside rubles for a few favored Americans, which had to be spent in Russia. Despite Soviet unease even in times of detente about the effect of Western art on the Russian man in the street, a good deal of American music, including rock, is played; less modern Soviet work is known in the West. And With Flowers Another Soviet‐American accord was announced last week, relating not to culture but cultivation. The New York Botanical Gardens and other American arboretums will exchange with their Russian counterparts seeds of grains, vines, herbs and trees endangered in their native habitats. It has been estimated that 500 of the 20,000 plant species found in each nation are facing extinction; many of them have potential for timber and fiber production, food cultivation and medicine. A species that doesn't fare well in one country may often take hold in another; the aim of the exchange is to preserve as many useful varieties as possible. WPIX's License Is Renewed In a test case of Government standards for television performance, a Federal hearing officer has given initial approval for the license renewal of station WPIX in New York City, and has rejected the challenge of a citizens' group. Whatever the outcome, the case is expected to have strong impact on future access to the country's television channels by people dissatisfied with broadcasting's status quo. The action last week by James F. Tierney, an administrative law judge of the Federal “Communications Cornmission, is subject to review by the commission and is open to appeal. WPIX, through subsidiaries, is owned by The Tribune Company, which publishes The Chicago Tribune and The Daily News in New York. It has operated Channel 11 since 1948. The essence of the case was: Did WPIX perform in the “public interest, convenience or necessity,” or should the franchise be awarded to an untested rival on the basis of promises that it could do better? Judge Tierney's decision reverses earlier recommendations of the F.C.C. Broadcast Bureau, based on extensive hearings, that WPIX should be disqualified for engaging in questionable news practices, and that Forum Communications, Inc., the challenging consortium of diverse citizens, was qualified to be a licensee. During the hearings, WPIX admitted to such practices in its newscasts as having superimposed “via satellite” on film not sent by satellite, and having identified a report from Vienna as from Prague during the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. Judge Tierney said the evidence did not indicate “contrived falsification” by WPIX, but rather “little more than singular lapses in poor, even reckless judgment.” He said that “under any reasonable standard, the WPIX program proposals would fully satisfy” the requirement to identify problems of the area.. The judge disqualified Forum for what he called the inadequacy of its financial position and its assessments of the area's television needs. Approaching ZPG Population growth in the United States is now less than 1 per cent a year and approaching zero, a United Nations report has shown. The projected average rate for the first half of the 1970's is put at ninetenths of 1 per cent, compared with an average rate of 1.3 per cent for the previous decade. The study attributes the decrease to a low‐level of immigration, as well as to a declining birth rate. At the end of 1973, American women were averaging 1.9 children, which is below the 22 average needed to replace the present population. Zero population growth is many years off, however, because births still exceed deaths.

SENATORS IN FRANCE BACK ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/16/archives/senators-in-france-back-abortion-bill.html,"PARIS, Dec. 15—The French Senate approved a Governmentsponsored abortion bill by a vote of 182 to 91 early this morning. The new bill allows any woman to have an abortion during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. The operation must be carried out by a doctor in an established hospital or clinic. Women under 18 must obtain their parents' permission. The Senate had added several amendments to the bill, but did not modify the original text substantially.

LAWYER ACCUSED OF DEATH OF FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/17/archives/lawyer-accused-of-death-of-fetus-7months-pregnant-woman-dies-after.html,"HOWELL TOWNSHIP, Dec. 16 (AP)—A Massachusetts lawyer faces two charges of death by automobile here following a car accident in which he is alleged to have caused the death of a pregnant woman and her unborn child. The fetus was stillborn following an accident Saturday night. The mother, who was seven months' pregnant, died yesterday. The lawyer, Thomas Dougherty, 26 years old, of Weymouth, Mass., was released in $5,000 bail by Municipal Court Judge Lawrence Friedman. Mr. Dougherty also was charged with driving while impaired. Legal experts said they could not recall any previous New Jersey case in which the death of a fetus was the basis for such a charge. “It appears to be an unprecedented proposition,” said Harvey Sklaw, a torts professor at Seton Hall University School of Law. “Even in cases in which the death of the fetus was intentional, such as during an abortion, charges resulting from the death have not been upheld. Here, the death was clearly unintentional.” The police defended the charge on two grounds. “The first reason was that doctors told us the fetus was killed in the crash and not by anything else,” said a police spokesman. “The second rule was going along with the six months' fetal viability rule.” That rule, the spokesman explained, holds that a fetus is capable of surviving outside the mother's womb after six months. The mother, Mrs. M Earlean Key, 23, of Farmingdale, was a passenger in a car driven by her husband, Edward. The Key auto collided with Mr. Dougherty's car on Route 9. The police said that Mr. Dougherty was attempting to make a left thin across the oncoming lanes of traffic when the collision occurred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YEAR'S ‘PROGRESS’ CITED BY WILSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/18/archives/years-progress-cited-by-wilson-outgoing-governor-reports-on-his.html,"Governor Wilson assessed his own brief term in office yesterday., as a “year of progress' during which he both undertook “historic initiatives” and charted a “new course, essential to our time,” for state government. The Governor reviewed his performance in a 14,000‐ward document, described by his office as a “report to the people” and released, his office as a and released, his office said, to mark “the first anniversary of his accession to office.” Since Mr. Wilson leaves the governorship in less than two weeks, it is also the last time he will mark that date as Governor. The report, despite its dry language, is a distinctly personal product in which the outgoing Governor keeps one eye on his place in history and the other current politics. For example, while he does not mention the name of his successor, Governor‐elect Hugh L. Carey, Mr. Wilson offers Mr. Carey advice about fiscal phi losophy and the next state budget. The state will finish the present fiscal year, Mr. Wilson asserts in his report, with a surplus of $17 ‐ million, which “would cover the continuation of the suspension of the 2.5 per cent income tax surcharge” through March 31, 1975. Mr. Carey, on the other hand, has said that the state may be headed for a fiscal crisis and will probably need the $85‐million in revenue that the surcharge brings in The temporary suspension of the surcharge expires on Dec. 31. In reviewing the record he compiled since he took over the governorship from Nelson A. Rockefeller last Dec. 18, Mr. Wilson observed: “During the years immediately ahead, it is my firm belief that the performance of state government will be measured by the people against this year of progress just completed.” Among the “historic initiatives” the Governor cited were the state's action to improve rail service and to maintain the 35‐cent subway fare in New York City; increased state aid to local schools; the new tuition assistance program for private and public colleges; the outlawing of discrimination against women in credit transactions, and the new Freedom of Information Act. He also listed among his achievements several highly controversial measures, including the restoration of the death penalty for the murder of a police officer, and the imposition of new restrictions on access to abortion. The Governor included as well bills he had signed, but in which he had not played an active role in shepherding through the Legislature. The new law dropping the corroboration requirement in rape cases was one such measure. Throughout the report, Governor Wilson stressed the importance of fiscal prudence. “For this; year of progress,” he wrote, “was based upon a basic principle: that for the future of ourselves and our posterity, new needs must be met and responsible progress attained with a full awareness of the absolute essentiality of both reducing the size and cost of government and of nurturing the growth of job opportunities for New York's working men and women.” The language of the report is in several places reminiscent of the gubernatorial campaign. Governor Wilson cited his support of the Office of the Welfare Inspector General, which, he said, “works to separate the greedy from the needy”—a familiar campaign phrase. He also pointed to reduction of $138‐million in state taxes, a figure, Mr. Carey often disputed during the campaign because it includes $85‐million for the suspended income tax surcharge, which has been suspended for the last two years as welt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two Affectionate Family Portraits at the Whitney:The Program,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/19/archives/two-affectionate-family-portraits-at-the-whitneythe-program.html,"In delving into their roots, Martha Coolidge and Amalie R. Rothschild, the young movie makers responsible, respectively, for ""Old Fashioned Woman"" and ""Nana, Mom and Me,"" the documentaries that arrived yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, vividly illustrate the idea that personal history need not be a bore. If traces of self-indulgence occasionally surface in these family portraits, they depict meaningful personalities lovingly exposed by deeply concerned relatives.In both instances, the protagonists, as well as the film makers, largely speak for themselves in forthright, sometimes understated and occasionally funny terms that point up the color, joys and hardships of their backgrounds. Miss Coolidge's grandmother and Miss Rothschild's grandmother and parents evolve as people worthy of the attention they are being paid.Martha Tilton Coolidge, her granddaughter admits, ""has been a small but intimidating old-fashioned woman."" But in ""Old Fashioned Woman,"" which, incidentally, had a screening at the recent New York Film Festival, the 86-year-old subject about whom she is so curious emerges, in a brilliant but gently hued cameo, as a charming, resolute Yankee who is old only in years.The tragedies and fulfillments of a life distilled from the past that dates back to Colonial days have enabled her to take time, life, family, friends and issues, old and new, such as abortion and morality, in stride and wisdom. Her grandmother comes across as much of a comfort to a viewer as she obviously did to her sensitively inquisitive granddaughter.Equally illuminating is Miss Rothschild's inspection of her antecedents, who, she says in a program footnote, helped her in ""self-discovery."" They also, it is almost immediately obvious, show an observer the subtle but definite influence they had on the dedicated researcher who focused color cameras and sound on them. Miss Rothschild's ""Nana"" is, like Miss Coolidge's grandmother, a forthright 86-year-old who, unfortunately, is not too willing to submit to questioning. But her parents, an artist-mother and an equally loving lawyer-musician father, indicate that the roots are strong and effective.The generation gaps in both films are made into bridges to an affectionate, perhaps biased, but always edifying look at unheralded individualists whose lives and values are worthwile and stir the heart and mind.

SENATE CEREMONY,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/20/archives/senate-ceremony-he-tells-of-gratitude-for-the-privilege-of-serving.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 —Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was sworn in tonight as the 41st Vice President of the United States. He was sworn in by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in a televised ceremony in the Senate chamber. Mr. Rockefeller became Vice President one day short of four months after his nomination by President Ford. He was escorted to the Senate by Mr. Ford. Members of Mr. Rockefeller's family, Congress, the Cabinet and New York State dignitaries were among those who witnessed the ceremony. Transcript of the ceremony appears on Page 16. He took the oath of office with his hand on a family Bible at 10:12 P.M. The former New York Governor, only the second man to become Vice President without a public vote, took office after the House completed Congressional approval of his nomination by a vote of 287 to 128. The Senate approved him by a vote of 90 to 7 last week. Ford Is Pleased Immediately after the confirmation vote, the White House issued the following statement by President Ford: “I am delighted that Nelson Rockefeller has been duly confirmed today to be the 41st Vice President of the United States. I congratulate him and look forward to his participation and assistance in the Administration. I commend the House of Representatives for its confirmation vote today, and the Senate for its vote earlier. Members of the 93d Congress have rendered a service to the nation by filling the constitutional office of the Vice President before adjournment. All Americans will benefit from the distinguished and devoted public service of the new Vice President.” Oath and Speech At just past 10:11 P.M., Mr. Rockefeller raised his right hand to take the oath: “I, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States ....” When the applause had subsided, Mr. Rockefeller read a short spech to the crowded chamber illuminated by five banks of television lights. “I feel,” he said, “a great sense of gratitude for the privilege of serving the country love.” He went on to thank all those involved in his nomination—the President, Congress, Betty Ford for “her great warmth and her courage.” “And if you'll forgive me for a personal note, my love and admiration to my own gallant wife, Happy,” he said. Margaretta Rockefeller, who was sitting in a front‐row gallery seat with their two sons, Nelson Jr., 10 years old, and Mark 7, was seen to wipe away what might have been tears under her eyes. Mr. Rockefeller also thanked the news media for their vigilant coverage, the citizens who he said had participated through elected representatives, and the Chief Justice for administering the oath of office. The new Vice President ended his remarks on a typically optimistic note, mentioning the “tremendous difficulties and unprecedented problems, both at home and abroad,” but adding that “there is nothing wrong with America that Americans cannot right.” This brought a spate of applause. Then, after mutual congratulations and welcomes from the acting majority leader, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and the minority leader, Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, Mr. Rockefeller assumed the seat of his only constitutional role, the Senate's presiding officer. Then, in a brief laughing byplay with Senator Byrd, he announced “The Senate will come to order please” and recognized the Senator from West Virginia. Mr. Byrd, also smiling broadly, said, “Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.” Mr. Rockefeller made the correct, ritual reply, “The Clerk will call the roll.” After laughter and more applause he left the chamber at 10:25 for a party amid handshakes and congratulations. 66 Speakers The House vote, which was completed at 8:05 P.M., followed almost exactly six hours of debate in which 66 members of the House argued for and against his confirmation. The votes against Mr. Rockefeller seemed to come from a coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. This meant that conservatives such as Republican Representatives John H. Rousselot of California, Philip M. Crane of Illinois and John M. Ashbrook of Ohio joined with liberals such as Democratic Representatives Thomas M. Rees of California, Bella S. Abzug of Manhattan and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan in voting no. For the conservatives, the issue was, in general, what they perceived as Mr. Rockefeller's liberal ideology and “big‐spender” reputation. For the Democrats, it was not so much ideology as the specifics of his tremendous wealth and his use of it. His net worth has been estimated at $107.6‐million, including the averaged‐out income from trusts. Party Voting The vote of 287 to 128 broke down along party lines in this way: Of the Democrats, 134 voted yes and 99 voted no; 13 were registered as not voting and one voted simply “present.” Of the Republicans, 153 voted to confirm and 29 voted against, while 5 were listed as not voting. In the 39‐member New York delegation all 17 Republicans voted to confirm. Ten of the 22 Democrats voted against confirmation, nine voted for and three were listed as not voting. President Ford, the only previous Vice President to have attained the office through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, was confirmed by the House on Dec. 6, 1973, by a vote of 387 to 35. He became President Aug. 9, 1974, and nominated the 66‐year‐old multimillionaire as Vice President on Aug. 20. The 25th Amendment provides for the selection of a Vice President without a vote of the electorate but through the Congressional process. Thus, Mr. Rockefeller becomes the second Vice President to be chosen without a public vote. Mr. Ford was the first. The general debate on Mr. Rockefeller's confirmation began at 2 P.M. in a sparsely filled House. chamber, and continued on through the afternoon with fluctuating attendance. Perhaps because its outcome was considered certain, many members strolled in the aisles, chatted and laughed as speakers presented their pleas to vote one way or the other. Representative William H. Natcher, Democrat of Kentucky, who was presiding, continually used his gavel to urge them to “come to order,” occasionally interrupting a speaker to call for quiet. The six hours allotted for debate by the Rules Committee was divided into three equal two‐hour segments. One segment was under the control of the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., which meant that he decided who might speak, and for how long. The two other segments were controlled by Representatives Edward Hutchinson of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Robert W. Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, the ranking or senior member of the group of 12 Democrats on the committee who voted against Mr. Rockefeller's confirmation. Approval of the Rockefeller nomination was recommended by the committee last Thursday by a vote of 26 to 12, with all the committee's 17 Republicans and 9 of its 21 Democrats voting in favor. Mr. Ford, last year, won a 30‐to‐8 vote from the same committee in favor of his Vice‐Presidential nomination. Mr. Rodino, a New Jersey Democrat who voted for the Ford nomination in committee but reversed himself in the House, was the first speaker, announcing that this time he planned to support the Republican Vice‐Presidential nominee. He outlined the committee's “scrupulously careful, intensive and complete investigation” of Mr. Rockefeller, which included nine days of public hearings. He mentioned some of the areas of principal concern to the committee—the family's wealth, Mr. Rockefeller's gifts and interestfree loans to state officials and associates, and the Rockefeller financing of an unflattering biography of a political opponent. He went on to say that “You've got to take what I consider to be the totality” of the nominee—his talents and his “giving of himself and his time” to public service. “Then I must say,” he concluded, “that despite the fact that I had to search my conscience, I want to say to you that as chairman of the committee, I am going to support the nomination of Mr. Rockefeller.” The important issue, he added, is “whether or not Mr. Rockefeller is fit and qualified under the 25th Amendment” to be Vice President. This was a view that the opposition forces, led by Mr. Kastenmeier and the other committee dissenters, did not support. There was general agreement that Mr. Rockefeller was, in terms of ability and background, qualified. Mr. Kastenmeier, in his statement, set forth the basic argument that underlay most of the other opposing statements. “With this nomination,” he said, “we face the possibility of merging this tremendous economic power with the greatest political power held in this country. The scope of this private authority raises the serious question of whether or not Mr. Rockefeller, as President, would be able to distinguish between the private interest and the public good.” Representative John J. Rhodes, Republican of Arizona who is the House minority leader, summed up the position of those in favor of confirmation in a statement that was read for him because he had just undergone minor throat surgery. Mr. Rockefeller, his statement said, “has been probed, provoked, tried, tested and observed from virtually every conceivable angle and perspective.” Despite this “meticulous scrutiny,” it said, “not a single shred of evidence was produced to even remotely suggest that Nelson Rockefeller profited financially from his service in government.” And he mentioned the nominee's “immense” experience in government and the need of “troubled” nation for help with the “many domestic problems that simply must be met with affirmative action by the Federal Government.” With a few exceptions, variations on these themes were sounded by the speakers who followed. Representative Wright Patman of Texas, a Democrat who is dean of the House, said he would oppose the confirmation because Mr. Rockefeller represented “the most colossal conflict of interest that could ever be imagined.” One speech that aroused other members to laughter was given by Representative Otis G. Pike of Suffolk County, who noted the debate “on this allegedly vital issue in this halfempty House before these halfempty galleries.” This led him to believe, he said, that “the stockings are already hung by the chimney with care and the champagne is cooling.” Mr. Pike, a Democrat, said he felt that the members must represent the people of their districts and “vote the way those people would have us vote,” which was why, he said, “although Santa Claus is coming to town, I decline to be one of his helpers.” Other New Yorkers who spoke in opposition included Representatives Samuel S. Stratton and Herman Badillo, both Democrats. Mr. Stratton of upstate New York said that Mr. Rockefeller “is not the kind of guy who is going to accept a subordinate role to anybody” and “in a very short order he's going to be taking over from President Ford.” Mr. Badillo of the Bronx said that Mr. Rockefeller, during his 15 years as Governor, “clearly used the massive economic power at his command in the carrying out of the office of Governor.” He also said that he felt the interest‐free loans Mr. Rockefeller made were a way of binding state officials to him, since the knowledge that leaving would mean repaying a debt “would deter even the most outspoken public official.” Another New Yorker who spoke, this time urging confirmation, was Representative Shirley Chisholm, a Brooklyn Democrat. She has been waging an active campaign in recent days to counteract the efforts of a group of liberal Democrats, spearheaded by the Judiciary Committee group of 12 dissenters, to delay the nominaltion for further investigation and until the next Congress convenes. Mrs. Chisholm, who hoped to gain a majority of the Black Caucus's 15 votes for confirmation, outlined the Rockefeller family's contributions to black institutions and to labor, social welfare programs, environmental planning, and an “equitable and intelligent abortion law.” She said: “I only call on my colleagues to look at the record. Look at the total record and judge this man on the basis of act, not allegation or emotion.” Several members referred to the fact that this confirmation would mark the second use in little more than a year of the 25th amendment, permitting a President to fill a Vice‐Presidential vacancy with the consent of Congress. There is a widespread feeling in Congress that the amendment is faulty and that changes must be made during the next session of Congress. The four months of investigation into the nominee included 17 days of public hearings by both committees, with testimony from witnesses ranging from former Attica prison inmates to J. Richardson Dilworth, the family's Chief investment adviser, and Laurance S. Rockefeller, the nominee's brother. In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had some 300 agents assigned to look into Mr. Rockefeller's past, and the committees had his Federal income tax and gift tax returns for the last seven years. He also made available, alter reports in the press, lists of his gifts and loans to former state officials and aides totaling nearly $2‐million, and of his political contributions and his charitable donations. The analysis of the Rockefeller family's finances by Mr. Dilworth showed its 84 members to be worth about $1.3‐billion. Transcript of Senate Inaugural Ceremony Following is a transcript of the ceremony at which Nelson A. Rockefeller was inaugurated as Vice President last night, as recorded by The New York Times: Mr. Rockefeller Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, President pro tern Eastland, Chief Justice, your excellencies, the members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests and fellow Americans. As I stand before you, I feel a great sense of humility. I feel a great sense of gratitude for the privilege of serving the country I love. I feel a deep sense of gratitude to President Ford, to the Congress of the United States and to the people of America. To the President for his trust and confidence and the opportunity he has given me to serve this great nation in working with him, a man for whom I have profound respect, admiration and warmth of affection. A man of integrity, sincerity, openness, dedication. A man bearing the lonely burdens of the Presidency with deep human understanding and total devotion to his country. And my admiration to the First Lady, Betty Ford, and her great warmth and her courage. And if you'll forgive me for a personal noté, my love and admiration to my own gallant wife, Happy. I feel deeply grateful to the committees and the members of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives for their confirmation of my nomination. Among the many reasons I look forward with pride and keen anticipation to serving the Senate as their presiding officer is the fact that my mother's father, my grandfather, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, represented the great state of Rhode Island in this very chamber for 31 years after serving for three years in the House of Representatives. The thoroughness with which the Congress exercised its responsibility on behalf of the American people under the 25th Amendment has been another dramatice evidence of the enduring strength and vitality of our Constitution and our unique American system. Educational Experience I've learned a great deal from this experience of the past four months. And I've come out of it with an even greater respect for the Congress of the United States, a more profound appreciation of the collective wisdom of the American people as expressed through the Congress, and a deeper understanding of the breadth of the responsibility to the people of this great free land that falls upon those of us in positions of public trust. I deeply appreciate the outstanding work of all those in government agencies involved in the investigation and preparation of material for the Congressional committee. I admire and respect the vigilant coverage of the free American press, radio and television, through which the people of America were so well‐informed. I would like to thank all of those citizens who participated directly in the process by expressing themselves to their representatives in the Senate and in the House, and to those who sent words of encouragement to Happy and to me. And finally, especially to you, Mr. Chief Justice, my thanks for your administration of the oath and symbolizing as you do the rule of law by which this great Republic functions. In this—or—this is a period in which our country faces tremendous difficulties and unprecedented problems, both at home and abroad. Problems that affect every section of our country and every family in America. But there is nothing wrong with America that Americans can not right. I pledge myself to the fullest limit of my capacity to work with you, Mr. President, and the Congress in the great task of building the strength of America to meet the grave new problems which we confront as a nation and as a people. I thank you. Senator Robert C. Byrd Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President of the Senate, pro tempore, at this historic moment in the existence of this distinguished body, I offer congratulations to the Vice President of the United States. And on behalf of our majority leader and my other colleagues in the Senate of the United States, I welcome the Vice President as the presiding officer of this body. There was a time in the history of this Republic when the Vice President's role as president of the Senate was perhaps the highest responsibility of the office, but that is no longer true. In today's world, the office of Vice President of the United States has assumed an importance and a significance with which it was not formerly associated. As the stature of the VicePresidency has increased, so have the responsibilities. Therefore, Mr. Vice President, we wish you well as you prepare to take your place in the Administration and the conduct of the nation's affairs, and I repeat the welcome, of this body to you as president of the Senate of the United States. SENATOR JAMES O. EASTLAND: The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized Senator Hugh Scott Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President pro tem, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker and members, I have a great privilege at this point and I would like to say first that I con gratulate the Vice President upon his opportunity to serve and to serve with the President and the Congress of the United States. Such a privilege is rare and is one to be earned, and I am certain that we are all going to benefit and to rejoice in this new move and advance along our constitutional path. The 25th Amendment has worked, and we are all very proud to have had a part in it. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished acting majority leader, I submit a resolution and I will read it and ask for its immediate consideration. DARRELL ST. CLAIRE, assistant secetary of the Senate: Whereas the nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President of the United States was submitted to the Congress for confirmation on Aug. 20, 1974, and whereas Nelson A. Rockefeller has today taken the oath of office as the 41st Vice President of the United States, now therefore be it resolved that the Senate congratulates the Vice President on assuming his new duties and wishes him well during his term of office. Resolved that an engrossed copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the Vice President. SENATOR SCOTT: I renew my request for the immediate consideration of the resolution. SENATOR EASTLAND: Without objection, the resolution is adopted (laughter). MR. ROCKEFELLER (taking the chair): The Senate will come to order, please (laughter). The Senator from West Virginia (recognizing Senator Byrd). I know him very well, too (laughter). SENATOR BYRD: Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum (laughter). MR. ROCKEFELLER: The clerk will call the roll (laughter).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Ford, last year, won a 30‐to‐8 vote from the same committee in favor dills Vice‐Presidential nomination. Mr. Rodino, a New Jersey Democrat who voted for the Ford nomination in committee but reversed himself in the House, was the first speaker, announcing that this time he planned to support the Republican Vice‐Presidential nominee. He outlined the committee's “scrupulously careful, intensive and complete investigation” of Mr. Rockefeller, which included nine days of public hearings. He mentioned some of the areas of principal concern to the committee—the family's wealth, Mr. Rockefeller's gifts and interestfree loans to state officials and associates, and the Rockefeller financing of an unflattering biography of a political opponent. He went on to say that “You've got to take what I consider to be the totality” of the nominee—his talents and his “giving of himself and his time” to public service. “Then I must say,” he concluded, “that despite the fact that I had to search my conscience, I want to say to you that as chairman of the committee, I am going to support the nomination of Mr. Rockefeller.” The important issue, he added, is “whether or not Mr. Rockefeller is fit and qualified under the 25th Amendment” to be Vice President. This was a view that the opposition forces, led by Mr. Kastenmeier and the other committee dissenters, did not support. There was general agreement that Mr. Rockefeller was, in terms of ability and background, qualified. Mr. Kastenmeier, in his statement, set forth the basic argument that underlay most of the other opposing statements. “With this nomination,” he said, “we face the possibility of merging this tremendous economic power with the greatest political power held in this country. The scope of this private authority raises the serious question of whether or not Mr. Rockefeller, as President, would be able to distinguish between the private interest and the public good.” Representative John J. Rhodes, Republican of Arizona who is the House minority leader, summed up the position of those in favor of confirmation in a statement that was read for him because he had just undergone minor throat surgery. Mr. Rockefeller, his statement said, “has been probed, provoked, tried, tested and observed from virtually every conceivable angle and perspective.” Despite this “meticulous scrutiny,” it said, “not a single shred of evidence was produced to even remotely suggest that Nelson Rockefeller profited financially from his service in government.” And he mentioned the nominee's “immense”: experience in government and the need of a “troubled” nation for help with the “many domestic problems that simply must be met with affirmative action by the Federal Government.” With a few exceptions, variations on these themes were sounded by the speakers who followed. Representative Wright Patman of Texas, a Democrat who is dean of the House, said he would oppose the confirmation because Mr. Rockefeller represented “the most colossal conflict of interest that could ever be imagined.” One speech that aroused other members to laughter was given by Representative Otis G. Pike of Suffolk County, who noted the debate “on this allegedly vital issue in this halfempty House before these halfempty galleries.” This led him to believe, he said, that “the stockings are already hung by the chimney with care and the champagne is cooling.” Mr. Pike, a Democrat, said he felt that the members must represent the people of their districts and “vote the way those people would have us vote,” which was why, he said, “although Santa Claus is coming to town, I decline to be one of his helpers.” Other New Yorkers who spoke in opposition included Representatives Samuel S. Stratton and Herman Badillo, both Democrats. Mr. Stratton of upstate New York said that Mr. Rockefeller “is not the kind of guy who is going to accept a subordinate role to anybody” and “in a very short order he's going to be taking over from President Ford. Mr. Badillo of the Bronx said that Mr. Rockefeller, during his 15 years as Governor, “clearly used the massive economic power at his command in the carrying out of the office of Governor.” He also said that he felt the interest‐free loans Mr. Rockefeller made were a way of binding state officials to him, since the knowledge that leaving would mean repaying a debt “would deter even the, most outspoken public official.” Another New Yorker who spoke, this time urging confirmation, was Representative Shirley Chisholm, a Brooklyn Democrat. She has been waging an active campaign in recent days to counteract the efforts of a group of liberal Democrats, spearheaded by the Judiciary Committee group of 12 dissenters, to delay the nomination for further investigation and until the next Congress convenes. Mrs. Chisholm, who hoped to gain a majority of the Black Caucus's 15 votes for confirmation, outlined the Rockefeller family's contributions to black institutions and to labor, social welfare programs, environmental planning, and an “equitable and intelligent abortion law.” She said: “I only call on my colleagues to look at the record. Look at the total record and judge this man on the basis of act, not allegation or emotion.” Several members referred to the fact that this confirmation would mark the second use in little more than a year of the 25th amendment, permitting a President to fill a Vice‐Presidential vacancy with the consent of Congress. There is a widespread feeling in Congress that the amendment is faulty and that changes must be made during the next session of Congress. The four months of investigation into the nominee included 17 days of public hearings by both committees, with testimol1ny from witnesses, ranging from former Attica prison inmates to J. Richardson Dilworth, the family's Chief investment adviser, and Laurance S. Rockefeller, the nominee's brother. In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had some 300 agents assigned to look into Mr. Rockefeller's past, and the committees had his Federal income tax and gift tax returns for the last seven years. He also made available, alter reports in the press, lists of his gifts and loans to former state officials and aides totaling nearly $2‐million, and of his political contributions and his charitable donations, The analysis of the Rockefeller family's finances by Mr. Dilworth showed its 84 members to be worth about $1.3‐billion. Transcript of Senate Inaugural Ceremony Following is a transcript of the ceremony at which Nelson A. Rockefeller was inaugurated as Vice President last night, as recorded by The New York Times: Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, President pro tern Eastland, Chief Justice, your excellencies, the members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests and fellow Americans. As I stand before you, I feel a great sense of humility. I feel a great sense of gratitude for the privilege of serving the country I love. I feel a deep sense of gratitude to President Ford, to the Congress of the United States and to the people of America. To the President for his trust and confidence and the opportunity he has given me to serve this great nation in working with him, a man for whom I have profound respect, admiration and warmth of affection. A man of integrity, sincerity, openness, dedication. A man bearing the lonely burdens of the Presidency with deep human understanding and total devotion to his country. And my admiration to the First Lady, Betty Ford, and her great warmth and her courage. And if you'll forgive me for a personal note, my love and admiration to my own gallant wife, Happy. I feel deeply grateful to the committees and the members of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives for their confirmation of my nomination. Among the many reasons I look forward with pride and keen anticipation to serving the Senate as their presiding officer is the fact that my mother's father, my grandfather, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, represented the great state of Rhode Island in this very chamber for 31 years after serving for three years in the House of Representatives. The thoroughness with which the Congress exercised its responsibility on behalf of the American people under the 25th Amendment has been another dramatice evidence of the enduring strength and vitality of our Constitution and our unique American system. I've learned a great deal from this experience of the past four months. And I've come out of it with an even greater respect for the Congress of the United States, a more profound appreciation of the collective wisdom of the American people as expressed through the Congress, and a deeper understanding of the breadth of the responsibility to the people of this great free land that falls upon those of us in positions of public trust. I deeply appreciate the outstanding work of all those in government agencies involved in the investigation and preparation of material for the Congressional committee. I admire and respect the vigilant coverage of the free American press, radio and television, through which the people of America were so well‐informed. I would like to thank alt of those citizens who participated directly in the process by expressing themselves to their representatives in the Senate and in the House, and to those who sent words of encouragement to Happy and to me. And finally, especially to you, Mr. Chief Justice, my thanks for your administration of the oath and symbolizing as you do the rule of law by which this great Republic functions. In this—or—this is a period in which our country faces tremendous difficulties and unprecedented problems, both at home and abroad. Problems that affect every section of our country and every family in America. But there is nothing wrong with America that Americans can not right. I pledge myself to the fullest limit of my capacity to work with you, Mr. President, and the Congress in the great task of building the strength of America to meet the grave new problems which we confront as a nation and as a people. I thank you. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President of the Senate, pro ternpore, at this historic moment In the existence of this distinguished body, I offer congratulations to the Vice President of the United States. And on behalf of our majority leader and my other colleagues in the Senate of the United States, I welcome the Vice President as the presiding officer of this body. There was a time in the history of this Republic when the Vice President's role as president of the Senate was perhaps the highest responsibility of the office, but that is no longer true. In today's world, the office of Vice President of the United States has assumed an importance and a significance with which it was not formerly associated. As the stature of the VicePresidency has increased, so have the responsibilities. Therefore, Mr. Vice President, we wish you well as you prepare to take your place in the Administration and the conduct of the nation's affairs, and I repeat the welcome of this body to you as president of the Senate of the United States. SENATOR JAMES O. EASTLAND: The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President pro tem, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker and members, I have a great privilege at this point and I would like to say first that I con gratulate the Vice President upon his opportunity to serve and to serve with the President and the Congress of the United States. Such a privilege is rare and is one to be earned, and I am certain that we are all going to benefit and to rejoice in this new move and advance along our constitutional path. The 25th Amendment has worked, and we are all very proud to have had a part in it. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished acting majority leader, I submit a resolution and I will read it and ask for its immediate consideration. DARRELL ST. CLAIRE, assistant secetary of the Senate: Whereas the nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President of the United States was submitted to the Congress for confirmation on Aug. 20, 1974, and whereas Nelson A. Rockefeller has today taken the oath of office as the 41st Vice President of the United States, now therefore be it resolved that the Senate congratulates the Vice President on assuming his new duties and wishes him well during his term of office. Resolved that an engrossed copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the Vice President. SENATOR SCOTT: I renew my request for the immediate consideration of the resolution. SENATOR EASTLAND: Without objection, the resolution is adopted (laughter). MR. ROCKEFELLER (taking the chair): The Senate will come to order, please (laughter). The Senator from West Virginia (recognizing Senator Byrd). I know him very well, too (laughter). SENATOR BYRD: Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum (laughter). MR. ROCKEFELLER: The clerk will call the roll (laughter).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moratorium Is Ended by F.D.A. On IUD Challenged Over Safety,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/21/archives/moratorium-is-ended-by-fda-on-iud-challenged-over-safety.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 20—The Food and Drug Administration ended today a six‐month moratorium on prescription by physicians of a widely used contraceptive device called the Dalkon Shield. An expert advisory committee to the agency had recommended that the ban on the intrauterine device be continued until serious safety questions were settled. The experts said that the moratorium should remain in effect pending accumulation of definitive data. At a news conference today, Dr. Alexander M. Schmidt, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said that the agency's action did not constitute an overruling of the committee's recommendation. He said that use of the devices would be carefully controlled. The F.D.A. has arranged with the manufacturer, the A. H. Robins Company, to keep a registry, of all patients using the devices. Through this registry there will be a continuing check on the safety and efficacy, of the devices in use. Dr. Schmidt said that his arrangement would allow the definitive data the advisory committee called for. He said that he hoped manufacturers of devices that competed with the, Dalkon Shield would also agree to participate in a registry. More than two million Dalkon Shields have been distributed in the United States since 1970. They are among the most widely used intrauterine contraceptive devices — commonly Called IUD's. In recent years, however, a relatively large number of deaths and cases of abortion linked to IUD use have been reported to involve the Dalkon Shield. At the news conference, Dr. Schmidt said that IUD's in general compared favorably with birth control pills in safety and efficacy. The available data, he said, indicate that the effectiveness of the Dalkon Shield is not significantly different from that of other types of IUD's, but that certain questions of safety cannot be answered without further information. To collect the needed data, he said, the F.D.A. has arranged with A. H. Robins to limit distribution of the IUD's to doctors who agree to register each patient at the time of insertion and to keep detailed records of each patient's experience with he device. A study of IUD effects has also been started jointly by the federal agency and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. After the F.D.A. action was made public today, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced it would continue its ban on the current model of the Dalkon Shield. The ban prohibits use of the device by its own doctors and cliics. Some scientists believe that possible cause of safety problems with the Dalkon Shield is a multifilament tail on the device that has been found to harbor bacteria. The company plans to substitute a monofilament tail to eliminate the risk of infection. A spokesman for Planned Parenthood said that it would reserve judgment on the monofilament model until it could be assessed by the organization's experts. According to F.D.A. figures, more than eight million I.U.D.'s of all kinds have been distributed in the United States since 1965, and four million may be in use today. The exact number is not known. Altogether, the F.D.A. figures show, 39 deaths have been attributed to I.U.D.'s, of which 14 have been linked to the Dalkon Shield; 17 to a device called the Lippes Loop, 4 to a product called Saf‐T‐Coil and the rest to other brands. A Problem Cited One problem in interpreting such figures is that no one knows how many women have used each type of IUD. The Lippe sloop, for example, has been in use several years longer than has the Dalkon Shield and may therefore have had greater total use. The total number of recorded septic abortions linked to all IUD's is 287, according to the F.D.A., of which 219 have been associated with the Dalkon Shield. Dr. Schmidt said that the figures did not prove that the Dalkon Shield was less safe than the other products. He said that it should be remembered that only a very small percentge of women using IUD's became pregnant. Those who do, he said, should be watched carefully by their doctors and should consider the possibility of therapeutic abortion if the device cannot be removed. “I would repeat,” he said in summary, “that on the basis of all the evidence we can get, the IUD is a safe, reliable and perfectly acceptable alternative to the oral contraceptive and other forms of contraception.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here is a woman with a lot of trouble,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/the-shadow-knows-by-diane-johnson-277-pp-new-york-alfred-a-knopf.html,"Madness, despair, desertion. The ladies are ever busy telling us “where it's at.” Boring marriages, irrelevant children, casual divorces, cold‐turkey abortions, ineffectual lovers, these women seem to have feverish lives. And of course in their spare time there's the degree to be gotten. The magical degree that will free them from all this trivia and make it possible for them to escape their male captors forever. Diane Johnson—author of three previous novels and a well‐received biography (“Lesser Lives”) — introduces even more exciting elements. Rape, murder, tire‐slashing and a strangled pet. N. is a terrified, powerless young divorcée, mother of four. Not only is she frightened and suspicious, she is paralyzed by her own gripping guilt. “I am a divorced woman,” she confesses, indicating that this in itself makes her a likely candidate for murder. In buying new tires for her car she is “determined to amend my former careless ways by choosing responsible tires now.” Her luxurious delight in pain emerges while she is carrying her heavy child (unnecessarily, the child can walk) as it begins to snow. “I mention all this because it seemed fitting somehow, to trail along in the thick wet falling snow carrying a heavy burden in darkness.” O God, bleak. This is very bleak. In addition, she seems to have extraordinarily unfortunate associates. Her lover has gone back to his wife (on Christmas day at that), her ex‐husband has become a psychotic, her best friend carries a long knife and hates her, and her one‐time maid, huge black Osella, makes threatening phone calls in the night. N.'s present companion and baby‐sitter, Ev, is attacked in the laundry room and dies during the night. N. is the only one who knows Ev was really murdered. She suspects Ev's drunken boyfriend, but it could be the ex‐husband, Have I mentioned that N. lives in a slum housing project? Or that she must study for her master's degree in mathematics in the midst of this chaos? Now clearly, here is a woman with a lot of trouble. But no more than she expects, ap parently, for “If you are going to have lovers and a life of freedom and intellect, you have to expect unwed pregnancies and divorces and malice and mistakes.” But just a minute. Is that really what a life of intellect implies? It's hardly a foregone conclusion that freedom is a mistake, nor does having a lover inevitably result in pregnancy. Malice is something else; I'm a little nervous about that one myself. Yet all this reductive reasoning is difficult to go along with. We are never told what's responsible for N.'s incredible passivity, why she is so devoid of energy, always acted upon, a constant victim. The only explanation seems to be her overweening guilt, so enormous within her that she must be punished over and over and reminded in brutish ways of her own worthlessness. But the reasons for this masochistic personality are never brought out. We are not told, for instance, why she was incapable of taking care of her children during her marriage. Her husband points out that she couldn't even keep house, let alone take care of the children, She doesn't work (the math holds no real interest; it's only an escape) and she has no particular burning, thwarted ambition. So what is all this? Is she a psychotic, a paranoiac? Or just cranky and recalcitrant? In this age of analysis, we have all become psychologists. We are able to assess the aberrant behavior of our friends (as they are assessing ours), give it its professional label and thereafter deal with Fred the Schizo or Alice the Sado‐Masochist, sagely and expertly recognizing the manifestations of their particular form of neurosis. Boring and tiring as this may be, it's necessary and expected. But if the reader, too, must now become an analyst, the author must not withhold information—it's not fair. In order to decide who is the lunatic, the murderer, the rapist, we must have some background, some histories, anecdotes, something to work with. And Diane Johnson doesn't give it to us. Her book conceals more than it reveals—I suspect because she doesn't know the necessary answers herself. It's too bad, too, because she writes well. She has created a wonderful character in the mad Osella, who appears in the end as a performer in a surreal nightclub act, oiled, nude, immense, “superfemale” and “breathing up all the air in the room.” She is able to make us believe in Ev, the baby‐sitter, and she seems particularly adept in picking up the black dialogue of these women. She is obviously a careful listener: the conversations flow easily, without strain—we feel we're simply eavesdropping. She handles her difficult material smoothly too; that is, events and transitions are never jarring or unnatural, which is usually the case when violence is introduced. We are ready for Ev's murder and for the hissing hatred of her friend Bess, who keeps N. awake all night, cursing obscenities at her through the wall. The attacker or murderer is never discovered, but it seems obvious that N. is her own destroyer. Her acceptance, even desire for abuse, is thoroughly rewarded. In the end she is raped by the unknown assailant. But amazingly, that seems to be all right with her. It wasn't too bad. In fact, “I felt happy. Anything bad can happen to the unwary, and when life sends you the coup de gráce you have way of knowing ... I feel better.” That may be impressive, but it's difficult to like or admire this woman. I think her lover saw his chance and took it. All of this grimy wallowing is not nice; it's tiresome and inevitably, as with some unexplained weakness of character that can't be changed, we grow impatient and simply don't want to deal with it anymore. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maverick Radio Station Makes Waves — and Money,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/maverick-radio-station-makes-waves-and-money.html,"PITTSFIELD, MASS. Can a young radio station in a small, conservative city make money advocating the legalization of marijuana? Will merchants advertise on a station that repeatedly pokes fun at free enterprise and big business? Is there a broadcast audience for hard rock and other “progressive” music in a community where the city fathers discourage live music in its bars and taverns? The answer to these and similarly loaded questions is in the affirmative. Three years ago in this city of 55,000, dominated by General Electric (the local plant employs more than half of the city's working population) and a mill that manufactures the country's currency paper, a man named Jerry Graham obtained the license for a 1,000 watt, daylighthours‐only AM station with the call letters WGRG. He recruited a youthful and youthoriented staff to run it and began transmitting very hip music, community ‐ service programs and leftward slanted newscasts and editorials. To many listeners, Graham must have seemed deliberately intent upon offending their Yankee sensibilities. As disc jockeys, he hired the 27‐year‐old black operator of a bicycle repair shop; a 25‐year‐old woman who is an avid proponent of women's liberation; a young man fresh out of high school, who wears his hair down to his waist; and a 20‐year‐old vegetarian whose favorite on‐air gag is to give his listeners the wrong time of day. As newscasters, Graham brought in a 44‐year‐old white alumna of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; a Presbyterian minister in his early 30's who writes radical religious newspaper columns; and a thickly bearded “music critic,” whose credentials rest heavily on his hanging around a local bar frequented by a motorcycle gang. After deciding that the versions of the news provided by the more popular wire services were too limited, Graham supplemented United Press International with the Zodiac service, which specializes in left‐wing exposés. He also hired an astrologer to do an on‐air forecast three times daily, Among Graham's other innovations have been “bulletin boards” (aired twice daily) through which anyone can buy, sell or trade wares or services, and offers of free time for position speeches by legitimate candidates from any political party. Graham banned paid political advertising on WGRG in the belief that it keeps ill‐financed people out of office. Local religious leaders are invited to participate in taped debates on such controversial issues as state support of parochial schools, birth control and sex education, which WGRG then broadcasts on. Sunday mornings. Other community leaders, such as daycare center directors, representatives from Vista prograins, prison officials and recycling‐depot organizers, are encouraged to tape comments, statements and opinions relevant to their particular fields of endeavor; these five‐ to ten‐minute spots are then broadcast several times throughout a given week in lieu of editorials by Graham. So‐called top‐40 tunes are taboo at WGRG and so is Muzak‐style “easy listening.” But just about everything else from Beethoven to Bessie Smith to Tommy Dorsey to Scott Joplin to Joy of Cooking and the Grateful Dead is aired. The station doesn't have a music director to screen out “risky stuff.” The disc ‐ jjockeys simply play whatever in their opinion is good; Graham encourages experimentation. “We play a lot of music that makes me sick,” Graham admits, “but I figure that for every piece I can't stand there's somebody out there saying, ‘Hey, that's great.’ In the long run, people listen because they know we won't bore them. Sooner or later they're going to hear something they really like,” But the most provocative aspects of WGRG's programing have been Graham's editorials and the newscasts, particularly an “expanded news and commentary” that airs everyday at noon for 20 minutes to a half hour. The content and presentation are openly slanted to the left. For instance, when reporting on oil company profits, WGRG announcers sound as though they were paying the dividends out of their own pockets. And their voices become decidedly arch when relating conservative court judgments on pornography, abortion or drug laws. Frequently, the announcers will break away from the prepared scripts to interject their own comments, usually snide or derisive, into the newscast. In fostering the slanted news concept, Graham offered a justification for it in an on‐air editorial, which argued in part: “At WGRG we start from a belief that there are very few facts. Facts are what science can prove. Add people to facts or events, and the truth becomes a question of who and what to believe. ...In order for you to decide where to find your own truth, it's important to know where your information is coming from. That's why we go out of our way to expose our biases.” Graham's novel approach to programing made for a financially shaky first two years of operation. Numerous merchants told Graham they would never advertise on his station; when pressed for a reason, it was invariably political. (Pittsfield's largest department store has consistently refused to advertise on WGRG on the grounds that the station's editorial policies are “un‐American.”) Graham, however, was confident that he had a audience; he just needed to be able to prove it to potential advertisers. So, in the summer of 1973, he enlisted the services of Pulse, Inc., a New York‐based survey organization. Pulse established that after only two years WGRG had actually captured 70 per cent of the area's 12‐ to 24‐year‐old audience, 70 per cent of the 18‐ to 24‐year‐olds, 33 per cent of the 18‐ to 34‐year‐olds, and 20 per cent of the 35 to 49 group. The figures confirmed Graham's belief that WGRG was drawing audiences as big or bigger than either of Pittsfield's two other stations. Before long, most of the area's youth‐oriented businesses — record shops, clothing stores, nightclubs and restaurants—were buying advertising time on WGRG. Then came the real coup: this past spring Graham's editorials won first place in national competition for the professional journalists' Sigma Delta Chi award. On top of that, UPI named WGRG winner of its 1973 top award for radio news in New England, based on the station's coverage of a tornado disaster in nearby West Stockbridge. • All this success and recognition was yet another triumph for Graham, a former Midwesterner who by age 32 had already fought his way to the higher echelons of one of New York City's largest stations, the 50,000‐watt WNEW. Jerry Granowski grew up in a tiny Jewish community in Indianapolis, graduated from the University of Indiana, married his high school sweetheart and changed his name from Granowski to Graham. A series of radio jobs took him East, where, in 1961, he landed a job as a newswriter for WNEW. He was promoted to news editor in 1963 and a year later was made news director. In 1965, Graham and WNEW jointly won a Sigma Delta Chi award for coverage of the Harlem riots the year before; they won again in 1966 for their reporting on the major power black‐out the previous summer. As a result, Graham was promoted to the overall program directorship of WNEW, but after his years of fastpaced work in the newsroom, the managerial job seemed boring. So, he and a friend, Bernie Ruttenberg, who was in charge of WNEW's publicity department, left the station and formed an electronic‐media consulting firm. Within a couple of years, the outfit was grossing $200,000 a year. In the meantime, Graham and his wife, Judy, bitten by the country‐living bug, had moved to Stockbridge. With great effort, Graham managed to keep up his end of the consulting firm from the country, but when the firm lost its steadiest client, the decision was made to close up shop. It was then that Graham snatched up the license for WGRG for a mere $35,000. (Ruttenberg returned to WNEW, only to suffer a fatal heart attack the first day back on the job.) Graham's most recent. Sigma Delta Chi award was for his editorials, sonic of which called for the impeachment of Richard Nixon well over a year before the former President resigned. Last April 1, Graham argued for support of President Nixon, only to end by reminding listeners that it was April Fool's Day. He took the 10th anniversary of the assassination of President John Kennedy as an occasion to advocate the legalization of marijuana. At the outset of this year's baseball season, he told baseball‐happy Pittsfield: “Imagine, five months to go and nothing on TV but baseball, which is hardly a game for grown men. Basketball is the noble sport ... Baseball is so dull it's used as a cure for insomnia. ... The best thing for sport would be to abolish baseball and make basketball required for all citizens.” • Graham claims that the key to WGRG's success is: never bore your audience and never insult their intelligence. This philosophy has given rise to the station's free‐wheeling format, with its extended newscasts, galvanizing editonals and, of course, music that appeals to a wide range of tastes. Now 40, Graham says his biggest fear is that his station's problems will all fade away: “Then it won't be fun anymore.” To hedge against this kind of boredom, he is planning an FM station that will be even more musically experimental than WGRG and that will feature many more political and community ‐ oriented programs. “I can't wait to do it all over again,” he says with a grin. And if he succeeds too quickly with that, well, he and his wife have scheduled a roundthe‐world backpacking trip for 1980. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giscard: A Sense of Style,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/giscard-a-sense-of-style-foreign-affairs.html,"PARIS—It should not be surprising to this elegant nation that its new President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, should have brought with him to France's highest office a conscious and Intellectualized sense of style. For Giscard, as he is generally known, style is not only an expression of artistic grace but part of the technique ofgoverning. He does not limit application of this personal philosophy to decisions concerning formal ceremonials: removal of the drums from renditions of the national anthem; changing the route of the Bastille Day parade to the area of the Bastille. He seeks to impose a new concept of personal style on the presidency itself, leaning to informality when possible. He receives visitors he knows in sweater, accompanied by his splendid Weimaraner dog, Jugurtha, and reserves to himself the private life customary to prosperous, cultivated Frenchmen. For the tall, quiet‐spoken and effective chief of state, style is the esthetic of action. It plays a role in various spheres and he feels it can influence the balance, of political forces. When public opinion doesn't perceive the ultimate goal of govern mental policy, it focuses on the style of its presentation. This is a subtle approach to the art of applying power. Thus, the single word “style” embraces the argumentation of issues. For Giscard a new style must be used because ours is a new time. Certainly the President has no criticism for the personal style of his immediate predecessors. He acknowledges de Gaulle's style as superb: that of a great military chief. Pomptdou, on the other hand, was simple in the best sense and gave to his office a maximum possible dignity. Part of the Giscardion approach to this concept of style is an obvious change in methodology. For the first time under the Fifth Republic a President mixes with the people, out of office hours, an approach that would have astounded de Gaulle and which encourages criticism by some contemporary Gaullists. For French chiefs of state. King Henry But, as the President points out, this search for contacts is no new thing IV mixed extensively with his subjects. Napoleon I circulated freely in Paris, talking with everyone who crossed his path. The establishment of direct relations between people and leaders has, indeed, proved useful. Now this must‐be modernized, however. For example, next year Giscard hopes that he and his wife can dine once a month in the home of a family they shave not previously known, thus broadening an Interchange of ideas at all social and intellectual levels. Nevertheless, the President takes pains to stress that this informal approach has nothing to do with a search for political popularity, only with a modernizing of the efficacy of his office. Under the Fifth Republic, he reasons, a sufficiently long term is guaranteed to French leaders at all levels. The next election here is ached, puled to occur in 1978; there is no need to campaign all the time in between. Nor does he think the search for popularity is customarily a feature of the French political scene. He looks back over history and concludes that most famous statesmen, from Richelieu to Clemenceau, rarely if ever went. out of their way to cater to mass option. Despite these personal views on the art of leadership in France, Giscard agrees with both de Gaulle and Pompidou that the world is now so complex that executive power in a democracy, must be strong in the name of efficiency. But he sees the need to pre serve a valid legislative authority and feels that, in this respect, he differs from the General, who didn't bother too much with distinctions between the governmental branches. The legislature In a democracy, he reasons, has enormous power to change society—as with the law permilting abortion in Catholic France, just pissed by the National Assembly. And the Legislature, Giscard believes, can help him in his project to make this country more flexible, to bee the problems of the present and the immediate future. The President, who is about to celebrate his first Christmas in office, considers himself a man of the center and wholly without preconceived prejudice. Looking in his own psychological mirror, he might say: “Here is a man of the center‐left on economic and social questions and a man, of the center‐right on questions involving national tradition.” Yet, apart from the style in which he gaits these leanings, he avoids methodological deftnation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FILM VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/the-godfather-part-ii-one-godfather-too-many-film-view.html,"If Francis Ford Coppola were a less Intelligent and less talented filmmaker, one might indulge the failed aspirations of “The Godfather, Part II”—if not the thick fog of boredom that settles in before the film is even one hour old. Clumsy directors may not be entitled but because their gaffs are not exactly unexpected, they are more easily accommodated. We snicker and laugh at multi‐million‐dollar dreadfuls like “The Valachi Papers” and “Crazy Joe.” Our good spirits remain intact since there's no particular surprise or sorrow. The earnest confusions of “The Godfather, Part II” are something else again. They look like the solemn attempts to rip‐off one of the best, most successful commercial American movies ever made, Coppola's original screen adaptation of Mario Paso's “The Godfather.” Rip‐off is an unkind word and, In this case, not really accurate since it implies a willingness to take the easy way, to exploit in the most obvious, cheapest manner an earlier success. Now I hardly think that Coppola, Puzo (who collaborated with him on the new screenplay) and Paramount Pictures did not hope to make a bundle on “Part II,” but it's apparent in the physical scope (New York, Las Vegas, Sicily, the Caribbean), expense and shape of the new film that this was meant to be something more than a sequel, something more than a revisit to a planet of murderous, vengeful apes. Well it is and it isn't. It's actually two films cross‐cut into each other. The first is the story of young Vito Corleone (who grew up to be the Mafia don played by Marlon Brando in “The Godfather”), from his early days in Sicily when his father was murdered by the Black Hand to his first rather nobly motivated criminal triumphs in New York's Little Italy in 1917. The second is the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who inherited the Corleone Family control from old Vito at the end of “The Godfather” and here goes on to win a Las Vegas gambling empire, with time out for an aborted attempt to take over the rackets in Cuba just before the Castro revolution. “Part II” is as stuffed with material as a Christmas goose. It's a mass (sometimes mess) of plots, subplots, characters, alliances, betrayals, ambushes, renunciations, kisses of death, you name it. Much of the time it's next to impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom, not, I suspect, because its mode is ambiguity, but because it's been cut and edited in what looks to have been desperation, a quality that “Part II” shares with another Coppola film, “The Conversation.” There are dozens of narratives going on more or less simultaneously in “Part II,” a couple of which give every sign of being material enough for an interesting, self‐sustaining individual film if lifted out of this fractured epic. One has to do with the first forays into crime by young Vito, played with a fascinating, reserved passion by Robert De Niro until the shadow of Brando's earlier performance falls over it and turns it into what amounts to an impersonation. Another promising sequence has to do with Michael's uneasy alliance with a Jewish mob king, Hyman Roth (played by Lee Strasberg, the head of the Actors Studio, in what becomes the dominant performance of the picture), and the efforts of the pair to seize control of Havana with Battista's cooperation. “We're bigger than U.S. Steel,” Hyman says genially to Michael as they sit sunning themselves on the terrace of a Havana (actually Santo Domingo) hotel. The most chilling moment of the film has nothing to do with mob vengeance, with family betrayals or with virtue corrupted. It is a street scene in Havana when Michael watches impassively as Battista's police round up some revolutionaries, one of whom blows himself up with hand grenade. You suddenly realize not only how isolated from the real world Michael has become, but also how isolated are the concerns of the rest of the film. One of the most remarkable qualities of the original “The Godfather” was the manner in which it suggested all sorts of sad truths about American life, business, manners, goals, entirely within a headlong narrative in which character was defined almost entirely in terms of action. The relentless forward motion of the film was as much the content of the film as the gang wars it seemed to be about. The ending was inevitable and tragic. The cross‐cutting in the new film gives it a contemplative air, but the truths it contemplates about fate, family and feuds seem hardly worth all the fuss and time (three hours and 20 minutes). • I've been told that one of Coppola's intentions in “Part II” was to de‐romanticize “The Godfather,” which some critics had accused (wrongly, I think) of glorifying crime. At the end of “The Godfather,” Michael Corleone, the once sensitive Ivy League student who has become the new don, is left lonely in his new authority. At the end of Part II he is still lonely,though we are asked to believe that he is now a more ruthless, more wracked man who suspects enemies everywhere around him and as easily orders the execution of a brother as he cooperated the execution of a brother‐in‐law in the first film. The difference between Michael in the first film and “Part II” is not one of real substance but of degree. Coppola also seems intent on contrasting the comparatively noble criminality of Michael's father Vito, his early days in Little Italy, with Michael's use of power for its Own sake later on. The idea that old‐time criminals were somehow less vicious and venal than today's is, however, as romantic as any notion that turned up in the original film. “Part II” doesn't illuminate or enrich the original film. It simply brackets it with additional information that may not make too much sense unless you've seen the first one. It also seems to have been written by writers wearing wooly mittens—the dialogue is that clumsy. You get the idea when Kay, Michael's middle‐class, WASP wife, admits that what Michael thought was a miscarriage wasn't. “It was an abortion, Michael,” says Kay who, though grieving, has a way with words, “just like our marriage is an abortion.” “The Godfather, Part II,” directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazaie and Lee Strasberg.

The Crisis Of Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/23/archives/the-crisis-of-law-abroad-at-home.html,"BOSTON, Dec. 22—It is high political drama to learn that the Central Intelligence Agency conducted massive domestic spying operations in violation of its charter. But the disclosure, by Seymour Hersh in The New York Times, has even more profound implications for our view of law. Here, on top of Watergate, is one more gross example of official crime—of lawlessness among those sworn to uphold the law. And that lawlessness brings “terrible retribution,” as Justice Brandeis warned nearly fifty years ago: “If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” When President Ford took office, one of his most urgent tasks was to restore public belief in the Government's respect for law. He made matters worse by his pardon of Richard Nixon. Then he unnecessarily degraded international legal standards in condoning surreptitious American aid to the anti‐Allende forces in Chile. All this lends exceptional significance to Mr. Ford's choice of a new Attorney General. It could indeed be the most important appointment he makes as President. A strong and respected figure in that office, after the corruption of the Nixon years, would be the most restoring of symbols. ABROAD AT HOME President Ford has at least tentatively decided to appoint such a figure: Edward H. Levi, president of the University of Chicago and former dean of its law school. In character, in professional reputation, in philosophy, Mr. Levi is extraordinarily qualified to serve this President and restore the general faith in law. But the appointment has run into objections from some Republican Senators, notably John Tower of Texas and Roman Hruska of Nebraska. It has therefore become a vital test of the President's understanding and determination—and a test also of the integrity of this country's intellectual conservatives. Edward Levi would generally be reckoned a conservative in his outlook as educator and lawyer. He is a deliberate man, reflective, with a distrust of instant solutions to hard social problems and a deep dislike for short cuts in the law. “The misuse of law as but another device for leverage,” he told entering law students last October, “is profoundly corrupting.” On an earlier occasion he said with regret that the student protest movement, however sincere its feelings, had accepted “the legitimacy of pressure, leverage and violence.” ■ Mr. Levi has been highly critical of student excesses, such as suppression of speakers with unpopular views. When violence came to the University of Chicago, he said that the day he called police on the campus, he would resign. He meant that calling in the police would signal his own failure—failure to maintain the ideals of university. The remark conveyed something of his values and his view of personal responsibility. In the continuing debate on the role of the Supreme Court he is on the side of caution. He said last year that the Court has a very great responsibility, when it reinterprets the law, “not to destroy the legislative process or the citizen's feeling of participation in the determination of public matters.” He used the context of a subtle lecture on law and morals to criticize the recent decisions on abortion and capital punishment. He is a quiet man with an understated ironic manner. Anyone who asks at the bar or the law schools about Edward Levi will find a remarkable respect for him, whether or not his views are shared. One admirer explained: “He inspires allegiance because he is trustworthy. He inspires respect because he believes so deeply in the primacy of mind, in the virtue of reason.” ■ Senator Tower has attacked Mr. Levi because he joined the National Lawyers Guild in the nineteen‐thirties. He was in the Chicago chapter for few years along with such others as Walter Schaefer, who became a great Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court. Does Senator Tower really care about that dusty history? Or is he worried that Edward Levi would be too independent as Attorney General, too resistant to pressure for political use of the law? The Levi situation is a particular test for conservative commentators and thinkers. They have twitted liberals for opportunism, and fair enough. Now they can show us, by remaining silent or speaking out, whether knownothings like John Tower speak for “conservatism” in this country. All of us, liberal or conservative, have much at stake in President Ford's selection of an Attorney General. Edward Levi is not the only person to restore the tattered fabric of law in this country. But he would be an exceptional choice, for this President and this time, and to back away now would be one more surrender to unreason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pope in Christmas Message Praises Jesus as ‘the Brother of All’,https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/26/archives/pope-in-christmas-message-praises-jesus-as-the-brother-of-all.html,"ROME, Dec. 25—Pope Paul VI in a Christmas message to the world praised Jesus today as “the brother of all, the advocate of the poor, the friend of the lowly, the companion of the suffering, the redeemer of sinners—in a word, our Savior.” The Pontiff said the Romar Catholic Church was imploring Jesus to impart his “life‐giving blessing” to its 1975 Holy Year. Pope Paul spoke, in Italian from the outer balcony of St Peter's Basilica at noon, a little more than 12 hours after he had ceremonially inaugurated the Holy Year. This event is expected to bring to Rome millions of Pilgrims seeking to gain extraordinary divine grace and spiritual benefits. Protesters Appear The first Holy Year visitors from abroad and many ordinary tourists were among a crowd estimated at 30,000 filling St. Peter's Square when the Pope stepped out on the balcony at the end of an hourlong pontifical mass inside the church. The air was mild under an overcast sky. The throng cheered the Pontiff. But his appearance was marred by an incident. Just as he started his address, a small group of young people demonstrating for legalized abortion were manhandled by the police. The demonstrators, not more than 30, had quietly walked along the broad Via Dellaconciliazione toward St. Peter's Square, stopping close to the line on the pavement that marks the boundary between Italian territory and Vatican City. A few young men silently unfurled three white signs demanding, in black lettering, that Italy's rigorous ban on abortion be lifted. Uniformed and plainclothes men of the public security police closed in on the group, seized the signs and detained 12 men and a young woman. Some of the demonstrators lay down on the street. Policemen, including a short, grayhaired man who seemed to be in command, punched and kicked them, undeterred by the presence of hundreds of witnesses. Policemen then carried some of the demonstrators bodily to the St. Peter's Square police station, and escorted other men and the young woman there, continually pummeling them. Bystanders protested when a uniformed policeman pulled the dark hair of the young woman. She was later identified as Mirella Paracchini, an activist in the Italian women's movement. The protest had been organized by the Italian Radical party, a small but respected civil rights movement advocating separation of church and state. It is non‐Marxist. A member of the Radical party's national leadership, Giuseppe Ramadori, was among those detained. The 13 were formally charged with taking part in an unauthorized demonstration, disturbing a religious ceremony, and resisting the police. They were released pending a judicial investigation. Pope Paul was clearly unaware of what was going on at the edge of the square as were many tourists and worshippers listening to him. At the end of his 10‐minute speech, the Pope gave his traditional blessing “urbi et orbi” —“to Rome and to the world.” The address and benediction were relayed over an international television hookup. The 77‐year‐old Pontiff looked wan and fatigue. He had retired at 2 A.M. after the ceremony of the unsealing of the “holy door” of St. Peter's, the official start of the Holy Year, and subsequent midnight mass inside the church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Ford conferring w energy chief,",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/28/archives/president-ford-conferring-w-energy-chief.html,"MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 27 — Judge Martin Ginsberg of Family Court was found guilty today of one count of perjury for having denied before a grand jury that he had received money from two businessmen in exchange for promises to use his influence in their behalf. The 44‐year‐old judge sat impassively in County Court as Judge Con G. Cholakis, who presided at the three‐week nonjury, trial, announced his verdict. Judge Ginsberg was acquitted by Judge Cholakis, who is from Rensselaer County, of a second count of perjury, because Judge Cholakis said, there was “a serious question” of corroboration of the testimony by one of the prosecution witnesses. Earlier in the trial, after the state rested its case, Judge Cholakis dismissed extortion and bribery charges, which had been part of the indictment last April 26 by a Nassau County grand jury. After Judge ChoIakis issued his verdict, Judge Ginsberg leaned over to John J. Sutter, his lawyer, and said: “I don't believe it.” “Neither do I,” Mr. Sutter responded.. After comforting her two daughters, Wendy, 20, and Susan, 18, who were weeping, Judge Ginsberg's wife, Joan, went up to her husband, held his head and said: “Relax, darling.” “My entire life and career is destroyed,” the judge murmured to the lawyer. Judge Ginsberg, who will be sentenced Feb. 14, faces a prison term of up to seven years. After the sentencing by Judge Cholakis, the verdict will be appealed to the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court. When Judge Cholakis issued his verdict, most of the 100 spectators appeared stunned and several were in tears. After the verdict, Judge Ginsberg sat at the table in the courtroom for more than a half hour speaking quietly to friends. “I still have complete faith in my vindication and I'm sure the appeal will be successful,” he said to a reporter. Earlier, outside the courtroom and before the Verdict, Judge Ginsberg said: “I've lived through hell the last six months. I have been through much in my life time and have overcome severe adversity. But none of these hardships of the past can compare with what I've experienced this past year.” He said he could not understand the District Attorney's bringing the charges that led to his indictment. Judge Ginsberg was indicted on charges of soliciting and receiving $8,000 in bribes for promises of political favors in 1970 and 1971, when he was an Assemblyman. An investigation was ordered by District Attorney William Cahn, a friend of the defendant for many years. Mr. Cahn Said at the time that to the best of his knowledge Judge Ginsberg was the first judge to have been indicted in the history of Nassau County. The two prime prosecution witnesses were Remeo DeMarco, who alleged that Judge Ginsberg had sought and accepted a $7,500 bribe to use his influence to have Mr. DeMarco designated as a county garage operator, and Louis Caiazzo, a Bethpage contractor who said he had given the judge $500 as a political contribution in hopes of getting town work. It is on the basis of Mr. DeMarco's testimony that Judge Ginsberg was convicted on the second‐degree perjury charge. On the second count in the indictment, which involved Mr. Caiazzo, Judge Ginsberg was found not guilty. When Judge Ginsberg was indicted, the Appellate Division relieved him of all duties, but continued his annual salary of $43,000. The law provides that he will be automatically disbarred when the sentence is pronounced, and he also loses his judicial post. Justice Thomas P. Farley, of the State Supreme Court, presiding judge of the Nassau County Court, removed Judge Ginsberg from the payroll today. If Judge Ginsberg's verdict is overturned by the higher court, he will be reinstated to the bar. But he could only return to the bench if there was a vacancy. Judge Ginsberg was permitted to remain free on his own recognizance until sentencing. Judge Ginsberg, who was elected to the Assembly from Plainview in 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, drew statewide‐attention while serving as an Assemblyman in 1969, when an attempt was being made, to ease the state's abortion law. On April 17 of that year, the bill to liberalize the 86‐year‐old abortion law was defeated when 14 legislators who had said they would vote for the bill suddenly decided to oppose it. They made their decison minutes after an, emotional speech by Mr. Ginsberg. Mr. Ginsberg, who was stricken with poliomyelitis at the age of 10 and must use leg and arm braces and canes, cited his own infirmity in opposing the bill. He concluded his 20‐minute speech by saying softly: “I don't know why God let me live in this form and condition. Perhaps it was so I could be here on April 17 to speak on this specific bill.” The next year, when the bill was modified, Mr. Ginsberg voted in favor of it. Judge Ginsberg was named to the Nassau Family Court in July, 1973, and was elected to a 10‐year judicial term the following November.

The alliance, which is the youth organization of the Socialist Workers party, begins its political convention tomorrow. It had sought to bar undercover F.B.I. agents from attending and had won such an order in Federal District Court in New York City. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the ruling, however. Today Justice Marshall upheld the. Court of Appeals in a six‐page opinion after closed hearings in his chambers. After the ruling lawyers for the alliance took the matter to Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., but he declined to hear the case. “While the applicants' allegations evoke an unsavory picture of deceit and political sabotage [on the part of the F.B.I.], the facts as characterized by the Court of Appeals suggest a less sinister view of the Government's planned activities,” Justice Marshall wrote. He noted that anyone under age 29 could attend, that the Government had planned no electronic surveillance or disruptive activity and “that the only investigating method would be the use of informants who would attend the meetings just as any other member of the public would be permitted to do.” He added, however, that the dangers inherent in undercover “investigation are even more pronounced when the investigated activity threatens to dampen the exercise of First Amendment rights.” The First Admendment states that citizens have the right “peaceably to assemble,” and the rights to freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Justice Marshall wrote, “The Government has stated that it has not authorized any disruptive activity at the convention. In addition, the Government has represented that it has no intention of transmitting any information obtained at the convention to nongovernmental entities such as schools or employers. I shall hold the Government to both representations as a condition of this order.” The Appelate Court had ruled that the planned survillance could be carried out “on condition that the Federal Bureau of Investigation refrain from transmitting the names of persons attending the convention to the Civil Service Commission pendfurther order.” Socialists Reveal Candidates Special to The New York Times ST.

As for Governor Byrne, he will spend New Year's Eve at Morven, the Governor's mansion in Princeton, and he does not expect a frivolous night. “This New Year's Eve, I will be at home—as usual,” Mr. Byrne said last week, “and I'll probably be asleep by the time the New Year rolls in.” The Governor's No. 1 priority for 1975? “To improve my backhand at tennis,” he said with a smile. “That's what be wanted to do, spend New Year's Eve with his family,” Jean Byrne, the Governor's wife, said. “We've had small parties in the past, but this year I think we'll just spend it together.” She usually stays up a little later than the Governor, Mrs. Byrne said, adding: “I think we all pretty much feel that this is a time for renewal, to put our priorities in order and weed out what's superficial. It's a time to renew human relationships and make them more meaningful, a time when we're given a chance to start over.” Malcolm S. Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine and a one‐time Republican candidate for Governor, plans to be en route to Europe in a balloon—if all goes according to schedule. “ra be high, but not on champagne,” Mr. Forbes said, adding that Dr. Thomas Heinsheimer would be with him on tte flight. They plan to leave from Santa Ana, Calif., tomorrow and allow six days for the trans‐Atlantic crossing. How does Mrs. Forbes feel about it? “I'm enthusiastic,” she replied. As for priorities, his is survival, Mr. Forbes declared. “And to have next year as happy a year as this one,” he added. J. Wallace LaPrade, special agent in charge of the Newark office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose new assignment as an assistant director at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington was announced earlier this month, said that, because of his new post, he and his family had decided to stay home over New Year's. Going to Washington “We belong to a country club, and my wife and I usually go to a dance,” Mr. LaPrade said. “But since I'll be leaving for Washington at the first of the year and my family will stay on in Tenafly until school ends, we decided to stay home so that we could all be together. “My priority for the new year is to fulfill this new assignment to the best of my ability—for the F.B.I. and for the people of the United States.” Jonathan L. Goldstein, the youthfdl United States Attorney for New Jersey, reported that he and his wife, Ellen, plan to spend New Year's Eve with friends at a neighborhood party. As for 1975, Mr. Goldstein said that he hoped to continue his efforts to reestablish public confidence in the integrity of governmental institutions. Ann Klein, the state's Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies, and her husband, Robert, a management consultant, anticipate “just a quiet party with old friends, as we have for many years.” As for 1975, her main aim, Mrs. Klein said with a grin, will be to “try to stay out of the newspapers as much as possible and get something done quietly.” A Two‐fold Thanks Dr. Oscar Sussman, the controversial director of Consumer Health Services, said that, because his wife had just been released from the hospital, “we're going to spend New Year's Eve quietly thanking God that she got out of her heart attack and wishing that the country could get out of its doldrums.” One of his major efforts in 1975, Dr. Sussman declared, will be “to continue to press for free access of information to the public of all reports and documents that the public, in effect, pays for when they employ someone like myself.” Ricki Stoçhaj, president of the Consumers League of New Jersey, said that she and her husband, John, a professor of economics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, hated celebrating New Year's Eve “any way exoept the way we would any other evening with friends.” As for 1975, Mrs. Stochaj asserted: “A few years ago, the league was criticized for wanting ‘pie in the sky’ when we asked for better use of resources, better distribution of income and wealth and greater participation in government by people. Now I think this is the only way we're going to survive both as a people and as a democratic society.” Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark will combine politics with pleasure. “I will spend New Year's Eve with my wife, friends and members of the Kenneth A. Gibson Civic Association at an informal party given by them at the Terrace Ballroom here in Newark,” he said. “For 1975, I would rather comment on my hopes for people than on priorities of government I sincerely hope that every American family will be able to survive our failing with the least amount of hardship and anxiety possible. The year must bring the necessary answers and activities for the welfare of the people from the Federal, state and local governments throughout the nation.” ‘A Nice, Loud Party’ Steven Nagler, director of the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, reported that he and his wife, Iris, were planning “a nice, loud party at home. I prepare the best eggnog possible, which I intend to do.” In 1975, Mr. Nagler said, he hopes to see an end to wiretapping, the decriminalization of marijuana, an end to restrictions on the availability of abortion and the elimination of restrictions as to where people may live, particularly because of zoning laws. “A little less agony and a little more ecstasy,” he declared. Sylvia Aranow, head of the New Jersey Tenants Association, said that she would be spending New Year's Eve dining with her children, Jonathan, 8, and Andrew, VA. This will be a repeat performance of last year, Mr. Aranow recalled, “when I let them pick the menu. We dined by candlelight on roast beef and a little wine, and they loved it.” As head of the tenants' organization, Mrs. Aranow intends to continue to seek more protective legislation for those who pay rent, “Personally, I intend to spend more time with my children,” she added. Governor and Mrs. Byrne will spend New Year's Eve at the Governor's mansion; Malcolm S. Forbes, top, publisher, hopes to be en route to Europe in a balloon and Commissioner Ann Klein and U.S. Attorney Jonathan L. Goldstein will attend quiet parties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite Drop in Parochial Schools, 89% of Laity in Poll Say They're Needed",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/29/archives/despite-drop-in-parochial-schools-89-of-laity-in-poll-saytheyre.html,"Despite a sharp drop in the number of Roman Catholic schools over the last decade, the Catholic laity appears to remain stoutly loyal to the principle of parochial education and ready to demonstrate its cornmitment in the form of increased financial support. The results of a broad survey by the National Opinion Research Center of Catholics across the United States, made available to The New York Times, show that 89 per cent of those polled believe the parochial school system is still needed and that 82 per cent say they would donate more to Sunday collections to bail schools out of fiscal troubles. More than 3,000 of them have 6(40 since 1964. The survey, financed by a gut from the National Institutes of Education and undertaken by four sociologists headed by the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, is a follow‐up to a similar questionnaire issued in 1263. .While attitudes toward such concerns as education can be measured against results of the earlier study (support for education has remained virtually the same), nearly two‐thirds of the questions in the new survey took up issues such as changes in church practices that were not in evidence at the time of the earlier sampling. These are matters like women's ordination, a married priesthood or abortion that were of marginal interest then. Changes Approved In addition to their opinions about the school system, the 925 respondents (there were 2,071 in 1963) reflected solid approval of changes such as the English mass instituted by Vatican II. Compared with the first study, they showed a slackening in overt religious conduct, a diminished sense of respect for the priesthood and hierarchy arid greater permissiveness toward birth control, premarital sex and divorce. A supplemental report oh apostasy, drawn from the center's general population survey itdicated that persons born Catholic and under age 30 were tigice as likely to fall away from the church as those over 50 and that those who have attended college were still more likely to drop out. Only 35 per cent of parents of salmi‐age children had them in Catholic schools. However, the study indicated the principal reasons had little to do with negative feelings about such samoling. The most common reason for nonattendance was that schools were not available, followed by the opinion that such schools, where they existed were too expensive. Among the majority that said it would pay more to underwrite Catholic schools, 59 per cent would give more than $50 and 31 per cent would give more than $100 to the Sunday collection. That led the researchers to conclude that “there are literally hundreds of millions of dollars of untapped resources should the leadership choose to utilize them.” The size of the Catholic school system has steadily shrunk. According to figures of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, there were 13,360 high schools and elementary schools in 1964 with combined enrollment of 5,625,040. Ten years later the number, of schools had dropped to 10,349 with a registration of 3,629,646. Meanwhile, weekly attendance at mass declined from 71 to 50 per cent, and confession at least once a month was reported to be 17 per cent in 1974, less than half that of the previous poll. The number of those who say they pray every day dropped from 72 to 60 per cent, and the percentage who say they read a spiritual book recently dropped from 58 to 33. By contrast, the proportion of those who receive communion weekly at mass rose from 13 to 26 per cent. There was also evidence of a quickening in the more peripheral areas of church life that have recently emerged. For example, 6 per cent reported having had contact with the pentecostal movement in the last two years, 8 per cent attended liturgy in a private home, 3 per cent said they had been involved with marriage encounter and 20 per cent reported attending a discussion group on religion. Tolerant on Sex Eighty per cent of the respondents said they accepted the English liturgy and two‐thirds approved lay clothes for nuns, the folk mass, progressive religious education and sex education in Catholic schools. Serving of the communion by the laity, a recent innovation, received only 45 per cent support, but the “handshake of peace,” a gesture of friendship shared by parishioners at one point in the mass, is approv,ed by 77 per cent. Sixty‐five per cent opposed the ordination of women to the priesthood. Nevertheless, 80 per cent said they could accept a married priesthood if that change were adopted, and 79 per cent favored it. Perhaps the most dramatic shift in attitudes has taken place in the area of sexuality. Sexual intercourse for pleasure alone rather than for procreation was viewed as wholesome by 50 per cent of those surveyed, compared with 29 per cent in 1963. Approval of artificial contraception rose in the same time from 45 to 83 per cent, while tolerance for sexual activity between engaged couples increased from 12 to 43 per cent. Acceptance of remar‐1 riage after divorce jumped from 52 to 73 per cent. On the matter of abortion, there were two levels of response. While 70 per cent agreed that married women who did not want more children should be able to obtain legal abortion, only 8 per cent of the women respondents said they would obtain an abortion themselves (19 per cent more would consider it). Whereas in 1963 just over half the respondents believed the church had a right to direction on birth control, that per centage has fallen to 32 per cent. Likewise, the proportion that believed that Jesus handed over authority to Peter and the popes (and by extension the bishops) dropped from 70 to 42 per cent, and only 32 per cent replied that it was “certainly true” that the Pope was infallible when speaking on faith and morals. The researchers asserted that the decline in church authority should be seen in the context of a more pervasive disillusion with political authority. They concluded that it would be “a mistake to think that there is an overt revolt against religious leadership” or that chagrin over church leadership was “anything as strong” as the “dissatisfaction with political leadership.” Asked to rate the competency of priests, bishops and the Pope with that of American Presidents over the last 40 years, the priests and the Pope outranked all Presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Richard M. Nixon, while bishops, described in the survey report as “the least popular of church leaders,” were placci behind Presidents Kennedy, Roosevelt and Eisenhower. Slightly more than 60 per cent approved of the way bishops are handling their jobs. However, the poll showed a loss of esteem about priests, particularly toward their preaching and the ability to understand personal problems. In first survey 30 per cent rated the priests' sermons as excellent, a figure that has dropped to 22 per cent.

"Ideas &Trends Education, Abortion, Science",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/29/archives/ideas-trends-education-abortion-science.html,"Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson, an early, militant advocate of abortion on demand, is now convinced that human life exists within the womb from the onset of pregnancy, and says: “I am deeply troubled by my own increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths.” A Changed View of Abortion Dr. Nathanson, who is chief of obstetrics at St. Luke's Hospital and is affiliated with the Cornell Medical School, was formerly director of clinic that performed 60,000 abortions during his tenure. “The decision for abortion,” he says, “is fraught with moral and ethical questions, not only for the woman and her physician, but for society at large.” The decision, he says in an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, “is the most serious responsibility a woman can experience in her lifetime, and at present it is hers alone.” Dr. Nathanson urges the formation of consultative organizations to counsel women. The doctor believes that the issue has become polarized between what he calls the “fierce militants of the woman's liberation” and the “ferocious right‐to‐life legions.” Now that the political struggle over legalization of abortion has ended, he says, society must find a middle ground: “We must work together to create a moral climate rich enough to provide for abortion, but sensitive enough to life to accommodate a profound sense of loss.” Dr. Nathanson says that he still supports the legal right of women to have abortions, but he feels that more attention must be given to the moral and ethical implications involved in their decisions. “Abortion must be seen as the interruption of a process that would otherwise have produced a citizen of the world,” the doctor says. “Denial of this reality is the crassest kind of moral evasiveness.” Comeback of The Ospreys A relocation program to restore the osprey population in eastern Long Island and southern New England is apparently working: Research findings indicate that reproduction of the eagle‐like birds is on the upswing for the first time in 25 years. Paul Spitzer, a Cornell University scientist, attributes the turnabout largely to the transplant of eggs and chicks from the Chesapeake Bay area. Suffolk County and southern New England once were principal breeding grounds for ospreys, but in the 1950's reproduction began to slacken. Studies traced the cause to chemical residues of DDT, which were accumulating in the birds' food supply and causing thin eggshells, thus breakage; the number of active osprey nests in the area dropped off, drastically. To offset the decline of natural breeding, 53 osprey chicks and eggs were transplanted in 1968‐70 from Maryland, where the DDT problem did not exist, and 45 fledged from their foster parents nests. In 1970 and 1971, Mr. Spitzer's studies show, the population decreased at rate of 11 per cent; in 1972 and 1973, when the transplanted birds were mature enough to breed, the decrease was only 3 per cent; and this year it is estimated at less than 2 per cent. Ideas&Trends/conthued Restoring the Reputation of Young Cabot The place of Sebastian Cabot, son of the Italian explorer John, In the annals of the voyages of discovery of the New World, has been an insecure one. At one time he was hailed as the premier navigator in the British service to chart North America. Then, documents from Italian archives restored his father to his leading role in the earliest voyages, undertaken in 1497 and 1498. Sebastian became to historians a supposititious discoverer, if for no other reason than what appeared to be boasts in reports of his own accounts were not consonant with 19th‐century notions of filial deference. The restoration of Sebastian's reputation began late In that century, as scholars found evidence that he had probably been talking about a voyage to the high latitudes in 1508‐9, after his father's death. With that voyage he is now generally credited, but because discrepancies still remain in Sebastian's story, as Alwyn A. Ruddock puts it in a recent issue of the British Journal Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research, some have expressed “grave doubts about the truth of Sebastian's claims.” On the basis of new documents, however, Mr. Ruddock has no doubts. He has found a copy of writ of privy seal dated “3 April Henry VII” and entered on the memoranda roll of the exchequer authorizing payment of an annuity to Sebastian from Bristol for voyage in 1504, If two voyages, 1504 and 1508‐9, are considered, Mr. Ruddock says, the apparent contradictions about Sebastian Cabot disappear. A Sexually Attracting Secretion Scientists have discovered that human females, like females of virtually all animal species, secrete “sex attractant” chemicals. The chemicals, aliphatic acids called pheremones, are found in vaginal secretions. Their presence in animals, from insects on up, has been known for some time, and the chemicals have been shown to stimulate sexual behavior in the male monkey. The presence of pherernohas in humans, though long stispicted was only recently confirmed by researchers in Atlanta. In experiments with 50 women as reported in the magazine Science, Dr. Richard P. Michael, Dr. R.W. Bonsall and Patricia Warner found that the chemicals were present in largest amounts during the woman's fertile period. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the chemicals play any role in human sexual behavior. If it turns out in time that pheremones provoke sexual stimulation in humans, as they do in monkeys, some women may be faced with a difficult choice. Pheremones have an odor that some persons find unpleasant, and the attention that most humans pay to bathing and applying artificial scents and deodorants would do much to negate the sexual role the chemicals might play. The Many Who Aren't in School A Children's Defense Fund study shows that more than two million American children are not attending school, that a large proportion of them have been suspended for disciplinary reasons, and that the majority of them are black. There are other reasons that 5.4 per cent of the 45 million children aged 7 to 17 are not in school, according to the private child‐advocacy organization: Some families cannot afford clothes, textbooks or transportation charges for their children; some of the youngsters are pregnant, and some stay home because of mental, physical and language handicaps for which their schools have inadequate programs or no programs at all. Shoplifting Goes Up Despite new techniques to stop it, shoplifting continues to increase, and many police officials and businessmen believe inflation and unemployment are overwhelming the inhibitions of people who would otherwise never think of stealing. The national Retail Merchants Association reports that its members losses from both shoplifting and pilferage by employes were 2.07 per cent of all, sales in 1973; and losses in 1974 are expected to be higher. The total annual cost to merchants is estimated at $5‐bilhon, about half from shoplifting. While much of the shoplifting is done by professionals, a recent survey of merchants by The New York Times showed that the practice involves all ages and all social and economic strata., In an attempt to reverse the trend stores have resorted‐ to armed guards, chained merchandise, microwave detectors, sensitized labels, infrared telescopes, alarms and television cameras.

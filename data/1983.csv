"SUPREME COURT; IN A 3-MONTH SESSION, A BUSY DOCKET",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/01/us/supreme-court-in-a-3-month-session-a-busy-docket.html,"The coming of the New Year finds that the Supreme Court has barely scratched the surface of its 1982-83 term. But while nine decisions down and perhaps 150 to go is not much of a scorecard, the first three months were not idle. Screening more than 2,000 appeals, the Justices selected 70 for argument and decision. These new cases, added to those already on the calendar when the term opened, filled in the last available argument slots and gave the term its final shape. To a docket already laden with cases in which the Reagan Administration has a substantial political stake, the Court added cases on the constitutionality of a tax deduction for private and parochial school tuition; on a judicial overriding of ordinary seniority rules to protect recently hired black employees from layoffs, and on the Administration's repeal of the rule requiring air bags or automatic seat belts for new cars. An already heavy criminal docket became weightier with the Court's announcement Nov. 29 that it would decide whether to modify the rule that bars illegally seized evidence from use at trial. The new cases will be argued in the spring, with decisions due in July. Still to come are decisions in most major cases with which the Court began the term, including the legislative veto, abortion cases and the so-called Bob Jones case on the tax status of discriminatory private schools. Here are some highlights of the recent additions to the Court's calendar: Religion The Court's ruling on the constitutionality of Minnesota's tuition tax deduction could determine the fate of the Reagan Administration's proposal for a Federal tax credit for private and parochial school tuition. A Federal appeals court upheld the Minnesota law on the ground that by permitting deductions for some public school expenses as well as for private and parochial school tuition, the law was nominally neutral. Taxpayers challenging the law argue that because its benefits flow almost entirely to parents with children in parochial schools, a result the Reagan plan would also achieve, the law is a thinly disguised state subsidy of religious education. The Administration will file a brief defending the law. (Mueller v. Allen, No. 82-195). The Court will also decide whether a legislature can constitutionally employ a chaplain to lead its members in prayer. The case (Marsh v. Chambers, No. 82-23) is an appeal by Nebraska, where the Legislature has for years begun each day's session with a prayer by a Presbyterian minister whose salary the state pays. A Federal appeals court said the financial arrangement, though not necessarily the act of prayer itself, was unconstitutional. Congress and many states have salaried chaplains, and the Justice Department has joined the state's appeal. Discrimination A Federal judge ordered Boston to preserve racial balance won for its Police and Fire Departments when a fiscal crisis forced layoffs. Some senior white officers lost their jobs while the jobs of newly hired blacks and Hispanic people were saved. The Reagan Administration filed a brief supporting the police and fire unions' challenge. (Boston Firefighters v. Boston N.A.A.C.P., No. 82-185). Arizona is appealing a ruling that its state employees' retirement plan violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by permitting the purchase of annuities that pay men higher monthly benefits than women whose policies have the same dollar value. The insurance business is interested in the case (Arizona v. Norris, No. 82-52) because nearly all annuities work the same way. Women receive less per month on the actuarial assumption that they will live longer than men. A third discrimination case involves privileges under the Federal tax laws. Federal law permits veterans' organizations to lobby without losing their tax-exempt status, but denies 300,000 tax-exempt charitable organizations the same privilege. The Government is appealing a decision by the Federal appeals court here that the law violates the equal protection rights of the nonveterans' charities (Regan v. Taxation With Representation, No. 81-2338). Criminal Law A garden-variety search warrant case, argued in October, with minimal attention, was turned into a major case a month later. The Court said it would use it as a vehicle for deciding whether to modify the exclusionary rule, which bars illegally seized evidence from use at trial. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist have campaigned against the exclusionary rule for years and may finally have picked up the votes they need to overturn the Court's precedents. The most likely change would be some form of ''good faith exception'' to the rule. The Administration has proposed legislation to effect such a change. (Illinois v. Gates, No. 81-430). Federal Regulation The Court has accepted four separate Government appeals of decisions in which the Federal appeals court here refused to defer to a Federal regulatory agency's interpretation of its authority. In the air bag case, the Court of Appeals blocked the Reagan Administration from rescinding a rule requiring air bags or automatic seat belts on all new cars. The rule was 14 years in the making. Its rescission was to have been a centerpiece of the Administration's antiregulatory policy. The appeals court said the action was ''arbitrary and capricious'' and ordered that the rule take effect next fall. (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v. State Farm Insurance, No. 82-354). The Court of Appeals invalidated rules adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to carry out a 1978 energy law and force utilities to cooperate in developing alternative sources of energy. The case (American Paper Institute v. American Electric Power) finds the Administration and the utility industry on opposite sides. Two other regulatory cases deal with nuclear power, in addition to a case on the validity of California's moratorium on nuclear power plant construction, to be argued Jan. 17. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the utility that runs Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania are challenging the appeals court's order that psychological stress in the community must be taken into account in deciding whether to restart the Unit No. 1 reactor, shut down since 1979, when its twin, Unit No. 2, was damaged in the country's worst commercial nuclear accident. (Metropolitan Edison v. People Against Nuclear Energy, No. 81-2399). In the other case, the appeals court invalidated the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's policy of refusing to consider environmental consequences of nuclear waste when deciding whether to license a nuclear power plant. Many utilities have joined the Government's appeal (Baltimore Gas & Electric v. Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 82-524).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STARTING WITH EVE; BY LAWRENCE STONE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/books/starting-with-eve-by-lawrence-stone.html,"A HISTORY OF WOMEN'S BODIES By Edward Shorter. 398 pp. New York: Basic Books. $24.95. Up till now women's bodies have had a good press. Artists have nearly always thought well of them. Initially their reproductive and nurturing potentialities were stressed, but more recently the emphasis has been upon the erotic aspects of the female nude. This is hardly surprising, given the human male's hair-trigger response to visual stimuli. Biologists have been equally flattering about women's bodies as reproductive machines that turn out children in such numbers that today man has crowded most other mammals off the face of the earth, leaving only the insects to compete. Demographers have found that women's bodies last longer than those of men, that their life expectancy at birth is higher. The economic historians, when they stop to think about the matter, also have nothing but praise for women's bodies, which have adapted remarkably to the long, backbreaking bending work in the fields imposed by postneolithic agriculture. Finally, the sexologists are falling all over themselves in praise of women's bodies. Women are almost unique in the animal world in being sexually responsive at all times. They may be sexually active for decades after the end of their reproductive cycle. And they are endowed with a capacity not merely for orgasm (not needed for reproduction) but for almost innumerable multiple orgasms. In this last respect women are to men as an AK-47 automatic rifle is to a 16th-century musket. Hitherto only two serious criticisms have been leveled against women's bodies as designed by nature, apart from the trivial one that the clitoris seems to be inefficiently sited. The first is the liability of the breasts to cancer, and the second is the narrowness of the pelvis. The human head has become so large because of an increase in brain size that the infant cranium often has considerable difficulty in forcing its way through the birth canal. The result is often excruciating pain for the mother and sometimes the death of both mother and child. Bay and large, however, the testimony of 5,000 years has been flattering to the female body. Not any more. Edward Shorter, a historian who is largely concerned with the internal plumbing of the female body, regards it as an almost unmitigated disaster area, at least before about 1920. He sees it partly as one of nature's botched jobs, partly as a mess made infinitely worse by exploitative husbands, ignorant folk customs and harmful medical interventions. His picture of the traditional past is grim indeed. Women were brutally treated by men, whose sexual demands forced usually unwanted and always dangerous pregnancies on women and whose economic exploitation condemned their wives to endless toil in the home and the fields. Mr. Shorter's view of Western family relationships before the late 19th century closely resembles that of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego when Charles Darwin encountered them. Finding that in a hard winter they were in the habit of killing and eating some of their women, Darwin asked one of them why they did it: ""Why no eat dog?"" The answer was simple: ""Dog catch otter. Woman no catch otter. Woman good for nothing. Man hungry."" Mr. Shorter, whose last book was ""The Making of the Modern Family,"" regards even sex in this traditional pre-20th-century society as nothing more than brief and brutal coupling, an outcome of ""ramrod impetuosity,"" closer to rape than to an act of love. Much of his book, however, is devoted to the horrors of childbirth and attendant gynecological disease. Mr. Shorter paints a terrifying and nauseating picture, though he concedes that the expectation of life for pre-20th-century women was greater than that of men before the age of 16 and after 40. (He claims that in women's fertile years it was 25 percent less, a figure I find roughly acceptable.) He utterly demolishes once and for all the fashionable feminist romanticization of the ignorant old midwife of the past. She would not leave well enough alone when she ought to have done so: She punctured the amniotic sac with a long, dirty fingernail; she tore open the cervix with grubby hands; she sped delivery by pressing on the stomach with all her weight. Mr. Shorter agrees with a description of midwives in 1690 as ""these great tuggers of women's bodies."" When things went wrong, as they did in 5 percent of all cases, the midwives either pulled the infant out of the womb by brute force, sometimes tearing off the child's head or arm in the process, or else just gave up and left mother and child to die. Even more widespread was the danger of sepsis after delivery, also largely caused by the dirty, probing fingers of the midwives. It was, he argues, medically trained male obstetricians, with their improved forceps and greater technical knowledge, who rescued women from some of these disasters. Mr. Shorter then moves on to another horror story, that of gynecological diseases. He describes in revolting detail the variety of common vaginal discharges, all noisome and painful. Since, he claims, women never washed their bodies and rarely changed their clothes, the stench can easily be imagined. Only after about 1930, he believes, did women cease to smell bad. Difficult childbirth also did awful things to some women: It caused ruptures of the vagina, through to the bladder or the colon. Sometimes the uterus was pulled out by a midwife along with the afterbirth.The result, Mr. Shorter says, is that women were sick most of the time and that pain was ""a normal part of their lives."" All this changed, he tells us, about 1920, thanks to modern medicine, which provided women with antiseptic and painless delivery, contraception, abortion, antibiotics. At last women felt well and smelled good, and men were even nice to them--a product of the affectionate marriage. As a result, women were now ready to embark on the great adventure of feminism. What are we to make of this ambitious and more than a little melodramatic story? First we have to note that Mr. Shorter takes the bulk of his data from reports by European male doctors, who mostly saw the sick and not the healthy and had a professional ax to grind against midwives. Moreover, Mr. Shorter seems to forget that in the past everyone, of both sexes, was far sicker (and smellier) than we are today. Of that there is no question. Both sexes were smaller, more stunted, more crippled, more in pain; they aged faster, and they lived half as long as we do. But the fact is that most women seem to have gone about their business despite the numerous pregnancies and that more wives outlived their husbands than vice versa. Moreover, Mr. Shorter entirely disregards perceptions. Death and disease were commonplace in traditional society, and although women feared childbirth, they were taught to regard it as their natural duty and accordingly were proud of it. Indeed, some scholars argue that menopause was psychologically far more traumatic in the past than today just because it deprived women of what they regarded as their prime purpose in life, reproduction. No one doubts that both the birthrate and female disease declined in the 1920's and 1930's, but the role of such change as a ""precondition for feminism"" is unclear. After all, the first feminist movement--to obtain the franchise--occured in the first two decades of this century, before the medical revolution. In any case, Mr. Shorter's single-cause explanation of the takeoff of feminism is wholly implausible, since it ignores almost entirely other critical factors, like the spread of ideas of equality and the moral collapse of patriarchy. To conclude, Mr. Shorter exaggerates and distorts the extent of female disease in the past, and when it comes to explaining the rise of feminism in the 20th century, he fails even to mention other economic, social, intellectual and cultural factors. He destroys his own case. All that is left is something most of us knew already--no golden age lies out there in the past, before the advent of modern science, industry and medicine-- and a convincing demolition of the myth of the totally virtuous untrained midwife.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR NEW YORK'S NEW LEADER, A DAY OF FAMILY AND ROOTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/nyregion/for-new-york-s-new-leader-a-day-of-family-and-roots.html,"For Mario M. Cuomo it was a day to celebrate his family and his immigrant roots, to pay ''magnificent tribute'' to American democracy and to wonder at the ''improbability'' of it all. ''I've been waiting for the moment of exhilaration,'' he told reporters before he spoke the oath as Governor of New York State today. ''I've been waiting for euphoria. Maybe it comes when you put up your hand. You're under oath. You are going to make a pact with 18 million people. I take a contract seriously.'' In a private ceremony on New Year's Eve and again in a tumultuous formal inauguration today with music, song and poetry, Governor Cuomo spoke with emotion of his parents, Andrea and Immaculata Cuomo, the ''magnificent immigrant couple who came here with nothing but aspirations and a willingness to work hard.'' 'A Magnificent Tribute' He said ''it has to be a magnificent tribute to American democracy'' that their son, ''who was born behind a grocery store in South Jamaica,'' would get to occupy ''the highest seat in the greatest state in the greatest nation and the only world we know.'' Mr. Cuomo bought a new blue suit for the occasion and, between moments of solemnity, seemed to relish his first day in office, exchanging New Year's greetings with state troopers and bantering with reporters, who followed him everywhere. And even as plants and files from the cramped Lieutenant Governor's office were being moved to the Governor's spacious office on the second floor of the Capitol, he seemed somewhat astonished about the transformation. 'Curiously Beautiful Thing' ''It's a good feeling, you know you can get things done,'' he said. As Lieutenant Governor, his views were often overlooked, he said. ''Before, when I pushed on the stone nothing happened,'' he said. ''Now when I push on it, it moves.'' He described the day as a ''curiously beautiful thing'' resulting from an ''extraordinary combination of circumstances to create a situation where I get to be Governor.'' ''I won't trace back the improbability of it all,'' he said, ''if we consider where we came from and what we have been.'' Mr. Cuomo spoke today of the ''Family of New York,'' but it was also a day for the Cuomo family. As they arrived from Queens in a chartered bus, his youngest child, Christopher, 12 years old, immediately ran through the Schuyler Mansion, the Governor's official residence, exploring everywhere. Mr. Cuomo's wife, Matilda, clasped a bouquet of roses, presented by the state trooper who stands watch over the mansion. After a night of parties at the mansion with relatives and close friends, Mr. Cuomo slept for four hours, dressed and strolled down the street for a New Year's Day mass at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. His wife was at his side, along with his older son, Andrew, 25, who was later sworn in as a special assistant to the Governor. Mr. Cuomo's other children - Dr. Margaret Perpignano (who was married during the campaign last fall), Maria, 20, Madeline, 18, and Christopher - trailed behind, with a host of in-laws. In church, he knelt in his seat for many minutes in silent prayer with his hands clasped and folded over the front of the pew. Mrs. Cuomo sat silently, tears glistening in her eyes in the lights of television cameras. A baby cried in the background. Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Brooklyn offered a prayer for the Cuomo administration - that ''they may be inspired to be strong and caring shepherds.'' The Bishop listed ways he thought Mr. Cuomo could use the power of the state wisely, including protecting the rights of the unborn, a reference to the abortion issue. 'Nothing New in What He Said' Mr. Cuomo, who has pledged to uphold the rights of women to obtain legal abortions, said later that Bishop Sullivan was merely reiterating the views of the Catholic Conference of Bishops. ''There was nothing new in what he said,'' Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Cuomo presided over a swearing-in ceremony for 18 members of his staff, and then moved into the Governor's office, while a procession of congressmen, state legislators, judges of the Court of Appeals, members of the Board of Regents and others filed into the New York State Convention Center. As the orchestra took up Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy'' from the Ninth Symphony, Mr. Cuomo and his wife walked side by side through the cavernous convention center. There, with Mrs. Cuomo holding the family Bible, he took the oath of office. In the last few days, he noted in his inaugural address, many people had reminded him that he faces difficult decisions in closing a budget gap of more than $1 billion next year. Yet during the morning swearing-in of his staff, the Governor looked across the room to his secretary, Michael J. Del Giudice, and at the same moment they both said in mock astonishment, ''This is tough?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Baby Dam,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/opinion/the-baby-dam.html,"The United States enters 1983 with 234 million inhabitants. That's four million more than in 1980; births are increasing; and some people think a new baby boom has begun. Baloney. The apt question about births, at this birth of a new year, is why there are so few. It's true that for nine years the number of births has been inching up, but that's only part of the story. The number of potential mothers has been zooming up. In 1960, there were 36 million women aged 15 to 44 and they bore 4.3 million babies. Today, there are about 54 million and they bore 3.6 million babies in 1982. In other words, for every two potential mothers in 1960, there are three now. Yet they are having many fewer children. If their fertility rate were anything like that of their mothers, births now would be six and a half million a year, not three and a half million. When potential mothers are up 50 percent, an increase in births of barely 1 percent a year is no boom; it's barely a blip. The arresting fact is the steep difference between those two figures - the Baby Dam. Why are so many women forbearing babies instead of bearing them? Or having fewer? If the pattern persists, as is probable, what are the consequences? Forecasting fertility is a chancy business. All the experts were confounded by the huge baby boom of the late 40's and 50's. Still, there are reasonable grounds for speculating that fertility will remain low. One reason is technology. Contraceptives and abortion are widely available, often supplemented by amniocentesis tests during pregnancy. While so-cial attitudes might, imaginably, change to inhibit abortions, a sharp turn against contraception is, well, inconceivable. Meanwhile, the education level for women keeps improving. The better educated the woman, the more likely she is to work for satisfaction - and the less likely to have a large family. A young woman fresh out of law school, say, is reluctant to leap into marriage and child-bearing, postponing entry into the legal job market until her training has faded from mind. Personal satisfaction parallels this career reason. Young men and women want sports cars, home computers, culture - and seem less eager for marriage and child-rearing responsibilities than prior generations. Charles Westoff, a demographer, once described this change in global terms, in Scientific American: Developed countries have seen a transformation in the economic value of children, ''from a source of income in agrarian economies to a considerable drain on income in industrial and post-industrial economies.'' Which of these factors, abortion aside, is likely to change? None. For they all turn on a factor that precedes the decision to have a child: greater freedom for women. There are many reasons to be glad that births are low, and stable. Sharp jumps in population size inevitably mean sharp competition for classroom seats, then jobs, then pensions; they wrench a society. But the best reason is that millions of women feel increasingly free to follow a variety of life models, free to find fulfillment out of, as well as in, the nursery. As long as that's what they want to do, the Baby Dam will hold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LEGISLATIVE SESSION EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON BUDGET DEFICIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/03/nyregion/legislative-session-expected-to-focus-on-budget-deficit.html,"The New York State Legislature returns to Albany this week to confront a faltering state economy and a potential budget deficit of more than $1 billion that will largely shape - and limit - its actions in many areas. The 206th session of the Assembly and Senate, which opens Wednesday, will also face many other issues - from retraining laidoff steel workers, to requests for increased aid for New York City, to reorganizing state agencies and rebuilding roads and bridges. It will be presented with a series of proposals from the new Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, who has pledged to do more than simply balance the budget. But with the state borrowing $300 million to pay its bills this fiscal year - and facing a much larger potential problem next year - the session may put Governor Cuomo's pledge to a severe test. 'Post-Election Budget Blues' ''Its going to be a very heavy dollar year,'' said James L. Biggane, the Senate's chief fiscal aide. ''There may not be anything beyond that.'' Political leaders and their aides have listed other issues the Legislature may confront this year. But all will be considered against a backdrop of what one lobbyist called ''the post-election budget blues.'' The following are some of the issues: - The Metropolitan Transportation Authority may be abolished or substantially reshaped. After approving a tax surcharge last month to save bus, subway and commuter rail fares, many legislators called for major changes in the management of the mass transit system to make it more accountable. Governor Cuomo has long supported the move for change, and one proposal under discussion would put the M.T.A. under direct control of the State Transportation Department. - Governor Cuomo has also called for changes in the way the Public Service Commission sets utility rates, which have more than tripled since 1975. The Legislature may also intervene to prevent large rate increases on Long Island when the Shoreham nuclear power plant goes into full operation. - New sources of financing will be sought to rebuild the state's infrastructure - its system of roads, bridges and water supply. This could take the form of general obligation bonds, taxes dedicated to road and bridge repair, state appropriations or a new state authority. - With the closing of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, N.Y., and the loss of 7,000 jobs, attention has been focused on job retraining and economic development programs. Financing for joint state-private high technology centers at colleges in the state is planned, and the Assembly has proposed a system of aid to retrain workers who have lost jobs in declining industries. - The death penalty and proposals to ban Medicaid financing of abortions will be back. But Governor Cuomo has pledged to veto death penalty legislation as Governor Carey did before him, and civilliberties groups are predicting that support for these causes has diminished in the new Legislature. - The Legislature is facing a deadline this spring on pension plans for 300,000 state workers. Newly hired state and local government employees contribute to their pensions and receive fewer benefits than older workers under a formula that unions say is unfair. The older workers do not contribute. Government and business groups favor the current system. Last year, with the Legislature unable to solve the dispute, the plan was extended for one year. - To close his own budget deficit and prevent the layoff of 6,600 city workers, Mayor Koch is counting of $300 million in new state aid, including increases in education aid, and the state takeover of Medicaid costs. In addition the Mayor has proposed a ''menu'' of 14 taxes, a combination of which is needed to raise $300 million to close next year's city budget deficit. Most of these will require approval of the State Legislature. - Efforts to restore the J-51 housing program are expected. The program, which provides tax benefits for rehabilitiation projects, expired last year, after a dispute between the city and Democratic Assemblymen over its use in the development of luxury housing. These issues will be considered by a Legislature whose power structure is little changed by the November elections. The Republicans remain firmly in control of the Senate, while the Democrats in the Assembly sharply increased their majority in the 150-seat house to 98 from 88 - the largest Democratic majority since 1913. The biggest change is, of course, in the Governor's office. Legislators are hoping that proposals that had been opposed by Gov. Hugh L. Carey will get new life. These include barring mandatory retirement provisions for all workers and reductions in paper work requirements for small businesses. ''At this point we want to hear what the new Governor has to offer,'' said a spokesman for Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader. But before most other issues are reached, the Legislature must grapple with the budget, which is being hit by what Ralph Laws, the Assembly's chief fiscal aide, called an ''extraordinary set of events.'' The recession has cut into tax revenues, and the state must pay for the current fiscal year's deficit of about $300 million, $485 million in salary increases for state employees and $200 million in increases in education aid approved last year. In addition, a partial takeover of local Medicaid costs, also approved last year, would cost $360 million. The takeover would bring the state's potential deficit to more than $1 billion. Governor Cuomo has been a leading proponent of the state takeover, but has said he is not sure the state can now afford it. Balancing the budget will require either new taxes, cuts in state programs or local aid, or a combination of the three. Governor Cuomo has opposed raising the income, sales, or business taxes, but legislative fiscal aides say he may have little choice. Last year the Legislature overrode a series of vetoes by Governor Carey, and the state's budget was not approved until after the formal dedline had passed. Few legislators expect the April 1 deadline to be met this year. Among other issues the Legislature is expected to face are the following: Criminal Justice Governor Cuomo and key legislators are all talking about improving coordination of the courts, police, the prison system, probation and parole. Under an Assembly plan, a Criminal Justice Agency would be set up to coordinate the budgets and rules of 10 state agencies. The Legislature is also expected to take up several plans to change the sentencing system. Under the plans, judges would be given statewide guidelines for giving criminals a fixed sentence for a particular crime. The Legislature is also expected to grapple with the problem of housing a rapidly growing prison population. The Environment The law requiring a 5-cent deposit on bottles of beer and soda sold in New York State takes effect July 1, and supporters are expecting the industry to put forward proposals to change the law and delay its implementation. Court of Appeals A proposal to change the way candidates for the Court of Appeals are nominated is expected from Governor Cuomo. The proposal would increase the number of nominees a nominating panel can submit to him and would change its voting procedures. Mr. Cuomo is expected to name five new Court of Appeals judges during the next four years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98TH CONGRESS OPENS WITH CALLS FOR BIPARTISAN EFFORT ON ECONOMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/04/us/98th-congress-opens-with-calls-for-bipartisan-effort-on-economy.html,"The 98th Congress opened for business today, and leaders from both parties called for greater bipartisan cooperation to deal with the country's economic problems. ''I will do everything I can to prevent a stalemate from happening in the 98th Congress,'' said Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Massachusetts Democrat who was re-elected Speaker of the House. ''The American people want action, not partisan bickering.'' Republicans said they would extend an ''olive branch'' to the Democrats, and they hinted that President Reagan might also be ready to make compromises on economic matters. ''Contrary to popular belief, the President is flexible,'' said Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader. But the spirit of comity did not last long, as House Democrats pushed through new parliamentary rules designed to tighten party discipline and increase the power of the Speaker. New Rules Denounced Most Republicans and a few Democrats denounced the changes, which were described by Representative Robert J. Lagomarsino, Republican of California, as an attempt ''to run roughshod over the rights of individual members of this body, on both sides of the aisle, whenever they disagree with the views of the leadership.'' The Democrats decided to discipline Representative Phil Gramm, Democrat of Texas, by throwing him off the influential Budget Committee. Many Democrats considered Mr. Gramm a traitor for helping plan President Reagan's budget strategy in the last Congress, and he did not help his party standing today by voting against the rules changes. The only other Democrat to break ranks was Representative Larry P. McDonald of Georgia. The decision on Mr. Gramm was made by the Steering and Policy Committee, a panel of leading House Democrats that decides all committee assignments for the party. The vote was 26 to 4 against the Texas Democrat, who has said he might consider switching parties if the Democrats punished him. The day's events signified how far the Congressional mood has shifted since two years ago, when the 97th Congress opened, riding the crest of Republican triumphs and itching to enact the Reagan economic program of lower taxes, smaller social programs and bigger military buildups. 26 More House Democrats The House members sworn in today included 269 Democrats and 165 Republicans, an increase of 26 Democrats over the 97th Congress. There was one vacancy because John L. Swigert Jr., a Republican from Colorado, died last week before he could be sworn in. The Republicans retained their 54 seats in the Senate, but to many lawmakers the November election registered a vote of no confidence in the President's program, and lawmakers from both parties say they are determined to seek changes in the Government's economic strategy. Congressional leaders attended a White House dinner with President Reagan tonight, and they made it clear today that they were taking the President a grim message as he tries to formulate a budget for the fiscal year 1984, which begins in October. Speaker O'Neill noted that the unemployment rolls had increased by four million since the last Congress took office, and he said in a pointed jab at the Reagan program, ''It is time to stop waiting for an economic theory to work and instead to do what we have done before - stimulate the economy.'' Representative James R. Jones, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said Mr. Reagan should submit a ''real budget'' that does not have an overly optimistic economic forecast. Mr. Jones said he favored ''doing something to rebuild the revenue base,'' and he suggested postponing the new Reagan tax cut that is to go into effect in July. Appropriations Rules Changed The new rules adopted by the House would change the way Congress appropriates money. Now, the process requires two steps, one to authorize expenditures and the other to allocate the money. In the past, lawmakers could attach riders to the allocation bills, and the process has been used recently by conservatives to inhibit school busing and Government-financed abortions. The Democratic-sponsored rules would make it much harder for legislators to attach such riders to the spending measures. Other rules changes would give the Speaker authority to dispense with time-consuming procedural votes. Another would provide that when a lawmaker switches parties, existing committee assignments are automatically lost. The argument behind most of these changes is that current rules slow down the legislative process and give too many opportunities to small groups working for special interests. But even some Democrats who voted for the rules package fear that it will inhibit free expression in the House. ''We're doing away with license for the little guy, the maverick, to make waves,'' said Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California. One suggested change, to make it much more difficult to force a floor vote on a constitutional amendment, was shelved by the Democrats in the face of widespread unhappiness in their own ranks. Last summer supporters of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget forced a floor vote by gathering 218 signatures on a discharge petition. The rejected change would have increased the requirement to 290 votes. The critics of this change pointed out that a discharge petition was used to gain floor consideration of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution in the early 1970's. Coincidentally, that amendment was re-introduced in the House today by a majority of the members. The amendment, which would ban discrimination based on sex, was ratified by 35 states, but when time ran out last spring, it was three states short of the number needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SURVEY FINDS HISPANIC CATHOLICS FOLLOW OWN RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/06/nyregion/survey-finds-hispanic-catholics-follow-own-rules.html,"Hispanic people in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York strongly profess central Christian beliefs and at the same time engage in religious practices that often differ markedly from the habits and customs of previous waves of Catholic immigrants, according to a study released yesterday by the archdiocese. The archdiocese is increasingly populated by Catholics with their own concept of religious involvement that is deeply personal, highly committed to the central beliefs of Catholic theology but largely unaccustomed to attending mass and following regulations laid down by the Vatican, the study shows. The survey of religious attitudes of Hispanic residents shows a pattern of spiritual observance among Spanish-speaking people that is far less rooted in formal activities in the church and more infused with folk religion than that of Catholics whose ethnic origins are European. Some Appeared Confused The overwhelming majority of those surveyed, about 85 percent, said they were Catholic; about 9.3 percent said they were Protestant. Some appeared to be somewhat confused about their religious identity. Ruth Doyle, director of the study, called it the ''first empirical examination of the contemporary religious experiences of the Hispanic community.'' She said the purpose of the study was to ''better serve the needs of the Hispanic community and to recognize the contributions that Hispanics have made.'' Members of the survey committee said the findings presented a challenge to the wider church to accept forms of Catholic practice and piety that have been largely unfamiliar to those raised in a North American Catholic setting that emphasized rites and parish life. Among the goals, church planners said, was to find a means to better grasp the value distinct spiritual traditions brought to this country by Hispanic people. A lack of awareness of certain key aspects of Catholicism was evident in several of the findings. Two-thirds of the Catholic respondents could not name a single sacrament and the same proportion had never heard of the Second Vatican Council. The overwhelming number had been baptized, but in a manner that stressed family and folk custom more than church ritual. How Marriage Is Regarded Likewise, the sacrament of marriage was seen by a large majority as a human ceremony rather than a church rite. Greater awareness has been found in recent polls of other Catholics. At the same time, the respondents showed overwhelming faith in such central dogma as the existence of a loving God, belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Resurrection. Elements of folk religion such as festivals, wearing medals, burning incense and setting up altars in the home were shown to blend with more formal aspects of churchgoing. Results Seen as 'a Blessing' The Rev. Raul del Valle, chairman of the steering committee that helped design the project, said the results were ''a blessing for the church and a tremendous challenge.'' The most positive sign, Father del Valle said, is that Hispanic people are ''holding on to the faith'' and making a contribution to a richer mixture in the church. On the morality of abortion, the findings varied widely according to the respondents' experience in the United States. Thirty-seven percent of those born in this country said abortion was wrong, while 67 percent of those who had arrived here after the age of 8 said so. Most Spanish-speaking people in the archdiocese trace their origins to the Caribbean region. The distinction between them and other American Catholics becomes clear at many points in the survey. Figures on churchgoing provide one measure of difference. The new study found that 31 percent of Hispanic Catholics attended mass weekly. A recent Gallup study showed a weekly churchgoing rate of 53 percent by Catholics nationally. Hourlong Interviews Held The 1980 census showed that 850,000 Hispanic people lived in the archdiocese, which comprises Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County and six upstate counties. In 1970, the total was 700,000. Hispanic residents now make up 35 percent of Catholics in the archdiocese, and officials estimate that the figure will climb to 40 percent by 1990. Half live in the Bronx. Terence Cardinal Cooke, seeking more knowledge about the beliefs and practices of Hispanic people, gave approval in 1979 for the survey. Over a 12-month period, starting in June 1981, the Office of Pastoral Research conducted hourlong interviews in person with 1,000 Hispanic people from scientifically selected samples. The Rev. Joseph P. Fitzpatrick, a Jesuit professor of anthropology at Fordham University who worked on the study, said the results posed an opportunity for the archdiocese. ''Hispanics may not always feel it's necessary to be present at the Sunday mass,'' Father Fitzpatrick said, ''but they still believe firmly in the basically principles of the faith. This presents a great deal of hope if we can respond in terms of the pastoral care they need.''

THE DEMOCRATS GET EVEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/09/weekinreview/the-democrats-get-even.html,"WASHINGTON WHEN the 98th Congress opened its doors last week, Representative Doug Barnard Jr., a four-term Democrat from Georgia, bid for a seat on the prestigious House Appropriations Committee. Mr. Barnard had a good case, since the slot had been held by a fellow Georgian. It went instead to Representative Bill Boner, a moderate from Tennessee. That small decision told a lot about the new tenor on Capitol Hill. Mr. Barnard is a pure-bred ''boll weevil,'' one of the two-dozen conservative Democrats who often provided President Reagan with his margins of victory. With 26 more Democrats in the House, that leverage is gone. The Democratic leadership lost no time in demonstrating it. Once the lawmakers were sworn in, a series of rules changes were swiftly propounded to speed up the legislative process and reduce the ability of the minority to hinder the majority. The rules gave the Speaker greater authority to waive certain procedural votes, and made it much more difficult for members to offer amendments to appropriations bills, once only used to set spending levels. In recent years conservatives have attached amendments pursuing causes from bans on federally financed abortions to prohibitions against school busing. Supporters of the new rules argued that they promoted efficiency while thwarting the guerrilla tactics of the right wing. But many Republicans, and a few Democrats, denounced them as a hypocritical attempt to ''run roughshod over the rights of individual members.'' After all, the critics maintained, antiwar legislators had once used riders on appropriations bills to bar funding for the Vietnam war. (The tactics of die-hard conservatives also provoked a reaction in the Senate, where leaders announced formation of a bipartisan panel to recommend changes in the filibuster rules to prevent a small band of dissenters from tying up the chamber.) The House leadership's influence was further enhanced by organizational efforts. Representative Phil Gramm of Texas, the most ornery of the boll weevils, was ousted from the Budget Committee; he promptly announced that he was resigning his House seat and running again as a Republican. Other boll weevils suffered lesser chastisements. John B. Breaux of Louisiana failed to win a spot on the Budget Committee and Roy Dyson of Maryland, on the Appropriations Committee. G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery of Mississippi was re-elected chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, but lost 53 votes in the party caucus. The vote, he said, was a way for his colleagues to ''let their frustrations.'' But conservatives, he conceded, would likely be more cooperative with their party leaders in this Congress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Birth Control Rule Near,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/11/us/new-birth-control-rule-near.html,"Richard S. Schweiker, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, today recommended a rule requiring family planning clinics supported by Federal money to notify parents of minors who receive birth control pills, diaphragms or intrauterine devices. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, saying the new rule would threaten the health and well-being of teen-agers and their families, immediately moved in Federal District Court to block implementation of the rule on the grounds that it violated family planning statutes and the U.S. Constitution's guarantee against invasion of privacy. The still must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Schweiker said in a statement, ''This Department has a deep responsibility to protect the health and safety of minor adolescents who are given prescription birth control drugs and devices paid for with taxpayer dollars.'' He cited the 1981 budget act in which Congress encouraged parental participation in a teen-ager's use of family planning services which receive Federal funds. However, critics said the rule would not promote parent-child discussion about sex. ''These regulations are not going to strengthen family communication; they are going to endanger the health and safety of thousands of young people,'' said the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. ''We are afraid that the minor will simply proceed to have sex without protection and the result would be unwanted pregnancies leading to abortion or out-of-wedlock pregnancies that the minor would not be able to handle,'' said Eve Paul, Planned Parenthood's vice president for legal affairs.. Under the proposed rules, family planning agencies would be required to notify a parent or guardian within 10 days after a minor receives a prescription contraceptive or device. Clinics would advise minors of the notificaton requirement prior to providing the service. Notification would have to be made through certified mail or in some other form that could be documented. It has been estimated that about 668,000 teen-agers visit family planning clinics each year, The Department said more than 120,000 public comments were received since the rule was first published in the Federal Register last Feb. 22. The rule will become final 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCHWEIKER RESIGNS POST IN CABINET TO JOIN AN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/12/us/schweiker-resigns-post-in-cabinet-to-join-an-insurance-association.html,"Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S. Schweiker has resigned to take a job with the American Council on Life Insurance, an industry trade association, the White House announced tonight. Formal letters of resignation from Mr. Schweiker and acceptance by Mr. Reagan are to be made public Wednesday, a White House official said. White House officials said they would have no comment on the resignation, which took several of them by surprise. But theysaid Mr. Schweiker had not left for policy reasons. Reagan Told 10 Days Ago A White House official said Mr. Schweiker informed Mr. Reagan about 10 days ago of his desire to take the lucrative job as president of the life insurance association. The resignation from the Cabinet was the fourth in the Reagan Administration and the second in a month. Alexander M. Haig Jr. resigned as Secretary of State last June, Energy Secretary James B. Edwards resigned in November, and Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis resigned in late December. Last week, Mr. Reagan selected Elizabeth H. Dole, a White House assistant for liaison to constituent groups, to replace Mr. Lewis. Like Mr. Lewis, Mr. Schweiker is a Republican moderate from Pennsylvania. Mr. Reagan could therefore be under some pressure to replace him with someone from the Northeast and from the moderate wing of the party, perhaps a woman. Speculation on Mr. Schweiker's successor immediately focused on Margaret M. Heckler, a former Republican Congresswoman from Massachusetts, who was defeated for re-election in November. Mrs. Heckler, like Mr. Schweiker, opposes abortion, a policy issue of concern to the department. Mrs. Heckler, who declined through an intermediary to talk with a reporter, was described by her aides as interested in the Cabinet post. At the same time, there was a possibility that her nomination could face opposition from the conservative elements in the Republican Party. She generally voted with the Reagan Administration, but under challenge from a liberal Democrat, Barney Frank, during the election campaign, she sometimes voted against the Administration, on budget matters, for example. Mr. Schweiker's resignation comes after a series of battles over programs with the Office of Management and Budget, which had proposed to make further deep slashes in department programs. White House aides have been saying that Mr. Schweiker won most of those battles and was able to win approval to restore most of the proposed cuts. ''He did very well in the appeals process and was able to head off most of the cutbacks,'' a White House official said. An Administration official said, for example, that David A. Stockman, the budget director, had agreed to Mr. Schweiker's request not to try for the third year in a row to eliminate a key nutrition program for pregnant mothers and infant children. Nevertheless, Mr. Schweiker departs at a time of certain confrontations in Congress over programs in his area. Administration officials have observed that he has had less than complete control over the President's position in these areas. Proposed revisions of the Social Security system, for example, were taken from Mr. Schweiker's jurisdiction after proposals he made in 1981 were rejected in Congress. Similarly, a task force under White House control has been working on proposals to contain the cost of health care and has recommended that Mr. Reagan seek to impose an income tax on employee health insurance benefits. Mr. Schweiker's resignation came as a surprise to key Senators as well as to members of his own staff. Dr. Robert J. Rubin, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for planning and evaluation, said he was shocked to learn of the resignation. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, said he had received ''no hint'' that Mr. Schweiker was about to resign. He said he would be upset if Mr. Schweiker did leave because he had been a ''splendid Secretary.'' Mr. Schweiker, a former Senator from Pennsylvania, was considered a Reagan loyalist by many White House officials. In 1976, when Mr. Reagan was challenging President Gerald R. Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, he surprised politicians by announcing that Senator Schweiker was his choice for Vice President. Mr. Schweiker, a Republican moderate who had been supporting Mr. Ford, then switched his allegiance to Mr. Reagan. After Mr. Reagan's election in 1980, Mr. Schweiker became an immediate favorite to join the new Cabinet. As Secretary, he ran the biggest agency in the Federal Government, with a budget of nearly $300 billion this year. The largest component is Social Security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN CHOOSES EX-REP HECKLER TO BE THE NEW SECRETARY OF HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/13/us/reagan-chooses-ex-rep-heckler-to-be-the-new-secretary-of-health.html,"President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Margaret M. Heckler, a former Representative from Massachusetts, to succeed Richard S. Schweiker as Secretary of Health and Human Services. If confirmed by the Senate, Mrs. Heckler would head the largest Cabinet department, which spent more than $275 billion last year. In her bid for re-election last fall in a reapportioned district, Mrs. Heckler was defeated by a Democratic incumbent, Representative Barney Frank, who portrayed the election as a referendum on President Reagan's economic and military policies. Mr. Reagan also announced today his intention to nominate John A. Svahn, the Commissioner of Social Security, to be Under Secretary of Health and Human Services. Mr. Svahn, who is 39 years old, served as director of the California Department of Social Welfare when Mr. Reagan was Governor in the early 1970's. If confirmed as Under Secretary, Mr. Svahn would succeed David B. Swoap, who returned to California this month to join the Cabinet of the state's new Republican Governor, George Deukmejian. Second Woman for Cabinet Mrs. Heckler, 51, is the second woman named to President Reagan's Cabinet in a week. He chose Elizabeth H. Dole, a White House assistant for liaison to special interest groups, as Secretary of Transportation, replacing In Congress, Mrs. Heckler, a moderate Republican, supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, Government programs for Vietnam veterans and Federal day care subsidies for working parents. But she disagreed with many women's groups on the abortion issue, voting against using Federal money to pay for abortions. For that reason, the National Women's Political Caucus supported Mrs. Heckler's Democratic opponents in 1980 and 1982 even though she helped found the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues in 1978. After serving in the House for 16 years, she had more seniority than any other woman in Congress. In an exchange of letters and in a brief ceremony in the East Room of the White House today, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Schweiker praised each other, as Presidents and departing Cabinet officers often do. In the letter accepting his resignation, Mr. Reagan said, ''More than anyone else, you have been responsible for honoring my firm commitment that society's safety net be maintained, so that Americans who require our help in times of need will receive it.'' The President said Mr. Schweiker, the fourth member of his Cabinet to resign, had performed with ''unexcelled competence and compassion.'' Mr. Schweiker, who served in Congress for 20 years, is leaving the Government to become president of the American Council of Life Insurance, the trade and lobbying organization for 572 life insurance companies. The council is involved in a wide range of tax and pension issues pending in Congress, state legislatures and Federal and state regulatory agencies. At a news conference, Mr. Schweiker said he was not leaving because of dissatisfaction or disagreements with the Administration. Referring to his job offer from the life insurance industry, he said, ''This was a very rewarding, unique opportunity that probably will not occur again.'' Mr. Schweiker had apparently been given a secondary role in deliberations on Social Security and the budget for his department next year, but he denied that he had been excluded from the ''inner circles'' at the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. In terms of politics and dollars, the biggest issues that will face the new Secretary are Social Security and Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly. , He will have to defend President Reagan's budget proposals in Congressional hearings. At the news conference today, Mr. Schweiker was repeatedly asked about the ethics of leaving his present job to work for the life insurance industry, which is heavily involved in writing health insurance. As Secretary, Mr. Schweiker was responsible for Medicare, the nation's largest health insurance program. Mr. Schweiker portrayed the health and life insurance industries as separate entities, saying, ''Health policies are none of the life insurance industry's business.'' Provide Much Health Insurance In fact, ''a large share of private health insurance for Americans is provided by life insurance companies,'' according to a reference book published by the American Council of Life Insurance. In 1981 life insurance companies received $31.8 billion, or 29.5 percent of their premium receipts, from health insurance, and most of the big life insurance companies offer health insurance too, according to a council spokesman. Organizations concerned with national health policy expressed reservations about the abrupt shift at top levels of the Reagan Administration. The American Medical Association said major groups involved in the delivery of health care should have been consulted. The association, in a statement, said its officers were ''surprised and deeply disappointed at the process,'' but eager to know Mrs. Heckler's views on health care. Dr. Anthony Robbins, president of the American Public Health Association, which includes many state and local health officials, said: ''It's hard to believe the change could come at a worse time. It takes a new Secretary a long time to decide which programs she wants to defend. This will provide an opportunity for the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to get the upper hand.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUSAN SARANDON'S ROUGHEST ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/theater/susan-sarandon-s-roughest-role.html,"At about 4 o'clock most weekday afternoons, Susan Sarandon starts feeling a little sick to her stomach. Curtain time is just four hours away for a drama in which she plays what she considers to be her most difficult role to date. She portrays a woman assaulted in her home by a would-be rapist in William Mastrosimone's ''Extremities'' at the Westside Arts Center on West 43d Street, a performance that has brought her critical praise. Miss Sarandon - who got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the 1981 film ''Atlantic City'' and acclaim for ''A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking'' Off Broadway two seasons ago - overpowers her assailant in ''Extremities'' by spraying insect repellent in his eyes. She ties him up and imprisons him in a fireplace. One reason the part is difficult is physical. She is battered during the assault scene - nightly from Tuesdays to Fridays and twice a day on weekends - and bears bruises. One finger is in a splint for a chipped bone. ''I have problems with my neck and my back,'' she said. ''I've had bloody noses and just got over a black eye.'' Other reasons have to do with the portrayal. ''You feel vulnerable,'' she said. ''And you have to reveal a dark side of your nature, which is not a pleasant sensation.'' Enraged and terrified that her captive assailant will go unpunished - since he did not actually rape her - and that he will return to maim or kill her, the character, Marjorie, decides at one point to kill him, defying two roommates who try to dissuade her. Association With Greek Tragedy The character, Marjorie, is, in effect, the plot, Miss Sarandon said. ''She hasn't much personality and no sense of humor. She's relentless. And to orchestrate the rage is difficult. I don't think most people would admit you can feel that much hatred. This play is like Greek tragedy, in which people felt these enormous emotions and acted on them. '' 'Extremities' is a metaphor about the animal in you,'' she continued. ''And it's about power. Not sex -that's not what rape is about; it's the rage a rapist feels and the power he is exercising. She's learning from him about power. The play is about the contagion of violence.'' Sipping a vodkaless Bloody Mary and looking refreshed after washing off the mud that is smeared on her hands and feet during much of the performance, the actress said the play's intensity carried her along. But there is one point at which she sometimes evokes her own life to inspire needed emotion. The actress, who was the oldest of nine children, pictures a knife that she finds concealed on the man as being used against one of her sisters. ''It's easier to imagine getting angry about someone else, someone you love,'' she said. Auditioned by Accident Born in New York and raised in New Jersey, Miss Sarandon became an actress almost by accident. She majored in drama at the Catholic University of America in Washington, but it was an academic pursuit; she minored in philosophy and English, as well as military strategy - ''I guess to balance the philosophy'' - and graduated in 1969. Her stage career began when her husband, Chris Sarandon, whom she married while in college - they were divorced in 1979 - asked her to play a scene with him in an audition for an agent. The agent then asked to represent both of them. After summer stock in Washington in 1970, she moved to New York and five days later was offered a part as a troubled teen-ager in the film ''Joe.'' Roles came quickly afterward and have not let up. She was in a television soap opera, ''A World Apart,'' which she said taught her technique, the way ''B'' movies have taught other actors. She also worked on films, including ''Lady Liberty'' (1972) with Sophia Loren; ''The Front Page'' (1974) with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and ''The Great Waldo Pepper'' (1975) with Robert Redford, In 1976 she appeared in ''The Last of the Cowboys'' with Henry Fonda, which she also co-produced, and the cult movie ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' for which she had to learn to sing. ''I had never even hummed out loud,'' she recalled. ''I was terrified.'' And so the role qualified as the kind she seeks. ''Since I'm basically lazy,'' she said, ''I try for parts that frighten me or seem impossible. So to survive, I will have to learn something and overcome it. It's like singing at an audition; you can belt a song all right, but if you try for a ballad, your voice shakes constantly.'' Even Miscasting May Help The challenge of the film ''Pretty Baby'' (1978) she said, was acting the part of a mother, to Brooke Shields. The challenge of ''King of the Gypsies'' in the same year, she mused, was being miscast. ''I was too small, too young and too white bread for the part,'' she said. She was seen most recently in Paul Mazursky's ''Tempest'' (1982), for which she received the best-actress award at the Venice Film Festival. And she recently completed ''The Hunger'' with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie, and ''The Buddy Stystem,'' with Richard Dreyfuss and Jean Stapleton. Miss Sarandon has spoken out on a number of issues: in favor of nuclear disarmament and the equal rights amendment and for First Amendment and abortion rights. But, she said, ''I wouldn't consider myself political. I'm only active in things that affect me. I'm just a frightened person who wants to live in a free country.'' Acting and living, which she says are inseparable, have taught her compassion. ''You realize that, given certain circumstances, you can do or feel things you thought you were not capable of,'' she said. ''And you become less quickly judgmental of other people. That's something you probably don't get in a lot of other professions.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION: THE COURT WAS RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/opinion/abortion-the-court-was-right.html,"The 10th anniversary of the United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, on Jan. 22, arrives with the prospect of more years of turmoil. The drive to overthrow the decision has become a major social issue of our time. The struggle has hamstrung Congress, disrupting its legislative schedule and exhausting its energies. Although the Roman Catholic hierarcy, the Moral Majority and other groups achieved nothing in the last Congress, having diluted their campaign by backing different bills to outlaw abortion, the danger remains that all opponents will unite against their common target. They probably would favor Senator Orrin Hatch's proposed Human Life Federalism Amendment. Giving each state and Congress concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion, it sounds innocuously like a states' rights measure, but it could gut the 1973 decision. Another choice is a revision of Jesse Helms's bill putting sweeping restrictions on Federal funding of abortion. A further danger is the rise of fanaticism that may push antiabortion campaigning into violence. New Right extremists have become desperate. Abortion clinics have been burned down or damaged in the last year. A doctor and his wife, directors of an Illinois clinic, were kidnapped for more than a week last August. To protect church-state separation, the Internal Revenue Code bars religious institutions from spending tax-exempt money to support or attack political candidates. Still, as the Abortion Rights Mobilization and other plaintiffs allege in a case before the Federal district court in New York, the Roman Catholic hierarchy has openly flouted the law in a number of states for several years and up through the November elections. For example, admitting that the Internal Revenue Service had warned tax-exempt religious newspapers to obey the tax code, Today's Catholic, organ of the San Antonio, Tex., archdiocese, still attacked Presidential, Senate and House candidates in 1980 with an editorial headlined: ''To the IRS - NUTS!!!'' When the anti-abortion drive was the cutting edge of right-wing strategy two years ago, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority's leader, predicted that the 97th Congress would quickly pass a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. Many believed him. Opposition to abortion bound the Catholic, Fundamentalist and Mormon right wings, and all conservatives, into a common front. But even with the threat of a unified anti-abortion drive in the new Congress, the New Right has lost glamor. No amendment or bill to outlaw abortion passed the Senate last fall. Of 19 senators who were up for re-election and who voted against Mr. Hatch's anti-abortion amendment and were leading ''hit-list'' targets, only one was defeated. When the National Abortion Rights Action League put money and forces behind controversial candidates last November, 71 percent were elected in the House, 66 percent in the Senate. The decline in anti-abortion strength can be measured best in Suffolk County, New York, long a right-wing bastion. The combined Conservative and Right-to-Life Parties -both oppose abortion - reached their peak there in 1979 when the county treasurer won 35,567 votes. While Lewis E. Lehrman ran a close gubernatorial race in 1982, his Conservative vote, combined with the Right-to-Life Party's candidate, dropped to 30,081 in Suffolk. In fact, the Right-to-Life Party drew only 7,275 votes for governor there and only 54,512 in the state out of 5,124,745 cast. Consequently, abortion rights forces have the added burden of complacency. With veterans dropping out, a key problem is to recruit youths, who have only a dim memory of pre-legal, ''kitchen-table'' abortion. Broader constituencies have to be converted to militancy on the model of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights. The American Medical Association and American Bar Association, as a result of increased activism, are involving more men. Abortion rights can no longer be considered mainly a female responsibility. If the drive to overthrow legal abortion is to be decisively blocked, members of Congress must be convinced that hard-core antiabortionists no longer threaten their re-election. When the Rightto-Life Party in arch-conservative Suffolk can draw only 4 percent or less in most districts, even right-wing members of Congress must realize that the effective answer is to make every child a wanted child through family planning rather than through fanatical attacks on the Supreme Court's abortion decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A DECISION NEEDING UNDOING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/opinion/a-decision-needing-undoing.html,"A decade after the United States Supreme Court tried to settle the abortion issue, it is plainly evident that it did not. The Court failed politically. It failed socially. It failed legally. And it failed medically. Because of these failures, the American rightto-life movement remains alive and determined. The landmark abortion ruling, in Roe v. Wade, failed politically because it was extreme. With it, the Court struck down the abortion laws of all 50 states. Before Roe, those few states that permitted elective abortions at all allowed them only early in pregnancy. After Roe, each was required to permit abortion on demand through the second trimester of pregnancy. Roe requires states to allow an abortion, even after the point at which the fetus becomes viable outside the womb, when the mother's life or health would be endangered by a live birth. In a companion case, Doe v. Bolton, the Court defined health so broadly as to include threats to emotional well-being. Such a sweeping frustration of the legislatively expressed will of the people of every state was bound to produce a fierce political reaction, and did. Though many observers expected it to be almost wholly impotent by now, the right-to-life movement's Washington lobby remains an uncommonly significant influence on the Congress. Indeed, last March it produced a majority vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee to reverse Roe v. Wade by means of a constitutional amendment. The decision failed socially because it struck at the heart of society's traditional reverence for the sanctity of all human life. By declaring that the unborn child is not a constitutional person, the Court divorced the concept of personhood from that of humanness. In spite of the decree, many Americans passionately continue to hold that all humans, regardless of the stage of their biological development, are persons who have the most basic right to live. These ''right-to-lifers'' are a sociological phenomenon because they constitute a rare social activist group - one that does not have its own self-interest at stake. Roe is a legal failure because it engendered the nearly universal scorn of constitutional law scholars from across the ideological spectrum. Solicitor General Rex Lee was charitable recently when he told the Court in a brief that the Roe right to an abortion was constructed on a foundation of constitutional shadows. There is no support whatever for the notion that the framers of the 14th Amendment even remotely considered abortion, much less intended to guarantee access to it, yet that part of the Constitution is where the Court claimed that the right to abort is grounded. What the Court, in its 7-2 decision, did was to impose a model abortion statute formulated on the basis of the social, economic and political views of seven men. But the Court is not a legislature. When it acted as if it were, it committed an abuse of power that undermined its integrity and its standing as a democratic institution. The Court's medical failure lies in its putting the medical profession at war with itself. At a time when the development of fetal monitoring and intrauterine treatment techniques are enabling doctors to consider the fetus a patient, others in the profession work to perfect abortion methods so that no unwanted child will emerge alive. Whether the doctor will heal or kill the unborn child in a given case is solely the mother's choice, which reduces the physician to a mere technician. Perhaps more ominous, Roe v. Wade gave rise to the ''wrongful life'' theory of legal action, which is enjoying increased acceptance in Federal and state courts. This development gives the parents of a handicapped child the right to sue the doctor who attended the pregnancy when they can show that he should have discovered the defect so that an abortion could have been obtained. The resulting pressures on physicians encourage infanticide as doctors seek to avoid potential financial liability for children whom they ''negligently'' caused to be born alive. The Declaration of Independence holds that the right to life is the inalienable right of every human being. Ten years after the Supreme Court alienated just that right of the youngest of Americans, it ought to seize the opportunity presented by the three abortion cases now on its docket to admit the fundamental failures of Roe v. Wade, and restore the rights of personhood to the full scope of humanity. Until that is done, the right-to-life movement will not be silent and will not die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABORTION RULING: 10 YEARS OF BITTER CONFLICT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/style/abortion-ruling-10-years-of-bitter-conflict.html,"Ten years ago next Saturday the United States Supreme Court ruled that the decision to perform an abortion would be a private matter of concern only to the woman and her physician and that only in the later stages of pregnancy was the state entitled to any voice in the matter. With that decision, abortion became a constitutionally guaranteed right, but the furor long generated by the issue has hardly been subdued and the national schism it has caused remains as wide as ever. That the dispute would continue was not the widely held view at the time. As Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York, recalled: ''Most us of really believed that was the end of the controversy. The Supreme Court had spoken, and while some disagreement would remain, the issue had been tried, tested and laid to rest.'' An Ever-Widening Schism With its landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court set in motion tumultuous, often painful conflict that has divided political leaders, scholars, scientists, theologians and ordinary citizens. Today those camps are, if anything, larger, more vocal and more politically sophisticated than they were a decade ago. Opponents of the right to abortion, members of the so-called rightto-life or prolife movement, are bent on overturning Roe v. Wade, preferably by a constitutional amendment that would codify the concept that the fetus, from the moment of conception, is a full human being entitled to constitutional protections. Supporters of legalized abortion, who call themselves prochoice, are equally committed to preserving what they regard as the legal right of a woman to control her reproductive life and to the belief that government intervention violates a woman's constitutional right of privacy. The abolition of abortion, they say, would impose one religious view - that the fetus is a human being - on all. Battle on Many Fronts The battle has been waged on many fronts: from the doorstep of the local abortion clinic, where opponents try to send patients home and even on occasion engage in violence, to local and state legislatures, Congress and the courts. The issue has been a driving force in politics, and candidates for public office are often judged by the stand they take. For most of the 1970's the strategy of the opponents of abortion rights was not to tackle the principle itself but to seek to curtail access either through regulatory restrictions or through limitations on governmental funds. Despite numerous legislative efforts, only one, the so-called Hyde Amendment, which permits states to refuse to fund Medicaid abortions, made a significant dent. The measure, named for its author, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, was struck down by a Federal district judge in Brooklyn and then upheld by the United States Supreme Court by a vote of 5 of 4. Although indigent women were, in effect, excluded from governmentally funded abortions, those who favor choice on the issue do not consider the measure as devastating as they had expected. William W. Hamilton, director and chief lobbyist in the Washington office of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, explained, ''Fifteen states plus the District of Columbia have continued to pay for Medicaid abortions, and those states account for 75 to 85 per cent of all abortions.'' However, the antiabortion movement gained considerable strength in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan, an avowed foe of abortion, to the Presidency and the defeat of several leading senators who were supporters of abortion rights, along with the resurgence of conservatives, as exemplified by the rise of the New Right movement. Human Life Amendment Last year a so-called human life amendment and a human life statute, both declaring that life begins at the moment of conception and is entitled to constitutional protection, attracted significant interest in Congress. The statute got out of a subcomittee but faltered after that, so its sponsor, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, standard-bearer of the movement, rewrote it and got it onto the Senate floor. A lengthy filibuster ensued before the matter was tabled by a vote of 47 to 46. Another measure given serious consideration, a so-called human life federalism bill, was introduced by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and another leader of the antiabortion forces. It provided that both Congress and the states were entitled to pass laws limiting or prohibiting abortion, with the more restrictive to prevail. That proposal was withdrawn with a promise that it be reintroduced for floor debate during the next Congressional session. 'Scientific Evidence' Cited Another bill has already been introduced. Sponsored by Representative Hyde and called the respect human life bill, it declares, among other things, that ''scientific evidence demonstrates the life of each human being begins at conception.'' If passed, it would give permanence to the Hyde Amendment, which has been attached to annual appropriations bills and would also allow challenges to certain proabortion measures to go directly to the Supreme Court. Experts who have been following the controversy expect that the spotlight will be on the Supreme Court rather than Congress. The court will render decisions in the spring on cases involving laws passed in Virginia, Missouri and Akron, Ohio, that involve such restrictions as requiring parental consent for minors, confining second-trimester abortions to hospitals, imposing a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, and requiring definitions by physicians of the fetus as a human life along with descriptions of its anatomy and ability to feel sensation. Although none of these or other provisions would abolish abortion or even strike at its legal essence, they are considered important because they will set the tone for further action. If the court upholds them, according to Judy Goldsmith, president of the National Organization for Women, ''we will see a spate of attempts to introduce restrictions all over the country.'' And if it does not ''we will see more activity in the Congress,'' said John P. Mackey, Washington representative of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life. ''Access questions are very significant,'' said Nanette Falkenberg, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. ''If you have to drive 500 miles to get to a clinic, if you have to go through a picket line when you arrive, if you hear a doctor say that what you are about to do is killing someone and if then you must go home for a 24-hour waiting period, that is simply an unfair emotional burden.'' In her view, ''they are trying to take out from the back door what they can't get out the front.'' As the scenario shifts back and forth from the legislative to the judicial forum, it is clear that neither side will bend to compromise. As Jeannie I. Rosoff, president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the educational and research organization concerned with family-planning and population issues, said: ''You could put both sides in one room for 50 years and no one would change positions. We operate from totally different views of the world, views that are more complex that abortion itself, involving a philosophy of life, one's approach to God and religion.''. Indeed, new philosophical questions are being attached to the controversy, especially by opponents of abortion -principally contentions that permitting abortion has opened the door to infanticide, in the form of withholding treatment from defective babies, and that euthanasia will inevitably follow. ''We're creating new categories of wanted and unwanted life,'' said Richard Doerflinger, legislative assistant for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities. The conference recently took a strong stand against the use of nuclear weapons. ''How can we say it is wrong to target and kill masses of innocent civilians to solve our defense problems and not take the same view of abortion?'' Mr. Doerflinger asked. To those who believe that women should have a choice on the matter, such reasoning is specious and muddies the waters of debate. ''The law must make what can appear to be arbitrary distinctions, and the most fundamental of categories the law has chosen to observe is the difference made by the fact of birth,'' said Harriet Pilpel, who has served as counsel to the city, national and international organizations of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. ''Birth is the significant factor in terms of defining the human being. If birth is not a meaningful distinction warranting differential treatment before and after it occurs, then almsot every other category created by the law would be subject to objection.'' How the debate has touched American beliefs and attitudes remains to be seen, though it clearly continues to inflame the passions of those who believe in the righteousness of their cause. Though most polls indicate that a large majority of the population firmly favor rentention of legalized abortion, some critics of Roe v. Wade say the findings have not been properly interpreted. Question of 'Hard Cases' Citing an overview of a number of polls, Dr. J.C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said: ''About 25 percent of the people are solidly prolife and another 25 percent are comfortable with abortion. Of the 50 percent in the middle, many may approve of it for hard cases, such a rape and incest or fetal handicap but diapprove of it for social reasons, such as poverty or unwed motherhood.'' Dr. Daniel Callahan, director of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, a research organization that is conducting an analysis of the ways supporters and opponents relate abortion to other values, said: ''For the activists on both side this is a permanent cause. But they are a minority in terms of intensity on the issue. Most Americans fall into the ambivalent middle category, sufficiently uncertain about the moral issues to be willing to take either side. Most people still won't go in one direction.'' And that is more or less what the Government has done so far, he said. ''It has taken the position that it will not abolish abortions, but neither will it pay for them,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A BACKDOOR ASSAULT ON FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/opinion/l-a-backdoor-assault-on-family-planning-164457.html,"To the Editor: Thank you for your editorial (Dec. 19) about the guidelines proposed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding family-planning clinics that also provide abortion services. he Reagan Administration is attempting to achieve through these guidelines what it cannot achieve through Congressional action or the rule-making process. Frustrated in its attempts to gut the nation's family-planning program and to restrict a woman's right to abortion, it is using this avenue to continue its attacks on the rights of women to make decisions about their childbearing. The great tragedy is that it is the poor and defenseless who will suffer the most. By requiring separate facilities, staffs, supplies and equipment, the guidelines will make family-planning and abortion services less accessible to those who need them most. The guidelines are part of an organized effort to make a constitutionally protected right semi-criminal. Since they are only now being circulated, in draft form, within the Health and Human Services Department, we are hopeful that the Administration will reconsider its intention to issue those guidelines.

INFANT MORTALITY IN CITY DECLINES TO A RECORD LOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/nyregion/infant-mortality-in-city-declines-to-a-record-low.html,"The rate of infant deaths in New York City dropped in 1982 to a record low, the Health Department said yesterday. It was the ninth consecutive year that the rate dropped. The department also said that heart diseases and cancer remained the leading causes of death for people of all ages, accounting for more than two-thirds of all fatalities. While the death rate for infants of 15.3 for every 1,000 live births is above the national average of 11.4, it is considerably below the city rate of 10 years ago. The rate then was 27.3. In a statement, Health Commissioner Dr. David J. Sencer said, ''During the past two decades we have seen major improvements in obstetric technology, delivery procedures and hospital care of newborns.'' Better Health Care Credited Sol Blumenthal, the department's director of biostatistics, said the city's rate was above the national average because of the high numbers of poor people here. Given that, he interpreted the latest decline in the rate as evidence that better medical care was reaching poor families. Among the vital statistics compiled by the Health Department on infants and released yesterday were these: - There were 111,667 live births in New York City last year, an increase from 1981, when there were 108,547. The birth rate of 15.8 per 1,000 population represented the fourth consecutive gain in this category. - There were 1,708 infant deaths, an increase from 1,678 in 1981. The death rate, however, dropped to 15.3 from 15.5. - In 1981, the latest year for these figures, the infant death rates were 19.6 among blacks and 12.7 among whites. - There were 96,993 reported abortions among city residents, an increase over the previous year's total of 92,037. One-fifth of the abortions were performed on teen-agers. 33,252 Heart-Disease Deaths The department said there were 72,621 overall deaths last year, a drop from 73,329 in 1981. The death rate per 1,000 population also declined slightly, to 10.3 from 10.4. Heart diseases accounted for 45.8 percent of all deaths and cancer for 21.4 percent. Following these were strokes and other cerebrovascular diseases (4.5 percent), influenza and pneumonia (3.3), murders (2.6), cirrhosis of the liver (2.6), diabetes (2.0), automobile and other accidents (1.9). Heart diseases were responsible for 33,252 deaths in 1982. In 1981, the total was 32,721. The number of cancer deaths last year, 15,535, was below the figure for the previous year, 16,147. Infant mortality has declined enormously since the beginning of the century, when an average of 13,520 infants less than one year old died annually - nearly one for every 10 live births. The death rate from cancer last year, 219.7 per 100,000 people, was the lowest cancer death rate since the 1950's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A LEGISLATIVE BATTLE IN PENNSYLVANIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/style/a-legislative-battle-in-pennsylvania.html,"The legislative battle on abortion crosses national, state and local lines. What has happened to a piece of legislation in Pennsylvania basically typifies how the dispute over abortion is waged both by those who favor freedom of choice in the matter and by those who advocate what they term the right to life. The sequence of events was described by Morgan Plant, executive director of Planned Parenthood affiliates in Pennsylvania; the description was concurred in by Molly Kelly, executive director of the southeast chapter of Pennsylvanians for Human Life. In July 1981 Representatives Stephen Freind and Gregg Cunningham introduced in the state General Assembly four bills called the Pennsylvania abortion control act. They were voted down in committee but then one that contained most of the restrictive provisions was attached by the Assembly to a Senate-passed measure known as the tough guy bill, which sought to prohibit amateur prizefights on stages. In December 1981 the omnibus bill was passed by the Assembly by a two-to-one margin and went back to the Senate, which also adopted it. Gov. Dick Thornburgh vetoed it, explaining that he thought it would hamper physicians, but he indicated that he would be willing to consider a revision. The bill was redrafted, voted again and signed. It requires a 24-hour waiting period; medical consultation, including detailed descriptions of the fetal anatomy; consent by one parent for a procedure to be performed on a minor; information printed in English, Spanish and Vietnamese; distribution of printed lists of alternative services; hospitalization for second-trimester procedures; the attendance of a second physician in cases where the fetus might be viable; quarterly reports on in vitro fertilization procedures, and prohibitions against the use state funds for abortions except when life is endangered and against insurance coverage in state policies for employees. A coalition of 14 organizations favoring choice filed suit in Federal District Court asking for an injunction and a ruling that the act was unconstitutional. The day before it was to go into effect an injunction was issued involving only the provision for a 24-hour waiting period. The rest of the law went into effect for just one day, Dec. 8, 1982, after which it was put in abeyance by being taken to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEWS SUMMARY; SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/nyregion/news-summary-saturday-january-15-1983.html,"International The arms control talks with the Soviet Union are now ''in a position to get somewhere,'' President Reagan said. Meeting with reporters for the first time since he ordered the dismissal of Eugene V. Rostow as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Mr. Reagan said that as a result of his military modernization program, he had regained ''leverage'' over the Soviet Union and that Moscow now had ''an incentive'' to bargain seriously. (Page 1, Column 6.) Moves on detente with Moscow have been undermined by China's support of ancient territorial claims and disputes and its spreading of anti-Soviet sentiments in China, the Soviet weekly political journal, Novoye Vremya, said. A commentary listed in detail the Chinese encylopedias, textbooks and journals that continue to claim that the Soviet-Chinese border is the product of unequal czarist treaties, and that great stretches of Soviet territory in Siberia and the Far East historically belong to China. (1:1.) The arrest of a Vienna arms dealer in connection with pistol used to shoot Pope John Paul II has led to the suspicion of Czechoslovak connivance in arms smuggling. A Czechoslovak citizen was arrested at the Austrian border with 300 undeclared pistols and 7 Soviet-designed automatic rifles in cases addressed to the Austrian dealer. (2:3.) National The President vetoed a crime bill chiefly because it would have established a Cabinet-level director of Federal efforts to combat narcotics. The last Congress passed the legislation, which had been endorsed by many Republican and Democratic legislators, but opposed by the Justice Department on the ground that a special narcotics director with inter-agency authority would have disrupted the Administration's efforts against drug trafficking, while producing friction among Cabinet members. (1:3.) Mr. Reagan defended his leadership and rebutted the most intense criticism thus far of his two-year-old Administration. At a news conference at the White House, Mr. Reagan contended that faulty news reports, not his leadership, was the problem. He said that on arms control there had been ''such disarray approaching chaos in the press corps'' lately that he felt obliged to come forth to reassure the Western allies. (10:1.) A preliminary finding that 320,000 cars in General Motors' line of 1980 X-models had defective brakes was announced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency scheduled a hearing Feb. 14 on whether the cars should be recalled and the brakes repaired at the expense of General Motors. The cars in question are all the the front-wheel drive models with manual transmissions manufactured for the 1980 model year and the 120,000 1980 X-cars with automatic shifts manufactured prior to May 1979. (1:2.) The railroad hobo ranks are growing. Some of the newcomers ride because they are unemployed and, in the long recession, have lost the means to look for jobs by car or bus. Others ride because it is an uncomplicated and easily mastered way of life with a style, a language, even a history of its own. (1:3.) Commitment to a mental hospital of a religious cult leader in Memphis was sought by his wife the day before he and six followers seized a police officer and beat him to death, a judge said. The seven cult members were killed in a police raid on their house. Probate Judge Joseph Evans said the law prohibited him from hosptializing Lindberg Sanders, despite the appeal from his wife. (4:1.) The national schism over abortion remains as wide as ever despite the Supreme Court ruling 10 years ago next Saturday that the decision to undergo an abortion is a constitutional right and a private matter only to the woman and her physician. Today, the anti-abortion and pro-abortion sides are larger, more vocal and poliitically sophisticated than they were a decade ago. (17:1.) Metropolitan Rockland County's sheriff was ordered by a State Supreme Court justice not to comply with a Federal court order that requires him to surrender to Federal custody a defendant in the Brink's robbery and murder case. Justice Robert J. Stolarik said a Federal writ of habeas corpus ordering the state to give up custody of the defendant, Samuel Brown, had frustrated the constitutional responsibilities of the Rockland County District Attorney, Kenneth Gribetz, and the sheriff, Thomas Goldrick. (1:1.) A drought warning will be declared in New York City if reservoirs are not substantially replenished by rain or snow in the next few days, officials of the Department of Environmental Protection said. The reservoirs are now at 51 percent of capacity. They should be at 81 percent, which is normal at this time of year. (25:6.) A full review of the tax system in New York State - the first since 1938 -was begun by the Legislative Tax Commission in Albany. ''Plug the loopholes,'' demanded several hundred economists, lawyers, lobbyists, accountants and bureaucrats who presented their views. The commission is scheduled to present a redraft of the tax statutes in April. (25:2-5.)

WOMEN SEEK ABORTION LOANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/nyregion/women-seek-abortion-loans.html,"AN increasing number of the women seeking loans for abortions through a new fund set up by the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut are not teen-agers, but adults, league officials say; many of them are no longer able to afford the average $200 cost because of unemployment. Yet, despite an apparent growing need for such financial assistance -the loans are interest-free - leaders of the league are troubled because they suspect that fewer people than should be are taking advantage of the fund. They contend that this may be because an element of fear has crept back into the abortion process. Many pregnant women, especially the less knowledgeable ones, may believe they are breaking the law by seeking an abortion, league officials suggest. ''Some say that they're afraid they may jeopardize their Medicaid if it's known they've applied for an abortion,'' said Lea Berliner, coordinator of the fund, known as Women Against Discrimination in Abortion. ''Others are worried that their welfare benefits will be taken away from them. There's a lot of confusion.'' Maryalyce Lee, the executive director of the 18,000-member Connecticut Right to Life Corporation, refutes this argument. ''When you show people there's a human being growing inside them,'' she said, ''they start to say, 'Hey, wait a minute!' It's education, not fear, that's become the deterrent.'' Planned Parenthood leaders say the situation is especially disquieting because they have been able to raise more money than they originally anticipated. Some $164,000 has been collected in less than two years. Some of the 135 contributors to the fund could give no more than $5 or $10 each. ''But they were very emotional about giving,'' said Joan Babbit, executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. ''They would send us a letter with their donation or tell us why they thought this sort of fund was important to support.'' So far, 1,728 women have used the fund, borrowing a total of $93,000. The average loan has been $85 with the rest of the cost made up in cash. The swing toward more adults rather than teen-agers seeking abortions is reflected in the most recent statistics available from the State Department of Health. Women 19 years and younger comprised 30.8 percent of the women seeking abortions in 1979, dropping to 29.7 percent by 1981, the latest year for which figures are available. Abortions during that time rose from 13,784 in 1978 to 16,565 in 1981. According to Jean MacDonald, director of the Hartford chapter of Planned Parenthood, applicants seeking financing through the fund cover a broad range of society - single parents, women living alone as well as an increasing number of married women. ''One woman's husband had been laid off by Pratt & Whitney four months earlier,'' said Mrs. MacDonald. ''And although she would have been the sort who would have been able to pay in the past, she did not have that kind of cash anymore.'' A majority of clinics and physicians require an immediate cash payment for this sort of procedure, said Mrs. Berliner. In some instances, it is still possible to have an abortion paid for through Medicaid. But constantly changing guidelines has been one of the factors, she maintained, that has made some low-income women uneasy about even applying. Many women make a special effort to pay back the loan, league officials said. ''One woman who borrowed $100 in September has been paying us back with $2 a week ever since,'' said Mrs. MacDonald. There is no means test, income ceiling or need for collateral in order to obtain a loan. And applications can be made at any of the league's 18 offices around the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WITH BUDGET AXES ALL ABOUT, SCHWEIKER PREFERRED A SCALPEL",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/weekinreview/with-budget-axes-all-about-schweiker-preferred-a-scalpel.html,"A paradox ran through the tributes paid to Richard S. Schweiker after he offered his resignation as Secretary of Health and Human Services last week to become the chief lobbyist for the life insurance industry. For to the extent that he was well regarded by President Reagan, it was because he loyally carried out the President's policy of reducing Federal outlays, or the growth of Federal outlays, for health, welfare and social service programs. And to the extent that he was admired by special interest groups and constituents served by his department, it was because he defended these programs. Mrs. Heckler's Choices Obviously, it is difficult to assign credit to one person for cutting and defending the same programs at the same time - unless, as Mr. Schweiker would argue, his achievement was to make cuts in the most judicious manner possible. But for two years as head of the largest Cabinet department, Mr. Schweiker did have it both ways. He portrayed himself as a loyal servant of the President, never speaking out in public to criticize the White House and never permitting his aides to engage in the time-honored Washington game of bureaucratic backbiting. Similar choices await Margaret M. Heckler, whom Mr. Reagan selected to succeed Mr. Schweiker. The eight-term Republican Representative from Wellesley, Mass., was defeated last November. Her record as a moderate and her sex made her politically attractive to the President, who is eager to shore up his standing among women and among centrists in his party. But Mrs. Heckler's standing with the White House is likely to vary inversely with her popularity among public health and welfare advocates. Her record in Congress suggests that she will be more outspoken than Mr. Schweiker, who rarely evinced strong feelings about any issue. Indeed, he was so taciturn that his own politics remained something of an enigma, and he was not completely trusted by either conservatives or liberals. Mr. Schweiker had been one of organized labor's closest allies in Congress until 1976, but he was moving to the right even before he joined Mr. Reagan as his Vice Presidential candidate that year. In Congress, Mr. Schweiker opposed gun control, supported school prayer and was against the use of Federal money to pay for abortions. He was being true to his conservative instincts when he announced last week that he had approved a rule requiring certain family planning clinics to notify the parents of young women who received prescription contraceptives. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America immediately filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify the rule. One of Mr. Schweiker's major embarrassments on Capitol Hill arose from his effort to reduce the regulation of nursing homes in keeping with President Reagan's goal of regulatory relief for private enterprise. Congress twice passed laws blocking any change. The department, under Mr. Schweiker, never figured out precisely how public health should be weighed in the calculus of costs and benefits. In an era when the spirit of Government and the nation has grown less generous, Mr. Schweiker's achievement seems to consist more of harm averted than acts of beneficence. He helped preserve funding for Head Start, which provides preschool services for poor children. But his first love was the National Institutes of Health, the worldfamous biomedical research complex. Mr. Schweiker constantly resisted cuts in the N.I.H. budget, continuing a campaign that he began as a member of Congress, where he developed a strong interest in medical issues. He had been the ranking Republican on the health subcommittees of both the Appropriations Committee and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Mrs. Heckler brings little of that detailed knowledge to the job. She served on the Science and Technology, Veterans Affairs and Joint Economic Committees. Not having been extensively involved in health or income security matters, she has much to learn. Social Security, by far the biggest program in the department, is so politically explosive that key policy decisions, when they are made, come from the White House. Mrs. Heckler cannot hope to play more than Mr. Schweiker's secondary role on the issue. If she can master the intricacies of Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, in less than one year, she will have proved a rapid learner. Inherited Issues and Aides As Secretary, Mr. Schweiker devised an elaborate proposal for paying hospitals fixed rates, set in advance, for treating all Medicare patients with a particular diagnosis. Whether Mrs. Heckler or anyone else in the Administration will push for that proposal is unclear. The White House stipulated that she should not publicly discuss her priorities before her confirmation hearings. In an effort to keep medical expertise at the top of the department, Mr. Schweiker urged President Reagan to promote Dr. Edward N. Brandt Jr., the Assistant Secretary for health, to the second-ranking position. Instead, Mr. Reagan chose a loyal, conservative Californian, John A. Svahn, to be Under Secretary. For the last two years, Mr. Svahn has been Commissioner of Social Security, dealing with an issue that will surely dominate the department's agenda in the next two years. In an analysis of Mrs. Heckler's voting record, the American Public Health Association, an organization of 50,000 health professionals, gave her a 65 percent rating. She agreed with the association on 13 of 20 votes involving health issues. She disagreed on bills involving abortion and health spending. In general, she has been a strong supporter of women's rights, but she opposes the use of Federal money to pay for abortions. Mrs. Heckler usually supported the President on budget questions. But last September she joined 80 other Republicans in voting to override his veto of a $14.1 billion supplemental spending bill. The House vote represented the first major breakdown of Republican unity on fiscal votes in the last Congress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMPLICATED FRIENDSHIPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/books/complicated-friendships.html,"DIFFICULT WOMEN, A Memoir of Three. By David Plante. 173 pp. New York: Atheneum. $9.95. AN American young man, a novelist, settles in London in the early 70's and pursues the friendship of much older women, who are either themselves literary or have entree to the literary life. It is a given that these women will be complicated, stubborn, strong-willed, and that the relationship between each of them and the novelist will be tricky, even suspect. If this were the 1870's, the circumstances would provide a Jamesian subtext fulfilling, only very slowly, some psychologically unforeseen purpose; but as it is the 1970's, the entire matter is at once laid self-consciously before us, and we are free to decide how much or how little it all means. David Plante has known, with varying degrees of closeness, Jean Rhys, Sonia Orwell and Germaine Greer. ''Difficult Women'' is a series of memoirs of the three, linked together by Mr. Plante's idea that his own complicated motives in devoting himself to these friendships is part of the story he has to tell. The idea, however, is a suggestion, not an intrusion. Mr. Plante is too good a writer to lose his balance or his subject: the spectacular exaggerations of will and character the three women embody. The memoir of Jean Rhys - already famous, having been published originally in The Paris Review - is a remarkable achievement. Rhys was in her 80's when Mr. Plante met her: a tiny woman hunched over with arthritis, drunk by lunchtime, wearing flowered dresses, brim hats and makeup applied with a shaking hand. Determinedly infantile (and made even more so by years of enforced solitude and obscurity), Rhys was literally carried about by people who knew enough to revere the famous forgotten novelist locked up inside the helpless old lady. Mr. Plante readily became the last of these people. He visited Rhys daily at her London hotel, talked with her, drank with her and set out to help her write her autobiography. He also moved her from bed to bath to chair and, in the most notorious incident in the memoir, rescued her when she fell into the toilet. But Mr. Plante never forgot who Jean Rhys really was and what made her valuable, so that while he captures neatly the shabby dishevelment of the narcissistic girl-woman fallen into confused old age, he also achieves full recognition for the writer whose eloquence and maturity are endlessly redeeming. Here are two moments typical of the entire memoir. Rhys is sitting drunk in her chair with Mr. Plante beside her: ''She seemed suddenly to rouse herself internally, and she shouted 'Oh David, I'm unhappy. You be happy. I'm so unhappy, all my life I've been so unhappy. It's unfair. I'm dying. I want to die. It's unfair. I'm dying, my body's dying, and inside I think: it's unfair, I've never lived, I've never lived.' '' Within a few minutes of this dismaying outburst Rhys says: ''Listen to me. I want to tell you something very important. All of writing is a huge lake. There are great rivers that feed the lake, like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. And there are trickles, like Jean Rhys. All that matters is feeding the lake. I don't matter. The lake matters. You must keep feeding the lake. It is very important. Nothing else is important.'' If you wish, you may remember Jean Rhys falling into the toilet, but David Plante's memoir is constructed to honor the woman with a vision of writing as a huge lake. Although Mr. Plante tells us often enough of his worldly ambition, and that his own emotional avarice makes him anxious (Why am I here? he asks continually. What do I really want from her?), inevitably we are disarmed by his openness. But with Sonia Orwell one is inclined to agree with rather than indulge the self-accusation. Sonia Brownell married George Orwell a few months before his death and became the heir to Orwell's literary estate. Out of this circumstance she made a profession. A minor literary salon-keeper (she died in 1980 at tHe age of 63), Sonia Orwell was a compulsive manipulator of literary and intellectual people, intensely invested in therapy-like intimacies with writers and painters. She emerges in this memoir a cold, angry, restless woman, murderously defensive, a dinner party drunk, possessed of no redeeming gifts of mind or spirit. Throughout the memoir, one feels Mr. Plante sighing wordlessly: ''How did I get myself into this?'' Unfortunately, the reader can all too quickly supply an answer to that question and respond with ''Yes, but why drag us into it as well?'' With Germaine Greer, however, not only are we back on solid ground, all the strands of psychological insinuation are pulled together (we know what Mr. Plante is doing here) and brought into vivid relief through a realized portrait of the largest figure of all. Germaine Greer is the most wonderfully exaggerated difficult woman anyone might ever want to know. A cross between Margaret Sanger and Brendan Behan, the celebrated feminist speaker and writer seems all crude appetite and missionary-like responsibility. A large, blowsy woman, not beautiful in the parts but spectacular in the sum, Greer eats, drinks and lusts after men with a heartiness that feeds her compulsive sociability. Mother to the world, she is always in the company of ''the helpless and the hopeless,'' whose problems preoccupy her continuously. Greer herself, though, is anything but helpless. Educated to live in the world, she knows -really knows - how to build a house, fix a car, plant a garden, drive tirelessly, cook brilliantly. And everyone around her knows that she knows. As Mr. Plante observes shrewdly: ''Everyone listened to her with such attention (because) she had a command of whatever vocabulary happened to be appropriate to the problem.'' At the local garage in Tuscany, where Greer has a house and where much of this memoir is set, the mechanics are mesmerized by her: ''They had never known a woman who could swing her hips from side to side and clasp her hands to her breasts and pucker her mouth and know as much as they did about shock absorbers.'' Greer commands the room wherever she is. Repeatedly she takes the conversation by main force and delivers a passionate speech on whatever is currently on her mind - female circumcision in Africa, practices of abortion and contraception around the world, whatever. She is able to do this because no one in the room cares about what they care about as much as she cares about what she cares about. The intensity of her engagement is the source of her power; it is selfgenerating and to a large degree self-feeding; she does not really need any of the people who are listening to her, she only needs people to listen. This is true of her when she is with one friend or at a dinner party for six or at a microphone facing 500. MR. PLANTE understands this about Greer thoroughly. Listening one night as she tells him vivid stories of her early sexual experiences, he thinks: ''I felt that I was being taken into her confidence, into her private world; that is, I was taken into the private world of a public woman, where I learned something about her no one else knew. But I also felt that she was not talking to me, but to anyone, and what I heard anyone could hear. Her only secret was this: she would not reveal how she had become Germaine Greer, how she had learned everything she had to learn to become the person she was.'' That Mr. Plante admires and loves ''the person she was'' is not in question. Tough, single-minded, unbelievably appropriating, Germaine Greer emerges at the last as warm, funny, generous and very intelligent; a demanding and altogether worthwhile presence. Mr. Plante's relationship with Greer is the most extensive of the three - he is her guest in Italy, they visit each other in London, travel together in the American southwest - and it is with her that his internal carryings-on about what he, an open homosexual, is doing with these strong-minded women is most fully articulated. When he says, ''I liked to be with Germaine because she was ... unpredictable in her reactions. ... Though this frightened me in that I ran the constant risk of saying or doing the wrong thing, I was excited,'' he is speaking for what he feels with Sonia Orwell and Jean Rhys as well. They all gave him ''something,'' promised him ''something'' that made him cleave to them. With Germaine Greer the mysterious something is out in the open. In her company he shivers with excitement, imagines her taking him into her capacious body, loves falling asleep feeling safe and happy because Germaine is in the next room, watches her in her bath in Italy as a child peeking through the halfopen door might watch guess who. ''Difficult Women'' is the result of a psychological fixation that illustrates delightfully what might be called adaptive neurosis. Mr. Plante's preoccupation with the meaning of his attachment to Rhys, Orwell and Greer neither distorts his subject nor pushes his prose out of shape; it only indicates the source of his engagement and reveals his wholly admirable ability to convert necessity into virtue by bringing these extremely interesting women to brilliant, mythic life. His special intensity leads us to something of larger importance as well. THERE is a profound sense of homelessness attaching to all four - the homosexual man and the difficult women. Because Mr. Plante is open - to the women and to himself - he neither idealizes nor patronizes the condition; he simply captures it perfectly. The people in this book act as though home is to be found in the connection they make with themselves in each other's presence. The complicated seriousness with which friendships are taken is, finally, what this book is all about. At a moment in social history when marriage is so problematic for so many, such a contemplation touches a live nerve. ''Difficult Women'' is moving, intelligent and very much of its time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEW JERSEY OPINION;
WHY THOUSANDS WILL MARCH TO END ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-why-thousands-will-march-to-end-abortion.html,"COME next Saturday, thousands of New Jersey residents will get out of bed in the dark, board a bus before dawn and ride to Washington. There, they will probably stand around in the cold for an hour or two, listening to speakers. And then these businessmen from Bergen County, these students from Douglass, Princeton and Seton Hall, these young girls from Cape May and these not-so-young girls from Clinton and Elizabeth - all will join with thousands of others from every state in the union in the annual March for Life to protest the legalization of abortion in the United States. Later, at about 5 P.M., they will climb back on their buses and probably pray that they will not have to return to Washington next year. But they will if they have to. And they'll keep going there in larger numbers each year until a Human Life Amendment restores the right to life to the unborn child. Today, 10 years after the Supreme Court decision that gave women the right to abortion for any reason throughout the entire pregnancy, people are beginning to understand that what is destroyed in an abortion is an innocent human life. No one really argues this much anymore. Not when we can look inside a woman's womb by means of computerized cameras and watch a tiny male or female human only 8 weeks old (when most abortions are done) suck its thumb, grasp an instrument placed in its hand and swim freely about with a natural swimmer's stroke. Not when we can listen to its heartbeat and measure its brainwaves. And not now, when, according to Dr. Thomas Verney, founder of the Toronto Center for Psychotherapy and Education, we can start communicating and influencing a baby's personality by talking, reading and singing to them while they are still in the womb. People are also beginning to question the argument put forth by those who advocate the right to have abortions: ''Make it illegal again and thousands of women will die from 'back-alley' abortions.'' Will this be the case? Not so, says Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a former director of the New York Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health, the largest abortion clinic in the world. Writing in ''Aborting America,'' he comments in part: ''The practice of abortion was revolutionized at virtually the same moment that the laws were revolutionized through the widespread introduction of the suction curettage in 1970. ''One can expect that, if abortion is ever driven underground again, even non-physicians will be able to perform the procedure with remarkable safety. No woman need die if she chooses to abort during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.'' The fact is that fewer women die today from abortion, legal or illegal; but they do die from it because many abortions are performed in the second trimester (10 percent) and the third trimester (2 percent). They die from it because it is not as safe as childbirth (another false claim), and they still die from criminal abortions in spite of its being legal. This is documented by Dr. Thomas W. Hilgers in a landmark study, ''New Perspectives in Human Abortion.'' Using data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and comparing mortality from induced abortions with that of pregnancy for the five-year period 1972-77, he found: ''When proper comparisons are made, the data demonstrates that pregnancy is clearly safer than abortion in both the first and second 20 weeks of pregnancy, with abortion proving to be twice as dangerous to the life of the mother in the second 20 weeks. ''In analyzing the trend in maternal deaths due to induced abortions, it has been shown that, while maternal deaths from criminal abortions appear to be decreasing, they have been replaced almost one to one by maternal deaths due to legal abortions.'' Abortion figures are hard to come by because most states do not require strict record-keeping. Many, like California, require none at all. Which is why the official figure given for abortion deaths in 1978 is 50, the same year that The Chicago Sun-Times uncovered 12 unreported deaths of young women just in Chicago clinics. The best estimate of the number of abortions performed annually in the United States before legalization is 90,000. Since legalization, the yearly total has soared to between 2 million and 2.5 million. The unwanted child argument is based on the assumption that every child who is ''unwanted'' will end up abused or a drain on society. Never mind that many studies have disproved this notion. Maybe we should ask ourselves why, after getting rid of approximately 15 million unwanted babies since 1973, child abuse has tripled in the United States? Why has child abuse reached epidemic proportions in New Jersey? (The Governor's Commission on Children's Services reported last February that child abuse in the state had risen by 1,000 percent in the last decade alone.) Is it possible that the abortion mentality is beginning to affect the way we view our ''wanted'' children? And what are the reasons for 2 million abortions annually? In testimony given before the Senate, Dr. C.Everett Koop, the United States Surgeon-General, said: ''Reasons given include preserving the life of the mother, expectation of a defective child, rape and incest. Even if these were valid reasons, they would account for only 3 percent of all abortions. A full 97 percent occur for matters of convenience and economy.'' In arguing a recent case in Boonsboro, Md., against a husband who tried to stop his wife from having an abortion, Barbara Mello, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, objected to questions concerning her client's reasons for having the abortion. The lawyer contended that the wife's reasons were irrelevant, since she could have an abortion for frivolous reasons or for no reason at all. She based her argument on the Danforth v. Planned Parenthood decision, which denied a husband any say in an abortion decision. Are we the only ones who are appalled at the idea that, if you're ''unwanted,'' you're better off dead? Any one of us could find ourselves in that category, and the only thing that could protect us would be our blessed constitutional right to life. This is the protection that the Supreme Court decision of 1973 took away from the unborn. In its place, under the guise of a right to privacy, women were given the right to choose. The fruits of this newly discovered right are sober indeed. Last April, a boy born in Bloomington, Ind. with Down's Syndrome needed a simple surgical procedure performed on his esophagus so that he could swallow. His parents chose to refuse this treatment for him.  Although 10 other couples volunteered to adopt infant Doe, as he was called, the Indiana courts gave the hospital permission to administer a strange, new Orwellian medical treatment called ''nontreatment.'' Food and water were withdrawn, and six days later the little wasted form of Baby Doe died of starvation and dehydration. On Feb. 6, 1982, workers repossessing a 20-foot-long metal shipping container from the posh Woodland Hills home of a Los Angeles pathologist made a gruesome discovery. The container was stuffed with 17,000 aborted fetuses, each packed tightly in its own plastic container. Autopsy reports disclosed fetuses as old as 30 weeks. In 1977, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency approved a $300,000 contract that used 100 fetuses to test the effects of pesticide. A January 1980 issue of the magazine Chemical Week had an article describing the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company's experiments with a compound using virus-inoculated nasal passages of freshly aborted fetuses. The research was directed toward knocking out viruses causing common cold. Worst of all, fetal tissue is being used to make cosmetics. An advertisement for a product called California Beauty, which is made by Rene Ibry of Cannes, France, reads: ''Exclusively taken from fetuses, the young cells applied to old tissues are able to regenerate the latter. These cells are all the more effective because they are living.'' It isn't 1984 yet. It's only 1983, 10 years since the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion. Those of us going to Washington next Saturday urge that we all pause and think again about this subject and where it is leading us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STYLE; THE JUNIOR LEAGUE TAKES OFF WHITE GLOVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/style/style-the-junior-league-takes-off-white-gloves.html,"Beverly Brooks is the deputy superintendent of a dingy women's prison on 11th Avenue that houses felons who have committed crimes from arson to murder. Many of them are 90 days away from release. When Mrs. Brooks heard the New York Junior League wanted to start a program at the Bayview Correctional Facility, she said she thought: ''What would they do here? And why would they come?'' She said she regarded league members as ''white-glove, uppermiddle-class women who don't do anything.'' That was in 1978. Carol Bellamy, a former State Senator and president of the City Council since 1977, has worked with the league in helping to achieve reforms in government services. She once thought of the Junior League as sheer fluff. ''I always pictured them as having something to do with flowers - you know, garden shows and arrangements,'' she said the other day from her City Hall office. Well, both women have changed their minds. 'Warmth and Sincerity' On first meeting with the league volunteers, Mrs. Brooks said, she was ''astounded by their openness, their warmth and sincerity.'' Now, almost five years later, their consistency, practicality and followthrough impress her, too. They are always at Bayview on the same night every week, offering the inmates a supermarket of experts to help them cope with the outside world. The workshops include how to write job resumes; dress for job interviews; shop with food stamps; find New York's ''freebie'' goods, events and services; get the most food value for the least money; learn the subway system and the facts on breast self-examination for cancer. ''They may come from the other side of the tracks, but the women trust them,'' said Mrs. Brooks. ''Trust is very difficult to establish in prison, and consistency is the key.'' A Word for a New Guide Miss Bellamy has also corrected for herself the commonly held and what she called an ''inaccurate'' perception of what the New York Junior League really is. ''The reality is, for example, not flowers,'' she said, ''but the league's new Access Guide to the city, which helps disabled people take advantage of all the diverse activities offered here.'' The league has a national membership of about 145,000. A candidate must be proposed by a local league member and then present three letters of recommendation, two of them from league members. After an admissions interview, a successful candidate becomes a ''provisional'' member, which involves four months of weekly courses, learning about the city and the league. The sole criterion for membership, according to the New York league's president, Katherine Sincerbeaux, is ''an absolute commitment to volunteerism - not the way you look.'' She pointed out that there are benefits for members as well: ''New members learn much more about their community,'' she said, ''and acquire new skills and make friends - of particular importance for those coming to New York from other parts of the country.'' They must also devote a certain number of hours a week to the league's voluntary services. Annual dues are $240 for actives and $205 for provisionals, with an added one-time provisional fee of $150. The league is housed in a superb neo-Georgian mansion on East 80th Street that was built for Vincent Astor. Traditionally, it has helped children and old people, sent food and clothing to the poor and the sick and provided guides for museums. The league began to undergo dramatic changes about a decade ago, when the emphasis changed from Lady Bountiful projects, benefit balls and bazaars to social activism. For the first time the New York League put itself on public record with the overwhelming support - indeed, insistence - of its members on such issues as abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment. Volunteers now also staff projects for victims of rape and incest and answer questions on venereal disease on a hotline at league headquarters (212-734-6010). They go into jails to educate male and female prisoners on alcoholism and its linkage to crimes. Volunteers are being trained for a speakers' bureau on the ''myths and facts of rape'' under the sponsorship of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Miss Bellamy commented that the New York Junior League - founded in 1901 and the oldest league among more than 250 in the United States, Canada and Mexico - has ''met the challenge of seeking and obtaining volunteers during a time of great crisis in volunteerism, when enormous numbers of women have left home to enter the labor force.'' But so have the members of the league. Eighty-one percent of the New York league's members work full or part time. The headquarters is now virtually empty until 6 P.M., when the members finish their paid jobs. Of the 1,900 New York league members, more than half are ''active'' and thus must put in their quota of volunteer hours. They contribute 150,000 hours of trained service each year. Projects and the attitudes toward them were different in the old days. Eleanor Roosevelt was quoted in 1948 as she described her experiences with the league when she was 19: ''Untrained,'' she said, ''I plunged into teaching calisthenics and dancing to little girls from the East Side. As I look back, the results were sometimes quite ludicrous.'' The New York league, which does not include the less traditional Brooklyn Junior League, founded in 1910, continues to be criticized for not reflecting the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of the city. Then there are the benefit society events of the New York league, which are not entirely a thing of the past. Among them are the Christmas bazaar and the Thanksgiving Eve Ball, where debutantes ''come out'' into society. ''Don't call them debutantes,'' league officers invariably say. ''Call them college provisionals.'' At the Plaza Hotel's cream and gold Grand Ballroom, always the scene of the annual dance and presentation to the adult world, there is a stag line of young male relatives in white tie, tails and white gloves, and Lester Lanin's dance band playing bouncy melodies on stage. Flanked by two escorts, the debutantes curtsy rockily to the league's president and the ball chairman. Tom Barton, whose wife has served as president and whose two daughters are league members, hasn't missed the Thanksgiving Eve Ball in the last 30 years. ''I love it, I love it,'' he said as he spun a partner around with dizzying enthusiasm. ''You know, the world may be a more serious place than it was in 1952 - but it's good there's some glamour left in it too.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRESIDENT SEEKS TO GAIN SUPPORT FROM MINORITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/us/president-seeks-to-gain-support-from-minorities.html,"At the urging of advisers who fear that his re-election may be in jeopardy, President Reagan has begun a series of program changes and initiatives to shore up his low political standing among blacks, the unemployed and especially women. White House officials said in interviews this week, for example, that Mr. Reagan planned to assail discrimination against women in pensions and insurance, and to seek tougher measures against delinquency in child support and alimony payments, in his State of the Union Message Jan. 25. According to these officials, the President is studying the possibility of legislation in these areas, which have received little attention from him in the last two years. Incentives for Businesses Mr. Reagan was also reportedly studying the possibility of seeking new incentives for the employment of ''displaced homemakers,'' or women who are suddenly thrust into the job market after being widowed or divorced. In addition, the President is expected to call for incentives for businesses to hire the long-term unemployed, unemployed young people and those thrown out of work because of declining industries in the Northeast and Middle West. The most visible recent action directed at women was the selection of the Administration's first two women to head Cabinet agencies. The two were Elizabeth H. Dole, a White House assistant for liaison with constituent groups, who was appointed Secretary of Transportation, and former Representative Margaret M. Heckler of Massachusetts, appointed as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Today the President devoted his weekly five-minute radio address to a tribute marking the 54th birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In another gesture to blacks, the White House announced earlier this week that Mr. Reagan would revisit a predominantly black parochial school in Chicago on Wednesday. 'Bigotry and Injustice Remain' In his radio address, Mr. Reagan reviewed highlights of Dr. King's life and said the slain civil rights leader ''awakened the moral sense of an entire nation,'' but added: ''Fifteen years after Martin Luther King's death, traces of bigotry and injustice still remain.'' ''So let the anniversary of this courageous American's birth be for us both a time of thanksgiving and a time of renewal,'' Mr. Reagan continued. ''Let us be grateful for the Providence that sends among us men and women with the courage and vision to stand peacefully but unyieldingly for what is right.'' The President's initiatives come at a time of rising concern by his aides that he is losing ground among key constituent groups whose support he needs if he decides to run for re-election. A close political adviser to Mr. Reagan said his support among working-class voters was ''scattering.'' Others pointed with alarm to recent polls showing that his approval ratings among women had plummeted. Gallup Poll Results Cited A new Gallup Poll released today shows that only 36 percent of the women surveyed approve of the President's job performance. Various poll numbers for single women and working women are sharply lower than this, and Republican strategists believe that the low numbers cost the party several key elections last November. (Page 15.) White House officials attribute Mr. Reagan's low ratings among women to many factors. Several noted polls showing that women were more sensitive to the issue of war and peace. Others acknowledged that the Administration's sharp cutbacks in social programs, such as nutrition and health, had hurt women disproportionately. Several White House officials said they feared that Mr. Reagan's failure to move faster to strengthen his support among women and blue-collar workers was being seen among Republican Party professionals as a sign that he might not run for re-election. ''We have got to retrieve the perception that Ronald Reagan cares about working people,'' a White House aide said. ''That perception is what elected him President in 1980, and without it he doesn't have a chance in 1984.'' Disappointment Over Budget A key aide to Mr. Reagan indicated that there was disappointment among several aides that the President's new budget for the fiscal year 1984, which is to be made public Jan. 31, does not contain more initiatives to help those without jobs. But the aide said he and others were encouraged in particular with the initiatives for women in the pension, insurance and workers' rights area, which are a product of a coordinating group headed by Mrs. Dole. The appointment of Faith Whittlesey, now Ambassador to Switzerland, to the White House liaison post held by Mrs. Dole is regarded as encouraging by Reagan aides. Mrs. Whittlesey's selection was said to be significant in another way: she believes women have the right to have an abortion, a belief that White House aides said would probably have prevented her from getting the job two years ago. Opposition to Rights Amendment Mr. Reagan's strong opposition to both abortion and the Federal equal rights amendment are acknowledged by Reagan aides as a significant reason for his low ratings among women. These aides said Mr. Reagan would not change his view, but one added, ''Sometimes I think that if the women want the E.R.A. so badly, we should let it pass.'' The Administration's answer to the pro-amendment forces has been to study laws and regulations on the Federal, state and local level and repeal discriminatory provisions. But little has been done in two years. ''Legal equity is important but economic equity should be the area we're focusing on now,'' said Mrs. Dole. ''Look at what's happening in the work force today. There's been a revolution out there, and we have to recognize it.'' Accordingly, Mrs. Dole has recently stepped up contacts with women's groups to find what could be done. In meetings at the White House, these groups have recommended changes in the pension and insurance areas to protect the rights of women. Although Mr. Reagan does not normally review briefs to be filed by the Justice Department, White House officials said he was given a review of the department's likely position in a recent case involving pensions. In that case, Solicitor General Rex E. Lee told the Supreme Court last Tuesday that most pension plans illegally discriminated against women by paying them lower benefits than men simply because they lived longer. Kathy Wilson, director of the National Women's Political Caucus, said she detected a real shift at the White House. ''It's clear there is some movement over there,'' she said. ''A lot of credit should go to Elizabeth Dole, who was just stonewalled over there for the first 18 to 20 months.'' In the appointments area, Helene Von Damm, the White House personnel director, said 94 of Mr. Reagan's Presidential appointments, or 13 percent, had gone to women. ''That's higher than it was for President Carter,'' she said, although women's groups maintain that women generally had more influential positions under Mr. Carter. Democratic Response to Reagan WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UPI) -Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, said today in response to the President's weekly radio speech that Mr. Reagan's words of praise for Dr. King conflict with policies that seem ''bent on rolling back civil rights efforts.'' Mr. Rangel, a black whose district includes Harlem, said in his own radio speech that Mr. Reagan's ''fine words'' were ''in conflict with those actions that his Administration has taken regarding the civil and human rights of many in this country.'' ''Where is his support for Dr. King's legacy in the actions of an Administration that seems bent on rolling back civil rights efforts and deliberately alienating minority groups?'' Mr. Rangel asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FERTILIZATION CLINIC OPEN IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/17/style/fertilization-clinic-open-in-new-york.html,"The Presbyterian Hospital has established what is believed to be the first in vitro fertilization program in New York City and has selected 25 women as potential mothers of so-called test-tube babies. The women, chosen from 150 applicants, will undergo the treatment next month. It involves removing several eggs from their ovaries in a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy, fertilizing the eggs in a small glass Petri dish with their husbands' sperm and returning the fertilized embryos to their wombs. (Multiple embryos are usually transplanted to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.) The odds that a pregnancy will occur in such an attempt are about one out of five, said Dr. Raymond L. Vande Wiele, director of the obstetrics and gynecology service at the Presbyterian Hospital, at 622 West 168th Street, and co-director of the in vitro fertilization program. If a pregnancy doesn't result on the first attempt, a couple will be allowed to repeat the procedure several times, he said. ''This is a formidable procedure,'' he said, ''one that lasts 18, 19 or 20 days and is trying to the patients.'' It is also expensive, he added, with each fertilization and transplantation attempt costing around $5,000, most of which is not reimbursible by insurance companies. So far, he said, about 50 babies have been born around the world as a result of in vitro fertilization, ''with a significant number of pregnancies.'' The first baby to be born was Louise Brown, on July 25, 1978, in London. The first American in vitro (''in glass'') fertilization program was started in 1980 at at Eastern Virginia Medical College in Norfolk, Va., and similar programs have sprung up at the University of Southern California; the University of Texas Medical Center in Houston, the University of Pennsylvania, and at Vanderbilt and Yale universities. In vitro fertilization is also being done in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Several other medical centers in this country have programs that are in the formative stage. Others are not seeking publicity for their programs because of possible critical community reaction. Plans to establish a clinic in Buffalo were canceled in December 1981 a few days after Bishop Edward D. Head of the Roman Catholic diocese of Buffalo opposed the procedure as ''depersonalizing.'' Some religious and right-to-life groups equate the procedure with abortion, because only those embryos that appear to be developing normally are transplanted to the womb. The rest are discarded. Dr. Vande Wiele said that in setting up the program he had encountered ''no negative reactions'' from either the hospital, fellow obstetrician-gynecologists or Community Board 12, whose approval he sought. He said he thought the hospital's attitude toward the program was one of ''enthusiasm.'' Women who will be given priority in the program, he said, are those who are 40 years of age and under, legally married, childless and who have no Fallopian tubes or whose tubes are diseased. One of those accepted for the program is a 36-year-old New Jersey woman who did not want her name used. She said she and her husband had been trying to have a baby for eight years. Her Fallopian tubes are blocked, she said, despite microsurgery to try to correct the problem. ''This really would be the last chance for my husband and me to have a baby,'' she said. ''Our doctors have said, 'This is it.' '' Peace of Mind She said that if her first attempt at becoming pregnant by in vitro fertilization did not succeed, she would try two more times. If these attempts are unsuccessful, she said, at least she and her husband would have ''peace of mind.'' ''One of the most important things is knowing you've done everything you can and that there's nothing more you can do,'' she said. Another member of the program, a 35-year-old elementary schoolteacher from Long Island who has been trying to become pregnant for five years, shrugged off the high cost of the program, saying: ''If you really want something, you can always find a way to pay for it.'' And what if she fails to become pregnant? ''Then we'll think about adopting,'' she said. A woman accepted for treatment in the Presbyterian Hospital's program is told to notify the hospital when her menstrual period begins. Between the fifth and 15th days of her cycle, she will be treated with hormones to stimulate the production of eggs by her ovaries. Around the 15th day, the eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilized in a Petri dish. Two days later they are transplanted into the woman's uterus. She returns home the same day, then waits until the end of her cycle to see whether she gets her next menstrual period. When a pregnancy does result, what are the chances that an in vitro baby will be malformed? About 3 per cent, ''the same as in normal births,'' said Dr. Georgianna Jagiello, an obstetrician-gynecologist and geneticist who is co-director of the program. Dr. Vande Wiele said a specially trained team that includes several gynecologists, a urologist, an ultrasound specialist, a biochemist and a psychiatrist would conduct the program at the hospital. Many of them have observed the in vitro fertilization program in Norfolk, he said. 'The End of the Line' The psychiatrist is needed as part of the team, according to Dr. Elynne Margulis, an obstetrician-gynecologist who is medical coordinator of the program, ''because patients who come to the program see this as the end of the line.'' ''I've had patients in other infertility programs say it's like death when they don't become pregnant and they see their menstrual period,'' she said. Asked about the future, Dr. Vande Wiele said he thought that his team would one day have to face the implications of the question, ''Can you make a boy or a girl?'' The answer to that question, he said, is: ''Theoretically, yes.'' Within 10 years, he said, doctors should be able to reach ''the ultimate goal'': correcting a family's genetic defects outside the womb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary; TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/nyregion/news-summary-tuesday-january-18-1983.html,"International Andrei A. Gromyko warned Bonn that it would be caught in a sharpened nuclear confrontation if new American medium-range missiles were deployed in Western Europe. On the second day of a visit to West Germany, the Soviet Foreign Minister also said that Moscow was ready to negotiate a reduction of its shorter-range SS-21, SS-22 and SS-23 nuclear weapons systems targeted on Western Europe on the basis of ''mutuality'' with NATO. (Page A1, Columns 1-2.) The White House again repudiated as inadequate an informal agreement worked out by American and Soviet negotiators in Geneva last summer for limiting medium-range missiles in Europe. Officials underscored their opposition to any agreement that fell short of the American position, which calls for both sides to scrap all medium-range missiles. (A1:1.) Trade concessions by Japan are sought by American business and labor officials. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is visiting Washington in an effort to repair what experts say are the most strained American-Japanese ties since World War II, and the officials urged Mr. Reagan to press Mr. Nakasone for a wide range of trade concessions at their White House meeting today. (A1:3.) American visitors in El Salvador include 11 members of Congress who are trying to find out what is happening in that troubled country. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat from Brooklyn, who talked with political prisoners who have been tortured, said: ''It is very hard to grasp what the reality of this place is.'' (A12:1-2.) National A deficit of at least $185 billion is likely in the 1984 budget being prepared by the White House, according to Administration and Congressional officials. The Administration has laid the groundwork for budgetary cuts and savings of $45 billion to $50 billion, but officials said that projected deficits have repeatedly climbed because of the 18-month recession. (A1:4-5.) Dioxin may contaminate 100 sites, not 55 as earlier suspected, state officials in Missouri fear. Forty-three pounds of the potent chemical waste remain unaccounted for, and environmental specialists fear that countless other sites remain to be detected. (A1:5-6.) George C. Wallace was inaugurated for a fourth term as Governor of Alabama. At his 1963 inaugural, Mr. Wallace vowed ''segregation forever.'' But yesterday he listed the state's economic troubles, called for unity and said: ''In times like these we must turn to one another and not away from or against one another.'' (A1:2-4.) The seven religious zealots who were slain last week by police officers in Memphis when they rushed a house in which a fellow officer was being held captive were all shot in the head, according to medical reports. (A16:1.) The right of an unmarried father to keep and raise his illegitimate child over the objections of the natural mother will be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The Justices accepted an appeal by a man who sought to raise the child and to block the decision of the 17-yearold mother to place the child for adoption. (A20:1-3.) ''Author of the abortion decision'' is a phrase habitually used by opponents of abortion in referring to Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun since he wrote the Court's decision that legalized abortion 10 years ago. In an interview, Justice Blackmun said that most of the letters he has received ''are very abusive,'' and the writers have called the Justice a murderer and a butcher. (A20:5-6.) The death penalty provisions of the military justice code were challenged by civil rights advocates. They called on the nation's highest military court to strike down the provisions on the ground that they have not been updated to conform to Supreme Court rulings in recent years. (A21:1-5.) What traits contribute to addiction? A new study concludes that there is no single set of psychological characteristics that embrace all addictions. However, the report cites several ''significant personality factors'' that can contribute to addiction. They include impulsive behavior, difficulty in delaying gratification and a sense of heightened stress. (C1:4.) Metropolitan Governor Cuomo, citing a deficit that he called the largest in the state's history, warned that he would have to cut ''good programs'' and raise revenue. In a day of meetings with key aides, Mr. Cuomo said he was ''considering everything,'' including layoffs of state employees. A state publication said the Legislature would have to cut aid to local governments and increase taxes to close the deficit. (A1:6.) Richard F. Halverson was appointed Acting Chancellor of New York City's schools after Frank J. Macchiarola confirmed he was stepping down as Chancellor to be president and chief executive officer of the New York City Partnership, a coalition of business groups. Mr. Halverson is now the system's Deputy Chancellor. (B3:1-2.) High-salaried employees who are hired without competitive tests are doing middle-level work at the City University at an annual cost of at least $4.1 million, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin said. In an audit report, he said that educational qualifications were ''routinely waived'' for the higher-salaried employees, who were getting more money, more raises and more vacation days. (B3:5-6.)

BLACKMUN ACCEPTS AFTERMATH OF WRITING ABORTION OPINION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/us/blackmun-accepts-aftermath-of-writing-abortion-opinion.html,"''Author of the abortion decision,'' Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun said softly and slowly, as if restudying the phrase. ''We all pick up tags. I'll carry this one to my grave.'' When the Supreme Court legalized abortion 10 years ago, it used Justice Blackmun's words, carving his niche in American history. ''I knew it was a no-win case, but I didn't ask for the assignment,'' Justice Blackmun, in a rare on-the-record interview, said recently of how he came to write the opinion. ''I am mildly annoyed at those, law professors included, who personalize it,'' the Justice said of the landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade. ''It was a decision of the court, not my decision. There were seven votes.'' Still Receiving Letters Nevertheless, most of the estimated 45,000 letters delivered since the decision to the Supreme Courthave been addressed to Justice Blackmun. ''We still receive 8, 9 or 10 letters a day,'' he said. ''Some are very supportive, very lovely messages. But most are very abusive. The more recent ones are as abusive as the initial ones.'' Ignoring the advice of fellow Justices against reading such mail, Justice Blackmun says: ''I want to know what the people who wrote are thinking.'' They have called him a murderer, a butcher, even Pontius Pilate. They have compared him to the Nazi overseers of genocide. On occasion, as recently as last year on the campus of the University of Georgia, his speaking appearances have been picketed. Tells of His Feelings A devout Methodist, Justice Blackmun has read letters of condemnation sent to him by Methodist clergymen. ''I'd be less than candid if I said it does not hurt, but not as much anymore,'' he said. ''People misunderstand. I am not for abortion. I hope my family never has to face such a decision.'' Justice Blackmun is convinced, however, that the Supreme Court was on solid legal ground when it ruled that a woman's constitutional right of privacy includes the right to end an unwanted pregnancy. ''I still think it was a correct decision,'' he said. ''We were deciding a constitutional issue, not a moral one.'' Justice Blackmun is an unlikely target of moral outrage. He neither smokes nor drinks, and adheres to an old-fashioned morality. Viewed as an Independent Justice Blackmun Mis genuinely well-liked by those who work for him. At one time ridiculed for what was taken as dependence on Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, he has been recognized in recent years as an independent force on the court. ''Blackmun appears committed to viewing litigants before the court as real persons rather than legal abstractions,'' an academician said of him, adding, he has ''an intense, almost tangible concern that justice be done.'' Justice Blackmun said he could not estimate how much time he had devoted to the ruling on Roe v. Wade, which was announced Jan. 22, 1973. ''A lot,'' he answered when he was asked the question. ''More than any other case I've ever handled.'' He said he could only guess why Chief Justice Burger picked him to write the decision, and he asked that his thoughts on that topic not be made public. For the record, he acknowledged that for many his role as ''author of the abortion decision'' will overshadow the rest of his work in a Supreme Court tenure dating back to 1970. In a voice betraying neither rancor nor remorse, Justice Blackmun said, ''So be it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COAST NOW LEADER INDICTED IN '65 SLAYING IN NEW ORLEANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/19/us/coast-now-leader-indicted-in-65-slaying-in-new-orleans.html,"The president of the California branch of the National Organization for Women was indicted in a New Orleans suburb today in the robbery and murder of a French Quarter bar patron 17 years ago. The indictment was returned against Ginny Foat, 41 years old, after one of her former husbands, John Sidote, appeared before a grand jury in Jefferson Parish. The Louisiana authorities had said the case depended on his testimony. Mrs. Foat issued a statement in Los Angeles saying, ''I believe with all my heart that a political climate of violence and degradation of women is in a test stage with me as its first victim.'' She added that the ''only killing in my life was the death of a passive woman named Ginny Foat before the birth of a strong feminist by the same name.'' In New Orleans, District Attorney John Mamoulides said Mr. Sidote would be granted immunity from prosecution in return for testifying. Mr. Sidote told the authorities earlier that Mrs. Foat played a role in the 1965 slaying of Moises Chayo, a 62-year-old Argentine businessman visiting New Orleans. According to the Jefferson Parish authorities, Mr. Sidote said that he and Mrs. Foat, working as a bartender and barmaid, robbed Mr. Chayo of $1,400 before he was beaten to death with a tire iron. Mrs. Foat was arrested by the Los Angeles police a week ago on a six-year-old fugitive warrant. At a hearing in California Superior Court here after the indictment, she was denied bail and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by her lawyer, Marcia Brewer, was rejected. Mrs. Foat was then returned to the women's jail here to await a hearing Feb. 11 in her fight against extradition. Her arrest produced outrage and charges of political harassment in the feminist and liberal political circles in which Mrs. Foat had gained prominence in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Several supporters of Mrs. Foat, including other NOW members, said she had not hidden the fact that she had been implicated in crime. They said that she had talked of a former husband's making accusations against her in Nevada and Louisiana but that she thought she had been cleared when the charges were dismissed by a Nevada judge in 1977 for lack of evidence. Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish said today that Mrs. Foat's identity and whereabouts were brought to the attention of the Louisiana authorities early this month by a national board member of the feminist organization, Shelly Mandell, who was screening Mrs. Foat's background for a possible nomination to the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission. In a statement released today through the Los Angeles NOW chapter, Mrs. Mandell said she ''had been led to believe that Foat's past problems were resolved.'' She added that she ''sought verification of that resolution through a discreet inquiry in order to prevent possible embarrassment'' to either Mrs. Mandell's employer, City Councilman Marvin Braude, or to Mrs. Foat. Sheriff Lee said Mrs. Mandell had described Mrs. Foat by her maiden name, Virginia Galluzzo, the name on the fugitive warrant. ''When we put Virginia Galluzzo into the computer, it hit,'' he said. ''It also gave her aliases - Virginia Foat, Faulk, Folk, Folke. We never did know that the woman known now as Virginia Foat was Virginia Galluzzo until we got this inquiry.'' Mr. Sidote had been convicted and served four years in a Nevada prison for another murder that he said he and Mrs. Foat committed in 1965 at Lake Tahoe. He said they had robbed a casino patron, Donald Fitting, a San Francisco hotel employee whose body was found later near the resort. The authorities said they had had no suspects in either the New Orleans or the Lake Tahoe murder until Mr. Sidote confessed to the police in upstate New York in 1977 after he was arrested on charges of assaulting a local woman. Sgt. John Salters of the New York State Police at Highland, who described Mr. Sidote as ''a heavy drinker,'' recalled: ''We brought him into the barracks. He was going through the shakes, had the D.T.'s. I bought him half a pint of vodka because he was gonna fall apart on me. He started telling us about two homicides that had been committed by him and Galluzzo. ''He had just had it. According to him, it was on his conscience.'' Confession Wasn't Recanted Sergeant Salters said Mr. Sidote did not recant the confession when he sobered up but rather repeated it several weeks later in a formal statement that was witnessed by the Ulster County District Attorney, Michael Kavanagh. Mr. Sidote was then extradited to Nevada, where the authorities said he agreed to testify against Mrs. Foat in return for a lighter sentence. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Fitting murder but reneged on his promise to testify when he was sentenced to 25 years to life rather than 10 years, officials said. His former wife, meanwhile, had been arrested in the Los Angeles area on a Nevada fugitive warrant. By this time she had remarried and was living with her new husband, Raymond Foat. A Nevada judge dismissed the charges against Mrs. Foat, and she was released because of the lack of testimony or any other evidence. Mrs. Foat, returning to the Los Angeles area, became active in NOW. She was elected state president in 1981. Her supporters and NOW colleagues say little is known about Mrs. Foat's early life that would have pointed readily to her becoming a political activist and eventually a top feminist leader. Involvement in King March The Ginny Foat Defense Committee, which was formed last week, said she had been ''an organizer of Dr. Martin Luther King's march on Washington'' but did not know whether she was officially working with Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference or was involved more casually, said Jeanne Cordova, a committee leader and NOW officer. According to the committee, Mrs. Foat became active in the Los Angeles chapter in 1977, was soon elected vice president of political action and in 1979 organized NOW's annual national conference. In 1980 she worked in the Illinois campaign for the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution and moved into the larger political arena to be elected a Kennedy delegate to the Democratic national convention. ''She was a floor whip, among the most vocal,'' said Miss Cordova, who was a delegate with Mrs. Foat. ''She and her organization just worked around the clock. We were worried then about the Democratic platform position on pro-choice and funding for abortions. She was a leader.'' Mrs. Foat primarily earned her livelihood as a caterer, first in Vancouver, British Columbia, and later in Orange County and Canoga Park in southern California, Miss Cordova said. Mrs. Foat was born in Brooklyn in 1941. Acquaintances said she studied business and psychology at City College of New York without earning a degree. The college, however, was unable to locate any record of her attendance. Her friends say she has been married four times. She has no children. Authorities' View of Her Life In contrast to the feminist leaders who knew an idealistic, compassionate leader, the law-enforcement authorities describe a Virginia Galluzzo/Foat who had a darker side to her life. Lieut. Robert Garner, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in Jefferson Parish said that while she lived in New Orleans, Ginny Foat was employed as a barmaid at a bar near the waterfront. According to the sheriff's office, Mr. Chayo, the man she is accused of killing had come to New Orleans from Buenos Aires to visit a son who was being treated at a hospital. According to Mr. Sidote's confession to the New York police, Jefferson Parish detectives have said, Ginny Foat met the victim in the bar and enticed him to her car while Mr. Sidote hid in the trunk. She drove him to the isolated area, released Mr. Sidote from the trunk, and there was a struggle.

NEW YORK DAY BY DAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/22/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-182055.html,"Abortion Ruling, 10 Years After T here were observances all over town yesterday of the 10th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court ruling that made abortion legal. The observances included those who continue to denounce the decision and those who continue to celebrate it. Terence Cardinal Cooke spoke to 250 Roman Catholic high school students at Cathedral High School in Manhattan. The students were shown slides, given packets of information to pass out to neighbors and friends and told by Cardinal Cooke that abortion was ''a national tragedy.'' At the Central Presbyterian Church on Park Avenue, Protestant, Jewish and Catholic groups held a service in support of the decision. Paul Moore Jr. the Episcopal Bishop of New York, said that to abridge the right of abortion was to abridge freedom of religion. Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue said those opposed to abortion rights favored ''oppressive theological punishment.''

"MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY; Budget or No, Reagan Keeps The Show Going",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-budget-or-no-reagan-keeps-the-show-going.html,"As White House budget hands scurried about backstage last week trying to find the right numbers, their principal was front and center, looking to set the right tone. To mollify party moderates, President Reagan journeyed to Chicago for a fundraiser for Republican Senator Charles H. Percy, where he promised new proposals for job training for the unemployed. On the way, he dropped in on a nearby all-black parochial high school where, as if to reassure traditionalists, he emphasized the link between education and employment. At a cheerful news conference he celebrated the second anniversary of his inauguration with a review of ''the accumulated damage'' in economic and international affairs he had inherited and the progress he had made. Yesterday, he covered his social agenda, promising in his weekly radio address to press for Congressional action on tuition tax credits for private schools, school prayer and abortion. In short, he was campaigning hard. Bits and pieces of the fiscal year 1984 budget he will present to Congress next Monday are said to be still going to the printer. But according to the best estimates, its projected deficit won't come below $185 billion, and then by means that will please no one. Last weekend's Social Security compromise would bring some $10 billion in savings; $3 billion to $4 billion could come through a freeze on spending of various kinds, including the Federal payroll and retirement programs. Defense costs, though higher than last year's, are reportedly trimmed by $8 billion to $10 billion from earlier balance sheets. Domestic programs seem unlikely to escape without a proposed reduction of another $25 billion to $30 billion. If, that is, Congress accepts the White House blueprint, which seems more unlikely. The Pentagon's budget, at least rhetorically is considered fairer game by the legislators, and a nervous Repubican leadership says the bottom line on much social spending may have already been reached. Of the $100 billion worth of domestic prgrams the White House wanted pulled back in 1981 and 1982, Congress gave it nearly $60 billion. Then there is fiscal 1985 and beyond - the key to the President's public appearances last week and to the White House's private calculations. The budget for that year will be before Congress during the 1984 Presidential campaign. The urgency for the longer term is shared by the business community. Its latest exhortation was an impressively endorsed ''Bipartisan Budget Appeal'' to cut defense and raise taxes more lest the recessions of the 80's make the slumps of the 70's look good. The document, signed by five former Secretaries of the Treasury, was released the day the gross national product was reported to have declined at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the last three months. On paper, on the tax side at any rate, President Reagan may comply. To reassure Wall Street that declining interest rates will not be inflated by ballooning deficits, the Administration is considering a $135 billion package of ''contingency'' tax increases and tax restructuring, perhaps via a flat-rate tax or a consumption tax (a tax on spending rather than income). Mr. Reagan's strategists find the idea attractive for two reasons. It can be called tax reform, and the White House can project steadily receding deficits. The increases would be automatically triggered if Federal red ink rose above $100 billion in 1985. Pretty much everyone expects that it will. As if in dress rehearsal for next year's battles, the President returned to blaming Congressionally forced compromise for crimping his success in hastening recovery, and the White House released a midterm report. ''By the end of 1982,'' its otherwise exultant 118 pages acknowledged, ''grave problems of unemployment remained''. Reduction in inflation (consumer prices dropped 0.3 percent in December, it was also reported last week) led the list of ''Two Years of Progress.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion at 10,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/opinion/abortion-at-10.html,"Ten years after the Supreme Court's judgment to legalize abortion, the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy is recognized by most Americans and still bitterly disputed by a minority. It now appears that, in 1973, the high court led rather than followed the election returns. The right-to-life movement failed last year to undo the decision in Congress and in attempts to punish supporting legislators at the polls. Still, constitutional liberties are not supposed to depend on their popularity and a debate still rages over the ruling's legitimacy. Even some who favor the result harbor misgivings about the Court's use of judicial power. Looking back with an open mind, we find ourselves satisfied that the Court acted judiciously as well as courageously. The Court held in Roe v. Wade that abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is a decision to be made by the woman, in consultation with her doctor, not by government. It refused to recognize any constitutional right of personhood in the fetus. It did allow some limitation on abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy and quite severe limitation in the third. But the Court denied that it was thus choosing among rival theories of when life begins; it was only recognizing the growing potential of life. The justices have been richly abused for this close but practical reasoning. Critics say they can't find the woman's right in the Constitution and complain that the judges were legislating, not interpreting the law. Justices White and Rehnquist, the two dissenters, said the majority exercised ''raw judicial power.'' But Justice Harry Blackmun persuasively found the woman's right in 14th Amendment concepts of personal liberty and privacy. And more Americans now understand what he meant in saying that the woman's rights are at stake because her pregnancy involves both her body and her burden. It taxes her physical and mental health; she usually must raise the child, often alone; she takes the brunt of a family's distress when it can't support a child or the stigma of unwed motherhood. What does liberty mean if society gives her no choice about bearing such burdens? Justice Blackmun's delineation of the trimesters of pregnancy was no act of intellectual usurpation; it is a plausible summation of medical knowledge and allows an increasing government interest as the fetus comes to resemble a baby. It was a creative and also conciliatory legal rendering. The right-to-life movement now seems in disarray; it acrimoniously upbraids its own leaders. No constitutional amendment forbidding abortion seems likely even though mean-spirited people persist each year in wanting to punish the poor by denying them governmentfinanced abortion. American law cannot reach the private or religiously derived philosophies of its citizens; no American is being forced to practice abortion. But when philosophy divides society so sharply, no law should impose one group's view on everyone else. In this sense, the abortion decision was not only fair, it was brilliantly American.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMONSTRATIONS MARK 10 YEARS OF LEGAL ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/demonstrations-mark-10-years-of-legal-abortion.html,"About 26,000 people marked the 10th anniversary today of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion by marching on the Capitol to demand legislation overturning the ruling. President Reagan called the Court's decision a ''tragedy'' and, in his weekly radio address, said he would continue to support legislation to ''end the practice of abortion on demand.'' Mr. Reagan made the broadcast from Camp David, the Presidential retreat in Maryland, as the antiabortionists marched past the White House to the Capitol. The United States Park Police estimated the crowd at 26,000 people. ''I'm here to fight against abortion,'' said Gail Buss, a mother of four from Springfield, Va. ''They should realize people mean business.'' ''Abortion, in effect, legalizes killing,'' she said. ''This is just a beginning, killing an unborn child. Just where do you draw the line? Would you also kill the very old and sick?'' Abortion Supporters Meet At the same time, a coalition of groups supporting the right to have abortions pledged to carry on with their cause. All day long there were rallies, fund-raisers and news conferences marking a decade of legal abortion. ''It happens we represent the point of view of a majority of Americans,'' said Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ''Mr. Reagan simply has said that he cares not to hear about their point of view,'' She was joined at a news conference by representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Organization for Women and the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights. The groups said they planned to fight attempts in the new Congress to place a permanent ban on Federal financing of abortion. That stipulation has been attached to budget bills every year since 1978. Prayer Starts Demonstration The antiabortion demonstration began with a prayer by the Rev. Thomas Welsh of Arlington, Va. ''We are here to urge the elected officials to redress the tragic mistake of the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Welsh said. In a message read to the crowd, Mr. Reagan said, ''We have waited 10 years for Congress to remedy this tragedy.'' After reaching the Capitol, the demonstrators said they would try to lobby the offices of their Congressmen and senators for passage of what they call the Human Life Amendment. ''We are opposed to taking life,'' Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island told the crowd. ''It is a very basic and important issue this nation must face.'' The Governor, who is a Democrat, said 500 people had come from his state to take part in the demonstration. Others came from Ohio and Kentucky as well as neighborhing Virginia and Maryland. ''Will we maintain our committment to human life?'' the Governor asked. ''Yes,'' the crowd roared back. ---- President Renews Pledge WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (AP) The President said in his weekly radio address that he had ''always believed that God's greatest gift is human life and that we have a duty to protect the life of the unborn child.'' ''Until someone can prove the unborn child is not a life,'' he said, ''shouldn't we give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is? That's why I favored legislation to end the practice of abortion on demand and why I will continue to support it in the new Congress.'' On Friday, Mr. Reagan met with more than a dozen leaders of the movement against abortion to underline his personal backing of their cause and urge them to unite behind a single piece of legislation. Mr. Reagan devoted his five-minute broadcast to issues that affect families, and said he would address the ''serious and painful problems'' of the economy and unemployment Tuesday when he delivered his State of the Union Message. Watching the Football Game At Camp David, Mr. Reagan was working on drafts of the annual speech to Congress as he watched the Washington Redskins-Dallas Cowboys football playoff. Mr. Reagan also reaffirmed in the broadcast that he would continue his backing of school prayer and tuition tax advantages for parents with children in private schools. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, giving the Democratic response to Mr. Reagan's address, did not talk about abortion but urged Mr. Reagan to ''stop claiming victory and start leading'' on the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EX-GOV. MILLIKEN FINDS BASIC CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN MIDWEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/ex-gov-milliken-finds-basic-changes-are-needed-in-midwest.html,"The files are still unpacked. The floors remain bare. The fumes of fresh varnish linger around the new bookshelves. And the desk rests uncluttered by the broad window overlooking the stormy green bay. ''It's beautiful, isn't it?'' he said to the day's visitor, the only item on a neatly typed daily schedule that used to be so full of items it took two pages and a cluster of aides to whisper discreet reminders in his politically attuned ear. The shelves, desk and view belong to William G. Milliken, whose agenda for 14 years was running the government of Michigan, in what turned out to be a period of economic decline throughout the industrial Middle West. Now 18 days into voluntary ''retirement,'' the 60-year-old moderate Republican has the time to survey his past life and his new life from a new chair in his old hometown, only three blocks from where the family department store is holding January sales. ''I'm just delighted to be out of the Governor's chair now,'' he said, ''just because there are times to move on, to turn a new corner and begin a new life.'' Joins Chrysler's Board The agenda for the new life is filling quickly for the wavy-haired, popular Governor who dominated the politics of his depressed state and became an outspoken advocate, a kind of elder statesman, for the economic, cultural and environmental causes of the troubled Middle West. Last week Mr. Milliken joined Chrysler's board of directors. Earlier he was named to head the new Center for the Great Lakes in Chicago. He does not rule out the possibility of returning to politics or becoming an ambassador someday. And several more board memberships will be announced soon. ''I have plenty to do,'' said the former Lieutenant Governor who replaced George Romney as Governor when Mr. Romney joined President Nixon's Cabinet in 1969. But these days, when Mr. Milliken looks out his new office windows, he sees a far different Middle West. ''The last two years were clearly the most difficult time I ever had,'' he said. With the highest unemployment rate of any industrial state, Michigan shared the deep convulsions of the automobile industry, the heart of Michigan's economy and the driving force for much of the region's economy. ''There were increasing demands on the states and their financial resources,'' he said, ''just at the time they were least able to help. The pressures were unbelievable.'' In the last two years Mr. Milliken proposed state budget cuts of $1.8 billion, nearly 20 percent, dropping 15,000 state employes. ''You see people losing jobs in all sectors,'' he said. ''You could see the anxiety spreading, and then its direct relationship to increases in public assistance, the prison population, alcoholism, drug addiction, wife abuse, emotional health care needs, all at the very moment the states' ability to help is declining. We tried to build a budget stabilization fund, a kind of rainy day fund. We had $250 million. But under all those pressures, it was gone virtually overnight.'' The Good Life Fades Mr. Milliken saw some of his region's brightest citizens migrate to the booming Sun Belt states in search of jobs and the good life, better than their parents' life, that everyone once expected. ''But that is no longer valid anywhere,'' he said. ''The Sun Belt - I call it the Parched Belt - is not and never was the utopia it seemed,'' he went on. ''Hundreds have come back to the Midwest quite disillusioned by the mushrooming problems down there, the lack of services, jobs, inadequate water and rising tax rates.'' The former Governor sees the need for basic structural changes in the Middle West. He thinks many institutions, especially primary schools, must quickly create curriculums emphasizing computers and the kind of high-technology training he sees replacing only some of the region's lost jobs. ''We are going to need an entirely new sophisticated and highly trained work force,'' he said. ''But the terrible tragedy right now is that the labor force left behind has thousands of productive middle-age men and women who worked hard and did everything we ever asked them to. But they will simply be unable to acquire the necessary new skills of the future. So in many cases their future is not very bright.'' Calls Change Bewildering The first step toward a solution, he maintained, is to understand what is happening. ''But this is very difficult when bewildering change is swirling all about us.'' The next step, he said, is to abandon the traditional adversarial relationship among management, labor and government and to build a new economy based on the area's strengths, which he regards as its people, its universities and its priceless water. ''The Great Lakes is the world's largest collection of fresh water,'' he said, ''and water will be for the Midwest almost like oil is to the OPEC countries. It is vital to life and agriculture and attracts industry and tourism.'' He said how the Great Lakes were used would affect the entire future of the country's midsection, a theme he will pursue through the new Center for the Great Lakes, which is sponsored by the Joyce Foundation. Mr. Milliken said the future must also see an end to the ''days of industrial raiding'' when one state sought to lure factories from another. ''It pays dividends in the short term,'' he said, ''but it is counterproductive in the long run.'' He says he already sees signs of increased regional cooperation on protecting the Great Lakes and resisting its waters' diversion elsewhere. Inevitably this must expand to other areas, he said. ''There is no reason why every Midwestern state needs a forestry school or its own network of teachers colleges or expensive medical schools or mental health care facilities,'' he said. ''We can't afford it. So let's share the load regionally more efficiently. We shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again.'' 'Limit to What We Can Do' He said new forms of government must also develop. ''Hard times bring new definitions,'' he said. ''Many government programs have gone on because they have gone on. In the regulatory field, for instance, do we need or can we afford government regulation of things like watch repairs? Let the marketplace handle that. Government is to provide services for those who can't provide them themselves. There is a new limit to what we can do.'' But he is concerned with deteriorating faith in politics and government. ''People can expect honesty and integrity,'' he said, ''but not miracles. People now seem so eager to judge us by one single narrow issue like, say, abortion or taxes. Your stand dooms you forever in their eyes. But what about society's broader good?'' But even given all the woes, present and future, the former Governor is confident. ''The good times will come back,'' he said, ''But they will be very different good times, leaner, tougher, more competitive.'' Then Mr. Milliken went out into the blowing snow and drove himself home from the office for the first time in 14 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PREGNANT AND GOING TO SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/nyregion/pregnant-and-going-to-school.html,"''IUSED to walk in the hallways of my other school real terrified. It's more comfortable here. We're one big family. And I don't have to worry about crowded hallways or kids looking at me funny,'' said a 16-year-old girl, her hands resting on her slightly rounded stomach, just beginning to stretch the boundaries of a maroon sweatsuit. She was six and a half months pregnant and unmarried. She dropped out of her regular high school in mid-September and at the urging of her guidance counselor has been attending the Boces 2 Vocational Educational Program in Bellport ever since. She was one of about 20 girls between the ages of 15 and 17 enrolled in a special class for teen-age expectant mothers - the only one of its kind on Long Island designed to provide both academic skills and occupational training to pregnant teen-agers. Barbara Strongin, executive director of Suffolk County Planned Parenthood, called the program ''truly a model,'' adding: ''Outside of New York City, there is nothing like it downstate in occupational education.'' The 18-month-old program was started in response to an increase in teen-age pregnancies, especially acute in Brookhaven and Islip Towns, served by the Boces 2 vocational program. (Boces 2 is an acronym for the Board of Cooperative Educational Services, covering school districts in the second supervisory district.) According to Suffolk's Department of Health Services, there were 3,890 teen-age pregnancies in the county in 1981, resulting in 1,292 live births, compared with 2,828 pregnancies in 1980, leading to 1,217 births. More than 700 of the births in 1980, the most recent year for statistics listed for the individual towns, were in Brookhaven and Islip Towns combined. Social-services and family-planning professionals who work with pregnant teen-agers say that the high rate of pregnancy in those areas is due to a variety of factors. They say many of the girls who gave birth came from impoverished families with limited access to medical services insuring early detection, which would allow the opportunity to choose abortion. The experts also cited the growing acceptance of unmarried motherhood among both black and white socioeconomic groups. And some family planners blame the school districts for failing to offer adequate sex education courses that would better enable teen-agers to make knowledgeable decisions about their futures. Once a teen-ager becomes pregnant, the likelihood of her ever finishing high school diminishes; educators and family-planning experts say that pregnant adolescents account for the largest percentage of the high school dropout rate. ''Pregnancy gives them an excuse not to stay in school,'' Mrs. Strongin said. ''They may not be interested in staying in school in the first place, and if they are not up to capacity, once they are pregnant they just drop out.'' Since 1976, when Title IX of the Federal 1972 Education Amendments went into effect, public schools have been required to continue educating pregnant students. If a girl does not wish to stay in her regular school -and most do not - she may also opt for home tutoring, in which a teacher visits the house once or twice a week. The advantage of the Boces program over home tutoring, according to Beverly Jefferson, health coordinator and assistant principal at the Bellport school, is that ''here they have some interaction with their peers rather than staying home with television and junk food.''  ''They can share their experiences and discuss their problems with a support group,'' Mrs. Jefferson said. Not only is the program designed to keep pregnant adolescents in school, but also, since most of them are keeping their babies, ''we encourage them to develop some skills so that they can support a child,'' Mrs. Jefferson said. At Boces, half of the day is spent on required academic subjects and the other half on learning a marketable skill. Although the students are steered toward less traditional areas, such as electronics, word and data processing and welding, many choose courses in cosmetology or the health professions, preparing for jobs as nurses' aides or medical assistants. The program is financed under a State Department of Education grant, but because the class is underutilized by the school districts, future funds, at least from the state, may be in jeopardy. Twenty-three high schools and 28 school districts are eligible to use the program free of cost, but only eight high schools are doing so. Students are referred to the class by school nurses and guidance counselors, and although they ''are a link to the kids, we are not 100 percent sure they all know about the program,'' Mrs. Strongin said. Many school administrators, she contends, refuse to admit that there is a teen-age pregnancy problem. ''I talked to one district superintendent who said his district had only one or two pregnancies a year - and I know for a fact that there were at least 30,'' Mrs. Strongin said. ''We know the numbers are there, we just have to figure out a way to reach them.'' Meanwhile, the program has the support of the teachers and administrators. ''It would be prehistoric to abolish the program at this point - it's absolutely essential that the program continue,'' said Linda Einhorn, who teaches the class English and social studies. One alternative to the state funds may be for the districts to pay for the class directly instead of paying for home tutoring, considered the second best option by the program's supporters. ''With home tutoring, the girls are taught in isolation,'' Miss Einhorn said. ''They don't get child care information or peer group counseling, where they can talk openly about anything and everything.'' Jeffrey Sardegna, a math and science teacher, added: ''We need the support of all the high schools to survive. They've only recently been giving the girls home teaching. Instead of paying for that, the districts could pay for this. The districts have to pick it up or it will die.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DIOXIN'S PERIL TO HUMANS: PROOF IS ELUSIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/dioxin-s-peril-to-humans-proof-is-elusive.html,"The deadly chemical dioxin, an unwanted byproduct of herbicides, pesticides and other industrial products, is raising increasing concern among government agencies, scientific researchers and people who may come in contact with it. Communities from New York to Oregon have reported human health problems that they fear are linked to exposure to dioxin, although the links have not been proved scientifically. Officials in Missouri say the number of sites there believed contaminated by the chemical has risen to about 100, and Gov. Christopher S. Bond has asked his Legislature to set up a special fund to help clean them up. Dioxin, he said, could lead to ''public hysteria'' if not handled properly. Accord on Animal Research Research biologists and environmental scientists generally agree that in laboratory experiments on animals, dioxin has more harmful effects, and in smaller doses, than any chemical man has produced. Twenty-five millionths of a gram is known to be potent enough to kill a two-pound animal. There are 28 grams in an ounce. But scientific proof of the effect on humans has been elusive. Conducting tests of toxic chemicals on people is ethically unacceptable, and establishing epidemiological proof by looking for correlations between exposure and effect on a given population is not always possible. In some cases, cancer may not develop for 30 years after exposure to a chemical carcinogen. Among the other unknowns about dioxin is how much of it there is in the country and how much is being produced. Dioxin is nearly insoluble in water, but it clings tightly to soil particles and dissolves in organic solvents like alcohol or oil. It can enter the body by direct skin contact, ingestion or inhalation. Dioxin was contained in oil sprayed almost a decade ago as a dustcontrol measure at horse stables and along roadsides throughout eastern Missouri. In recent months, concern has arisen about dioxin's long-lasting effects on residents of Times Beach, Mo., and other areas, and state and Federal officials have been finding more and more sites at which the chemical was dumped. Dioxin was among the hazardous chemicals found in 1978 at the Love Canal near a residential neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y., and it has been found at individual dump sites elsewhere in the country. It was also a chemical contaminant of the defoliant Agent Orange, used in Vietnam. Humans who have been exposed to it near Love Canal, in Vietnam or in situations such as train wrecks or factory explosions have suffered a variety of severe health problems, including kidney and liver ailments, birth defects and cancer. But whether it was the dioxin that caused the ailments among the humans exposed to it has not been determined to the satisfaction of medical researchers. The Veterans Administration, which has said it will seek to determine whether a link exists among Vietnam veterans, has relinquished control of the project to the Federal Centers for Disease Control. Scientists Are Progressing Only in recent months have scientists begun to make what they now regard as an important breakthrough. They believe a clearer understanding of the effect of dioxin on health is emerging. Not until recent years were many physicians even trained to recognize symptoms of so-called chemical diseases. Moreover, scientists, underscoring the frequent difficulty in proving cause and effect in medicine, emphasize that it took 40 years to establish a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, even though the evidence seemed to point that way all along. Now, in a series of experiments reported most recently in last November's issue of the scientific journal Nature, a member of the dioxin group of compounds, one called 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzene-pdioxin, or TCDD, has been shown to be what is called a potent ''tumor promoter'' in rats and mice. According to the paper, by Dr. Alan Poland and others at the University of Wisconsin's McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, the model of tumor production derived from these experiments is relevant to humans because the excessive multiplication of cells in the skin of mice is strikingly similar to that evoked by TCDD in human skin. Dr. Poland said TCDD did not appear to be a complete carcinogen by itself. But he said it enhanced morbid growth in cells already exposed to potential cancer-causing agents; that is, exposure to TCDD, in conspiracy with other environmental factors, brings on the cancer. 'Basic Mechanism Is the Same' ''There is no question that dioxin plays a role in tumor formation in animals, and almost certainly has the same action on human cells,'' said Dr. Howard Eisen, a medical officer at the National Institutes of Health. ''The basic mechanism is the same.'' TCDD is the variety of dioxin found in Agent Orange, which is a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides, and the variety confirmed in Missouri soil by the Environmental Protection Agency. Members of the dioxin family, known as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, or PCDD's, are byproducts not only of herbicides and pesticides but also of dyes, pharmaceuticals, wood preservatives and other products known generally as chlorinated phenols. In general, these synthetic organic compounds are formed by adding chlorine to hydrocarbon molecules that are derived from petroleum. Two decades ago commercial 2,4,5-T often contained as much as 70,000 parts per billion of TCDD and sometimes more. But manufacturers say current techniques can reduce it to a level of less than 10 parts per billion. The industry maintains that it can assure safe products, especially since the material sprayed on fields is heavily diluted. What Spraying Might Do If the TCDD content of commercial 2,4,5-T is 100 parts per billion, for example, a single spraying might cause surface soil concentrations of 0.02 parts per trillion. Estimates of TCDD soil contamination from Agent Orange in Vietnam are about 0.08 parts per billion. Spokesmen at the Dow Chemical Corporation said that by testing their output of the dichlorophenol herbicide 2,4-D nine times every 24 hours, they make sure dioxin contamination never exceeds 1 part per billion. Although 2,4-D is closely related to 2,4,5-T, it is not generally contaminated with TCDD. It does contain other less toxic dioxins, though there has been almost no research on the effects of these substances. The possible risk posed by even that level of dioxin must be weighed, industry spokesmen say, against the enormous economic value of the products. Industry specialists say they believe, further, that the risk is not so high as to require special precautions other than those always taken in handling hazardous substances like herbicides and pesticides. Advice From Disease Agency Assessing that risk is, of course, part of the problem. Researchers say the risk begins to appear in animals with exposure in the partsper-1,000-billion range. The Centers for Disease Control have advised Missouri officials that materials containing more than one part per billion of TCDD should be removed from residential areas. But that figure itself has caused some confusion. Dr. Renate D. Kimbrough of the Federal disease agency expressed annoyance with some news accounts that reported, incorrectly, that the agency considered dioxin concentrations below 1 part per billion in soil to be ''safe.'' Although this is the detection limit being used in soil tests at residential areas in Missouri, she said, it represents a compromise between health concerns and cleanup practicalities. Dr. Kimbrough said exposure to lower concentrations over extended periods could still present health risk. In one area of Missouri, the Environmental Protection Agency said, dioxin was found last fall in surface soil concentrations of 300 parts per billion. The Federal agency calculates that exposure to this soil presents an added cancer risk, for children who ingest it regularly, of as much as 35 percent. That is, these children have a 35 percent greater chance of contracting cancer in their lifetime than those who do not ingest the soil. This is regarded as above the approximately 30 percent risk of cancer that all Americans face. The special properties of chlorinated phenols, of which dioxins can be a byproduct, are what make them so useful to an industrial society. But those properties, such as heat resistance and electrical resistance, insolubility in water, and chemical durability, are also what make the phenols biologically threatening. Among other things, the substances may collect in living organisms at higher concentrations than in the surrounding ecosystem, a process known as bioaccumulation. Problem With Enzymes In virtually all types of tissue in every animal species tested, Dr. Poland of the University of Wisconsin's laboratory said in an interview, TCDD induces the production of enzymes that are the organism's attempt to metabolize, or render harmless, the chemical irritant. But the enzymes are now often thought of as a double-edged sword, because organisms that have a high capacity for producing them are more susceptible to tumors at the spot where a carcinogen is administered while those with a low capacity show distant cancers such as leukemia or lymphomas. Dr. Daniel Nebert, the branch chief of developmental pharmacology at the National Institutes of Health, who is also active in dioxin research, concurred with Dr. Poland's findings, calling them a ''major breakthrough.'' Other scientists generally agreed with that assessment. According to Dr. Nancy Kim of the New York State Department of Health's toxic substances assessment unit, TCDD fits into one of two major cancer theories. In the first, the hypothesis is that merely one foreign molecule attaching to DNA can set off the cancer process. Because TCDD does not bind appreciably to DNA, it does not match this scheme. But its ability to cause excessive cell multiplication, known as hyperplasia, does fit the second theory, that cancer is caused by repeated irritation of tissues. Although scientists believe that current laboratory work showing the similarities in animal and human cancer mechanisms has taken the research a crucial step forward, such theoretical work is only half the puzzle-solving process. The other half is human epidemiology, a tedious, time-consuming matter hindered by all the real-world ambiguities that laboratory work can filter out. Study of Chemical Plant Workers Scientists at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are studying an unusually high incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas among workers exposed to dioxin at two chemical companies in Michigan and West Virginia. In a letter to the medical journal Lancet for the January 1981 issue, the researchers reported that three of 105 workers who died suffered from the rare cancer. This was 2.9 percent of the deaths in the group; the general population would be expected to show only seven one-hundredths of one percent. The study might provide the first international confirmation of a 1977 report from Sweden suggesting that forestry workers exposed to 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have a roughly fivefold higher incidence of softtissue sarcomas. In addition, several studies have revealed an increased incidence of Hodgkin's disease in lumberjacks and woodworkers. A Lancet editorial noted last year that any change in the pattern of sarcomas, ''even in small numbers of cases,'' might strengthen the causative association with dioxin. Studies by Dr. Bertram Carnow, an occupational health consultant and editor of the Journal of Occupational Medicine, examined a group of 47 men from 1980 to 1982 who had been exposed to dioxin after a railroad accident in 1979. In an interview, Dr. Carnow said the exposure varied from 8 hours to 90 days at concentrations in soil or liquid runoff of about 30 parts per billion. Five of the men, or 10.6 percent, have developed skin cancers; the expected incidence in the general population is about 0.17 percent a year. A significant number of other disorders was also observed. ''The only safe level of dioxin is nondetectable,'' said Dr. Carnow, whose medical practice in Chicago has treated nearly 300 cases of dioxin exposure. Besides the role of TCDD in causing cancer, the other great area of medical concern regards apparently related fetus damage and other reproductive problems. For animals, the evidence is straightforward and overwhelming. TCDD injures or kills animal embryos at doses as low as one billionth of a gram administered per kilogram of body weight per day. For humans, however, the record so far is circumstantial. The Environmental Protection Agency used emergency powers in 1979 to ban virtually all use of 2,4,5-T in the United States after discovering a higher than normal rate of spontaneous abortions in an Oregon region that had been sprayed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TO RETAIN POWER OVER THE LIFE-BEARERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/24/opinion/l-to-retain-power-over-the-life-bearers-180428.html,"To the Editor: In ''Abortion: The Court Was Right'' (Op-Ed Jan. 14), Lawrence Lader chose to defend the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing all abortions by these arguments (in his order): he Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Moral Majority failed to get Congress to pass their bills; fanatical new-right extremists burn down abortion clinics; they kidnapped a doctor; the Roman Catholic hierarchy flouts its tax-exemption status; anti-abortionism fuses Catholic, fundamentalist and conservative right wings; the Long Island Right-to-Life Party received fewer votes in the past election; the attacks on Roe v. Wade are fanatical. These are more distortions than facts. The facts are: Neither the bishops nor the Moral Majority control the Right-to-Life movement. Many liberals support the movement. Most Americans oppose abortion on demand. Pro-life leaders are more likely to be economic liberals than the general population. No pro-life group has been accused of kidnapping or arson by any court. One clear casualty in the abortion controversy is rational discourse. By stigmatizing criticism of Roe v. Wade as fanatical, Lader cheapens political debate.

A Monkey Wrench for Family Planning,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/24/opinion/a-monkey-wrench-for-family-planning.html,"Since 1978, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, under a grant from the Federal Agency for International Development, has been publishing and distributing International Family Planning Perspectives, a quarterly that goes to about 25,000 family planning workers around the world. All are on an A.I.D.-approved list and most work in countries that are actual or potential recipients of American development assistance. For its recipients, who disseminate family planning information, the publication is an invaluable way to keep up with the field. The articles are in English, but followed by French and Spanish synopses. The A.I.D. subsidy is essential to the journal's survival: soliciting subscriptions from a third-world audience is costly and futile, and the quarterly has no advertising. Yet that subsidy is now in jeopardy; over the objections of its own Office of Population, the A.I.D. Communications Review Board wants to cancel the journal's grant. The review board's case against the publication is hard to make out. Richard Miller, the board's chairman, says journal funding is exorbitant when compared with that of A.I.D.'s in-house publication, Horizons. But he is comparing apples and oranges: Perspectives is a journal of scientific research, Horizons a kind of house organ. Mr. Miller also questions the wisdom of sending a journal written in English to a mostly foreign audience. He neglects to mention that a Spanish edition was terminated last year or the addition of the French and Spanish synopses. Furthermore, Mr. Miller says, the board has judged the journal to be ''clearly inconsistent'' with Administration and A.I.D. policy on abortion. But he doesn't explain that the board specifically criticized only two articles. One assessed the consequences of illegal abortion for mortality rates in Bangladesh; the other mentioned that abortion was legal in Tunisia. Both had been approved by A.I.D. before publication. The Communication Review Board's mandate was to carry out ''waste reduction.'' Nowhere does its mandate mention throwing a wrench into America's support, over two decades, of family planning around the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Valentine's Jan. 14 Op-Ed piece is that his constituency ''does not have its own self-interest at stake.'' Of course it does. Where else does it draw its energy from? The interest is in the enforcement and perpetuation of power over the life-bearers of the family, the same interest that lies behind the move to inform parents about their daughters' (but not their sons') use of birth control. The only real threat to male domination in the history of human society has been the move by some women to assume responsibility for the ongoing quality of life of the species: to choose when and under what circumstances to have their children. While elsewhere men are moving irresponsibly toward annihilating life in their unending struggle for power, it is grotesque that in this arena of family affairs it is the advocates of domination who style themselves Right-to-Lifers.

ABORTION OPPOSITION STRESSED IN KIDNAPPING TRIAL IN ILLINOIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/abortion-opposition-stressed-in-kidnapping-trial-in-illinois.html,"The attorney for a man on trial in the abduction of a doctor who performed abortions in nearby Granite City has made his client's opposition to abortion a central part of the defense. Federal prosecutors say the defendant, Don Benny Anderson, 42 years old, of Pearland, Tex., is one of three men asserting that they are the ''army of God'' who abducted Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife, Rosalie Jean, last August. The prosecutors say the men threatened to kill Dr. Zevallos and his wife if President Reagan did not announce an end to legal abortion. The men also demanded that the doctor close his clinic in Granite City. Dr. Zevallos, 53, and his wife were released unharmed near their home near Edwardsville, Ill., after being held for eight days in an abandoned ammunition bunker about 120 miles north of their home. Mr. Anderson is charged with attempting and conspiring to obstruct interstate commerce through threats or violence. No Federal kidnapping charges could be filed because no state line was crossed. State kidnapping charges are pending. Sought Public Sentiment Mr. Anderson's attorney, Wayne T. Schoeneberg, said in opening statements to the jury today that the three men did not make a direct threat to Mr. and Mrs. Zevallos over the operation of the doctor's clinic. Mr. Schoeneberg stressed the abortion issue in his opening statements and his cross-examination of Dr. Zevallos today. ''These three men had a very, very strong belief that abortion was wrong and abortion in this country should end,'' he said. ''Their purpose in going there was to kidnap Dr. Zevallos and his wife and hold them to gain public sentiment to end abortions,'' he told the jury. Abortion Issue Discussed Mr. Schoeneberg repeatedly asked Dr. Zevallos if the men had tried to convince him in the course of his captivity that abortion was wrong and that he should stop performing abortions at his clinic. Dr. Zevallos testified that he had discussed the abortion issue with the men and had challenged their assertions that abortion is wrong. But Dr. Zevallos said the men often threatened to kill him and his wife if they did not obey the men's commands or if they did not agree to close the clinic. Under questioning by Mr. Schoeneberg, Mr. Zevallos confirmed that his clinic has performed at least 70 abortions a week since it opened in 1974. Revelations From God Cited Dr. Zevallos testified that the man he identified as Mr. Anderson, who he usually called the older of his abductors, told him that he had received revelations from God to undertake a crusade against abortion. The man said he and his friends had tried to get abortion stopped by peaceful actions, but had burned and bombed several clinics and would continue to do so until legal abortions were ended. The doctor testified that he and his wife believed they would be killed. Even when they were told they were to driven home and released unharmed, the doctor said, he did not believe it. When the men told them to remove their blindfolds, the doctor testified, he and his wife begged to leave theirs on because they were afraid they would be killed once they saw the men's faces again. Lawyer Volunteers Counsel Mr. Schoeneberg is defending Mr. Anderson without charge. The lawyer offered his services after reading about the case. He said he decided to help not only because he was intrigued by the legal aspects of the charges issued by a Federal grand jury but also because he opposes abortion. One of the two men charged pleaded guilty Friday and is to testify against Mr. Anderson. He is Wayne A. Moore, 18 years old, of New Caney, Tex.. Mr. Moore's brother, Matthew M. Moore, 20, also of New Caney, is charged with being the third abductor and is awaiting trial. The trial is expected to last about a week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HISTORIC REVISION OF CATHOLIC LAWS SIGNED BY PONTIFF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/historic-revision-of-catholic-laws-signed-by-pontiff.html,"Pope John Paul II signed a new code of canon law today that incorporates many of the historic changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council and other reforms that flowed from it. The new code will not officially take effect until Nov. 27, but most of the changes have already been put into practice by the clergy and the 750 million Roman Catholics around the world. The signing ceremony symbolized the closing of an important chapter in the church's modern history, which began on this date 24 years ago when Pope John XXIII announced his intention to summon the first ecumenical council of the 20th century to discuss church doctrine. Era of Debate Was Opened It was a decision that set in motion events that after his death led to Vatican II in the mid-1960's, a council that liberalized the church and its rituals, and ushered in an era of debate among the clergy and the laity. ''We recommend ourselves to the mercy of God because this is a historic event, and it is up to those who come after us to judge what we have done,'' Pope John Paul II said at the signing ceremony. The new code sweeps away vestiges of authoritarian church law, broadens the role of the laity and decentralizes the church by extending more authority to the bishops. Yet it also upholds traditional church law on issues that are of great interest to many Catholics, particularly women's rights advocates. Abortion Penalty Retained For instance, it retains the penalty of automatic excommunication for undergoing or performing an abortion, reserves the right of ordination into the priesthood for men only and leaves unchanged the church's bans on contraception and divorce. On the last issue, the revised code places limits on an experimental program among American Catholics that made it easier to obtain annulments of marriages from the church. The old code, rewritten in 1917, named 37 offenses that resulted in immediate and automatic excommunication, which bars a person from receiving the sacraments of the church. That list has been reduced to seven. Code Must Be Translated The text of the Pope's official statement on the signing of the code will not be released until Wednesday, the Vatican announced. The code is not expected to be made public until next week, when copies will be distributed in Latin. Then begins a nine-month effort to translate it into many languages and distribute it around the world for Catholics to discuss. It is not expected that the actual promulgation of the code will directly affect or influence Catholics in a major way since most of the changes have been introduced in a piecemeal fashion over the last two decades by church decree or accepted practice. ''A document that would have been considered revolutionary 20 years ago actually contains very few surprises today,'' said the Rev. Vincent O'Keefe, former president of Fordham University in New York and now a senior official with the Society of Jesus headquarters in Rome. ''It's been talked about for nearly a quarter of a century, and now that it's here everyone is looking ahead to the unfinished work of Vatican II, the reorganization of the Curia and the intellectual and spiritual formation of seminarians.'' In a Vatican news conference today, summaries of the code were presented by canon law experts and others who had a hand in its preparation. One unexpected change came in the details of the expansion of the laity's role at the parish level. In a departure from previous practice, it will now be possible for lay people, men and women alike, to fill some priestly duties in parishes where there is a shortage of priests, according to Bishop Jose Rosalio Castillo Lara, head of the Vatican commission that has been working on the new code for 17 years. He said lay people could be granted permission by the episcopal authorities to manage a parish, perform weddings, officiate at funeral rites and take charge of religious training. They will not, however, be authorized to say mass or hear confessions, he said. The code also formalizes other advances already put into practice that were not available to women when the code was last rewritten. For example, women can now become diocesan chancellors, auditors, assessors, financial administrators and seminary board members. They can also serve on diocesan annulment tribunals. More Parity for Couples In addition, husbands and wives are treated with greater parity, and women's religious orders are given more administrative autonomy than in the past. The 1917 code had 2,414 canons, or articles of law, contained in five books. The new one has 1,752 canons in seven books. Among the old laws extensively altered were the ones that dealt with acts that result in excommunication. The seven remaining excommunicative offenses are abortion, violation of the confidentiality of confession, absolution by a priest of a person who has committed a sin with the priest's assistance, profanation of the consecrated communion host, consecration of a bishop without Vatican approval, a physical attack on the Pope and heresy and ''abandoning the faith,'' which in 1949 Pope Pius XII interpreted as applicable to ''active members'' of the Communist Party. Several Italian cities today are controlled politically by Communists, including Rome, Florence, Naples and Milan. Ban on Political Office In political matters, the code retains a law that excludes priests and nuns from political office except in special cases and also bars them from leadership roles in labor unions. ''They must favor peace and accord based on justice,'' Pio Ciprotti, an expert on canon law, said at the news conference. ''But they cannot assume political office or leadership roles in labor unions unless local bishops decide otherwise for the common good or defense of the church.'' Among former church laws dropped in the new code are restrictions against cremation, marriages with non-Catholic Christians and membership in the Masons unless these acts are done expressly to defame the church and its teachings. Also discarded were old laws carrying the penalty of automatic excommunication that proscribed the publishing of books defending heresy, reading such books without the express permission of the church or making false relics for sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHEN BIRTH CONTROL IS NOT ENOUGH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/28/opinion/l-when-birth-control-is-not-enough-193312.html,"To the Editor: Is it ''squealing'' (as you call it in your Jan. 13 editorial ''Who Runs Health and Welfare?'') when parents are informed that their children are attending a family planning clinic? The problem of parental involvement seems too complex to be disposed of so cavalierly. Many young teen-agers are sexually active not by mature choice but because of loneliness, peer pressure or feelings of inadequacy. Many of these youngsters, overwhelmed by emotional involvements, need and wish for parental help, but because of guilt feelings are afraid to ask for it. I have worked with many young girls who found themselves pregnant and, after initial reluctance, accepted the advice to turn to their parents and experienced immense relief. The quandary is this: Do we go with privacy, thereby protecting those teen-agers whose parents would be excessively punitive but harming those who would be helped by concerned parents? Or do we mandate disclosure, helping those youngsters who profit from parental involvement but hurting those whose parents are incapable of helping? Clearly, neither approach is to be recommended. Perhaps, supplementary to the privacy solution, family planning centers need to provide counseling and offer help to youngsters who basically wish to involve their parents but are fearful of doing so. Just handing out contraceptives or making abortions available does not solve many of the problems that these youngsters frequently encounter. DORIT B. WHITEMAN, Queens Village, N.Y., Jan. 19, 1983.

ABORTION FOE IS CONVICTED IN COUPLE'S ABDUCTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/28/us/abortion-foe-is-convicted-in-couple-s-abduction.html,"The leader of a small anti-abortion group called the Army of God was found guilty today of trying to close an abortion clinic by abducting its owner and his wife. Don Benny Anderson was convicted by a jury of seven men and five women that deliberated about three hours. The defense attorney, Wayne T. Schoeneberg, who spent only 10 minutes on his presentation, did not dispute evidence that Mr. Anderson and two others abducted Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife and held them captive for eight days in a concrete bunker. Mr. Schoeneberg told the jurors in closing arguments that the three ''had a sincere, firm, honest belief that abortion is wrong and that by their acts, abortion could be brought to an end in this country.'' ''I'm not saying the Zevalloses deserved to be in that bunker,'' Mr. Schoeneberg added, ''even though some people might believe that because of the horrible business he is in.'' Guilty on Two Counts Mr. Anderson, 42 years old, of Pearland, Tex., was found guilty on two counts of attempting to obstruct interstate commerce and conspiring to do so. Each count could bring a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The authorities say the other members of the group were Wayne A. Moore, 18, and his brother, Matthew, 20. Wayne Moore has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and his brother is awaiting trial. The Federal indictment did not charge Mr. Anderson with kidnapping because the Zevalloses were not taken across state lines. However, state officials said they would await the outcome of the Federal trial to determine whether other charges would be lodged. The Government presented witnesses who testified Dr. Zevallos's business, the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, was involved in interstate commerce. Mrs. Zevallos, who wept throughout her testimony, said she and her husband were constantly threated with death after they were abducted from their home on Aug. 12. Handcuffed and Blindfolded She said they were kept handcuffed and blindfolded in a sweltering, abandoned ammunition bunker and were fed peanut butter sandwiches and soda. They were forced to used a large bucket as a lavatory, she said. Mrs. Zevallos said they were released unharmed only after she persuaded her husband to tell the captors he would stop performing abortions. ''These criminal acts are the cause and the foundation of the indictments here,'' Frederick Hess, the United States Attorney, said in his summation. ''This is nothing more than criminal conduct cloaked in a cause after he was caught.'' Mr. Anderson, who has seven children, did not testify. Mr. Schoeneberg read excerpts from a rambling letter written by Mr. Anderson and delivered to the authorities in the midst of the abduction. The letter, which Mr. Anderson called an ''epistle'' written in the ''voice of God,'' denounced abortion and demanded that President Reagan speak out publicly against it. ''The Army of God is eternal and those who fight for right are the Army of God,'' said the letter. ''We, the Army of God, have no intentions of forcing any beliefs on anyone.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDY FINDS FEWER FRESHMEN IN COLLEGE LOOK TO TEACHING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/29/us/study-finds-fewer-freshmen-in-college-look-to-teaching.html,"College freshmen today are less interested in becoming teachers than at any time in the last 17 years, according to a national survey sponsored by the American Council on Education and the University of California at Los Angeles. Further, the survey indicates that freshmen are more materialistic and show less social concern than in past years, consistent with a trend that began in the middle 1970's. At the same time, an increasing percentage of freshmen say they approve of sex if ''people like each other,'' believe abortion should be legalized and favor a national health care plan. The profile of the freshman class is produced annually by the education council and researchers at U.C.L.A., providing a yardstick against which changes in the attitudes and characteristics of college students can be measured. Providing Reflection on Values Information on career interests is considered especially important because it reflects the values of students and predicts rises and declines in the popularity of certain professions. ''Since 1966, when 21.7 percent of the entering freshmen were planning careers as schoolteachers, student interest has declined steadily to the point where only 4.7 percent of the 1982 freshmen aspire to teaching careers,'' says the report on the survey, ''The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1982.'' The eroding interest in teaching seems to hold unfortunate consequences for elementary and secondary education in the country, coming at a time when education officials say that fewer and fewer good candidates are entering teaching programs. An especially serious shortage of teachers has developed in certain fields such as mathematics and science and further disenchantment on the part of college students seems to pose problems for school systems trying to fill vacancies. A 'Grim' Outlook Is Seen ''When these trends are viewed in the light of other recent data about prospective school teachers, the outlook for our educational system is grim,'' said Alexander W. Astin, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the university, which conducted the survey. ''Since recent studies of college admissions tests show that education majors have much weaker academic skills than students majoring in most other fields,'' Dr. Astin continued, ''it appears that we are headed for a crisis not only in the quantity, but also in the quality of persons who want to teach in our elementary and scondary schools.'' The fields whose popularity is rising among freshmen, who in many cases start the major area of study upon entering college, are business, engineering and computer programming. The percentage of freshmen choosing these three fields as career choices reached a record in the 1982 survey. Business has shown the sharpest rise of all, capturing the allegiance of 20.2 percent of the freshmen in 1982, as against 11.6 percent in 1966. Better Pay as a Lure The move toward better-paying professions seems to be an important factor in the decline of interest in teaching. More than two-thirds of the freshmen, 68.9 percent, said that being ''very well off financially'' was an essential objective. This was a goal of 65.2 percent of the freshmen last year and 43.5 percent in 1967. At the same time, to ''make more money'' was a reason ''very important in deciding to go to college'' for 69.8 percent of this year's freshmen, as against 67 percent last year and 49.9 percent in 1971. The altruistic goals embraced by so many college freshmen in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when the campuses become centers of dissent against the Vietnam War, are less and less evident, according to the survey. Students placed less importance than in other recent years on cleaning up the environment, helping people in difficulty, promoting racial understanding and developing a meaningful philosophy of life. ''This would appear to be a general societal phenomenon,'' said Dr. Astin. A Crowded Middle of the Road In identifying their political orientation, 1.8 percent called themselves far left, 18.9 percent were liberal, 59.8 percent were middle-of-the-road, 18.4 percent were conservative and 1 percent were far right. The attitudes of the freshmen on a number of social issues were mixed. As against a year ago, fewer freshmen favored abolishing the death penalty or giving preferential treatment to the disadvantaged. And more thought criminals had too many rights and were against the legalization of marijuana. At same time, however, more approved of school busing to achieve racial balance, and fewer would prohibit homosexual relations. The survey report is based on the responses of 188,692 full-time freshmen with the results weighted to reflect a representative national sample. Dr. Astin was assisted by Margo King Hemond and Gerald T. Richardson of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program.

LEARNING FROM DISNEY AND DICKENS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/books/learning-from-disney-and-dickens.html,"The following essay, which he titled ''Cartoons,'' was one of the last works of the novelist, short story writer and essayist, John Gardner, who died in a motorcycle accident last September at the age of 49. It forms part of a forthcoming book of essays by diverse writers, ''In Praise of What Persists,'' edited by Stephen Berg. TRYING to figure out the chief influences on my work as a writer turns out to be mainly a problem of deciding what not to include. I grew up in a family where literary influence was everywhere, including under the bridge on our dirt road, where I kept my comic books. My father is a memorizer of poetry and scripture, a magnificent performer in the old reciter tradition. (I once did a reading in Rochester, N.Y., near Batavia, where I grew up. After I'd finished several people remarked that I was a wonderful reader - ''though not quite up to your father, of course.'') He did readings of everything from Edgar Guest to Shakespeare and The Book of Job at the monthly Grange meetings, in schools, churches, hospitals. While he milked the cows, my mother (who'd once been his high school English teacher) would read Shakespeare's plays aloud to him from her three-legged stool behind the gutter, and he would take, yelling from the cow's flank, whatever part he'd decided on that night - Macbeth, King Lear, Hamlet and so on. My mother was a well-known performer too, except that she mainly sang. She had one of those honey-sweet Welsh soprano voices and sang everything from anthems to the spirituals she'd learned from an old black woman who took care of her during her childhood in Missouri. Often my mother performed in blackface, with a red bandana, a practice that may sound distasteful unless you understand that she wasn't kidding; she was authentic, flatting, quarter-toning, belting it out: She was amazing. They frequently worked together, my mother and father, and were known all over western New York. Sometimes they were in plays - my mother often directed - and wherever they went, riding around in the beat-up farm truck or just sitting in the kitchen, they sang, always in harmony, like crazy people. The house was full of books, very few of them books that would now be thought fashionable aside from the Shakespeare and Dickens. My parents read aloud a lot - the narrative poems of Scott, miles of Longfellow, spooky stories by Edgar Allan Poe, the poems of Tennyson and Browning, also rather goofy religious writers (I loved them; what did I know?) like Lloyd C. Douglas and some woman whose name escapes me now, who wrote Jesus-filled love stories with titles like ''A Patch of Blue.'' My grandmother, who was bedridden through much of my childhood, was especially fond of this religious lady, and one of my more pleasant chores was to read her these tender little novels. The climax was always the moment the boy shyly touched the girl's hand. I've never found anything more sexually arousing than that Jesus-filled, long-delayed touch. I mean it was smut, it nearly made me a pervert, and not a court in the land could nail her. My favorite authors, at least when I was between the ages of 8 and 18, were in what might be described as the nonrealistic tradition: God, Dickens and Disney. One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible from one end to the other. Reading the Bible straight through is at least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin. But the good parts are, of course, simply amazing. God is an extremely uneven writer, but when He's good, nobody can touch him. I learned to find the good parts easily (some very sexy stuff here too), and both the poetry and the storytelling had a powerful effect on what I think good fiction ought to be! Dickens I ran into when I was in my early teens, when I began to find the Hardy boys tiresome and unconvincing. I never liked realism much, but the irrealism of two boys having long conversations while riding on motorcycles (I was big on motorcycles myself) was more than I could put up with. Running across Dickens was like finding a secret door. I read book after book, and when I'd finished the last one I remember feeling a kind of horror, as if suddenly the color had gone out of the world; then luckily I discovered that when you went back to one of the ones you had read first, you couldn't remember half of it, you could read it again and find it even better, so life wasn't quite as disappointing as for a moment I'd thought. For me at that time Disney and Dickens were practically indistinguishable. Both created wonderful cartoon images, told stories as direct as fairy tales, knew the value of broad comedy spiced up with a little weeping. I have since learned that Dickens is occasionally profound, as Disney never deigns to be; but that was never why I valued Dickens or have, now, a bust of him in my study to keep me honest. Unconsciously -without ever hearing the term, in fact - I learned about symbolism from Dickens and Disney, with the result that I would never learn to appreciate, as I suppose one should, those realistic writers who give you life data wihout resonance, things merely as they are. Dickens's symbolism may never be very deep -the disguised witches and fairy princesses, Uriah Heep and his mother flapping around like buzzards, or all the self-conscious folderol of ''A Tale of Two Cities'' - but in my experience, anyway, it spoils you forever for books that never go oo-boom. There were other important influences during this period of my life, probably the most important of which was opera. The Eastman School of Music presented operas fairly often (and of course played host to traveling opera companies, including the Met). From Dickens and Disney (not to mention God) it took no adjustment to become opera-addicted. The plots of most operas (not all, heaven knows) are gloriously simple-minded or, to put it more favorably, elemental; the stage is nothing if not a grand cartoon (Wagner's mountainscapes and gnomes, Mozart's crazies, Humperdinck's angels, the weirdness and clowning that show up everywhere from ''La Boheme'' to ''The Tales of Hoffmann''). I was by this time playing French horn, and of course I'd always been around singing. So I got hooked at once - hence my special fondness now for writing librettos. By the time I reached college my taste was, I'm afraid, hopelessly set. Predictably I was ravished by Melville - all those splendid cartoon images, for instance Ahab and the Chinese coolies he's kept hidden until the first time he needs to lower away after whale - and of course by Milton, who must be considered one of the all-time great cartoonists, as when Satan Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; sometimes He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery concave touring high. (It's true, Milton's a little boring now and then, and Milton teachers often don't properly value the cartoonist in him and want to know things about ''Paradise Lost'' that only some kind of crazy could get seriously interested in; but never mind.) I'm afraid the embarrassing truth is that the whole literary tradition opened out, for me, from Disney and his kind. I got caught up in the mighty cartoons of Homer and Dante, (much later Virgil and Apollonius), the less realistic 18th-and 19th-century novelists (Fielding, Smollett, Collins and the rest), the glorious mad Russians (Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Bely), and those kinds of poets who fill one's head with strange, intense visions, like Blake, Coleridge and Keats. FOR me the whole world of literature was at this time one of grand cartoons. I thought of myself mainly as a chemistry major and took courses in English just for fun. I guess I thought literature was unserious, like going to the movies or playing in a dance band, even an orchestra. It did not seem to me that one ought to spend one's life on mere pleasure, like a butterfly or cricket. Beethoven, Shakespeare, Richard Strauss, Conan Doyle might be a delight, but to fritter away one's life in the arts seemed, well, not quite honest. Then I came across the New Criticism. At the first college I went to (for two years) I'd read nearly all of the Modern Library, partly for fun, partly because I felt ignorant around my fellow students, people who could talk with seeming wisdom about Camus and Proust, Nietzsche and Plato - I soon discovered they hadn't really read what they claimed to have read, they'd just come from the right part of town - but I'd never in any serious sense ''studied'' literature. (I took a couple of courses where one was examined on what Carlyle and Cardinal Newman said, without much emphasis on why or to whom). But when I moved to Washington University in St. Louis I got a whole new vision of what literature was for - that is, the vision of the New Criticism. Like the fanatic I've always been, I fell to analyzing fiction, digging out symbols and structural subtleties, learning about ''levels'' and so on. I don't say this was a foolish activity - in fact I think the New Critics were basically right: It's much more interesting and rewarding to talk about how literature ''works'' than to read biographies of the writer, which is mainly what the New Criticism replaced. Working with the famous books by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, I began to love things in fiction and poetry that I'd never before noticed, things like meaning and design, and, like all my generation, I made the great discovery that literature is worthwhile, not a thing to be scorned by serious puritans but a thing to be embraced and turned cunningly to advantage. I learned that literature is Good for you, and that writers who are not deeply philosophical should be scorned. I began to read realists - two of whom, Jane Austen and James Joyce, I actually liked - and I began to write ''serious'' fiction; that is, instead of writing pleasant jingles or stories I desperately hoped would be published in The Saturday Evening Post or maybe Manhunt, I began shyly eyeing The Kenyon Review. With a sigh of relief (though I'd enjoyed them, in a way) I quit math and science and signed up, instead, for courses in philosophy and sociology and psychology, which I knew would make me a better person and perhaps a famous writer so brilliant and difficult that to get through my books you would need a teacher. This period lasted longer than I care to admit. On the basis of my earnestness and a more or less astonishing misreading of Nietzsche (I was convinced that he was saying that only fiction can be truly philosophical) I won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to the University of Iowa, where I meant to study in the famous Writers' Workshop but soon ended up taking medieval languages and literature, the literature God had been nudging me toward all along: ''Beowulf,'' ''The Divine Comedy,'' the Gawain poet and Chaucer. The scales fell from my eyes. My New Critical compulsion to figure out exactly how everything works, how every nuance plays against every other, had suddenly an immense field to plow. I continued to read and think about other literature - I went through a Thomas Mann phase, a Henry James phase and so on - but I found myself spending more and more time trying to figure out medieval works. IT seems to me that when I began working on medieval literature, in the late 50's and early 60's, scholars knew very little about even the greatest works in that literature. No one had really figured out the structure of the works of the Gawain poet, not to mention ''Beowulf'' or the poetry of Chaucer. People were still arguing about whether or not ''Beowulf'' is a Christian poem; people were still trying to shuffle around ''The Canterbury Tales.'' The usual New Critical method, which is to stare and stare at the work until it comes clear, was useless on this material, because again and again you found yourself staring at something that felt like a symbol or an allusion, or felt that maybe it ought to be some kind of joke but you couldn't see the humor. To figure out the poem you had to figure out the world it came from - read the books the poets knew, try to understand esthetic principles abandoned and forgotten centuries ago. One had no choice but to become a sort of scholar. Literary detective work is always fun, for a certain kind of mind at least, but the work I did on medieval literature, then on later classical literature, was for me the most exciting detective work I've ever done or heard of. The thing was, not only did you solve interesting puzzles, but when you got them solved you found you'd restored something magnificent, a work of art - in the case of ''Beowulf'' or ''The Canterbury Tales'' - supremely beautiful and noble. One unearthed tricks of the craft that nobody'd known or used for a long, long time -tricks one could turn on one's own work, making it different from anybody else's and yet not crazy, not merely novel. I think every writer wants to sound like him-or herself; that's the main reason one sees so many experimental novels. And of course the risk in the pursuit of newness is that, in refusing to do what the so-called tradition does, one ends up doing exactly the same thing everybody else trying to get outside the tradition does. For better or worse (I'm no longer much concerned about whether it's better or worse), I joined up with an alternative tradition, one with which I felt almost eerily comfortable. My church-filled childhood delighted in discovering a Christianity distant enough - in fact, for all practical purposes, dead enough - to satisfy nostalgia without stirring embarrassment and annoyance, as modern Christianity does. For instance, when one reads about ''ensoulment'' in a medieval book - that is, when one reads arguments on precisely when the soul enters the fetus, and the argument comes from someone of the 13th century - one can read with interest; but when one hears a living Christian hotly debating ensoulment, hoping to be able to support abortion without feelings of guilt, one shrinks away, tries to get lost in the crowd. I found in medieval culture and art, in other words, exactly what I needed as an instrument for looking at my own time and place. I of course never became for a moment a medieval Christian believer, but medieval ideas and attitudes gave me a means of triangulating, a place to stand. And, needless to say, medieval literature had built into it everything I'd liked best from the beginning, back in the days of God, Dickens and Disney, of grotesques (cartoon people and places), noble feeling, humor (God was perhaps a little short on humor) and real storytelling. I said earlier that I'm no longer much concerned about whether the work I've done and am doing is for better or worse. That is not quite as true as I might wish. Egoistic ambition is the kind of weed that grows out of dragon's blood: The more you chop it away the more it flourishes. But it's true that at a certain point in one's career one begins to face up to one's limitations, and the way to stay sane at such a moment is to soften one's standards a little - find good reasons for approving lumpy but well-intentioned work, one's own and everybody else's. TO put all this another way, when I think back now over the influences which have helped to shape the way I write, I notice with a touch of dismay that they were as much bad influences as good ones. I won't criticize God (anyway, He's almost certainly been misquoted), but clearly the influence of Dickens and Disney was not all to the good. Both of them incline one toward stylized gestures. Instead of looking very closely at the world and writing it down, the way James Joyce does, brilliantly getting down, say, the way an old man moves his tongue over his gums, or the way a beautiful woman idly plays with her bracelets, a writer like me, seduced by cartoon vision, tends to go again and again for the same gestural gimmicks, a consistent pattern of caricature (compare the way doors in Dostoyevsky are forever flying open or slamming). I look over my fiction of 20 years and see it as one long frenzy of tics - endlessly repeated words like merely and grotesque, a disproportionate number of people with wooden fingers and a dreary penchant for frowning thoughtfully or darting their eyes around like maniacs. I seem incapable of writing a story in which people do not babble philosophically, not really because they're saying things I want to get said but because earnest babbling is one of the ways I habitually give vitality to my short-legged, overweight, twitching cartoon creations. And needless to say, from artists like Dickens and Disney I get my morbid habit of trying to make the reader fall into tender weeping. The whole New Critical period I went through, and the scholarly period that followed it, betrayed me, I think, into an excessive concern with significance. It's probably the case that novels and stories are more interesting if, in some sense or another, they mean something. But it has begun to dawn on me that - in fiction, as in all the arts - a little meaning goes a long way. I think what chiefly made me notice this is the work of my creative writing students. Until about five years ago, I never taught creating writing, only medieval literature and now and then a little Greek. When I began to look hard and often at student writing, I soon discovered that one of the main mistakes in their writing is that students think (probably because they've taken too many English literature courses) that fiction is supposed to tell us things - instruct us, improve us, show us. In a sense of course they're right, but only in a subtle and mysterious sense. When one has analyzed every symbolically neat detail in a story like ''Death in Venice'' or ''Disorder and Early Sorrow'' - when one has accounted for every verbal repetition, every pattern and relationship, and set down in alphabetical order every thought to be lifted or wrenched from the story - one discovers that, when you come right down to it, Mann has told us nothing we didn't know already. More by my writing students' early bad examples (they later get better) than by all the good literary examples I ever read, I've come to see that fiction simply dramatizes. It gives importance to ideas, it seems to me, pretty much in the way the string on which a handful of pearls have been strung gives a kind of importance to the pearls. When I read my earliest, most ingeniously constructed fictions (''The Resurrection'' and ''Grendel'') I find I can no longer figure the damn things out - would that I'd kept all my charts! Insofar as such books are interesting, for me at least, they're interesting because I like the characters and hope, as I reread, that life (the rest of the book) won't treat them too badly. I don't mean, of course, that I intend never again to use symbols or to design my stories so that the reader has the kind of experience William James described with such delight: ''There goes the same thing I saw before again.'' What I do mean is that when I was 3 or 4, or 12 or 13, I understood fiction more profoundly than I understood it through most of my writing years. I understood that a story, like a painting, or like a symphony, is one of the most wonderful, one of the most useless, things in the world. The magnificence of a work of art lies precisely in the fact that nobody made the artist make it, he just did, and - except when one's in school - nobody makes the receiver read it, or look at it, or listen to it; he just does. The influence of my writing students has been to lead me to understand (or imagine I understand) that art's value is not that it expresses life's meaning (though presumably it does, as do butterflies and crickets) but that it is, simply, splendidly, there. I THINK of the performances my mother and father would sometimes do at, for instance, the monthly meetings of the Grange. The way the night would go is this: First everybody would crowd into one immense room with trestle-tables and white-paper tablecloths, the tables all loaded down with food, all the red-faced farmers and their plump wives and children finding folding chairs near friends, and somebody would tap a water glass with the side of his spoon and would say a quick, self-conscious prayer, and then everybody would eat. It was a wonderfully pleasant social time, lots of jokes and stories and abundant country food; but it wasn't a time they chose solely for its pleasantness: If you wanted to get farmers to come from all over the county late at night, after chores, you had to feed them. Then they'd all go into another room and have their business meeting -how much or how little they should organize, how to keep the feed-mills, the truckers and the United States Congress in line. Nobody much cared for the business meeting, though sometimes somebody would ''get off a good one,'' as they used to say. Then, when the work was done my mother and father would stand there in the middle of the big, bright room and say poems or sing. How strange it seemed to me that all these serious, hard-working people should sit there grinning for an hour or more, listening, for instance, to my father telling them an endless, pointless story of a ghost in armor, or a ship rescued by pigeons, or somebody called Dangerous Dan McGrew. It was absurd. I wasn't just imagining it. The whole thing was deeply, weirdly absurd. Clearly if one is to devote a lifetime to doing something as crazy as that, one had better do it well - not necessarily because there is any great virtue in doing it well but only because, if one does it badly, people may wake up and notice that what one's doing is crazy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE NATION; Birth-Control Rule Challenged,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/weekinreview/the-nation-birth-control-rule-challenged.html,"Whether its Secretary-designate was ready or not, the Health and Human Services Department's disputed rule on contraceptives for teen-agers got into the Federal Register -and into Federal court - last week. The rule is due to take effect Feb. 25 unless blocked by the courts. It requires that parents be told when children under 18 receive prescription birth control products from federally subsidized clinics. A spokesman said that Margaret M. Heckler, nominated to succeed Richard S. Schweiker as Secretary, ''has not been involved in any review'' of the regulation. Last year, when still a member of the House, she signed two letters opposing it. Since then, what objectors dubbed the ''squeal rule'' has become one of the department's more controversial initiatives. When Mr. Schweiker proposed it last Feb. 22, he said it would ''encourage family participation'' in the provision of contraceptive services. Some 5,000 clinics that provide birth-control pills, intrauterine devices and diaphragms would have to notify parents within 10 working days, keep records of all notifications, and make those records available to the Government on request. Opponents say the rule would not improve family relations and, in the words of Faith Johnson, a United Church of Christ official, ''would likely result in more unintended adolescent pregnancies, births and abortions.'' One of the first suits to hit the courts was filed by New York Attorney General Robert Abrams in Federal District Court.Judge Henry Werker set a hearing for Thursday and ordered Mr. Schweiker to answer the charge that the rule was unconstitutional.

DIOXIN'S EFFECT IN ITALY LESS SEVERE THAN HAD BEEN FEARED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/us/dioxin-s-effect-in-italy-less-severe-than-had-been-feared.html,"On a clear July day seven summers ago, a quiet Saturday in the Lombardy region of northern Italy just an hour's drive from the Alps, a soft explosion at a small chemical plant at Seveso sent a column of smoke and particles of debris mushrooming into the afternoon sky. The cloud trailed south over the town and nearby villages before slowly dissipating against the horizon. Children reported playing in the snow-like crystals that filtered down from the sky. Within weeks, Seveso was known to scientists around the world as ''the poisoned city'' and some compared its inhabitants to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, fatally exposed to a frightening man-made element. A byproduct of the production of fertilizers at the chemical plant was dioxin, one of the most toxic substances known to science, so powerful, it was reported, that a few drops in a water reservoir could kill all the inhabitants of a large metropolis. It is the same substance that contaminates at least 15 sites, and perhaps as many as 100, in Missouri. Children Developed Rash It was said here that at least 22 pounds and perhaps as much as 132 pounds of dioxin had escaped in the explosion's cloud. Children who had frolicked in the poison crystals developed an ugly red rash, chloracne. Pregnant women were counseled to have abortions. The center of town was evacuated. Seveso, it was said, was a valley of death and would become a desert. None of the worst predictions have come true. The city, with its narrow, crooked streets and earth-colored buildings, about 10 miles north of Milan, looks no worse for wear than other aging northern Italian communities that have made uneasy accommodations with industry. Nearly everyone agrees that the original estimates of how much dioxin escaped into the environment was exaggerated. Hoffmann-LaRoche, the Swiss company that operated the plant, places the figure at less than one-half pound. Others believe it was higher, but nowhere near the amount, perhaps more than 50 pounds, that was part of waste oil sprayed to contain dust at the Missouri sites a decade ago. No new cases of chloracne have been recorded here since 1979, according to a group of scientists who continue to monitor the aftereffects of the explosion on the region encompassing 220,000 residents. Little Evidence Found This study has produced evidence that there was a slightly elevated incidence in birth defects in the two years after the explosion, but Italy lacks reliable data on birth defects and scientists are not sure that a similar investigation of new births in any other urban-industrial population in northern Italy would not produce the same deviation. Lancet, the respected medical science publication, last fall reported that with the exception of chloracne, there was no evidence of substantial dioxin poisoning at Seveso. And, the publication also reported, the established cases of chloracne were relatively mild ones, suggesting at most a low level of dioxin poisoning instead of a catastrophic one. It said that only a few patches of ground close to the explosion site ever registered dioxin levels approaching those at the contaminated sites in Missouri. All these findings have reduced, but not eliminated, the sense of doom in Seveso. The shadow of the 1976 cloud still lingers in the minds of scientists and townsfolk. ''I trust in God the worst is over and we can go on with our lives and not worry anymore,'' said Vittorio Chiapinni, a factory worker who lives inside the monitored danger zone. ''We are tired of doctors and technicians invading our homes and inspecting us like laboratory animals. What will happen has happened.'' Still Unanswered Questions The future, however, holds the biggest unanswered questions. ''In terms of chronic disease, like cancer or cirrhosis of the liver, we still don't know if something important has happened at Seveso,'' said Dr. Ericcaldo Stringini of the Istituto Tumori in Genoa. ''We will have to wait another 10 or 20 years.'' A report at the end of this year is expected to show that the region has not suffered a significant increase in leukemia, a type of cancer that is expected to appear within three to four years after exposure to dangerous levels of dioxin. Other cancers, however, have much longer periods of latency. While work continues on removing topsoil from Zone A, the area extending southward from the chemical plant that is considered the most contaminated, and burying it in impermeable containers elsewhere, there are allegations that the zones were fixed more by guesswork and political pressure than by the more reliable indicators of reported cases of chloracne and animal deaths. There is also concern that the authorities do not know how much dioxin has been concentrating in fields where produce is now being grown for Italian markets, and how much of the substance has collected in waterways. Only One Autopsy While such fears are discounted by the Government, an incident that took place in 1980 shows that the dread of dioxin reaching out from the earth to kill suddenly is never far away from the minds of the people. A local farmer discovered one morning that his flock of 200 sheep died after grazing in a field that had been barred to livestock since the contamination. A chill went through the population, especially the 800 people who had been permitted in 1977 to return to homes in the contamination area after being evacuated for a year. But it was proven to nearly everyone's satisfaction that the flock died from eating a grass high in water content that is known to be fatal to sheep, and no ''unusual'' traces of dioxin were found by autopsies, according to Franco Nelo, a biologist. But there is no clear understanding of how much dioxin may be collecting in the tissues of the living residents. Only one autopsy has been performed on a human being exposed to the fallout from the explosion, an elderly woman who had already been suffering from cancer of the pancreas. The autopsy found significant levels of dioxin in her organ tissues, according to Mr. Nelo. But he said the existing cancerous condition of the woman may have increased the accumulation of the toxic material in her body. Local religious traditions and customs have made it difficult to get permission to perform autopsies on others, he added. ''It is just one of many mysteries of Seveso,'' he said. ''Only time will solve them.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ROE V. WADE: 'GOOD INTENSIONS RUN AMOK',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/opinion/l-roe-v-wade-good-intensions-run-amok-201111.html,"To the Editor: The recent hoopla over the 10th anniversary of the infamous abortion decision, Roe v. Wade, has raised enough rhetorical and ideological dust to all but obscure some of the more important - and most divisive -issues raised in that case. To refer to Justice Blackmun's opinion as ''not only fair'' but ''judicious,'' ''courageous'' and ''brilliantly American'' (''Abortion at 10,'' editorial Jan. 23) only contributes to the public confusion over the constitutional issues. First things first. To speak of the ''constitutional right'' secured by the Roe decision is to deny a fundamental constitutional fact. The allegedly constitutional right expounded in Roe is not in any meaningful sense a constitutional right at all. The decision in Roe allowing abortion could only be ''found'' in the 14th Amendment once Justice Douglas had planted the ''right to privacy'' there. In Griswold v. Connecticut (interestingly enough, a birth-control case), Justice Douglas searched the cracks and crevices of the Constitution to find a right to privacy growing out of the ''penumbras'' and ''emanations'' of the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Douglas, never one to pull his juridical punches, confessed that the right he had pulled out of his judicial hat was indeed a right ''older than the Bill of Rights.'' But as no less a constitutional authority than Thomas Jefferson knew, to speak of rights that antedated the Constitution but were not explicitly confirmed in that Constitution was not to speak of constitutional rights. To Justice Black, Douglas's opinion in Griswold was the result - could only be the result - of an unhealthy judicial reliance on a ''mysterious and uncertain natural law concept.'' Strictly speaking, then, the right to abortion, like its jurisprudential forebear, the right to privacy, is an example of judicial whim becoming constitutional obligation. This is hardly the stuff of limited popular government. The second point lost in the recent celebration of Roe v. Wade is that abortion is a tough moral problem. Decent people are to be found on both sides of the issue. While one may hold an opinion as to whether abortion is right or wrong, one cannot know with any degree of certainty that that opinion is true. Given the divisiveness that such questions inevitably generate, in a popular scheme of government it is best to leave such questions to political deliberation. And in our Federal scheme of popular government, that means to leave it to state choice or to Congressional judgment. For when push comes to shove, federalism has a constitutional status the so-called right to privacy cannot begin to equal. The essence of good government, our founders thought, would come from the free exchange of ideas. Since we are incapable of knowing what justice is, republican government offers an acceptable alternative: institutional deliberation and popular consensus. As long as all sides to the issue have a chance to be heard, that is all that is required. In a system of government based on majority rule, there will always be, as the late constitutional scholar Alexander Bickel reminded us, a losing minority. To attempt to solve a tough moral and political problem by judicial decree is to pre-empt the essential processes of popular government. The issue of abortion is more a social and political one than a constitutional one. Roe v. Wade is a clear example of good intentions run amok. As an effort to settle the public debate, the Court stumbled into what Justice Frankfurter once called the ''political thicket.'' The Court did this once before on an equal scale with much the same result. Roe v. Wade has done for the moral problem of abortion what Dred Scott v. Sandford did for the moral problem of slavery. And in both instances what was sacrificed was the Constitution. GARY L. MCDOWELL, Carlisle, Pa., Jan. 24, 1983.

PREACHERS HAIL REAGAN ON ABORTION AND PRAYER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/us/preachers-hail-reagan-on-abortion-and-prayer.html,"President Reagan, urging the nation to ''face the future with the Bible,'' received repeated standing ovations from a convention of Christian broadcast preachers today. He vowed to renew his efforts for a ban on abortion, for restoring classroom prayer and for tax credits for parochial school tuition. With his budget proposal finally delivered to Congress after a difficult period of revision and controversy, Mr. Reagan made a point of emphasizing other major topics today, including the social issues and the disarmament campaign. As Mr. Reagan addressed the broadcasters, Vice President Bush was carrying a letter to Europeans in which the President vowed to meet the new Soviet leadership on the missile issue. Attempting a multifaceted day, Mr. Reagan thus demonstrated his power, and perhaps even his relief, to push beyond the endless budget problem and take up other issues. Mr. Reagan was warmly cheered and applauded by several thousand broadcast evangelists as he criticized the Federal courts for what he called ''wrong'' decisions on school prayer and condemned ''the excruciating pain the unborn must feel as their lives are snuffed away.'' Announcing that he would sign a Presidential proclamation making 1983 the ''year of the Bible,'' Mr. Reagan said the Bible had lessons for the Federal budget. ''We might come close to balancing the budget if all of us lived up to the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule,'' he told the convention gathering of the National Religious Broadcasters at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. While his audience welcomed Mr. Reagan's re-endorsement of their views on several sensitive religious and social issues, Mr. Reagan gave no clear indication of how high a priority the White House would accord those issues in the new Congress. The Administration pursued those measures in Congress for a short period last year but then deemphasized them. Some of Mr. Reagan's advisers are wary of those issues, especially in measuring the political effect Mr. Reagan's anti-abortion stance may have on some women's groups that have been critical of the President on the abortion issue. ''I know many well-intentioned, sincerely motivated people believe that Government intervention violates a woman's right of choice,'' Mr. Reagan told the convention in addressing that point. ''And they would be right if there were any proof that the unborn are not living human beings. Medical evidence indicates to the contrary and, if that were not enough, how do we explain the survival of babies who are born prematurely.'' There were murmurs of ''Amen!'' and strong applause here and at other points as Mr. Reagan promised to revive those issues in the Congress. However he gave no sign that any new strategy would be pursued, and he stressed instead how the Administration would not quit however often it might be rebuffed. Pledges Fight for School Prayer ''I want you to know something,'' he declared in raising the issue of voluntary public school prayer. ''I am determined to bring that amendment back again and again and again and again, until we succeed in restoring religious freedom in the United States.'' The audience was again on its feet, cheering, and still again when Mr. Reagan said, ''The First Amendment was not written to protect the people and their laws from religious values; it was written to protect those values from Government tyranny.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary; TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/nyregion/news-summary-tuesday-february-1-1983.html,"International President Reagan offered to meet with Yuri A. Andropov, the Soviet leader, to sign a treaty banning all intermediate-range, land-based nuclear missiles. The open letter was read in West Berlin by Vice President Bush on the first full day of his 12-day tour of Europe. (Page A1, Column 2.) A pledge on arms accords was made in Tokyo by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. He told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that Washington would never negotiate an agreement with Moscow for reducing medium-range missiles in Europe at the expense of the security of Japan or other countries. (A9:1-3.) Productivity by Soviet workers was stressed by Yuri V. Andropov in a visit to a Moscow factory reminiscent of those often made by Nikita S. Khrushchev. The new Soviet leader bluntly told the workers that store shelves would fill only after workers produce the goods. (A1:1-3.) 300,000 Ghanaians have returned home by land from economically troubled Nigeria since the border between Togo and Ghana was opened over the weekend, Togolese officials estimate. Hundreds of thousands of other Ghanians are reported on their way to Togo by way of Benin. (A3:1-3.) The fastest computers in the world are now made by the United States. But Japan is pressing a $200 million program aimed at cornering the world market in supercomputers with machines 1,000 times more powerful than present ones, and the Reagan Administration has ignored calls for a comparable program. (C1:2-4.) National President Reagan sent his budget to Congress. The program for the fiscal year 1984 calls for a 10 percent increase in military spending, freezes or cuts in most domestic programs and relies on an economic recovery rather than any major jobs initiative to combat unemployment. In an immediate attack on Mr. Reagan's philosophy, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. called on Congress to approve a ''major commitment to creating jobs.'' (A1:6.) The five-year military spending plan that President Reagan proposed reaffirmed his intent to continue expanding military strength even though the cost has been shaved by less inflation and Congressional pressure. (A1:5.) The level of Federal spending on education, job training and employment programs, welfare, food stamps and legal services for the poor would be reduced under the President's proposed budget. (A17:1.) Low-income students would be required to finance a large share of their college costs before becoming eligible for Federal grants, under President Reagan's budget proposals. Education Secretary T.H. Bell said this major change in the Government's grant program for needy students was designed to stress self-help. (A17:5-6.) The President urged Americans to ''face the future with the Bible'' and announced he would sign a Presidential proclamation making 1983 the ''year of the Bible.'' Mr. Reagan received repeated standing ovations from a convention in Washington of several thousand broadcast evangelists as he vowed to renew his efforts to ban abortion, restore classroom prayer and grant tax credits for parochial school tuition. (A1:4-6.) Independent truckers struck across the country to protest increased taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel, excise taxes on trucking equipment and increased registration fees for large trucks. Scattered violence was reported. Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis said he estimated that 20 percent of the 1,000 long-haul owneroperators were striking, but the chief of the truckers' association said 50 to 70 percent had halted work. (A10:1-2.) The notion that addiction is incurable and can be controlled only by abstinence is being challenged by the success of new therapies. They go far beyond abstinence and offer psychological insight and behaviorial guidelines, in addition to time-honored group support, to treat a wide variety of compulsions. (C1:1.) Metropolitan Governor Cuomo warned of sacrifice required of New Yorkers because of a state budget totaling $31.5 billion with a projected deficit of $1.8 billion. The Governor's proposed budget would cut 14,000 jobs from the state payroll and impose increased taxes and other measures to raise more than $900 million. Mr. Cuomo said, ''The pain must be diffused and shared.'' (A1:1.) A $1 billion cut in mass transit funds, an amount almost equal to the increase approved by Congress in the postelection session last year, is proposed in President Reagan's budget, according to officials of New York and New Jersey. One cent of the 5-cent increase in the Federal gasoline tax was committed to a $1 billion masstransit trust fund. A spokesman for New York City said, ''You could describe this as a breach of faith of the gas tax legislation.'' (A19:1-6.) Control over setting taxi fares is sought by Mayor Koch, who said that the nine-member independent commission that oversees cabs in New York City should be abolished in favor of a single taxi commissioner accountable to City Hall. Mr. Koch also called for increased license fees for taxi drivers, the establishment of a school for taxi drivers and the opening of one inspection station for both medallion and nonmedallion cabs.

Wade decision, The Times has yet to grasp even the legal scope of that ruling, as demonstrated once again in ''Abortion at 10'' (editorial Jan. 23). You state that the Court permitted ''quite severe limitation (on abortion) in the third (trimester).'' v. hat the Court actually did was prohibit state interference with any abortion necessary to preserve the ''health'' of the mother. It explicitly ruled that ''health'' included ''all factors - physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age - relevant to the well-being of the patient,'' as judged by any physician. Thus, in its official report on the Hatch Amendment, published last year, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee concluded: ''The committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a woman to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.''

The Plainfield Planned Parenthood people said that the article was incorrect about pregnancy being safer than an abortion, and the North Jersey GYN Center in Irvington said: ''All the fetal tissue goes to a crematory and is not used for cosmetics or for experiments.'' New Jersey has specific laws about who can do an abortion, and where and when. Mrs. Dermody is using many of the same old arguments used years ago against birth control - that preventing birth would mean we would do away with the old and helpless.

Article on Abortion Draws Readers' Replies,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/l-article-on-abortion-draws-readers-replies-214019.html,"On issues of great moment, like abortion, prevarication is sometimes the unfortunate offspring of desperation. Grace Dermody (Opinion Page, Jan. 16) put forward several statements from the annals of antiabortion mythology that should not be permitted to filter into the public consciousness as fact. According to her fiction, legions of selfish females are having abortions for their convenience at any time throughout the nine months of their pregnancies. Logic would persuade that no one has a third-trimester abortion for ''convenience,'' but the Supreme Court decision of 1973, which legalized abortion, also provided that abortion in the United States would be outlawed after the 24th week of gestation, owing to the state's interest in a viable fetus. Scientific opinion generally holds the outer limit of viability to be 28 weeks. The court allowed a four-week margin of error. Ninety-one percent of all abortions are performed before the 12th week of gestation. The well-under 1 percent of ''abortions'' performed in the third trimester are really deliveries performed only for the gravest medical indications, such as to remove a dead or anencephalic (no brain) fetus. Mrs. Dermody quotes a claim by Dr. Thomas W. Hilgers that ''pregnancy is clearly safer than abortion in both the first and second 20 weeks of pregnancy'' and that ''maternal deaths due to legal abortion have replaced deaths from criminal abortion one to one.'' This last is a particularly weighty claim, considering the fact that, prior to 1973, illegal abortion was the leading cause of maternal death in this country. Dr. Hilgers's medical misstatements are soundly refuted by Dr. Willard Cates, former chief of the abortion surveillance branch of the Centers for Disease Control, and Scot A. LeBolt. The twin rebuttal arguments appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association, July 9, 1982 (Vol. 248, pp. 188-196). After criticizing Dr. Hilgers's methodology, they concluded that, between 1972 and 1978, women were seven times more likely to die from childbirth than from abortion. They are supported by statistics from the Centers for Disease Control. Between 1972 and 1978, the maternal mortality rate was 11 deaths per 100,000 live births. The death rate from legal abortion in 1978 was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions, making legal abortion statistically comparable in safety to a penicillin shot (although late second-trimester abortions are more dangerous than childbirth). While railing against the dangers of legal abortion, Mrs. Dermody quotes Dr. Bernard Nathanson, author of ''Aborting America,'' in proclaiming that we need not worry about driving abortion underground because illegal abortion would now be safe. In fact, Dr. Nathanson's claim that suction curetage could be safely used by nonmedical personnel is hotly contested. Mrs. Demody wisely did not mention Dr. Nathanson's other claim: that prostaglandin suppositories could be safely used by women to initiate illegal abortions. According to Dr. Nicholas Poulos of Metropolitan Medical Associates, an abortion clinic in Englewood, ''prostaglandin, if used by women without medical supervision and monitoring, could produce severe complications and even death.'' It is also true that many women would still resort to unsterile household instruments and corrosive douches. Mrs. Dermody chooses to gut-punch us with ghoulish stories alleging the misuse of fetal tissue that have absolutely no bearing on whether abortion should be banned. The fact that an 11-year-old child in Kalamazoo, Mich., was literally forced by an antiabortion judge to bear a child, and then was charged with emotional neglect of that child, demonstrates that the antiabortion mentality places coercion well before compassion.

That the article is one-sided is to be expected, since the author is a spokesperson for the New Jersey Right to Life. That it completely misses the point of the abortion issue, although somewhat expected, is not excusable and should not escape the notice of readers. The author fails to focus on the really important result of the landmark Wade v. Roe decision of 10 years ago, namely: Women today have the freedom to choose whether or not they have an abortion, they have reproductive freedom and they have the freedom and responsibility to make decisions about their lives and their bodies without interference from the state or the church. Such freedom, won after much struggle, must be preserved; such freedom cannot be lost to fanaticism and conservatism. That is why on Jan. 22 many thousands marched and stood to be counted in celebratating a woman's constitiutional right to choose abortion. THE REV. DAVID J.

Although there has been a large increase in child abuse during the last 10 years, researchers have found no correlation between child abuse and abortion. However, the incidence of child abuse does have a correlation with unemployment, also up in the last 10 years. Awareness of the problem by teachers, medical personnel, parents and friends has aided in more-accurate methods of detection and reporting, and therefore higher statistics. If we blame the problem of child abuse on our ''abortion mentality,'' we may set the solutions back 10 years.

ARTICLE ON ABORTION DRAWS READERS' REPLIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/l-article-on-abortion-draws-readers-replies-203085.html,"The war against legal abortion has been waged for more than 10 years, and those who would deny women the right to medically safe abortion, in a clinic or hospital, are getting desperate. Although their original argument against abortion - that the person begins at the moment the sperm and egg meet - is still the backbone of their movement, they have stooped to lies, half-truths and misrepresenting the facts to emotionalize the issue they now know they are losing. They have lost in every national and state poll and in almost every election, and have usually lost in the courts, particularly in the United States Supreme Court. Their numbers diminish daily, and news accounts of their annual march on Washington report that the number of people attending is down every year. Some reporters have finally taken note of the fact that a large number of the participants are children on parochial-school buses. The facts are that a vast majority of people favor legal abortion and do not think that the government should interfere in a woman's personal life. The facts are that a majority do not believe that a person begins at conception. The facts are that those who support a woman's right to choose abortion also support family planning services and sex education. If the rabid anti-abortionists want to stop abortion, why do they oppose contraceptive services and discussions by high school seniors of abortion and contraception? If they want everyone to be pregnant, why do they oppose in vitro fertilization, which allows women to have their own babies? No one wants a teen-ager to get pregnant, and pro-choice people would like young women to talk to their parents if they want an abortion. However, we do not live in a perfect world, and many young people cannot talk to their parents. In New Jersey four years ago, a 40-year-old woman's physician did not tell her about a test to detect genetic problems. He assumed that she wouldn't have an abortion because she is Catholic. She gave birth to a baby with Down's Syndrome and other medical problems. The woman herself developed kidney trouble and her husband had a heart attack, but she loves her child and is determined to do her best for him. Recently, a church nursery school run by nuns refused to accept the child as a student in a class with four 3-year-olds and two nuns as teachers. Specialists in a program operated by the public-school system had advised the woman that it would be helpful. When she protested to the priest and the diocese, they told her to take the child elsewhere. The New Jersey Legislature passed a Right to Conscience law, which protects doctors and nurses who do not wish to participate in abortions, but the State Supreme Court ruled that nonsectarian hospitals that provide obstetrical care must allow physicians to perform abortions for their patients. Congress has denied Federal Medicaid funds for abortions unless a woman's life is endangered. Rape and incest victims and women with severe medical problems were denied funds. In New Jersey, the State Supreme Court ruled that indigent women could not be denied equal medical care, and ordered the state to pay for all medically necessary abortions. Antiabortionists say that they do not want their tax money used for abortions, but many of us pay taxes for things we oppose, such as war and nuclear weapons. More than 90 percent of all abortions are performed before the 12th week, less than 4 percent are performed after the 15th week and less than 1 percent are performed after the 20th week. In New Jersey, it is impossible to obtain an abortion past the 24th week, yet those who oppose abortion rights constantly claim that a woman can get an abortion up until the time she delivers. The zealots who oppose abortion are never forced to have one or participate in one, but they seek to force the majority to believe as they do. Their proposals to declare a fetus a person from the moment of conception would prohibit all abortions, for any reason, and even some forms of birth control.

"MADRID FACING FIGHT FROM RIGHT ON ABORTION ,",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/world/madrid-facing-fight-from-right-on-abortion.html,"The new Socialist Government is facing its first major battle with the right-wing opposition over the legalization of abortion in Spain. The prospective change in the penal code would be limited compared with the laws in force in many other European countries. It would permit abortions only in cases of rape, a malformed fetus or when the life or health of the woman was in danger, while retaining severe penalties for abortions performed for other reasons. Nonetheless, a recent announcement that the Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was going to fulfill a campaign pledge and push ahead with the measure has caused an uproar among conservatives in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. The Popular Alliance, the opposition party of the right in Parliament, has said it will fight the proposed legislation. However, the Socialists, with 202 of the 350 seats in the lower house, command enough deputies to gain passage. On Wednesday the Cabinet approved the text of the new code, which will now go before Parliament and is expected to become law by June. To make it more acceptable, the Government also approved measures to increase the availability of information on family planning, birth control and steps to take to insure the health of the fetus. Strong antiabortion legislation was one of the hallmarks of the dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, whose moral absolutism on this and other issues insured church support for his rule. The penal code provides for a variety of prison sentences, ranging from six months to six years for a woman who willingly undergoes an abortion to between six years and 20 years for a doctor who performs one. The law is enforced. Two weeks ago magistrates in Barcelona imposed a 37-year sentence on an elderly intern found guilty on seven counts of performing abortions, and another sentence of 29 years on a second intern. The arguments on abortion are similar to those raised in other countries. Many antiabortion groups equate abortion with murder and find support in a forceful antiabortion sermon delivered by Pope John Paul II to a crowd of more than a million people in central Madrid on Nov. 2. ''Every conjugal act must remain open to the transmission of life,'' the Pope said. ''Nothing can legitimize the death of an innocent.'' Feminist groups and those who favor legalizing abortion argue that every family has the right to determine the number of children it wants. They point out that family planning programs lag in Spain and that contraceptives, while available from some private doctors, are rarely prescribed under public health payments so that birth control is not accessible to many women. Figures on the number of illegal abortions performed annually in Spain are debatable, and debated. One study estimated that 300,000 abortions were performed 10 years ago. Those who favor legalizing abortion contend that about an equal number of abortions were performed last year. What is not debated is the number of women who travel abroad for abortions, mostly to England, where 18,000 to 20,000 went in 1980. A pledge to legalize abortion under certain circumstances was in the program of the Socialists, who won a landslide victory in the October general elections. But the issue remained in the background until two weeks ago, when the new Health Minister, Ernest Lluch Martin, told a Catalan newspaper that the Government was planning a draft to make abortion available under the public health system. Although the church is expected to take a forceful position against abortion in public, sources within the Socialist leadership said they believed that the campaign would be mainly ''pastoral'' and would not constitute an all-out political offensive against the Socialists. One Cabinet minister said the Government was forced to seek a liberalization. ''It's impossible for a Socialist Government to preside over such a set of antiabortion laws,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARTICLE ON ABORTION DRAWS READERS' REPLIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/l-article-on-abortion-draws-readers-replies-203088.html,"The article distorts the real issue. To state that ''no one argues much any more'' over whether ''an innocent human life'' is destroyed in an abortion ignores the fact that no one today can claim on a scientific basis that at conception, or at any particular point in time, an individual human person comes into existence. All scientists agree that there is a continuum. A living cell (a sperm) and a living egg join and, through cell division, a fetus gradually develops. The decision as to when a person comes into existence is a philosophical and religious question, not a scientific one. Because it is a religious question about which there is vigorous disagreement, for the government to impose one theological viewpoint that claims personhood for a fertilized egg would be a clear violation of the Constitution, depriving those who do not share this theological view of their rights under the Constitution. Throughout New Jersey, more and more religious groups and individuals are coming to recognize that their freedom is under attack by the so-called ''right to life'' movement, and through the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights and other groups they are quietly rallying to support religious freedom. Protestants, Jews and even many Catholics who refuse to agree with the present stand of the hierarchy are united in this movement. None of us in the coalition would attempt to force Mrs. Dermody or any of her allies to violate their conscience and have an abortion.

PROTECTING THE ADVERTISER: A DILUTION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/protecting-the-advertiser-a-dilution-of-the-first-amendment.html,"THE United States Supreme Court is likely to rule in favor of a New Jersey drug company's free-speech case against a Postal Service regulation that prohibits the unsolicited mailing of advertisements for contraceptives. More's the pity if it does. Based on similar cases in recent years, there is good reason to believe that the Court will continue to emasculate the First Amendment by extending constitutional protection to commercial advertising when it decides Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products. (The company is based in Piscataway and has a plant in Trenton.) The Postal Service is challenging the decision of a Federal District Court that held that the regulation was ''consitutionally impermissible because it was more extensive than necessary to serve governmental interest in protecting the privacy of individuals in their homes.'' The Court went on to say that whether the First Amendment protects commercial speech depends upon the nature both of the expression and the governmental interest served by its regulation. According to Robert D. Joffe, a New York City lawyer who represents a number of health and family-planning groups that have filed a joint brief in support of Youngs's position, the case is a ''classic'' one of ''free speech and peoples' right to obtain information versus the Government's right to regulate the information that people receive.''  The case may well be important, but not for these reasons only. Hollow rights have long been advocated on behalf of citizens to justify governmental controls on speech. That, in a nutshell, is what is more bothersome than either the Youngs right to free speech or a person's right to privacy. While the Youngs position may be supportable, I would rather see the final legal word based on the old-fashioned natural right that any speaker possesses, instead of this disturbing ''preferred speech'' concept. Shifting the right from the speaker to the listener - the right-to-know concept -implies little more than a governmental right to restrict. For many years, the prevailing legal doctrine was that advertising had no First Amendment protection, although such private activity was entitled, of course, to ''due process.'' If a particular expression of fact or opinion were labeled ''commercial speech,'' it could, by definition, be suppressed by law. This meant that advertisers were subject to governmental supervision without the protection or guarantees that the Constitution afforded most other kinds of speech. The free-speech clause of the First Amendment was never intended to protect commercial messages because, as a rule, they do not affect the political process, contribute to the exchange of ideas or enhance individual self-expression. That all began to change in the 1970's, when the Supreme Court enunciated a series of decisions establishing varying degrees of First Amendment protection for commercial speech. For nearly 30 years, beginning with Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942), the Court had based its decisions on a hierarchy of expression, a preference for political rather than commercial speech. In New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), the Court went to great length to explain that the libelous matter in question was contained in an ''idea'' advertisement, not one purely for a commercial product or service. But the chink in the armor was apparent nonetheless. In 1973, the Court again denied First Amendment protection to commercial speech, but mainly because the ''Help Wanted'' advertisements in The Pittsburgh Press were unlawful in that they discriminated by sex. The newspaper argued that the ruling would restrict its editorial judgment and thus violate the First Amendment.  Chief Justice Warren Burger's dissent was prophetic: ''It launches the Court on ... a treacherous path of defining what layout and organizational decision of newspapers are 'sufficiently associated' with the commercial parts of the papers as to be constitutionally unprotected and therefore subject to governmental regulation.'' Two years later, in Bigelow v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that newspaper readers had the First Amendment right to receive advertised abortion information. In the Court's majority opinion, Justice Blackmun said: ''The advertisement published in appellant's newspaper did more than simply propose a commercial transaction. It contained factual material of clear 'public interest.' '' This differed from The Pittsburgh Press case because the activity was legal. A devastating blow to the old commercial speech doctrine was dealt by Virginia Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976), in which the Supreme Court overturned Virginia's state laws against advertising the prices of drugs. Emphasized once again was the First Amendment right to receive information. But the Court also said that governments still had the right to control advertising that is, for example, false and misleading or purely commercial. Especially revealing is the dictum that ''... the greater objectivity and hardiness of commercial speech may make it less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing the speaker.'' Meanwhile, the Supreme Court continued to expand First Amendment protection of commercial speech in a series of cases, but not without some qualification. A ''For Sale'' sign on a home warrants protection, as does the advertising or display of contraceptives and the advertising of legal services and fees. Justice Rehnquist, who dissented in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977), stated: ''I continue to believe that the First Amendment speech provision, long regarded by this Court as a sanctuary for expressions of public importance or intellectual interest, is demeaned by invocation to protect advertisements of goods and services.'' A number of conclusions are apparent and will no doubt affect the Court's ruling in Bolger v. Youngs. When commercial speech is lawful and truthful, restriction is permissible if the Government's interest is deemed substantial. Also, such regulation must directly advance governmental interest and should not be overly broad in fulfilling that interest. Where issue-oriented advertisements are involved, the Court has developed a balancing test: restriction versus interest. The latter, noncommercial speech rule is akin to the protection guaranteed most other Constitutional rights. If the advertising of goods and services were treated as a form of speech beyond Constitutional protection but not without legal due process, the right to speak would at least retain some of its original vitality. Regulation by time, place and manner of speech is reasonable so long as freedom is accorded the speaker first and foremost. However, recent Supreme Court decisions clearly indicate that the rights of listener are more important, the usual justification for restrictions on speakers. Yet even the listeners are restricted by a third party, such as a Government regulatory agency, which decides what listeners need to insure an informed citizenry. After all, the right to hear is derivative of the right to speak, and free speech is precisely the right to speak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spanish Bishops Fight Abortion Law Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/world/spanish-bishops-fight-abortion-law-changes.html,"The church has declared its opposition to easing Spain's strict antiabortion laws, setting the stage for a showdown with the Socialist Government. Spanish bishops, in a strongly worded document issued Saturday night, said abortion under any circumstances was murder and called proposed legislation to legalize abortion ''gravely unjust and totally unacceptable.'' In the document, issued by the Episcopal Conference, the bishops vowed to ''oppose moral degradation'' and urged believers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country to express disagreement and refuse to cooperate in the practice of abortion. The proposed law would allow abortion in cases of rape, malformation of the fetus or where the mother's life was in danger. The Socialist Government is relying on its parliamentary majority to push through changes, mild by West European standards, in Francoera abortion laws that provide for long prison terms. The new law would require two specialists' approval for abortion in cases of malformation of a fetus or danger to the mother's life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RELATIONSHIPS; THE GRIEF OF A FAILED PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/style/relationships-the-grief-of-a-failed-pregnancy.html,"WHEN Dr. Judith N. Lasker, assistant professor of sociology at L ehigh University, is asked if her 3 1/2-year-old daughter is her o nly child, she pauses. ''In my mind, I have two children,'' Dr. L asker said, ''and she is my second.'' Her first child, also a girl, w as stillborn four and a half years ago. Dr. Lasker, co-author with Susan Borg of ''When Pregnancy Fails'' (Beacon Press, 1981), was one of many experts who attended a recent symposium to discuss the emotional trauma suffered by people who lose an expected child during pregnancy or after delivery. Among the sponsors of the conference, entitled ''Women and Loss'' and held at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, was the Foundation of Thanatology, which seeks to improve the care of terminally ill patients and their families. Other sponsors included the departments of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Recognition that a pregnancy loss is as much a form of bereavement as is any other death, and that it must be mourned, is recent. In the past, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (in which the ovum develops outside the uterus), stillbirth and even relinquishing a baby to adoption were treated as incidents to be quickly forgotten. That attitude typified the personal experience of Dr. Robert J. Echenberg, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Bethlehem, Pa., who is medical consultant to a support group for families that have suffered such losses. ''I did not know until I was in my teens that I had an older sister who was either stillborn or died after birth,'' he said. ''No one ever talked about it. A few months ago, I learned that my grandmother still lights a candle for that child.'' Today, the attitudes of some professionals are changing dramatically, with couples being urged to express their emotions openly in order to recuperate from their loss. Two of those who work with such couples are Kathleen Capitulo, a nurse specialist at Booth Memorial Medical Center in Flushing, Queens, and Anthony Maffia, a social worker there. They described an optional program under which they help parents of infants who are stillborn or die shortly after delivery. ''We dress the baby and take it to the parents,'' Mrs. Capitulo said. ''We say, 'You have a beautiful daughter with such a cute nose.' If the baby has a malformation, we'll tell them; if its skin is peeling, we tell them. We encourage them to touch and hold it. That erases fears people have that they've borne a monster, and it is a positive experience.'' In addition, she said, when the time is right, ''We discuss the possibility of baptism, autopsy and a funeral.'' Continuing support is considered essential. ''Couples go home alone,'' Mr. Maffia said, ''and some simply don't understand what's happened to them. They may have to tell other children or deal with judgmental relatives. Also, husband and wife may grieve on different levels at different times, and if a marriage is already in trouble, this may put it over the edge.'' While friends and relatives may be uncertain how to offer condolences when a newborn child dies, they tend to dismiss miscarriage with such platitudes as, ''It's all for the better'' or ''Forget it - it's no big deal.'' But there is nothing trivial about miscarriage, according to Dr. Phyllis Leppert, a physician and registered nurse in New York who specializes in maternal and fetal medicine. ''Menopausal patients talk to me about miscarriages that occurred decades ago,'' she said. ''They become a secret, unresolved grief.'' The effects of miscarriage have only recently been recognized. ''To the pregnant woman,'' Dr. Leppert said, ''an embryo is a projected person, and she bonds to it, so she can feel a strong and intense grief. Couples whose pregnancy ends early must mourn in a more abstract way than those whose baby dies at birth. We have no ritual for that kind of loss.'' Guilt is inevitable in most losses, specialists say, with people convinced that they have provoked the outcome - through jogging, say, or falling or having sexual relations. Even husbands may feel guilt if they are exposed to dangerous chemicals at work. And long after the event, women tend to experience what is known as ''shadow grief,'' a sense of sadness that surfaces at holidays or on what would have been the child's birthday. Those in the field say that, despite the advances, more professionals are needed in such work. And help must be extended to groups of patients who have not yet been considered for it. As Dr. Lasker put it: ''Women who give up their babies for adoption go through the same grief process, but they do not talk about it. The infertile grieve for a nonevent - for children never conceived. And now there are women who have prenatal tests, learn that the fetus has serious abnormalities and reluctantly have an abortion. That too represents the loss of a wanted child. They all need help.''

...AND ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/opinion/l-and-on-religious-freedom-in-the-us-218613.html,"To the Editor: President Reagan's Jan. 31 comments to a convention of Christian broadcast preachers about his efforts to restore classroom prayer, a ban on abortion and tax credits for parochial school tuition were misguided at best and may serve to exacerbate relations between religious groups in the United States. he President is in error when he claims that his bill to restore mandatory prayers and/or moments of meditation in the public schools will ''restore religious freedom in the United States.'' The Supreme Court ruling which struck down mandatory prayer was, in fact, an act permitting religious freedom, providing those who do not wish to pray relief from statute and peer pressure to engage in an act that violates their personal beliefs or creeds. No effort has ever been made to prevent voluntary, non-disruptive prayer by individuals at any moment within the school day. Mr. Reagan's announcement that he would sign a Presidential proclamation making 1983 the ''Year of the Bible'' is indicative of the quagmire which awaits government upon entering the realm of religion. Jews and Christians do not agree upon the set of books composing the Bible for their respective faiths. When the President makes a declaration of this nature, he must therefore offend one faith or make his proclamation so vague as to be meaningless. At the same time, actions of this variety cannot be viewed by Moslems or members of other faiths within the country without feelings of hurt and recrimination. While religion as an aspect of the human experience deserves to be a subject of study and discussion within the schools, religious practice belongs in the homes and houses of worship of the citizenry.

CHINA'S POLICY ON SIZE OF FAMILIES IS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE MINORITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/china-s-policy-on-size-of-families-is-extended-to-include-minorities.html,"China has begun closing a conspicuous loophole in its nationwide birth-control program by restricting the number of children that some of its minorities may have. On the island of Hainan in the South China Sea, the native Li and Miao minorities have been limited to four children per family since last July. This number has been further reduced since October to two or three children per family in an informal measure that is being drafted into legislation in Guangdong Province, which governs Hainan. Wang Yuefeng, director of the Li-Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which covers more than half of Hainan, said: ''A similar policy is being applied to the minorities as to the Han majority. The only difference is a greater number of children.'' The prefecture includes 750,000 Li and 30,000 Miao in its total population of nearly 1.9 million. Until recently, China's 55 minorities had been exempted from its stringent family planning rules, which restrict Chinese couples to a single child or, in some rural areas, to two children. Rapid Growth of Minorities The result is that the minorities have been growing much faster than the Han majority, though they still account for less than 7 percent of China's population of more than 1 billion people. The national census taken last July disclosed that the minorities had increased by 68.4 percent since the previous census in 1964, while the Han majority grew by only 43.8 percent. With nearly a quarter of the world's population and only 7 percent of its arable land, China has instituted radical measures aimed at reducing its population growth to only .95 percent annually in the rest of this century. The Government has exempted the minority nationalities to avoid the kind of ethnic frictions that developed during the Cultural Revolution, when those in power suppressed the traditions and dress of the minorities in an effort to assimilate them within the Han majority. The loyalty of the minorities is far more important to Peking than their size would suggest, because many of them inhabit strategically sensitive border regions like Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Yunnan. Yet their freedom from birth control has annoyed Han Chinese who want more than one child too. Last December Bo Yibo, a state councilor, declared that the birth control exemptions granted to China's minorities did not necessarily mean ignoring ''practical conditions.'' His remark suggested that Peking was reviewing its position on exempting the minorities. Mobile Birth Control Units China's population growth has been estimated at 1.35 percent last year. But in Hainan's mountain town of Tongza, Mr. Wang disclosed that his prefecture's population grew by 1.9 percent. The population of the Li grew by 3.6 percent and the Miao by 4.1 percent. Mr. Wang said that preparations were being made to send 13 mobile birth control units into the countryside to distribute intrauterine devices and birth control pills ''to insure a better success rate.'' ''Our principle here is that if a couple have children up to the limit, we encourage them to undergo sterilization,'' Mr. Wang said. He said that abortions, a standard means of holding down births on the mainland, were ''not common'' in his prefecture. There have been unconfirmed reports that the Government is encouraging family planning among other larger minorities, such as the Dai in Yunnan and the Zhuang in Guangxi, but the subject remains sensitive. Mr. Wang, whose political loyalty as the highest-ranking ethnic Li official has earned him an alternate seat on the Communist Party's Central Committee, rejected suggestions that the impetus for the new birth-control policy had come from Peking or Canton. ''Family planning is not an idea of the Han people to be applied to the minority peoples,'' Mr. Wang told a group of visiting foreign correspondents. ''It is an outcome of an idea among the minorities themselves. It's fully democratic and the will of the people who ask for family planning.'' 'Won't Hamper Unity' ''This application of family planning won't hamper the unity of the minorities because they got the idea among themselves, at the grass-roots level,'' Mr. Wang said. He did not say how the idea could have arisen spontaneously in a rugged region where the inhabitants are dispersed in isolated villages and nearly a third are illiterate. In one such Li village, Huang Qingxiang, the leader of the Maoli production team, understood that ''we are allowed to have four children, but no more than four.'' Mr. Huang, a slender young man who leads the other villagers in tending the surrounding rubber trees and rice paddies, said that any family that had a fifth child now would be penalized. It must pay 220 pounds of unhusked rice and 50 yuan - nearly $26 - every year until the extra child is 14 years old. The village's per capita income last year was 180 yuan - about $93. Eighteen of his village's two dozen families already had more than four children, Mr. Huang said, but they were born before the new regulations were announced, so no one was fined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was convicted of the two Federal charges on Jan. 27. Mr. Anderson made a 15-minute speech before the sentencing, reading antiabortion statements from a yellow pad.

THE SQUEAL RULE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/opinion/the-squeal-rule.html,"I didn't plan to fix the day so indelibly in my mind, but I can pinpoint exactly the first time I went to the doctor to see about birth control. It was my 17th birthday, a milestone that entitled me to that most important of suburban rites of passage, a driving permit. Spurred, perhaps, by that one small step into adulthood to venture another, I took a drive with my boyfriend to the Planned Parenthood office in a neighboring town, my novice driving skills made even shakier by the nature of our trip. My recollection of that day, now more than seven years ago, is prompted by a new regulation of the Department of Health and Human Services, due to take effect later this month. Under that regulation, the so-called squeal rule, any federally subsidized clinic that dispenses prescription birth control to a patient under 18 will also have to send a registered letter to her parents informing them of that fact. The supposed rationale of the rule is to encourage family communication about sex and birth control, and to ''protect the health and safety of minor adolescents,'' according to the departing Secretary, Richard S. Schweiker. If the squeal rule had been in effect when I was 17, I never would have driven to the clinic. It wouldn't have stopped me from having sex; I was already doing that, stupidly, unprotected, in the blind belief that ''it'' couldn't happen to me. The rule simply would have prevented me from receiving a reliable method of contraception. Why couldn't I just tell my parents that I loved my boyfriend, thought I was old enough to have sex and wanted to take the responsiblity that accompanies it? It wasn't that my parents had unshakeable religious or moral convictions opposed to premarital sex, or to birth control. It wasn't that they were unable even to discuss the issue: My mother had explained all the technical details long before. It wasn't that my father was going to beat me, or lock me in my room or forbid me to see my boyfriend. But I knew my parents would disapprove. I knew that their disapproval wasn't going to make me stop, no matter how much ''family communication'' we had. And I didn't see any reason to throw my actions in their faces, to create the discord that would have followed such a revelation. There was also the matter of my privacy: I didn't want my sex life to become a matter of dinner table debate. Perhaps in the best of all possible worlds we would have talked about it. Family communication is the sort of thing, like apple pie, that no one is against. But it is a rare adolescent who lives in an ideal world, at least where parents are concerned. I didn't. I wasn't going to tell my parents, no matter whether that decision was wise or not. And I wasn't going to have that decision forced on me by some Government regulation. Neither are the the teenagers who will be subject to the squeal rule. There I was, supposedly smart - at the top of my high school class, on my way to a prestigious Ivy League college, perfectly aware of the importance of contraception - still having sex without any protection. What of teenagers with less knowledge of birth control, or a more abiding trust that beginners' luck will protect them from pregnancy? If my mother had found my diaphragm, the worst consequence that would have ensued would probably have been a nasty fight. What of teenagers with more to risk than mere disapproval if a clinic had to notify their parents? The squeal rule is going to backfire. It is going to promote pregnancy, not family communication. Instead of encouraging teenagers to use birth control, the rule will force them to turn away from clinics and to use less reliable methods, or none at all. Supporters of the squeal rule may like to comfort themselves with the belief that teenagers denied access to reliable birth control will do the rational thing, and simply abstain. But sex is not a subject that provokes the most rational decisions at any age, and the facts suggest that expecting abstention would be sheer fanatasy. A 1981 study of 1,200 teenagers visiting family-planning clinics found that 86 percent were already sexually active; the average time before coming in for birth control was one year. Teenagers affected by the rule are not going to stop having sex because of it. And some of them - too many of them -are going to get pregnant. There were more than one million teenage pregnancies last year; more than 450,000 of those teenagers had abortions. Those numbers are a tragedy that the Government should be doing something to prevent. Instead, it has issued the squeal rule, which will push the numbers even higher. And contributing to the problem, rather than working to solve it, is the greatest tragedy of all. --------------------------------------------------------------------- The writer requested anonymity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BAR GROUP V. MARDI GRAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/us/a-reporter-s-notebook-bar-group-v-mardi-gras.html,"The name mentioned most frequently at the midwinter meeting of the American Bar Association here wasn't Chief Justice Warren E. Burger or Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor or Morris Harrell, president of the organization. It was Robert J. Kutak, who was not here. Mr. Kutak, the Omaha lawyer who headed the commission that tried to redefine the ethical code of the legal profession, died Jan. 23 at the age of 50. But he haunted the occasion as the bar balked at much of what he had labored at for five and a half years, particularly rules that would have permitted lawyers to ''blow the whistle'' on dishonest clients. Robert W. Meserve, the Boston lawyer who succeeded Mr. Kutak as head of the commission, said he would not invoke his memory to help enact the ''Kutak Code,'' and he kept his word. But his memorial speech Tuesday morning took on added poignancy as key elements of the code were defeated. ''Bob showed himself to be one who never withdrew from the battle,'' Mr. Meserve said, his voice breaking. ''Whatever our opinion of the ultimate result of the work he did, he had no doubt, nor do I, that it was a most important endeavor to set the lawyer right before the court of public opinion.'' ''The twaddling of words, the splitting of hairs - he didn't stand for that,'' said Mr. Kutak's father, Jerome, a 79-year old legal aid lawyer. ''He represented the spirit of youth and innovation, and this is an organization of old men.'' As if legal ethics, gun control and the insanity defense were not enough, the House of Delegates came close to confronting another philosophical and political tar baby: homosexual rights. The delegates were to debate a resolution recommending legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing and public accommodations. The measure was dropped, officially because two proponents of the resolution, Dan Bradley, a former director of the Federal Legal Services Corporation, and John J. Quinn of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, were not on the premises. Supporters of the resolution acknowledged privately that the climate just was not right. There were few celebrities at this convention. ''Highlights'' included panel discussions on ''Catching Flack and Talking Back: Two Views on Responding to Criticism,'' and on how lawyers should deal with the news media. John C. Shepherd of St. Louis won the bar presidency unopposed. The good-natured Mr. Shepherd underwent something of a transformation for his first news conference, where he unveiled a new and more solemn, stentorian style. Then he encountered matters rare to the world of bar politics: issues. He was asked about the Legal Services Corporation. About the exclusionary rule. The number of women and blacks in his law firm. Applicability to law parterships of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Abortion. The ethics code. He ducked a few, hedged on others, and got bruised on those he tried to answer until a bar aide hustled him off to a luncheon. Mr. Shepherd has plenty of time to learn the ropes. Under the association's byzantine election procedures, as ''president-electnominee,'' he will not take office until August 1984. Like the exclusive private clubs that mount Mardi Gras parades, the American Bar Association retains some of its elitist ways and is still substantially older, whiter, richer and more male than the American legal profession in general. Things have apparently changed too fast for Joe Stamper of Antlers, Okla., who has come to personify the A.B.A.'s more rural, homely, conservative past. At most conventions, there is at least one issue - legalizing prostitution, banning discriminatory private clubs, loosening lawyer-client confidentiality - that prompts him to rise in opposition. He has become a Will Rogers of the right. And so the world of Antlers, population 2,997, is as familiar at these gatherings as Gopher Prairie and Grovers Corners are to literary types. ''This is really a conservative body, but conservatives are afraid to express themselves,'' Mr. Stamper said. ''They're afraid they'll be accused of intolerance.'' To Leonard Janofsky, a past president, scheduling a convention at Mardi Gras time doesn't make sense. ''I'd try to plan things so you didn't have these peripheral distractions,'' he said. The A.B.A. is an ''early to bed, early to rise'' crowd, a member's wife said. When she and her husband asked a couple out for dinner after Chief Justice Burger's speech Sunday afternoon, they were rebuffed. ''Oh, no, we can't do that,'' the woman replied. ''I have to watch 'The Winds of War.'

WHEN THE POPULAR WILL CHOOSE TO OPPRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/opinion/l-when-the-popular-will-choose-to-oppress-225814.html,"To the Editor: Prof. Gary L. McDowell's Feb. 1 letter attacking the basis of the Supreme Court's landmark abortion ruling in Roe v. Wade seriously misrepresents what Justice Douglas said in his Griswold opinion and calls for nothing less than a total abdication of judicial responsibility when ''divisive'' issues are raised. Far from searching the ''cracks and crevices'' of the Constitution, Justice Douglas simply argued that certain rights in the Bill of Rights very clearly imply the existence of other rights. In particular, he pointed out that there seems little reason for the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures if it is not to protect privacy. McDowell clearly does not care for Justice Douglas's style and his use of the term ''penumbra'' or ''emanation.'' One might agree that the Justice's choice of words was unfortunate. But no one should allow himself to be distracted from the real substance of what is said by the manner in which it is said. What I find even more disturbing than McDowell's disingenuous reading of Douglas is his view of the proper role of the Court. He suggests we ought to leave divisive issues to ''political deliberation,'' that such questions are not the proper concern of the Supreme Court. One wonders, of course, what would be the present legal status of black Americans had the Supreme Court of the 1950's left the ''divisive issue'' of civil rights to the whims of legislatures. Even the most superficial study of American history makes clear that representative government too often has chosen to oppress those who were not in the majority. More often than not, it has been the Supreme Court that has said ''no'' to the will of the people, that has protected those rights the Constitution seeks to shield from the ''vicissitudes of popular will.'' In short, it is precisely when the political system confronts divisive issues that the Supreme Court has made its most important contribution to democracy. To disqualify the Court from so acting is to surrender to the basest desires of the political process. RICHARD J. DEL GUIDICE, Potsdam, N.Y., Feb. 2, 1983.

THE SENATE; A MOVEMENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT FILIBUSTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/us/the-senate-a-movement-to-do-something-about-filibusters.html,"The rules of the Senate were not chiseled in stone on Mount Sinai. It just sometimes seems that way. Accordingly, it is a matter of some note on Capitol Hill when the Senate contemplates a change in its traditional methods of operation. And right now, a panel of lawmakers is examining ways to limit the use of the filibuster, and accelerate the pace of legislation through what is often called ''the world's greatest deliberative body.'' Indeed, senators worry that their procedures are so deliberate that they approach paralysis. ''We're really concerned,'' said an aide to the Senate leadership, ''that the rules have gotten to the point where they're somewhat cumbersome. What we need to do is preserve the traditions of the Senate, but not leave the Senate as an archaic institution, as it sometimes appears to be.'' The panel charged with examining the rules is headed by Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, who hopes to have a recommendation ready by mid-March. The first item on the agenda is a phenomenon called the ''post-cloture filibuster,'' an esoteric procedure that can have a profound effect on the laws that eventually emanate from the Capitol. Principle of Unlimited Debate Current Senate rules embody the principle of unlimited debate. That means that any senator can try to kill any piece of legislation by seizing the floor and talking indefinitely; in other words, by staging a filibuster. The filibuster can be shut off only if 60 members of the Senate vote to do so, a procedure known as cloture. The filibuster has been hotly debated many times. Historically, a two-thirds vote was required to conclude debate. The 60-vote, or three-fifths, rule was instituted in the 1960's to strengthen the hand of the majority. But whatever vote was needed to adopt cloture, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, noted, the ''general understanding'' throughout Senate history was that once it passed, the lawmakers would proceed rapidly to a final vote on the merits of the bill. That unwritten rule changed in 1969, when Senator James B. Allen, Democrat of Alabama, came to Washington and virtually invented the ''post-cloture filibuster.'' An expert in parliamentary procedure, Senator Allen, who has since died, discovered that by various delaying tactics, he could keep a filibuster going long after cloture had been invoked. His pioneering work was embroidered upon by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and former Senator James Abourezk, Democrat of South Dakota, who staged a long post-cloture filibuster against a rise in natural gas prices in 1977. Breaking Point Reached The issue came to the fore in the post-election session of Congress last year, when a small group of conservative Senators tried to thwart a bill raising the gasoline tax to pay for highway and mass transit improvements. The filibuster was eventually defeated after numerous late-night sessions, but Senate leaders decided that a breaking point had been reached. ''I think most members of the Senate, and a high percentage of the general public, perceived that the Senate was unable to cope during the lame-duck session,'' said Senator Mathias, who is chairman of the Rules Committee. ''If we were to continue as an effective institution, something had to be done.'' Under current rules, once cloture is voted, the Senate can debate a bill for 100 hours, one hour per member. But the chance to offer amendments is almost endless, and procedural matters, such as rollcalls, do not count against the time limit. Some of the proposals under discussion would reduce the total post-cloture debate to say, 50 hours, or severely limit the right to offer amendments once cloture was voted. 'Very Delicate Balancing Act' The rules of any legislative body always constitute ''a very delicate balancing act,'' in the words of Senator Mathias. As Senator Russell Long, Democrat of Louisiana, put it: ''The whole thing is a constant trade-off of rights, the right of the majority versus the rights of the minority. And any time you give a benefit to one group, you cost the other group.'' When used properly, Senator Mathias said, the filibuster is ''a very important right,'' because it forces the Senate ''to stop and think.'' But he believes that the rise of the post-cloture filibuster has tilted the delicate Senate balance in favor of the minority. ''Having stopped and thought,'' he added, ''you have to have the ability to move on and get a decision. If you prevent yourself from being able to do that, you're crippling the whole process of government.'' Some senators are worried, however, that the Senate leadership is overreacting to the gasoline tax filibuster. ''The problem with that whole thing is that it occured right before Christmas,'' said one Republican staff member, ''and all their wives were telling them to go home.'' Concern Over Punishment Senator John P. East, the North Carolina Republican who helped lead the opposition to the gasoline tax, worries that the rules might be changed to punish him and his allies. ''I think that if the reason for doing it is parochial or provincial, that would be unwise,'' Senator East said. ''Filibusters are staged by various groups of all kinds.'' In fact, while the filibuster was originally perfected by Southern conservatives fighting civil rights legislation, it has been used recently by hard-core liberals to bury such issues as abortion and school busing. And while liberal leaders like Senator Metzenbaum favor changes in the filibuster rule, they want assurances that any new procedure protects ''the rights of the minority to be heard,'' a spokesman for the Senator said. Legislation 'Glut' Cited Moreover, Senator East asserted, the gasoline tax was a good ''case study'' of a bill that was pushed through too quickly, and that ''more reflection and deliberation might have been appropriate.'' If the rules are changed to make filibusters more difficult, the Senator warned, the ''stop and think'' function of the minority might be undermined. Senator East insists that it is unfair to ascribe the Senate's problems to the filibuster rule. The real issue, he says, is that Congress has ventured into many areas where it does not belong, and produced a ''glut of legislation'' that cannot be swallowed. What makes matters worse, much of the legislation is crammed into the final weeks of a Congressional session, and is not spread evenly over the year. ''You kind of squeeze out deliberation,'' said the North Carolina Republican. ''It boils down to pressure and shoving and pushing.'' It is one thing to talk about changing the post-cloture rules, quite another to find a workable alternative. And given the Senate's penchant for obstreperous behavior, whatever rules changes are proposed could always be subject to a filibuster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHEN THE POPULAR WILL CHOOSE TO OPPRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/opinion/l-when-the-popular-will-choose-to-oppress-225609.html,"To the Editor: Professor McDowell's letter is yet another unprincipled use of the Constitution to achieve conservative political results. After condemning Justice Blackmun's opinion in Roe v. Wade as not based on a right specifically found in the Constitution, Mr. McDowell abandons his own approach to promote political views he favors. o accord constitutional status to federalism, as Professor McDowell does, while rejecting a ''right to privacy,'' is at best inconsistent, since neither value is specifically articulated in the Constitution. Further, Professor McDowell's bald assertion that the First Amendment serves merely to promote the ''free exchange of ideas'' is dubious in light of the quantity of scholarly commentary to the contrary. In the end, it is fair to conclude that the Constitution is a skeletal document, leaving the definition of the three values Mr. McDowell discusses uncertain. One can take the view that constitutional doctrine is properly shaped, in part, by judges. The ''good government'' Mr. McDowell endorses can best be served by a view of political institutions that is consistent. At the very least, if one adopts the view that the Constitution serves certain political ends, the text of the document should not serve merely as a convenient hiding place. JEFFREY A.

D'AMATO: AT HOME IN THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/magazine/d-amato-at-home-in-the-senate.html,"Tom Goldstein is a writer specializing in legal and political affairs. Day after day, night after night, the debate over legislation to raise the gasoline tax dragged on. Conservatives filibustered against the measure, which was intended to create a public works program. The Administration also disliked the plan, but gradually gave ground as Christmas approached. While larger political and economic issues were being played out around him, Alfonse M. D'Amato, New York's junior Senator, was keeping watch over a more parochial issue - the preservation of operating subsidies for public transportation, a matter of paramount importance to his constituents. This was his issue, the issue he had picked after his election two years before as a means to make his mark in the Senate. Now the Administration was trying to eliminate the subsidies, which helped pay the day-to-day costs of mass transit in New York City and keep the fares down. D'Amato seldom left the Capitol. Late one night, he pulled off his trousers to preserve the crease, put on sweat pants and managed to get 25 minutes sleep on a couch in his office before he was awakened for a vote on the Senate floor. During another all-night session, aides wheeled in an upright piano they had discovered in the hallway, and for nearly an hour the Senator broke the tension by playing three songs - ''Heart and Soul,'' ''It's a Sin to Tell a Lie'' and ''Blue Moon'' - over and over again. D'Amato was signing papers in his office one afternoon when the debate on the floor, which he was monitoring on a squawk box, unexpectedly turned to mass transit. It sounded like trouble, and D'Amato grabbed an aide and a jacket and dashed down the long hallway to an elevator, a balding 45-year-old echo of the high-school hurdler he had once been. Minutes later, breathing hard, he rose on the floor to defend mass transit funds. ''I am arguing equity here,'' he said. ''For years, my state has been hurt by inequitable formulas. I cannot stand idly by and watch this occur again.'' The speech was a turning point. An amendment to greatly reduce funding for mass transit was narrowly defeated. Largely because of his persistence, his horse trading with colleagues, his refusal to compromise at a time when others were caught up in the larger drama, D'Amato emerged victorious. ''He fought like a tiger,'' says Richard Ravitch, chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ''He was indispensable.'' The gratitude is understandable. Under the measure D'Amato attached to the gasoline tax bill, the M.T.A. will receive an extra $1 billion in Federal aid over the next four years. D'Amato did not hesitate to claim credit. ''It demonstrates to some people,'' he said, ''that instead of being an ultraconservative philosophical demagogue, I can be conscientious to detail, I can build coalitions that can pass important legislation.'' When he bid for the Senate, D'Amato was presiding supervisor of Hempstead, a Long Island ''town'' that is actually a collection of small communities. He ran a shrill, rancorous campaign that left many voters with the image of a brash, unpolished, knee-jerk conservative. He seemed to his critics to lack the understanding of world and national issues displayed by his predecessors, Robert F. Wagner, John Foster Dulles, Herbert H. Lehman and, for 24 years, Jacob K. Javits. During the campaign, there were published reports questioning his integrity. His victory was widely attributed to the split of the moderate and liberal vote between his two opponents and to Ronald Reagan's unexpectedly strong race in New York. Today, after two years in the job, many of the concerns about him seem wide of the mark. Al D'Amato has not turned into a picture-book Senator. His grammar remains imperfect, his voice high and scratchy. He's never lost the habit of greeting strangers, ''Hi, babes.'' But he has by most accounts done a credible job. In part, that reflects a change in the man, in his adaptation to a new world. In part, it reflects a public misunderstanding of who he is and of the Senate. There was a time when the upper house of Congress had some of the elements of an aristocratic club. No more. The aura of collegiality has faded. When Senate staffs were small, senators dealt directly with each other, but that changed when the staffs grew large. Today, turnover among senators is high, and the newcomers arrive with less experience in government than was once the case. Political uncertainty is a particular problem for the 18 Republican senators who were swept into office in the Reagan landslide. Like many of them, D'Amato has been putting some distance between himself and a President whose ratings in the polls have been sliding. D'Amato's term is up in 1986 - a year when there is no Presidential election - and he will have no one's coattails to hang on to. At least a dozen Democrats have already expressed interest in challenging him. His strategy is to be a tenacious booster for New York State - getting Federal help for subways and senior citizens housing and small businessmen - and by letting people know just how he's doing. The 1980 Republican Senate primary was a most strident campaign. In one debate, Javits told his opponent: ''You're a young man in such a big hurry to get yourself elected that I don't know what you'd stop at.'' D'Amato questioned whether Javits, one of the last survivors of the progressive Republican tradition in New York, would live through another six-year term. After his victory, D'Amato went on to win the general election, defeating Javits, who ran on the Liberal Party line, and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, the Brooklyn Democrat, in another bitter, personal campaign. D'Amato relentlessly attacked her votes in Congress against defense appropriations and in behalf of ''ineffec-tive'' social welfare programs. On the evening of his victory, D'Amato was overheard telling supporters that Representative Holtzman had used ''gutter tactics.'' He referred to his ''enemies,'' saying: ''We know who they are and we're going to get them.'' The tone of the comments fed fears about D'Amato's ethics and judgment. There already had been rumors and newspaper stories questioning his honesty. Finally, there were three investigations. The Nassau County District Attorney's office explored D'Amato's role in the awarding of a cable television contract when he was presiding supervisor. The Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into the terms D'Amato had received on campaign loans from a bank in which he had deposited taxpayers' funds. The Organized Crime Strike Force in the Eastern District of New York explored charges that he had been involved in payoffs for construction contracts at the Town of Hempstead's garbage recycling plant. In all three investigations, the Senator has been exonerated. ''Not a single charge stands up to any scrutiny,'' says D'Amato's lawyer, Michael F. Armstrong, former counsel to the Knapp Commission, which investigated corruption in New York City a decade ago. But damage had been done, and D'Amato has been trying to build up his reputation ever since. The most important appointments a Senator influences are Federal judgeships, which are for life. Following Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's example, he appointed a judicial screening committee that recommends candidates. He has nominated more than a dozen judges and prosecutors, and their place in the political spectrum has ranged from conservative to moderate. ''The best'' is how the Senator describes his picks, but the general feeling in the legal community is that, while the candidates, as a group, approach the intellectual and legal quality of those chosen by Javits, they are not as distinguished as those nominated by Moynihan. ''Al wants to show he is a class act,'' says Michael Armstrong, who is a member of the screening committee. ''To appoint good judges and prosecutors is to show he is not a political hack.'' As expected, the Senator has become a champion of some conservative positions. D'Amato opposed Medicaid payments for abortions for victims of rape and incest. He has favored restrictions on the ability of Federal courts to order busing. He supports a bill that would bar challenges to voluntary school-prayer programs. D'Amato has also generally favored reduced Government spending, a balanced budget and deregulation. But, as his colleagues in the Senate have discovered, D'Amato is more pragmatic than ideological. ''To build a record,'' D'Amato says, ''is to do little things day by day.'' D'Amato's voting record in the first third of his term has reflected a greater concern with satisfying his New York constituents than with distinctions of right and left. ''People expected someone fighting on issues like busing instead of mass transportation,'' he says. Then he adds: ''There are more important things than busing.'' Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat who has served on two committees with D'Amato, has noticed the change. ''From the campaign,'' Dixon says, ''I got the impression he was an extreme right winger. I have found him more moderate.'' After the 1980 election, The Rochester Times-Union editorialized: ''New York has two U.S. Senators with brains, beliefs, class and clout. They are Sen. Jacob Javits and Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan. Next year it will have one.'' Fourteen months later, the paper suggested that while D'Amato needed ''a sense of history'' about foreign affairs, he seemed ''genial, hardworking and eager to learn.'' There was New York milk along with New York eggs, New York potatoes and New York beets and sauerkraut. There were ducks from Long Island and wine from upstate. Al D'Amato was the host as dozens of senators and representatives stopped by the Senate Caucus Room reception to celebrate New York Farm Harvest Day. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina arrived early and sampled egg cookies, apples and a blend of New York milk and Kahlua, the sweet coffee liqueur. ''Hey,'' said D'Amato. ''They got a special cow in New York who does Kahlua in his milk.'' Thurmond seemed impressed. ''I did not realize New York was a farming state,'' he said. ''I never would have known this had not Senator D'Amato sponsored this.'' The freshman and the 28-year veteran of the Senate bantered and embraced, and a photograph was snapped. ''Anything he wants, I try to give him,'' said Thurmond. ''That's right,'' responded D'Amato, ''he gives me my judges.'' Thurmond is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which must approve nominations for Federal judgeships. As the lawmakers drifted back to work, they were given a bushel of New York agricultural products. Favored legislators, like Strom Thurmond, also received a jug of cider or a wheel of cheese. Al D'Amato knows how to cut a political deal, a skill he picked up during nearly two decades as a local official, and he sees it as essential to the performance of his new job. ''Not enough of us,'' he told a recent Senate committee meeting, ''have been small-town mayors or supervisors.'' The controversial Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway does not seem to be a matter of much consequence to a New York Senator. D'Amato voted to continue funding the project, he says, in return for Southern support for a bill he was pushing that would provide funds to clean up a radioactive waste dump at West Valley, near Buffalo. In addition to his deal-making abilities, D'Amato has brought great energy and doggedness to his new job. Paula Hawkins, Republican of Florida, another first-term Senator who sits behind D'Amato in the Senate chamber, says: ''He's terrific. He's a sleeper. You should see him on the floor. He won't take no. He'll take them all on. He really cares. He's really sensitive. Maybe it's because he's Italian.'' One of D'Amato's proudest achievements was his winning battle to preserve, nearly intact, industrial revenue bonds. The bonds, which are used by many New York communities, make tax-exempt financing available to small businesses as a way of creating new local jobs. Last summer, he introduced two amendments on the floor, one at 3 o'clock in the morning, and shepherded them until they were passed. ''D'Amato really was one of the one or two key participants,'' says a former staff member of the Small Business Committee, on which D'Amato serves. ''He was tremendously effective, and this is very important to New York.'' In his Washington office, where photographs of his wife and their four children share space with a bust of Lincoln and some partially filled bookshelves, the theme of helping New York is constantly heard. One afternoon, his high-pitched voice rose even higher and his hand sliced down as though he was practicing a karate chop on the arm of his chair as he ticked off recent accomplishments for New York: ''We saved $37 million for senior citizen housing.'' Then he added: ''If I don't do it, who will?'' ''There's a new instrument landing system for Chemung Airport.'' And again, the refrain: ''If I don't do it, who will?'' ''There'll be a bicycle trailway in Rochester.'' Pause. ''If I don't do it, who will?'' Was that refrain an oblique reference to Senator Moynihan? ''Unfair question,'' D'Amato replied. ''I won't answer that.'' Publicly, the two men speak about each other in platitudes. ''Oh, Patrick is an absolutely marvelous engaging person,'' says D'Amato. And Moynihan says: ''He is a fine colleague. We work well together.'' They have a polite but uneasy relationship. Their staffs cooperate when necessary. Al D'Amato was born in Newark, in 1937, and, when he was 7 years old, the family moved to Island Park, a close-knit, largely Italian community in Nassau County near Kennedy International Airport. D'Amato still lives there today, around the corner from his parents. (''It is the second poorest in Long Island,'' he says. ''People find that incredulous.'') Since his election, the Senator has traveled widely - to Lebanon, Tokyo, Taiwan and Panama, as well as to the three ''I's'' that are obligatory stops for a New York politician, Ireland, Israel and Italy. But D'Amato always returns to his roots in Long Island, to the split-level, shrimp-pink Cape Cod with the wrought-iron eagle on the front door. The four-bedroom house on a small lot shows family wear and tear; the Senator apologized to a recent visitor because a part of the door to one of the bathrooms had been scratched away by a family dog, now dead. 1st JUMP D'Amato earns $60,662 as a Senator, and last year he received an additional $50,000 for speaking engagements - an amount that puts him in the top ranks of his senatorial colleagues. Adding in his wife's salary as a teacher, income from her inheritance and some income from investments, he estimates the total at $140,000 - but he says he still had to borrow money last year to pay his taxes. When the Senate is in session, he stays in a condominium he recently purchased in Virginia. During one of the Senator's visits to Island Park, he carried out the garbage and chatted with the sanitation men, then dropped into his favorite chair in the living room. He was somewhat groggy, feeling the aftereffects of a whirlwind trip abroad. Over the course of the morning, several old friends from the neighborhood visited. From across the room, Michael Masone, superintendent of public works for 20 years, volunteered that the Senate had not changed D'Amato. ''He's still the same Tippy to us,'' said Masone. D'Amato blushed at the sound of the nickname, and at first refused to tell how he came by it. Finally he relented. ''Alfonse!'' he squealed. ''Growing up with that, I needed a nickname.'' His relatives found one, calling him Tippy after the family's active and excitable pet dog. The Senator is the oldest of three children. His brother Armand, 37 years of age, a State Assemblyman, lives a few miles away. His sister, Joanne Ribiero, 35, is married to a concert violinist and lives in Florida. D'Amato attended Syracuse University, first as an undergraduate, then as a law student, working part time as a janitor. At Syracuse, he met and married Penelope Collenburg and moved back to Island Park after graduation. Through a friend of his father, he got the clerk's job in the town attorney's office, and he has not been off a government payroll since. In 1977, D'Amato became Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead, a political entity of 840,000 people. He held the most heavily weighted vote on the county's Board of Supervisors, but he did not have administrative responsibility over the police and fire departments or health services. Two years later, he recalls, he decided to make a bid for the Senate: ''I was fairly certain Javits would be vulnerable to a primary. The Republicans felt estranged from him.'' After his victory, D'Amato found himself an outsider in an insider's city. On his first trip to the capital after the election, he brought along just one adviser - Thomas A. Bolan, a founder of the state's Conservative Party and an early and influential Reagan supporter, but a man D'Amato hardly knew. The two have since become close. Bolan, a law partner of Roy M. Cohn, serves as a middleman between the Senator and Reagan aides. Some of these aides now feel that D'Amato rode the President's coattails to victory in 1980 and has not shown the proper gratitude. As chief of his staff of 50 people, D'Amato chose John R. Zagame, a friend of Armand D'Amato and a former State Assemblyman from Oswego. Zagame ran for Congress in 1980 and was defeated in the Republican primary. His only previous experience in Washington was as a Congressional page. On many levels, the Senator has worked hard to adapt to his new job. His clothing, for example. ''He's more spruced up,'' says his brother Armand. ''He's not as Long Island-y.'' The suits come from a factory outlet, but they tend to be darker, more conservative. As a freshman Senator, his most important adaptation, D'Amato says, has been what he calls ''a more balanced viewpoint.'' He explains: ''I am much more willing to listen. I don't cling tenaciously to the thought that I know everything.'' The Republican leaders in the Senate feel he has done what they require of a freshman Senator, that he has voted with the party on most key issues. In the beginning, he made some embarrassing mistakes. The worst, he says, was his proposal that Federal housing funds be denied to those cities that refused to phase out rent control. The plan died, and D'Amato reaped nothing but ill will among the thousands of his constituents who live in rent-controlled housing. ''I opened my big mouth before I understood the facts,'' he says. When he headed the Appropriations subcommittee that supervises the District of Columbia, D'Amato endorsed a candidate to become police chief in the District. This breach of etiquette - it was not within the subcommittee's purview - particularly irritated the local political establishment because his man, who happened to be of Italian extraction, was the only white candidate in the field. (The Senator eventually won praise for his work on the subcommittee from The Washington Post and from local leaders, including Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.) D'Amato learned another lesson in the ways of Washington when he prematurely disclosed to the press that President Reagan had agreed to name John L. Behan, a Vietnam War amputee who lived on Long Island, to head the Veterans Administration. There had been a struggle over the appointment, and the early disclosure so embarrassed the White House that Behan was never given the post. The education of Al D'Amato, who had spent his life as a local politician in a narrow corner of Long Island, resembles a cram course. He suddenly found himself involved in large, complex issues, without a full briefing from his predecessor, a standard procedure in the Senate. According to Javits, after the election he offered D'Amato the assistance of his staff and access to background papers to provide the newcomer with an ''education in national issues.'' But the offer was never accepted. On the Appropriations Committee, D'Amato votes on the allocation of funds for programs approved by all other Senate committees. On the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, he faces a host of complicated questions. ''What did I know from Glass-Steagall or Steuben Glass?'' asks D'Amato. The Banking Committee has been reviewing the Glass-Steagall Act, which governs how commercial banks may go about their business. Now, says D'Amato, ''There are few people who know more about it than I do.'' A lobbyist from a major bank, however, says of the Senator: ''He is not to be confused with gang busters, but he is not all that bad. He has shown a willingness to learn.'' The leaders of Wall Street have been trying to prevent commercial banks from gaining the right to underwrite securities and, as head of the securities subcommittee, D'Amato has been under pressure from both bankers and brokers. Both groups are heavy campaign contributors. D'Amato expects there will be some legislation this year. ''I'll try to be fair,'' he says. ''What's going to happen? Both sides will be annoyed.'' In the beginning, D'Amato was an unquestioning supporter of the Reagan Administration, at least on economic matters. In an admiring Op-Ed article in The New York Times in March 1981, during the battle over the President's first budget, the new Senator pleaded, ''Let us not pick the Reagan package to pieces,'' and counseled that unless ''even some meritorious programs'' were cut from the budget, ''no significant change in our present economic morass will be possible.'' His first break with the President came over the Administration proposal to sell Saudi Arabia an $8.5 billion package of military equipment, including AWAC radar aircraft. D'Amato, who received only 4 percent of the Jewish vote in 1980, placed himself firmly in Israel's corner from the start. By early 1982, he was labeling President Reagan's proposed 1983 budget ''an absolute disaster,'' and later in the year, he joined 20 other Republicans in voting to override a Presidential veto of a $14.1 billion supplemental spending bill - despite an 11th-hour telephone call from the White House. The President told him, D'Amato says, that a defeat on the budget would send the wrong signal to the financial markets about Congress's determination to control Federal spending. According to D'Amato, he told the President that Republicans were starting to lose the support of middle-class people. He says he warned, ''Mr. President, we're going to divide this country.'' Since then, the Senator has taken pains to separate himself from the President on a variety of issues. ''Don't lock me in with President Reagan,'' D'Amato told one audience. The Reagan military budget particularly raises his hackles. ''You do yourselves a terrible disservice'' he says, ''if you say the military is sacrosanct. Any jackass who says you can't make cuts in a $250 billion military budget is a jackass. That's where this Senator is coming from.'' The President and the Senator see each other only on formal occasions, and D'Amato's contacts with the White House staff are limited. Given the new budget presented last month by President Reagan, their relationship is not apt to improve quickly. The President wants to trim $1 billion in funds for mass transit. D'Amato said they were ''more drastic'' than the cuts sought by the Administration in 1982, and that he looked upon them with ''disdain.'' In general, D'Amato sees himself as a ''mainstream Republican.'' The President, he says, is ''a little more to the right,'' and Javits is ''well to the other side.'' That leaves the Senator a long distance from the ultraconservative many New Yorkers thought they were voting for, or against, in 1980. Today, Al D'Amato is still finding his way around Washington. Rushing from meeting to meeting, cheerfully greeting policemen and perfect strangers, he occasionally makes a wrong turn and must ask for directions. But as he sits in his office, there is a certain sense of comfort and confidence. D'Amato is a man of many moods, and they shift like mercury as his staff moves easily in and out of his office, many of them without knocking. One moment he snaps at a secretary for not removing empty coffee cups fast enough, the next moment he may be hugging her. One day D'Amato complained to Ed Martin, his 28-year-old press secretary, that he disliked the italic typeface used on some press releases. ''I hate this typewriter,'' said the Senator, with no trace of humor in his voice. ''I have such a hard time reading this,'' he added. ''No wonder they don't use the releases.'' (The typeface remains unchanged.) On another afternoon, the Senator's mood was buoyant as he leaned back at his desk and spoke on the telephone with Michael Armstrong. The previous day, a growth, which was found to be nonmalignant, had been excised from D'Amato's chest. The dressing protruded a few inches, and earlier this day it had been removed. The Senator made a sexual wisecrack, as he had several times earlier in the day, about the missing bump on his chest. He laughed at his remark, then looked around the room to make sure the aides and friends gathered there were laughing, too. The phone conversation ended, and then Tanya Metaksa, the chief legislative aide, walked into the room. A quiet, efficient woman, she had worked for the National Rifle Association before joining D'Amato's staff. ''Good news,'' she said. Prospects looked promising for a D'Amato amendment that would allow Federal funds to flow without interruption to seven new housing projects in New York State. Some technical work needed to be done on the amendment, and the gathering in D'Amato's office broke up. Soon the Senator would be on the telephone to three radio stations in Poughkeepsie to announce that rehabilitation could begin on 58 units of Federal housing in that city. D'Amato spends part of most days on the phone, gossiping with local and state political leaders back home. Many of the conversations center around Joseph M. Margiotta, the Nassau Republican leader who had given D'Amato's career several key boosts. While appealing a conviction on charges of mail fraud and extortion, Margiotta still holds his powerful party post. D'Amato is intensely interested, but he wants to stay out of the cross fire over whether his former mentor should resign. He prefers the role of mediator. For example, when Anthony Prudenti, Suffolk County party leader, and George L. Clark Jr., state party leader, were feuding, D'Amato invited them to dinner and patched it up. The Senator insists he wants no formal role in state party politics, and says he is content to let others vie for statewide leadership. Potential leaders include Buffalo Congressman Jack F. Kemp; Lewis E. Lehrman, who lost a bid to be Governor last fall; Warren M. Anderson, majority leader of the State Senate, and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan. ''I want to be Senator,'' says D'Amato. ''I don't want to be state party chairman.'' He does, however, want to keep his home-state image polished. When Congress is not in session, D'Amato is traveling around the state. During last fall's recess, when a third of the Senate was running for re-election, his schedule was so full it seemed that he, too, was running. In one 26-hour period in Buffalo, he met with Mayor James Griffin and more than two dozen civic and business leaders ... held a press conference about the meeting ... took an unscheduled tour of a new housing project for the elderly ... kissed women customers during a tour of the Broadway Market, where Polish is the first language ... spoke at a lunch in his honor at Andy's Lounge on Buffalo's West Side, a predominantly Italian neighborhood ... visited the site of another housing project for the elderly ... met with executives of The Buffalo News ... taped a 30-minute television interview ... met with local political leaders ... responded to questions for 90 minutes at a town hall meeting in Amherst, an affluent suburb of Buffalo ... returned to Andy's Lounge for a fundraiser for the local sheriff ... slept for five hours ... spoke at a breakfast of local Republicans ... appeared on a live local television talk show ... taped a radio show. At stop after stop, his message was the same: ''I'm a small-town boy. I understand the needs of neighborhoods and communities. Unfortunately, people become insulated and isolated in Washington.'' One local official after another praised the Senator for the Federal money he had steered to this decaying industrial city on the shore of Lake Erie. At lunch, the Senator sat next to Representative John LaFalce, a respected young Democrat. ''D'Amato does well here,'' LaFalce said. ''He pays attention to Buffalo. This is the time it counts, when it is not an election year. Jack Javits wouldn't do this kind of stuff. He was a national legislator. There are lots of things I did when Carter was in office I can't do now with the Reagan Administration. When I need help for my district, I call Al.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW JERSEYANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/nyregion/new-jerseyans.html,"TUESDAY marks the 162d birthday of Susan B. Anthony and, according to Christine Carmody-Ary, the state coordinator of the National Organization for Women, Miss Anthony would be proud of today's women.  ''American women are now using the vote that Susan B. Anthony worked to make possible,'' she said. ''We have become healthy in the political arena in protecting our best interests and in being involved.'' Although Miss Carmody-Ary, a 44-year-old Jersey City resident, began working at the age of 12 to help support her widowed mother and younger sister, she did not become involved in women's issues or politics until she became pregnant while employed by a company that insisted that pregnant women leave their jobs. She joined the Jersey City chapter of the National Organization for Women (which later became the Hudson County chapter), working for job opportunities for women, to establish a rape crisis center at the Jersey City Medical Center, to start a battered-women's shelter at the local Y.W.C.A., to help set up an abortion clinic and to create a child-care center at Jersey City State College. Miss Carmody-Ary also helped to start the annual Susan B. Anthony birthday parties in Hudson County, which since 1979 have been marked by a biographical reading and a cake. On Wednesday, she will take Hudson's tradition to Cranbury, where she will be the keynote speaker at the combined Princeton area-Eleanor Roosevelt chapter's celebration. Sanford Schneider, a Medford resident, combines vocation and avocation nicely. On the job at Burlington County College, he deals with Federal matters such as higher-education legislation and grants programs. He also is a member of the Medford Board of Education, and recently was chosen as a representative to the National School Boards Association's Federal Relations Network, an educational lobbying group. Mr. Schneider, who is executive director of research, planning and development at the college, said of his appointment: ''I won't have to start at square one. I've been dealing with Congress in my everyday job for 14 years.'' Carlos Hernandez of Jersey City, who recently was named acting vice president for academic affairs at Jersey City State College, has been involved in projects ranging from criminal justice to an art museum. However, he says, all have been related to his academic interest: psychology. While working on his doctorate, Dr. Hernandez served an internship with the Criminal Justice Evaluation Project in New York City on programs for young offenders. Next, he worked with the elderly on a project at the Cooper Hewitt Museum, also in New York, dealing with how the aged perceive the city's environment. He taught psychology at Jersey City State College while completing his thesis about a public housing project in Jersey City. Although now involved in administration, Dr. Hernandez says he'd still like to pursue research in his special interest: the psychological impact of housing. Augusta Vogt, the oldest resident in the 85-year-history of the Fritz Reuter Altenheim Retirement Home in North Bergen, was 106 last Wednesday. Mrs. Vogt, who was born in Schleswig, Germany, in 1877, arrived in this country in 1899, married and was widowed in 1934. At the age of 97, she went to live at the home. Each year since she reached the century mark there has been a birthday party, and she has received letters from the President, the Governor and the Mayor of North Bergen. According to the home's administrator, Mrs. Vogt is often alert and still enjoys an occasional glass of beer. Patrick T. McGahn of Margate, who was an advance man for John F. Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign and for Lyndon B. Johnson's in 1964 and who directed Wilbur Mills's short-lived 1972 campaign, went to Washington recently with 14 fellow members of a Democratic National Convention site committee to hear 1984 convention host proposals. Nine cities, including New York, are vying. Mr. McGahn said he was looking ahead to when Atlantic City, which was the 1964 convention site, had ''the necessary 20,000 rooms-plus to make a bid'' for the 1988 convention. A delegate to the 1972 convention and an alternate in 1976, he said that he would soon begin querying Atlantic City hotel and business interests and political leaders to see if they wanted to begin planning a run for 1988. Mr. McGahn has been a lawyer for the Resorts International Hotel-Casino and has represented the Trump interests in real-estate deals. Dr. Shirli M. Vioni, Superintendent of Schools in Pleasantville, has been elected to the board of directors of South Jersey Industries. Dr. Vioni, a Pleasantville resident, is the first black and the second woman ever appointed to the 10-member board of the Folsom-based corporation, a holding company that includes the South Jersey Gas Company and four natural-resources development companies. Dr. Albert G. Vitale of Summit has been named head of the medical staff at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York, which is a two-year appointment. A 30-year staff member of the hospital, Dr. Vitale is a cardiologist and an internist and a consulting physician at Overlook Hospital in Summit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PUTTING HEALTH CARE BACK 25 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/nyregion/putting-health-care-back-25-years.html,"AS A physician, I am deeply concerned about the Federal regulation (due to go into effect on Feb. 25) that says that all clinics receiving Federal funds must notify the parents of women under 18 years of age when birth control pills or other contraceptive devices are prescribed for them. This - the so-called ''snitch rule'' promulgated by the Reagan Administration - would put the medical and health community involved with such clinics in the distasteful position of being forced to selectively betray the confidence of the teen-age women who seek their help. Should this regulation be enforced, this country would regress 25 years as a dispenser of health care. Many girls who ordinarily would seek contraceptive help and advice would sooner risk pregnancy than the wrath of their parents. Thus, those who want and need the services of family planning agencies the most would be the least likely to avail themselves of these services. Ideally, we would prefer that teen-agers defer sexual activity until adulthood, when they could better understand the implications of such activities. But like it or not, ''The Pill'' changed sexual mores. Government regulations notwithstanding, there is no way in which we can roll back the new ''sexual freedom'' to conform to standards of 25 years ago. Those young people who are sexually active will remain so despite such government manipulation. We must face the reality that teen-age pregnancies are on the increase, with many a tragic outcome for mother and child. There is nothing so grim as the specter of a pregnant teen-ager grappling to make a decision on adoption vs. abortion, or of coping with the upbringing of her baby, for which she is totally unprepared. Statistically, pregnant teen-agers are classified as high-risk pregnancies, and they are more prone to bearing congenitally defective children, further adding to the problem. The unwanted child of today may well be the battered child of tomorrow, and the baby brought into this world by an immature, illprepared parent is more likely to be the social misfit of the future. The ramifications go on and on, and the financial burden for the care of so many of these babies must ultimately fall to the taxpayer. The least we can do in a responsible and enlightened society is to teach these sexually involved youngsters how to protect themselves from an unplanned pregnancy. If they are intelligent and responsible enough to seek counseling and contraceptive help, we must not discourage them from doing so. The ''snitch rule'' must go! Government interference with the rights to privacy and confidentiality in health care and family planning must not be allowed, lest we set a most dangerous and destructive precedent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLINICS OPPOSING BIRTH-CONTROL RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/nyregion/clinics-opposing-birthcontrol-rule.html,"TAPED to the window of the waiting room in the Planned Parenthood clinic in Hackensack is a note printed in felt marker: ''Planned Parenthood of Bergen County Absolutely Will Not notify parents of minors receiving services.'' The sign is more than a reassurance that the clinic's long-standing policy of confidentiality remains in effect. It also is a symbol of the fierce battle being waged around the country against what its opponents call the ''squeal'' or ''snitch'' rule: Department of Health and Human Services regulations requiring all family-planning clinics receiving Title X funds to notify the parents of minors receiving prescriptions for birth control. The regulations, which are scheduled to go into effect Feb. 25, define ''minor'' as an ''unemancipated'' person up to and including the age of 17. Federal health officials say that the regulations are designed to promote family participation in social-agency services. Familyplanning clinic workers, on the other hand, say they expect the rules to frighten off teen-agers and lead to even greater numbers of teen-age pregnancies. A suit by the Planned Parenthood Federation and the National Planning and Reproductive Health Association is scheduled to be heard in Federal District Court in Washington tomorrow. Another, filed by the Memphis Association of Planned Parenthood, is to be heard in a Tennessee Federal Court on Wednesday. Two suits have been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The first was heard in Federal District Court in New York City on Feb. 3, with the judge reserving decision. A separate A.C.L.U. suit is pending in West Virginia. Most of the suits have been joined by other parties, including, in the New York case, the State Attorney General. After the regulations were promulgated last February, the Department of Health and Human Services received 120,000 comments, of which about half were from individuals and half from organizations and agencies. A breakdown by pros and cons has not been made public by the department. However, according to a briefing memo for Secretarydesignate Margaret Heckler - it was signed by Dr. Edward N. Brandt Jr., an assistant secretary, and dated Jan. 19 - the public debate included ''about 60,000 individual comments (mostly in opposition).'' Asked about the individual comments, Russell Mack, a Department of Human Services press officer, maintained that ''they went all across the spectrum.'' One of the agencies on record as opposing the regulations is the New Jersey Department of Health. Dr. Allen N. Koplin, the acting commissioner, said that when the regulations were promulgated, the department wrote the-then Secretary, Richard Schweiker, opposing them. However, he added, it is ''questionable'' whether New Jersey will enter into a suit. Under the regulations, family-planning clinics must send a registered letter to the parents of a minor girl receiving contraceptives within 10 days after she has been to the clinic. Failure to do so would mean the loss of Title X funds. (These funds are for family planning.) Last year, Title X funds for family-planning agencies in New Jersey totaled $4,249,950 and were used by 20 of the state's 25 family-planning agencies. The 25 agencies operate about 65 clinics. In 1982, according to Ann Levine, director of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of New Jersey, 35,345 girls under 20 years old were seen for contraceptive services by all 25 agencies. Of these, she said, 16,000 to 17,000 were 17 years old or younger. The reason most often cited for a teen-ager's going to familyplanning clinics is the promise of confidentiality. A patient fills out a form asking whether her parents know she is there and whether she wants them to know. Most often, say clinic workers, the answers are ''no.'' Dr. Alta Garfield, program coordinator of family planning for the state's Department of Health, said that ''all the agencies have said that the adolescents have been saying, 'I will not be coming back in' because of the parental notification.'' Most teen-age girls who seek contraceptive services at clinics have been sexually active for six months to a year, according to clinic workers. Before they arrive, some have been using contraceptives that can be bought over the counter, such as spermicides or condoms. Many have used no contraception at all. According to Patricia Manahan, a nurse and clinic supervisor for Planned Parenthood of Bergen County, foam and other spermicides give only 50 percent protection against pregnancy. The clinic, she said, does ''not recommend using the condom alone.'' The birth-control pill is the method most often chosen by teen-age girls, although Loretta Carter, director of social service for Planned Parenthood of Essex County, said: ''Our doctors really don't encourage a young woman to go on birthcontrol pills because pills have hormones.'' But, she added, teen-agers ''want something that's easy, something they don't have to think about.'' On their first appointment in Newark, girls who are given pills must listen to a sex-education lecture. For some of these girls - one-third of the clients are 19 and under - ''this may be their only source of medical information,'' said Earlene Laurel, a nurse who is the Newark clinic supervisor. According to a 1977 publication by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research organization in New York City, risks for teen-agers from birth-control pills are much less than risks from pregnancy. It cites a rate of 11.1 deaths per 100,000 live births among teen-agers, against 1.2 deaths per 100,000 pill users who do not smoke and 1.4 for smokers. In addition, according to the institute, teen-age mothers are 15 percent more likely to suffer from toxemia, 92 percent more likely to have anemia and 23 percent more likely to suffer from complications from a premature birth than mothers in their early 20's. In 1981 - the latest year for which data are available from the state's Health Department - there were 890 births to girls 15 years old and under, 1,308 births to girls of 16 and 2,100 to girls of 17. There were 267 illegitimate births to girls 14 and younger and 7,494 illegitimate births to girls 15 through 19. In 1980, the department also disclosed, 7,751 abortions were performed on girls 15 through 19 in hospitals and licensed clinics, the only facilities required to report abortions. This, the department said, constituted about 26 percent of all abortions reported in the state that year, the latest one for which such figures are available. In addition, it said, 293 girls under 15 had reported abortions that year. Planned Parenthood of Essex County, which has four clinics and gets 60 percent of its funds from Title X, saw 4,754 girls 15 through 19 for contraceptive services last year; the average age was 17. ''If this becomes law,'' said Mary E. Singletary, a nurse and the organization's executive director, ''if the board elects not to notify the parent because we've said to these youngsters that we were going to keep their confidentiality - where do we get the money to service them?'' ''They're making this a political football,'' she added. ''We're talking about politicians telling parents to be closer to their children and children closer to their parents. This won't make them any closer. It might drive them further away.'' Geraldine Rosen, executive director of Planned Parenthood for the Greater Camden Area, which has eight clinic sites, said that ''only the poor'' would be affected by the regulation ''because the middle and upper classes not only have the funds to pay for private services, but they have access to private physicians.'' However, in relatively affluent Bergen County, Planned Parenthood served 463 15-through-17-year-old girls for contraceptives in the first half of 1982. Although many can afford to pay, Adalyn S. Hixson, the organization's executive director, said it was the confidentiality that brought the teen-agers in. As she put it: ''Some of the young people's families have money and could well afford to pay for contraceptive services if the kids had the kind of relationship where they could approach their parents about it.'' Although family-planning clinics have been constantly reassuring their teen-age clients - through messages like the one taped to the window in Hackensack - the teen-agers, clinic workers say, are calling, saying they are afraid to appear, afraid their privacy will not be protected. ''The thing is,'' said Mrs. Manahan of Bergen County Planned Parenthood, ''you can't put a notice up in the office and say you're not going to tell - when all the kids are still out there and can't see the note.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doctor's License Lifted In Abortion on Girl, 12",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/us/doctor-s-license-lifted-in-abortion-on-girl-12.html,"The state Board of Medical Examiners has unanimously revoked the license of a physician accused of performing an illegal third-trimester abortion that nearly killed a 12-year-old. The Department of Professional Regulation charged Dr. Egar Gonzalez of Miami with fraud, illegally terminating a pregnancy and ''the killing of an unborn child by injury to his mother.'' The penalty imposed by the board Saturday was stricter than one recommended by the department, which wanted an indefinite suspension. Dr. Gonzalez also faces criminal charges of acting illegally in performing the abortion on the girl in June 1982. A Dade County Circuit judge dismissed manslaughter and aggravated battery charges, but prosecutors are appealing. According to court records, Dr. Gonzalez charged the girl $1,000 for the abortion.

MAYOR BYRNE PLAYS DOWN HER SEX IN CHICAGO RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/us/mayor-byrne-plays-down-her-sex-in-chicago-re-election-campaign.html,"The Mayor of Carl Sandburg's ''City of the Big Shoulders'' recently confessed to a crowd of a thousand ''Women for Jane Byrne'' of fears she had when taking office three and a half years ago. ''You can imagine what it would be like, being the first woman Mayor and not being able to make the payroll,'' she said. That was Mayor Jane M. Byrne's first and last reference to her sex that evening as she appealed for renomination in the Feb. 22 Democratic primary, in which she is opposed by two men. ''This Mayor has gone out of her way not to identify with women's issues,'' said Patricia Horne, executive director of the Midwest Women's Center, a nonpartisan coalition of traditional and feminist women's groups. Observers See Difference Many observers say that campaign strategies in this primary have been altered because the incumbent is a woman. While Mayor Byrne's campaign projects her as a hard-headed businesswoman, her two major opponents, United States Representative Harold Washington and State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, have appeared interested in women's issues and have gathered on their staffs women known for their strong feminist stances. While all three assert that they have worked diligently, if unsuccessfully, for passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment in Illinois last year, Mr. Washington has proclaimed women's rights ''a major theme'' of his campaign. He talks of injustices, promising better child care, stronger city services for rape and spouse-abuse victims, and jobs for women. Under his administration, he said, women would not just be ''showpieces, go-fers and typists.'' Rebecca Sive-Tomashefsky, executive director of the Playboy Foundation and co-chairman of Mr. Washington's women's organization, discounted Mayor Byrne's claims of having put more women in high office. ''Washington wants to put women in positions of line responsibility,'' his aide said, ''whereas Byrne appoints women to traditional spots, such as human services, arts and libraries. Where are the women in the departments of streets and sanitation, budget or planning?'' Daley Less Vocal Mr. Daley, the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, has been less vocal than Mr. Washington on women's rights, but has relied heavily on his record as state's attorney. He says he appointed several women prosecutors, instituted a rape victim-witness program and streamlined rape prosecutions. Senator Dawn Netsch, known for her feminist stance in the Illinois Legislature, said Mr. Daley's record on women's rights was one reason she joined his campaign staff. She disagrees with his opposition to abortion, but says, ''It is not an issue for the mayor's race.'' Some, including her former campaign adviser, Don Rose, say that Mayor Byrne's approach to women voters is more in line with traditional, almost paternalistic, politicking. An aide introduced the Mayor to a women's group by saying, ''She is making sure your children are not hurt by pornography, drugs and alcohol.'' Mr. Rose said he had steered her away from feminist groups and stances. He said Mayor Byrne's growing emphasis on appearing businesslike, ''almost neuter,'' is calculated to offset ''sexist attacks'' and accusations of her being a ''hysteric.'' Her current staff continues this line. ''Women make it more of an issue that she's a woman than she does,'' said Jan Starr, her women's coordinator. ''We are not in a campaign to elect a woman,'' said Karen Petit, who holds Jane M. Byrne's former city job, director of consumer affairs. ''The mayor is a noun that knows no gender.'' The effect on women voters of the candidates' campaign approaches to them is hard to judge. Two weeks ago, newspaper polls showed that Mayor Byrne's support among women was only a few percentage points higher than among men. But a poll released last week showed a much larger gap; the Mayor's support among women of various ethnic and economic groupings was 15 to 25 points higher than among men of the same categories. Newspaper Slights Karen Wellisch, president of the National Organization for Women, which endorsed the Mayor primarily because she is a woman, said the Mayor is subject to slights and criticism that men are not, from newspapers as much as from political opponents. Newspaper articles have dwelled on her hair style, dress and makeup changes, have called her ''Mayor Bossy,'' and ''mare'' Byrne, have said she is ''impulsive,'' a ''98-pound bully'' and a ''prim s@c@h@o@o@l@m@a@r@m@,@'@' and have quoted her as ''gushing'' her responses to questions. One columnist, a man, suggested that her opponents ''avoid the impression of ganging up on the one female'' in the series of debates that just ended. Mr. Rose, the Mayor's former aide, who is now a television commentator on the primary campaign, said he believed that advice was taken. ''Some of the things they say about her are tainted with sexism,'' he said of the men in the race. ''But they don't attack her quite as hard as they would a man. The worst things they've said about Mayor Byrne aren't as bad as the attacks against Richard J. Daley.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Squeal Rule Sophistry,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/opinion/squeal-rule-sophistry.html,"A Federal judge has finally pierced the hypocrisy by which the Reagan Administration, in the name of ''family values,'' tried to abridge adolescents' access to sex counseling and contraceptives. He properly found the ''squeal rule,'' requiring notice to parents, a denial of Congress's intent and called the defense of it ''mere sophistry.'' After finding in 1978 that ''the problems of teen-age pregnancy have become critical,'' Congress amended a law assisting private family clinics to require that they also serve adolescents. Three years later, it further stipulated that they ''encourage family participation'' in this work. Most agencies have done just that; they encourage teen-age clients to tell their parents about the help they seek, and a majority take the advice. Last year, however, the Reagan Administration decided that ''encourage'' meant the agencies themselves must notify parents whenever girls under 18 request contraceptive drugs or devices. Former Secretary Schweiker of Health and Human Services said this squeal rule would ''encourage'' parental participation because without it that participation was impossible. He also held that it didn't mandate but merely facilitated family involvement. Characterizing these arguments as ''sophistry,'' Judge Henry Werker of Manhattan has now blocked enforcement of the rule, ''because it contradicts and subverts the intent of Congress.'' About 450,000 girls under 18 become pregnant each year. Nearly half become mothers who then risk losing job and education opportunities and becoming dependent on welfare. Of those who seek help from private agencies, 25 percent have said they would steer clear of them if parents had to be notified. A new survey of 1,200 teen-agers in eight cities, by Johns Hopkins University, reveals that confidentiality is the single most important consideration in their choice of a clinic. Instead of reducing adolescent pregnancies and abortions, the squeal rule would probably increase both, by ''encouraging'' mostly avoidance of the agencies. Judge Werker's response to a challenge by New York's Attorney General Abrams and civil liberties lawyers should go a long way toward stifling the clamor for this unwise approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR THE CHIEF OF PROTOCOL, 'CHARMED' AND BUSY LIFE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/style/for-the-chief-of-protocol-charmed-and-busy-life.html,"There will be five official representatives of the United States Government accompanying Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip on their nine-day visit to the West Coast, which begins tomorrow. In the party will be Michael K. Deaver, the deputy chief of staff, and his wife, Carolyn; John J. Louis Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, and his wife, Josephine, and a meticulously groomed woman whose job it is to make sure that all the diplomatic niceties are unobtrusively observed. The woman's name is Selwa Roosevelt and the sign over the door of her office at the State Department reads ''Chief of Protocol.'' Since her appointment last April, the 54-year-old Mrs. Roosevelt, who holds the rank of ambassador and is a successor to Leonore Annenberg, has been photographed greeting 27 kings, presidents, prime ministers and chancellors from countries as diverse as Costa Rica and Jordan, Iceland and India. But the flashbulbs catch only the icing on a complicated and multilayered cake. Her job touches every aspect of diplomatic relationships. ''We've been called the nannies of the diplomatic corps,'' she said in a recent interview that began in her spacious office and continued in her red-brick town house in Georgetown. ''We are the office of record for all the diplomatic corps, now about 6,000.'' Diplomatic licence plates and identification, customs courtesies and free-entry privileges, problems in communities in which diplomats reside all fall under the aegis of Mrs. Roosevelt, as does the operation of Blair House, the President's guest house for distinguished foreign visitors. In addition, Mrs. Roosevelt consults with the President, the Vice President and the Secretary of State on state gifts, always American in origin, and arranges for their purchase. Planning Entertainment The department, staffed by 40 men and women, is also responsible for planning and arranging entertainment for the Secretary of State and his deputy and coordinating with the State Department and embassies on the President's schedule when he travels abroad and on the schedules of distinguished foreign nationals who visit this country. The schedules cover every minute of a visit, including such details as who sits where in what car. ''There's no time for 'After you, Alphonse,' '' she said. Mrs. Roosevelt has, in her own words, led ''a charmed life'' but she hesitates to say so, because she is superstitious. The words appear to take shape almost against her better judgment but they are, in fact, carefully considered. She does not make remarks that she later regrets. ''I'm lucky,'' she said. ''And I have been lucky.'' And she is known far and wide as Lucky, rather than Selwa. A self-proclaimed ''flag-waving, Fourth of July American,'' Mrs. Roosevelt is inclined to believe that her luck started even before she was around to enjoy it, when her father, then a 16-year-old boy from the mountains of Lebanon, stowed away on a boat and made his way to Kingsport, Tenn. It continued, she said, with the woman she calls her greatest intellectual inspiration, Najla Showker, her mother. Mrs. Showker, who still lives in Tennessee, enrolled in college after her husband's death and recently retired as a professor of linguistics. ''There have been two great things in my life, my husband and my parents,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said . ''We didn't have children, which is a sadness, but God doesn't give you everything. He gave me a good share.'' Mrs. Roosevelt has been peripherally involved in government since her marriage in 1950. Her husband, who proposed to her the day after they met, just before her graduation from Vassar, is Archibald Roosevelt Jr, a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt. Now the director of international relations for the Chase Manhattan Bank, he was, at various periods during their marriage, assigned to United States embassies in Istanbul, Madrid and London. Her credentials include a stint as an assistant to Roger L. Stevens at the the Kennedy Center, and a career in journalism. It wasn't, however, until she was named to the $67,200-a-year post as Chief of Protocol that the involvement became direct, and prestigious. It also began almost too quickly. On her second day at work, she was at Williamsburg, Va., greeting Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands. As Mrs. Roosevelt stepped aboard the royal aircraft the Queen, obviously well briefed by her own protocol staff, smiled and said, ''This is your first visit, isn't it?'' The remark considerably eased the newcomer's jitters. Her most important accomplishment to date, she believes, is setting in motion the computerization of protocol records. The program was designed and presented before her tenure but ''I believed it should have top priority,'' she said. The State Department's exacting specifications for her job include a comprehensive knowledge of current affairs and foreign policy and a willingness to accept personal responsibility. Mrs. Roosevelt added a few others. ''You have to have physical stamina, you can't afford the luxury of being moody or bad tempered, and you can never be late,'' she said. ''We also have some guests who speak only their own language so communicating, despite a language barrier, is important.'' Mrs. Roosevelt is fluent in Spanish and knows some French. Protocol itself may transcend party lines but, she said unequivocally, her job was a political one. ''You are part of the Administration, and it is important that you are in tune with the Administration,'' she said. As a registered Republican and longtime admirer of Ronald Reagan, the qualification posed no problems for her. She is, too, she said, an unabashed admirer of Nancy Reagan. ''I love to watch them together,'' she added. ''They have human dimensions. You have enormous respect but you're not afraid of them.'' She particularly related to the President's belief in the American dream, she said, because she herself was the product of it. ''I got my first job when I was 12 or 13,'' she said. ''I sold perfume in a department store during vacation. At 16, I went to the local newspaper and talked myself into a summer job. I didn't know what camp was, or a vacation, but I didn't care and I never felt deprived. I think that was the making of me.'' Several months before her appointment, Mrs. Roosevelt spoke out at what she considered the ''unfair'' treatment Mrs. Reagan was receiving from the press and wrote an article defending her. There are some who believe that although Mrs. Roosevelt's credentials as a knowledgeable Washingtonian, a well-known hostess and a journalist were the decisive factors in her appointment, the article also played a role. ''She has no doubt about her priorities, her life is dedicated to Ronald Reagan,'' the article said, adding later, ''One need not agree with her viewpoints on everything (I, for one, wish she would understand the importance of keeping abortion safe and legal).'' ''But one has to at least grant her the right,'' it said, to ''chart her course as First Lady in keeping with her personality, her upbringing and her own interests.'' 'The Perfect Excuse' Mrs. Roosevelt enjoys the job itself and ''the perfect excuse'' it provides for a limited indulgence in clothes. Her wardrobe includes such designers as Adolfo and Oscar de la Renta. ''I've never spent as much money on clothes before,'' she said. ''I have to dress considering the possibility that I'll be summoned to the White House or to a meeting with the Secretary of State. I'm conservative but I love pretty dresses. I'm a romantic about everything.'' Her household arrangements have also changed. Someone comes in daily to clean and look after the clothes but, she said, her husband has also helped. ''I had always been a traditional wife and never expected my husband to do anything, not because he wouldn't, but because that was the way we structured our lives,'' she said. ''Now he goes to the supermarket for me and does errands. He's very supportive.'' Her days are rarely routine. There may be an early trip to Andrews Air Force Base to greet a visitor, or a breakfast appointment, followed by several hours in the office, a lunch and a meeting at the White House. There are also diplomatic receptions and dinners, as many as seven or eight a week. Her husband accompanies her to some and enjoys his role. ''He often says, 'I have the fun and Lucky does the work,' '' Mrs. Roosevelt reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIRTH-CONTROL RULE IS BLOCKED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/19/us/birth-control-rule-is-blocked.html,"In a rebuff to the Reagan Administration, a second Federal district judge today blocked regulations that would have required federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents when minors received prescription contraceptives. Judge Thomas A. Flannery said, ''It is quite clear that, as a result of these regulations, substantial numbers of adolescents will become pregnant and will either elect abortion or suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancies.'' Accordingly, he added, ''the regulations are unlawful'' and invalid because they violate the letter and the spirit of the law authorizing the use of Federal money for family planning services. Judge Flannery issued a preliminary injunction against the rules, as requested by the plaintiffs, representing clinics and teen-agers around the country. The plaintiffs include the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, a national nonprofit association of clinics. Judge Flannery reached the same conclusion as Federal District Judge Henry F. Werker in Manhattan, who issued a similar injunction Monday in a separate case brought by the New York State Department of Health and the American Civil Liberties Union, but it was unclear at the time whether the order would extend beyond New York. Judge Werker ruled Thursday that the temporary injunction applied to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the official responsible for the promulgation of rules, and ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to notify all its regional offices warning them not to put the new rules into effect. They were scheduled to go into effect next Friday. The Department of Justice said the Government would abide by Judge Werker's ruling but would appeal the ruling as soon as possible. Government Arguments Rejected In the case here, Judge Flannery rejected virtually every argument made by Justice Department lawyers representing the Department of Health and Human Services. The judge said the Government was trying to violate the ''zealously guarded policy of confidentiality'' long favored by the clinics. Claire del Real, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency had no comment on the judge's decision. She said she did not know whether there would be an appeal, but added, ''We continue to believe the rules are legally sound, authorized by law and consistent with the intent of Congress.'' Judge Flannery's decision made no reference to Judge Werker's opinion. Nancy L. Buc, an attorney for the Planned Parenthood Federation, noted that neither decision was yet final. The purpose of the rules was to encourage teen-agers to consult their parents on the subject of birth control. The rules said that a clinic must notify a parent or guardian within 10 working days after providing prescription contraceptives to a minor. Clinics Serve 615,000 Minors The Government estimated that the rule would apply to 5,000 clinics that receive Federal money. The clinics serve a total of 615,000 people under the age of 18. The most effective contraceptives, such as birth control pills and diaphragms, require prescriptions. Federal officials denied that the rules would violate the privacy of young women. The officials said the women would have been told of the parental notification requirement in advance and, by accepting the contraceptives, would have signified their approval. Judge Flannery said he could not accept this argument because a young woman would be making her ''choice'' under ''essentially coercive circumstances.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRESIDENT HINTS HE MAY RUN AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/19/us/president-hints-he-may-run-again.html,"President Reagan offered a ringing reavowal tonight of the most conservative parts of his agenda, teasing a conference of his supporters with a re-election hint that his Administration ''will need more than two years'' to complete its goal of reforming the Federal Government. The President, insisting that the nation had ''turned the corner'' toward recovery, issued his strongest insistence to date in defense of a device designed to protect taxpayers from being driven by inflation into higher tax brackets. Some critics of the Administration want to repeal a provision that Congress passed in 1981. Linking the tax rates to the inflation rate to prevent pushing people into higher bnrackets ''is non-negotiable,'' Mr. Reagan said in a dinner speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. He said, ''It's a fight we'll take to the people, and we'll win.'' The audience responded with cheers, and also applauded when the President, in his strongest remarks thus far on the attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, praised the ''courage and resourcefulness'' of the Italian Government. Italy has raised charges of a possible Bulgarian plot. Mr. Reagan added that, contrary to speculation, no one in the United States Government is ''feeling embarrassed'' with the Italian investigation. A 'State of the Reagan Report' The President, as if mindful of the criticism that has been expressed in some quarters of his conservative underpinning, delivered a sweeping speech that touched on every issue dear to the hearts of conservatives. He called on Congress to discuss the issue of abortion ''openly and freely on the floors of the House and Senate,'' and accused liberals of aggravating the crime problem. Offering his audience at the Sheraton Washington Hotel what he termed ''a sort of state of the Reagan report,'' the President called on conservatives to ''take a great deal of honest pride in what we have achieved.'' Mr. Reagan gently apologized to some conservatives who want him to be more blunt and critical in dealing with opponents, cautioning: ''I hope you know that sometimes it's better if a President doesn't say exactly what's on his mind.'' In his one passing reference to whether he will decide to fun for re-election, the President said: ''Now I'm the first to acknowledge that there's a good deal left to finish on the conservative agenda. Our cleanup crew will need more than two years to deal with the mess left by others over a half-century.'' 'We've Turned the Corner' The President's conservative backers and strategists have been among the more outspoken recently in importuning him to declare for re-election soon so that his political organization will not lose valuable campaign time. Mr. Reagan has insisted that the voters, not the party professionals, will help him decide that question in good time. He told his audience, in effect, that his program had already been successful enough to provide a strong Republican program for 1984. ''It's time to admit our guilt,'' Mr. Reagan declared, speaking ironically of Democratic charges that the Republicans are responsible for the economy. ''Time we admitted that our liberal critics have been right all the time and they should go right on telling the American people that the state of the economy is precisely the fault of that wicked creature, Kemp-Roth, and its havoc-wreaking twin, Reagonomics. ''Let's admit we've turned the corner on the economy,'' the President added, asserting that the Administration had not ''panicked'' in the recession and had kept to its program. ''And our stubborness, if you want to call it that,'' he said, ''will, quite literally, pay off for every American in the years ahead.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A CANDID TALK WITH JUSTICE BLACKMUN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/magazine/a-candid-talk-with-justice-blackmun.html,"John A. Jenkins lives in Washington and writes on legal matters. ONE DOESN'T COME TO this place, of all places,'' says Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, sitting in his Supreme Court chambers surrounded by photographs of Charles Evans Hughes and judges from the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit in the 19th and 20th centuries, ''with an acquired education in constitutional law.'' Reflecting on what he has learned in his 12 years on the nation's highest court, the 74-year-old Justice, a short, slightly built man with a full head of gray hair swept back from a face that is lined and drawn, continues: ''I think this job is very competitive among the nine of us. ... ''If a vote goes 5-4 on a given case - a tentative vote - and one is assigned the opinion to write, he circulates it. And somebody on the down side, on the four, is preparing a dissent. You're locked in combat. It's competitive to that degree. You're struggling for the fifth vote. But I think, clearly, this is an educational process - and I would hope that one matures as the years go by.'' Just a few years back, Harry A. Blackmun was nearly an invisible Justice, widely dismissed, in his own resentful words, as ''a stepchild of others on the Court.'' Although he made history in 1973 with Roe v. Wade, the Court's landmark decision legalizing abortions, of which he is both author and guardian, Justice Blackmun's early years on the Court were mostly distinguished by what appeared to be indecisiveness. His lowly seniority, which garnered him assignments writing opinions in tax cases and other mundane fare, did not raise his profile. Yet today, he has emerged as the Court's most unlikely crusader, a jurist determined to make the Court responsive not only to individuals -''One has to be aware that human beings are involved in all these cases,'' he says - but also to ''prevent it from plunging rapidly to the right.'' Justice Blackmun's evolution as a jurist and prominence on the Court represent one of the most important developments in the judiciary's recent histo-ry, and they have gone largely unnoticed. That a sitting Justice has decided to discuss his tenure is nearly without precedent in a proscribed world where Justices' inaccessibility is formidable and legendary. When Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong wrote ''The Brethren,'' an account of the Court, no Justice was willing to be quoted directly. ''We shouldn't talk out of school,'' the Justice acknowledged during remarkably candid conversations with this writer. ''The rule around here is no interviews at all.'' WO EXCEPTIONS TO THAT unwritten rule, the late Justices William O. Douglas and Hugo Black, each granted a television interview, but primarily limited their remarks to the Constitution. Justice Blackmun is the first Nixon appointee after Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and the only member of the Burger Court to go on the record in extensive interviews. (''The Chief Justice gives one to U.S. News & World Report every year, but it's highly controlled as I understand it,'' says Justice Blackmun.) First, Justice Blackmun participated in a 50-minute session with Cable News Network a few months ago and now he was taking part in lengthy and wide-ranging con-versations punctuated by a self-effacing wit. He speaks openly of his fears about the increasingly conservative tenor of the Court, his thoughts about the legalization of abortion, his relations with other Justices - ''Holmes or somebody described the Court as nine scorpions in a bottle,'' he said. ''We don't socialize too much'' - and especially with the Chief Justice: ''I am fairly positive that he feels I have not been the supportive arm he would have liked me to be.'' Justice Blackmun was initially typecast as the subordinate half of the ''Minnesota Twins'' and therefore an appendage of the Chief Justice, a fellow Minnesotan and lifelong friend. Today, he is speaking critically of the conservative bloc composed of the Chief Justice, Justice William H. Rehnquist and the newest Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor. No longer a conservative, Justice Blackmun has become a pragmatic, strongly independent jurist who more often than not votes with the Court's two more liberal Justices, Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. Justice Blackmun acknowledges the change, although he adds wryly, ''Once in a while I'd like to think that they joined me.'' Not that Justice Blackmun considers himself a flaming liberal. ''I'd like to regard myself as being a member of the center of the Court,'' he says. ''When Potter Stewart was here,'' he explains, referring to the retired Justice whom Justice O'Connor replaced, ''I lined the Court up as 2-5-2 on the spectrum. There were five of us in the center, and whoever prevailed in a case had to get votes out of the center. ''And certainly now I think it's a 2-4-3 setup. ... I know I would be happier if the Court didn't plunge back and forth from left to right, just by the addition of a new Justice.'' Justice Blackmun's unprecedented candor seems motivated not only by his political concern, but also by personal resentment. ''I have a little anger underneath it all,'' he says. ''Anger from being categorized over the 12 years I've been here in a way that I think I never fit.'' Perhaps, too, as his thoughts turn to retirement, Justice Blackmun is also speaking out for his place in his-tory and to refute those critics who have negatively assessed his tenure on the Court. ''I'm convinced much of the criticism simply has to do with Blackmun's style,'' observes Yale Kamisar, a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan. ''He's a plodder. No charisma. No commanding presence. No one would ever take him for a Supreme Court Justice. When I think of someone to compare Blackmun to, it's Harry Truman. Just like Truman, Blackmun has said in effect: 'What am I doing here? I didn't deserve the appointment, but I'm going to make the most of it, and I'm going to convince people by the time I leave that I deserved it.' '' The notion of humility is central to an understanding of Justice Blackmun's place on the Court. He believes he is there to do justice, not merely to oblige its doctrinal demands, and his unprepossessing style serves to re-mind him of the constituency he has been sent there to serve. ''Maybe I'm oversensitive,'' Justice Blackmun says, ''but these are very personal cases. We're dealing with people - the life, liberty and property of people. And because I grew up in poor surroundings, I know there's another world out there that we sometimes forget about.'' The other world that the Justice sees is part of his past. His father owned a grocery and hardware store in St. Paul, Minn. ''We lived in a blue-collar neighborhood,'' the Justice says. ''And we didn't have very much, but nobody complained because everybody was in the same state in our neighborhood. And it didn't do me any harm at all.'' In 1925, the Harvard Club of Minnesota, looking for a deserving high-school graduate to send to Harvard on a tuition scholarship, chose 17-year-old Harry Andrew Blackmun. Characteristically, he now says their award of the scholarship must have been an accident of fate. He majored in mathematics, and to cover living expenses, worked as a janitor, a milkman, a painter of handball courts, the operator of a motor launch for the coach of the Harvard crew and a grader of math papers. He seriously considered going to medical school (''I probably would have been a poor physician''), but chose the Harvard Law School instead, working at the same eclectic collection of jobs to pay both tuition and board. Felix Frankfurter was one of Justice Blackmun's law professors. At the time, Justice Blackmun says, ''I did not particularly admire him. I was not one of his favorites.'' Still, he considers Frankfurter a formative influence: ''He was one of the greatest teachers I ever knew, and I learned a lot from him. ... To this day, when I am working on opinions, if I can find a Frankfurter opinion it's always helpful.'' EARS LATER, JUSTICE Blackmun would fulfill his interest in medicine by serving as resident counsel to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ''It was the happiest decade in the lives of my wife and myself,'' he says. ''I was able to have a foot in both camps - law and medicine.'' Then, in 1959, President Eisenhower appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Justice Blackmun had been a little-noticed appeals court judge for 11 years when Chief Justice Burger suggested to President Nixon that he be considered for the Court. The President had wanted a conservative Southerner originally, but after the Senate rejected his first two nominees, Judges Clement F. Haynesworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell, he compromised with Justice Blackmun, a Northerner who seemed to have the ''law and order'' philosophy he wanted. Justice Blackmun, who has good-naturedly called himself ''Old No. 3,'' says he always recalls ''that I came here as the third choice, not the first, and I think this has been good for me to realize.'' Justice Blackmun recalls presiding over a swearing-in ceremony for an official that took place in the Oval Office. President Nixon told the new appointee, ''I just wanted you to know that we had a number of people in mind for this. But at all times, you were the No. 1 guy.'' According to Justice Blackmun, ''I must have had a funny look on my face, because the President looked at me and said, 'And that's no reflection on you, Mr. Jus-tice!' I've always remembered that, because he obvi-ously wondered how his remark had hit me. I thought it was funny as could be.'' As a federal appeals court judge and as a new Supreme Court Justice, Justice Blackmun seldom seemed to give much weight to his personal feelings about a case. He professed himself to be against capital punishment, but consistently refused to overturn death sentences, saying state legislatures had the power to outlaw the punishment. One case that came before him on the appeals bench alleged racial discrimination in home sales, yet he felt his hands were tied by legal precedents. He wrote a decision saying the civilrights laws didn't apply, then expressed relief when the Supreme Court overturned his ruling. In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, he was one of three Justices voting against the press. ''The First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire Constitution,'' he wrote. In Justice Blackmun's early years on the Court, his opinions frequently seemed naive or ill-reasoned to court observers. In one, he upheld a bankruptcy filing fee - for indigents. On another occasion, after all nine Justices had agreed in conference that a fiveperson jury was unconstitutional but a six-person jury was not, Justice Blackmun was assigned to write the opinion. Instead of explaining the Court's logic in simple terms (the Justices felt they had to draw the line somewhere), he tediously analyzed studies of group interaction and collected statistics on the effects of reductions in group size to show that juries of five or fewer would violate the Sixth and 14th Amendments. Only one other Justice would sign his opinion. ''Some of his early decisions were just wretched,'' recalls the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Burt Neuborne. ''In the civil-liberties community, we just despaired. We couldn't believe anyone could be that insensitive! You wouldn't know it was the same Justice, to look at his opinions today. The overriding verdict on Blackmun is so overwhelmingly positive that the civil-liberties community looks to him as a very important third vote on the Court.'' Justice Blackmun says, however, that ''I don't believe I'm any more liberal, as such, now than I was before. I've always been more liberal than the Chief Justice, for instance. Always.'' The Justice's liberalism was exemplified by his authorship of Roe v. Wade. As the Justice sees it, the Court's 7-2 decision constituted justice in its most essential form. ''I believe everything I said in the second paragraph of that opinion, where I agonized, initially not only for myself, but for the Court. Parenthetically, in doing so publicly, I disobeyed one suggestion Hugo Black made to me when I first came here. He said, 'Harry, never display agony in public, in an opinion. Never display agony. Never say that this is an agonizing, difficult decision. Always write it as though it's clear as crystal.' '' At another juncture, the Justice observes, ''I probably agonize over cases more than I should, and more than most of my colleagues do. I always have done that, and it's something I haven't been able to get over... But at the same time, once a decision has been made, I don't lose any sleep over it.'' Justice Blackmun, who staunchly defends Roe, feels that he probably will be remembered for that ruling alone: ''I suppose I'll carry Roe to my grave.'' His office has received more than 45,000 letters about the decision (''Think of any name; I've been called it in these letters: Butcher of Dachau, murderer, Pontius Pilate, Adolph Hitler''), and he still is sometimes picketed by anti-abortion groups when he shows up for speaking engagements at law schools. He says he is ''fatalistic'' about his safety when he encounters such hostility: ''I'm in my 70's now. I've lived a good life. ... If something's going to happen, it's going to happen.'' Justice Blackmun has expressed his fury when the Court has occasionally stepped back from its 1973 decision. In 1980, when the Court narrowly upheld the Government's denial of Medicaid-funded abortions, he fumed. He needed a fifth vote to have his way, and he didn't get it. The Chief Justice, who had voted with him in Roe, now voted with the other side. Justice Blackmun says the Chief Justice's actions are proof of his becoming ''more conservative'' on this and other issues. ''I feel the abortion decisions are among the most liberal that the Court has produced in many a year. ... And (the Chief Justice) was never very enthusiastic about joining the majority. ... But ever since Roe,'' Justice Blackmun says with exasperation, ''he has gone the other way on abortion cases.'' Like his brethren, Justice Blackmun says he occasionally chafes under the Chief Justice's domination: ''Certainly, he can't be accused of being a rock-ribbed conservative in all respects. But he's a tight-rein man. He likes to keep things tight. He runs his office pretty tight, holds his law clerks under control, doesn't let them mingle too much. There are those who say he's very dogmatic. And impatient with those who disagree. But if one knows him well enough... he has a soft spot, too, as everybody does - if one can find it!'' Justice Blackmun's pique ment toward the Chief Justice has occasionally surfaced in his writings. In a 1979 case, Gannett Company v. DePasquale, the issue was the right of news reporters to be present during a pretrial hearing. Not only did the Court rule 5-4 that reporters had no such constitutional right, but Justice Stewart's primary opinion also said no fewer than 12 times that the closed-hearing ruling could apply to trials as well. Chief Justice Burger joined in his opinion, but he also wrote a concurrence that seemed to limit the holding to pretrial hearings - obviously a far narrower interpretation than Justice Stewart's. Justice Blackmun dissented in Gannett, and he still considers the Chief Justice's concurrence disingenuous. ''I cannot understand it,'' the Justice says almost four years later. ''He tried to make (his concurrence into) a pretrial thing in the face of Potter Stewart's much broader language. I just think it doesn't fit in a scholarly way.'' But Justice Blackmun triumphed a year later, when the Court accepted another case, Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, in an effort to clear up the uncertainties created by the previous ruling. Unlike Gannett, Richmond clearly presented the issue of the press's right to cover an actual trial, and now the Court sided 7-1 with Justice Blackmun. Justice Rehnquist dissented, and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. did not participate. The Chief Justice, as was his privilege, assigned himself to write the opinion, and Justice Blackmun penned a sarcastic concurrence aimed right at him. ''It is gratifying,'' he wrote, ''to see the Court wash away at least some of the graffiti that marred the prevailing opinions in Gannett.'' The Justice grows pensive when asked about his relationship with the Chief Justice. ''I've known him most of my life - since we were about 5 years old,'' he says. ''We did go to the same grade school together. Our paths separated at the high-school level and never joined again, although I maintained an acquaintanceship with him through all the years and watched with great pride his advancement and activities and development. ''He's a pretty dominating person, and always has been. But I know him well, and I think I don't mind his displays of dominance ... or attempted dominance. The Chief has a great heart in him, and he's a very fine human being when you get to know him, when the tensions are off. One has to remember, too, that he's under strain almost constantly. I think he's tired, as all of us are tired. ''When I went through my confirmation process, Senator Kennedy asked me if our acquaintanceship might be a difficult factor in working on the court. My answer was definitely yes. I felt there would be times where our friendship would be sadly strained. And this has developed. There isn't any question about it. ... Our relationship is very different from what it used to be before I came here, and maybe even from what it was during the first couple of years after I came here. Our closeness has lessened considerably. He doesn't come down here to the chambers, although others stop in on occasion. Socially, I don't see him at all.'' When asked whether Chief Justice Burger feels that Justice Blackmun has betrayed him, the Justice replies, ''It wouldn't surprise me if he felt that way. But I'm not going to be a stand-in for anybody. I'm not going to be a No. 2 vote for anybody. I never have been, and I don't intend to be.'' In recent years, Justice Blackmun has become a sensitive advocate of the politically powerless, appealing to his colleagues, as he did in his dissent in the Bakke reverse-discrimination case that prohibited the setting aside of places for minority students at the University of California: ''The sooner we get down the road toward accepting and being a part of the real world, and not shutting it out and away from us, the sooner will (racial discrimination) vanish from the scene.'' Similarly, in a stinging dissent to the Court's 5-4 decision in 1980 denying funds for Medicaid abortions, the Justice stated, ''The Government punitively impresses upon a needy minority its own concepts of the socially desirable, the publicly acceptable and the morally sound. ... There truly is another world out there, the existence of which the Court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore, or fears to recognize.'' Justice Blackmun makes no excuses for the vehement language in some of his dissents. ''If one feels strongly about a major issue with social and economic overtones, I think it deserves some strong talk once in a while. Everybody gets surprised when I produce it. They think it's out of character. But I've been as tough in some of my written language as anybody around here.'' (The Justice wishes, however, that his colleagues' conduct on the bench was more temperate. ''I think our Court is a little rude,'' he says. ''I think we talk too much on the bench, among ourselves, while counsel is speaking. The Chief Justice tells me he gets a lot of letters about it from lawyers. And I think we, at times, are a little rough on counsel. ... With nine of us up there in these black robes, and this poor guy down there alone, it's tense enough without several of us asking questions at once, or doing it in that staccato fashion.'') Justice Blackmun's transformation became quite evident last term, when he authored a number of important opinions that sharply divided the Court. Three of his opinions gave the Federal Government wider authority over state actions, contrary to the general thrust of the Reagan Administration's policies. In aother 5-4 case, Justice Blackmun guided the Court to a decision upholding a Federal law that required state utility commissions to take energy-conservation measures. And he was also author of a 6-3 ruling that for the first time applied the Federal law against sex discrimination to employees of schools and colleges receiving Federal aid. Previously, the law had applied only to students. In prior years, Justice Blackmun might have voted the other way, making the Court's ruling in at least two of the cases far different. After all, during the Court's 1970 term, his first, he had voted with Chief Justice Burger - who dissented in these major opinions last term - 90 percent of the time. That trend continued until just a few years ago, when the Justice's migration from the right became noticeable. Then, with Justice O'Connor's arrival, the turnabout became dramatic: Justice Blackmun voted with Justice Brennan, the Court's senior Justice and its liberal leader, 75 percent of the time. Mistrustful of ideology in the law, Justice Blackmun has sought to prevent those he deems ideologues from upsetting the basic fairness of the Court's original decision. Ironically, that mistrust of ideology has led him to side with Justices Brennan and Marshall, the Court's two most liberal ideologues, as he attempts to maintain a centrist balance. Just as Justice Blackmun sees Justice O'Connor's appointment as adding a third solidly conservative vote to the Court, so does he see it as his responsibility to correct the imbalance her presence creates. ''She's obviously settled down on the right side,'' Justice Blackmun says. ''Nothing wrong with that.'' Yet, although he says he has seen no ''political voting'' by Justice O'Connor or anyone else, Justice Blackmun suggests the Court's newest Justice might have a political agenda. He has, for instance, considered the prospect that she might one day be the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee. ''It's always a possibility,'' Justice Blackmun says. ''You hear every rumor. I think there's also a possibility of her being named the Chief Justice. Suppose the Chief steps down tomorrow. The President could name her. It would be a popular, feminist kind of thing. And then he could still fill her place with another appointment. I have heard comments to the effect that everything she does looks as though she's running for President! But one could say that about a lot of people. She commands the public attention. Eventually, we'll get a woman on a national major party ticket. And right now she's a very logical possibilty.'' Some see Justice Blackmun's balancing act as a glaring deficiency. Unlike his colleagues, Justice Rehnquist for instance, Justice Blackmun makes little attempt to propound a consistent theory of how the Constitution should be interpreted. Unencumbered by precedent, he votes instead in accordance with his sense of fairness. The hazard is that a case thus decided may confuse future litigants. ''What's really at issue here is the role law should play in our society,'' observes Mr. Neuborne of the A.C.L.U. ''Most people think it just exists to settle disputes, but it's actually much more than that. The law is really a set of signals you give people, telling them how to behave. If you have a Justice putting out inconsistent signals to the country, it doesn't help people order their affairs so they can live in accordance with the law. The law can't then be a teacher; it can only be a dispute resolver. To my mind, Blackmun is a terrific dispute resolver, but he is not a great teacher. He's a brilliant pragmatist, but only a passable theoretician.'' ''What is lacking in some of Blackmun's poorest work,'' adds a well-known constitutional law professor, ''is an explanation of how he decided as he did. Even some of his most important opinions and concurrences and dissents are just very personal statements without any law in them. They lack the reasoned foundation that a better Justice would lay.'' Justice Blackmun's critics almost invariably mention Roe when they rebuke him for failing to more carefully locate the constitutional underpinnings of his opinions. The Roe opinion did not link the right of abortion to any specific Bill of Rights guarantee. But the University of Michigan's Kamisar says the abortion issue is such an intensely personal one that Justice Blackmun was bound to be criticized no matter how carefully his opinion was crafted. ''It's inherent in the issue,'' Kamisar observes. ''He's always going to take a beating on Roe v. Wade.'' Justice Blackmun, who moderates yearly a seminar on justice and society at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies with Norval Morris, professor of law and criminology at the University of Chicago Law School, is familiar with such criticism. ''We always have a couple of professors there,'' he says, ''and they're way up in the clouds. They want to talk John Rawls and all the other legal philosophers. John Stuart Mill. The practical lawyers couldn't be less interested in theory! So we kind of take a middle course. I get disturbed when we have a case that goes off on theory and does injustice to the litigant. I think we're there to try to do justice to him as well as to develop a great, overlying cloud of legal theory. I'm not a 'jurisprude.' I couldn't be an expert in jurisprudence if I wanted to be. I'm not Roscoe Pound, or Rawls, or Mill, or Robert Nozick, or all the rest of them. I don't have the intellect for it. (But) I do not think I've been inconsistent.'' ''Of course, all of us are more liberal in some fields and more conservative in other fields,'' Justice Blackmun observes, and cites an example: ''Surely, Thurgood Marshall is a liberal, basically, and it's understandable. And yet, if we get a case in the securities area, I mean he is always over on the conservative side. And this is an area where he and Brennan part.'' Justice Blackmun lives with his wife, Dorothy (their three daughters are grown) in a Rosslyn, Va., apartment, just across the Potomac River from Washington, and, although he earns $96,700 a year and has a net worth of well into six figures, he drives to and from the Court each day in an old, blue Volkswagen. Soft-spoken and approachable, he's a favorite of Court clerks and staff. Off the bench, he is almost Mitty-ish in his demeanor. Gold eyeglasses frame his face, and a hearing aid peeks out from behind his left ear. By the standards of the pin-striped and black-frockcoated lawyers who appear before the Court, Justice Blackmun is plebeian in his manner of dress, wearing in his office rumpled slacks, loafers and a comfortable cardigan sweater. He apologizes to a visitor ''for the looks of the office, but I can't even keep up with the law reviews over there.'' He arrives at the Court each weekday between 7:30 A.M. and 8 A.M., then breakfasts with his clerks in the Court's downstairs cafeteria from 8:05 A.M. to 9 A.M., when the workday officially begins. The routine is unalterable - his breakfast of one egg, toast, coffee and water rarely changes - but ''it came about rather by accident,'' Justice Blackmun recollects. ''When I came to Washington, I wasn't used to the traffic circles here, and the congestion. And I thought that if I got in early and left late, I'd be better off. I told my clerks I was always here for breakfast, if they wanted to join me. And it's continued ever since.'' Given the court's workload - 5,311 cases filed this year, more than double that of 15 years ago - both the Justice and his clerks work weekday evenings and Saturdays and Sundays as well. ''We kept up an exhausting pace,'' recalls Charles Rothfeld, who was a clerk last term. ''And at the end, only Justice Blackmun was ready for more.'' When the F.B.I. conducted its prenomination investigation of the Justice a dozen years ago, it turned up only one criticism: He works too hard. Justice Blackmun credits his stamina to an exercise regimen he follows daily. Each noon, he leaves his office for a four-block-long walk around the Court building. And each day at 5 P.M., he leaves again and goes downstairs to an exercise room staffed by a full-time physiotherapist. ''I couldn't survive if I didn't go down there every day,'' he says. ''At least I get down and stretch, and I feel better. It's a broken-down little exercise room, but I have a regular routine - calisthenics, weights, bicycle, rowing machine, then a whirlpool.'' He doesn't smoke and rarely drinks. Trim and vigorous, the Justice says of his colleagues: ''Some of the younger ones are probably in less good physical shape than some of us old bats.'' His schedule leaves little time for leisure pursuits or socializing. ''His idea of entertainment,'' says Richard A. Meserve, a former clerk and now a lawyer with Covington & Burling in Washington, ''is a walk around Roosevelt Island,'' a small Potomac River nature preserve near the Blackmuns' apartment. Although they would prefer an evening out, the Blackmun's stay home Saturday nights and listen to the ''Prairie Home Companion'' radio show. ''I have 50 books at my bedside, and I haven't read one,'' laments Justice Blackmun, who catches up in the summer. ''During the year, I try to get a few mysteries in, last-minute bedtime reading. Calms one down a bit. The classics, basically. I try to get through the Tolkien trilogy every other year, at least.'' He realizes that the exigencies of his duties have put distance between himself and his wife. ''A lot of people think that when you serve on a multijudge court, it isn't lonely. But it's distinctly lonely,'' he says. ''Certainly, being here has cut down on my social life. I think it's unfair to Mrs. Blackmun. There are not enough hours in the day for me to do some of the social things that she would like to do. I can't do both. I can't get ready for an argument session and go out nights. So in that respect, it's a little lonely, and it's lonely for her.'' Justice Blackmun's only rebellion against to the tightly structured existence of the Court is a well-developed mischievous streak, and it has endeared him to his clerks, if not to the Justices who often bear the brunt of his pranks. When Justice O'Connor, for instance, was named to the Court, she received the end-of-the-bench seat reserved for the most junior Justice. Beside her sat Justice Rehnquist, an old friend and Stanford law-school classmate who, it was rumored among the clerks, had once dated her. Justice Blackmun had also heard the rumor. When they next took the bench, he leaned over to Justice Rehnquist and puckishly admonished him: ''No fooling around.'' Once his clerks jokingly placed a peaked Mao Zedung cap on Justice Blackmun's head and dared him to wear it to the Justices' conference that was about to begin. He strode gamely into the conference, the cap jauntily atop his head. Occasionally, even Justice Blackmun's self-effacement can be amusing. ''He almost never calls in the summer when he's vacationing on one of his favorite lakes in Wisconsin,'' explains Mr. Rothfeld. ''So, when he called, I thought I'd done something that was terribly wrong. Instead, he apologized and asked me if I would read him the baseball standings. He couldn't get a newspaper there.'' Mr. Neuborne of the A.C.L.U. remembers an anxious moment in 1975 when he was a New York University law-school professor sitting alone in the faculty law-school library, marking up one of Justice Blackmun's opinions for inclusion in a legal casebook he was preparing. ''No one would accuse Justice Blackmun of being terse,'' Mr. Neuborne says. ''And I had my red pencil out, and I'd already slashed 20 pages down to six when I heard this voice coming from over my shoulder: 'What are you doing to my case!' It was Blackmun. He was a visiting lecturer at N.Y.U., and he had wandered into the library to get a cup of coffee. I was flustered and I tried to explain. He asked to see what I'd done. And after he read it, he smiled, and said to me: 'It's better your way.' '' Sitting on a window ledge in his office, Justice Blackmun reflects on changes he knows must soon come to the Court. At 74, he is one of the youngest of five Justices who now are well into their 70's. Justice Marshall, too, is 74; Justice Powell and Chief Justice Burger are 75; Brennan is 76. ''When does a fellow step aside?'' he asks himself. ''I don't want to go off in a state of senility, as some have, even on this Co",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rt, in the past. I don't want to reach that point. And, of course, each of us is the last to know when he's reached that point. Just how much longer I'll go, I don't know.'' The Justice says he is mindful that, if he were still at the Mayo Clinic, he would have reached mandatory retirement age almost a decade ago. He is also weighing the wishes of his wife, who has been lightly pressing him to leave the Court. And, of course, he senses the impatience of those who would take his place: ''They're always in the bulrushes, waiting. A lot of them!'' He might write a book after he leaves. ''I think age 75 is the time I ought to take a look at retirement,'' he softly concludes. To leave the Court now, though, would be to deny the full measure of his own evolution. Such is the quandry of Justice Harry Blackmun. In difficult times past, he has taken strength from an affirmation of the biblical figure Nehemiah - ''I am engaged in a great undertaking and so cannot come down. The work would come to a halt if I left it to come down to you.'' THE JUSTICE ON HIS COLLEAGUESJustice Blackmun had the following casual remarks about some of the Justices.WILLIAM J. BRENNAN: Regarding Roe v. Wade, in which Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion upholding the right to abortion: ''It is fortunate that (Brennan) did not have to write that opinion. On the other hand, his stature is such, and his position in his church is such, that he's been able to surmount this criticism and outride it. As you know, he's been honored by the (Roman Catholic) Church in many ways, even since then. But he's had criticism from certain sectors of the Roman Catholic church, as I have - I happen to be a Methodist - from some individuals in the Methodist clergy.''BYRON WHITE: ''A number of years ago, there was an attorney from Houston - a very nice-looking, big fellow -who presented his argument. White asked him a couple of questions and, as he concluded, I noticed - I'm sure Byron White didn't think that I would - that they looked at each other and, almost imperceptibly, nodded. The case was concluded and I leaned over and I said, 'What does that nod mean, Mr. Justice?' And he said - I've forgotten the name, say it's Hill - 'Mr. Hill played against me in a certain football game, and he played end. I've never had a more uncomfortable, battering afternoon in my life than he gave me. He just beat me up.' What happened was, the nod was one of mutual respect between these two old gridiron antagonists.''THURGOOD MARSHALL: ''When we went up (to Justice Marshall's native Baltimore) for the ceremony in connection with the dedication of his statue up there in front of the Federal building, he and I were sitting next to each other and he said, 'Why do you think that fellow asked me what high school here in Baltimore I went to? Hell, there was only one I could go to!' It's that kind of remark that he utters once in a while that I think is revealing about his background, the difficulties of his childhood and the like. And to the extent any of us has that sort of thing, I suppose it colors our attitude toward people, toward the little person - that's a phrase I overuse on occasion.''WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST: Concerning the talks preceeding Justice Blackmun's nomination by President Nixon to the Court: ''I was rather cross-examined by two members of the Department of Justice, one of whom was no less than William H. Rehnquist. He was assistant A.G. in charge of the office of legal counsel. He and I have kidded about that ever since, because whenever I depart from his position, I say, 'Bill, you never should have recommended me' and so forth. He's easy to kid with," he always kids back.''""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIGHT ON A DARK SUBJECT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/books/light-on-a-dark-subject.html,"SECRETS On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation. By Sissela Bok. 332 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $16.95. IN 1969 a young student named Tatiana Tarasoff was murdered by a man who had told his psychotherapist two months before that he wanted to kill her. The therapist called in the police when his patient first confessed his desire; the young man was questioned, found ''rational'' and let go. The university's director of psychiatry overseeing the case then asked that the police expunge their intervention in the matter from the young man's record. No one informed Miss Tarasoff or her parents of the danger; it was thought to abrogate the confidential relationship between doctor and patient. One day Miss Tarasoff admitted the man to her home, was shot and stabbed. The parents later sued Miss Tarasoff's university, the campus police and the therapists for negligence. The California Supreme Court upheld the parents: ''The privilege (of confidentiality) ends,'' the court wrote, ''when the public peril begins.'' Sissela Bok has written a subtle and often eloquent book about conundrums of secrecy like those posed by the Tarasoff case. She is a philosopher whose learning is immense and whose range of reference is wide: ''Secrets'' deals with the Pentagon Papers, the Abscam trials, the Iranian hostage crisis and other contemporary events, as well as making considered judgments on John Locke, Thomas Carlyle and the 14th-century Japanese text ''The Confessions of Lady Nijo.''. The aim of her book is to fashion an ethics of secrecy -when it is justified, when it is not. Like the California Supreme Court in the Tarasoff case, she is disposed to think that secrecy must end when public peril begins. What makes ''Secrets'' complex, however, is the author's acknowledgement that legal definitions of proper and improper secrecy will always miss the psychological and, indeed, theological rationales for secrecy. Her book explores keeping a secret as both a sacred and as a profane act. Twenty-five years ago this book would perhaps have been unthinkable. Anglo-American philosophers were then disposed to write analyses of such matters as ''in what sense can a dog 'know' its parents?'' Brilliance was exercised in proportion to the triviality of the subject at hand; experiences of death, obsession and moral compromise were considered unsuitable for rigorous philosophic analysis, and somewhat embarrassing. Sissela Bok belongs to a new generation of philosophers - Bernard Williams in England, Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel in this country - who have put philosophy in the service of clarifying somewhat the mess of adult life. The vexing problem of the dog's parents has been put aside for inquiries into the ethics of abortion or the censorship of pornography. In this new effort, Sissela Bok's work is distinctive because of her sensitivity to questions of power as they relate to ethics. The present work is in one sense a companion volume to her previous book, ''Lying.'' In both, she pays much attention to the context in which lying or secrecy occurs, specifically what difference it makes to consider these phenomena as private or public acts. In both books she is as much concerned with the psychological motives for lying or for keeping a secret as with the act itself. But ''Secrets'' is also a significant advance on the earlier work; it goes deeper into its subject at the risk of being less clear. ''Lying'' was a brisk, efficient analysis: As the rationales for lying were toppled one after the other, certain nagging but important problems were pushed to the side, like the relationship between a lie and a fiction. There are no such evasions in ''Secrets''; the problems raised are explored from many sides. Indeed, the book is almost maddeningly fair-minded: In her effort to probe the complexity of secrecy, the author takes such pains to present views contrary to her own that the reader sometimes is at a loss to know what she believes. But there is a clear position in ''Secrets,'' one that appears if the reader is as patient with her as she is scrupulous to other writers. Basically, this book argues that there is a break between secrecy in private and in public. What makes secrecy important as an interior experience cannot therefore easily be used to justify professional, military or governmental secrecy. At the end of her study, Sissela Bok writes: ''With no capacity for keeping secrets and for choosing when to reveal them, human beings would lose their sense of identity and every shred of autonomy. Their plans would be endangered and their creativity stifled; they could not count on retaining even the most fundamental belongings. And yet this capacity too often serves to thwart the very same human needs, since it risks damaging the judgment and character of those who exercise it, and conceals wrongdoing of every kind.'' The reason for this potential damage, she says, is that ''Control over secrecy and openness gives power: it influences what others know, and thus what they choose to do.'' The thesis may sound obvious when stated baldly. It isn't, because of the way she analyzes the inner, subjective experience of keeping a secret. Like the sociologist Georg Simmel, she begins by asking why a person's secrets, in her words, ''once revealed, will seem paltry and out of proportion to all that went into guarding them.'' The reason, both say, is that making something secret gives it value. Indeed, a secret creates in us the sense of interior life, so that our inside is not something we have but something we make, partially through our secrets. At this point Sissela Bok parts company with Georg Simmel. His emphasis is on how the psyche continually shores itself up by making new secrets; hers is on how the psyche traffics its secrets in the world. In much the strongest chapter in the first half of her book, ''Confessions,'' she makes clear how psychiatric attitudes toward listening to confessions differ from priestly attitudes and how the person confessing a secret can manipulate others through the act. Despite her keen eye for the abuse possible in harboring and revealing personal secrets, she emphasizes the moral importance of this traffic. She believes that through learning discretion, people can learn respect for the privacy of others, and that through sharing secrets they can create strong fraternal bonds. Most important, she believes that an awareness of the value of secrecy kindles an awareness of mystery: No one can, or indeed should, try to lay bare the unfathomable inner core of another human being that constitutes his or her distinctiveness. In taking this position, Sissela Bok sides with Lionel Trilling against what he called the cult of displaying one's inner authentic self; she shows moreover that in this respect for the secret begins our belief in the sacred. The trouble is that the sense of something sacred about our secrets is so easily profaned. Gossip profanes, for example. In the last half of her book the author shows how institutions and persons in power profane secrets. They do so in two ways. The obvious way is ''Big Brother's'' method, the use of power to uncover personal secrets and so gain control over individuals. The less obvious way, practiced by the doctor, the military strategist and the journalist, is the cloaking of actions of power in secrecy; what makes this complicated is that the individual in power justifies his or her secrets by appealing either to the necessity of his or her work, or by claiming that the keeping of a secret is beneficial to those who don't know. These appeals justify secrecy as if there were no question of using it as a tool of power - to coerce, mislead or violate. SISSELA BOK does not throw all these appeals out of court, but she shows when it is fallacious to reason from the individual to the collective and when institutional claims of secrecy are suspicious on their own terms. There is an especially trenchant chapter on military secrecy. She makes it clear, through an analysis of the Iranian hostage crisis, and particularly the Government's attempt to rescue the hostages through military action, just how the practice of secrecy within military channels created the very inefficiency that caused the military effort to abort. She has equally unkind things to say about the efficacy of Great Britain's Official Secrets Act. This analysis, which also touches on military deception during the Vietnam War, adds up to a vindication of Jefferson's position on the citizenry's right to know about the possibility of war: ''It is their sweat which is to earn all the expenses of the war, and their blood which is to flow in expiation of the causes of it.'' ''Secrets'' makes a strong case, then, against what the California Supreme Court called in the Tarasoff affair the ''privilege'' of secrecy in public affairs, and a strong case for the privilege of secrecy in private. But I finished the book with a certain feeling of dissatisfaction. Government officials have become virtuosos at appearing candid while hiding their real actions; politicians have perfected the art of advertising themselves while keeping their own counsel. The position taken in ''Secrets'' is one that any reasonable official might subscribe to in principle, but only in principle. And the book's analysis of ''disinformation'' and other techniques for creating the illusion of openness is all too brief. Since ''Secrets'' operates at a more profound level than ''Lying,'' I wish the author had returned to her earlier theme and spent more effort on analyzing how people lie when they have a secret. SOMETHING in the premise is also troubling. Not all acts, experiences or beliefs are equally potent in creating that mysterious ''inner'' region we make sacred by keeping secret. Our dog's parents are not a fit subject for mystery; our own, unfortunately, are. For all its evils in practice, one of the virtues of psychoanalysis as a theory is to indicate which of our experiences have the weight to inspire awe and so the desire to keep them locked inside. ''Secrets'' does not pay enough attention to which secrets matter. It provides an ethics of secrecy without a real theory of value. For this Sissela Bok's liberality of spirit is to blame, if blame is the right word. While suspicious of secrecy in the public realm, she shows absolute respect for the varieties of individual belief and desire. The conundrum that faces the author and probably most of her readers -myself included - is how to make judgments of value while respecting the variety of values. What Sissela Bok has created instead are tools for criticizing the powerful when they claim the right to keep us in ignorance. ''Secrets'' is a distinguished and necessary book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE TERMS FAKE DOCTORS GROWING PERIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/nyregion/state-terms-fake-doctors-growing-peril.html,"Walter Ian Fischman has published dozens of books for the home handyman and hobbyist. Among the titles are ''101 Projects for Bottle Cutters'' and ''How to Finish Off Your Basement or Attic.'' Mr. Fischman also wrote a syndicated column called ''You Can Do It,'' and for a year in 1965 and 1966 was the editorial director of Popular Mechanics magazine. More recently, according to authorities, Mr. Fischman decided to branch out into medicine. He set up a practice on the Upper East Side on the ground floor of a building at 25 East 69th Street. Although he said he was a physician, he had no license to practice medicine. In his ''practice,'' authorities said, Mr. Fischman offered abortions and cures for everything from sexual dysfunction to pneumonia. His treatments were unusual. One of his abortion techniques was to insert electrically wired acupuncture needles into the hands, feet and torso of a patient and induce a small electric current. Put On 5 Years' Probation Last Nov. 9, Mr. Fischman was sentenced in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five years' probation for practicing medicine without a license, a Class E felony punishable by up to four years in prison. Officials say that while the number of prosecutions in New York State is still small, concern is increasing about the danger of unlicensed people posing as physicians. ''It's apparently a growing and very lucrative business,'' said William Dowling, the chief of the special prosecutions bureau of the State Attorney General's office, the unit responsible for prosecuting the Fischman case. Investigations of people fraudulently practicing as physicians are conducted by the Office of Professional Discipline of the State Department of Education. In 1981 six cases were passed on to the Attorney General for prosecution. In 1982 the number rose to 10. Charges Are Now Felonies Mr. Dowling said that, while there had been plea-bargaining arrangements through 1981 that had allowed those who were caught to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges, that practice had ended and all indictments would now be for felonies. Mr. Fischman, who is 58 years old, was arrested last June 21 after he tried to perform an abortion on an undercover agent. He was arrested at the office complex he shared with Dr. Louis Parrish, a licensed physician whose specialties are family medicine and psychiatry. Dr. Parrish has declined to answer questions about his relationship with Mr. Fischman. Authorities say Dr. Parrish is liable to prosecution for aiding in the unlicensed practice of medicine. The agent visited the Fischman office to follow up on a complaint by Ellen Liberty, a 28-year-old waitress, who had gone to Mr. Fischman for what turned out to be an unsuccessful abortion. She later described the procedure as a ''nightmare,'' and through her attorney, Stephanie Brand, has filed suit against Mr. Fischman. Patient Describes Treatment Miss Liberty said in an interview that she had sought out Mr. Fischman because a friend had told her that his was a ''humane and less traumatic'' way to have an abortion. Miss Liberty recalled that Mr. Fischman had greeted her in a white coat and called himself ''Dr. Fischman,'' and that everything in the office seemed professional. She said he had dimmed the lights and turned on soft music before beginning the treatment with injections of what he called ''herbal medicine.'' He then inserted needles in her feet, hands and abdomen. These, she said, were wired to ''what looked like a stereo set,'' and she felt something like ''tingling, but it was more intense, painful.'' After the 20-minute treatment, she said, Mr. Fischman said, '' 'You should be feeling good, feeling euphoric like on a marijuana high.' '' Miss Liberty said: ''I didn't feel anything at all. I was just glad it was all over.'' When she found that the procedure had not worked, Miss Liberty informed the District Attorney's office. Because of the delay, Miss Liberty said, she had to have a late saline abortion at Mount Sinai Hospital. Called 'Hocus-Pocus Procedure' Miss Liberty saw Dr. Thomas D. Kerenyi, an obstetrician and gynecologist, to arrange for that abortion and told him what she had gone through with Mr. Fischman. ''It's incredible that anyone would do such a hocus-pocus procedure,'' Dr. Kerenyi said of the Fischman treatment. ''It's witchcraft reborn.'' At least one patient came to Mr. Fischman as a result of a recommendation from someone at the Serenity School for the Body and Mind, a so-called natural-healing center in a former upstairs synagogue at 310 East 72d Street. The school taught yoga and dispensed herbs. Serenity has since moved to a storefront at 74 West 69th Street, where Mr. Fischman taught a course called ''Sexual Acupressure.'' The catalogue said the course could help ''raise your level of sexual awareness and pleasure to a new and higher level.'' The catalogue described Mr. Fischman as a ''doctor of Chinese medicine and the author of a book called 'Sexual Acupuncture.' '' ''Sexual Acupuncture'' was published by E.P. Dutton in 1978. Mr. Fischman was listed as co-author with Dr. Frank Z. Warren. The jacket describes the work as ''a dramatic new technique to intensify your pleasure,'' and described Mr. Fischman as a doctor of Chinese medicine, the author of 26 books and more than 2,000 articles, and the president of Wentworth Press. Mr. Fischman declined to discuss his work. ''I had a very strange group of patients who were allergic to conventional Western medicine,'' he said in a brief telephone interview. Mr. Fischman's former associates at Popular Mechanics were surprised to hear of his conviction. John Linkletter, who is now the magazine's editor, said that Mr. Fischman had left to return to freelance writing but that he continued to keep in touch with the magazine, offering articles from time to time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A CONSERVATIVE SHOWS HIS LIBERAL BENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/weekinreview/a-conservative-shows-his-liberal-bent.html,"WASHINGTON SENATOR Dan Quayle is an unorthodox conservative. The youthful Indiana Republican, who says that Government can be ''brutal and ruinous'' has taken the lead in championing the cause of the structurally unemployed - those who have been eliminated from the job market by a lack of training or education. He says that Government has no alternative but to help provide jobs for minority-group members, women and youths. He also has fought for First Amendment rights involving those who could endanger national security by revealing the identities of covert Govrnment agents, sought reductions in military spending, and believes his party will stand or fall on the social ''fairness'' issue. For five weeks last fall, Senator Quayle supported conservative Republican efforts to ban abortion and school busing, and legalize school prayer. He cast vote after vote to end a liberal filibuster of legislation containing those measures. But then he rose in the Senate chamber to say he was changing his vote. ''It's time we got on with other things,'' the 36-year-old freshman told his colleagues. ''Enough is enough.'' The right wing viewed his reversal as a betrayal. His switchboard and mailbox were flooded with denunciations of his ''pro-abortion, pro-busing'' stand. ''That's the way the far right plays it,'' Mr. Quayle said. ''Some of their tactics are detestable.'' The radical right may find further reason to denounce the lawmaker these days. He has sponsored legislation that would provide $2 billion to help the approximately seven million structurally unemployed. The Administration rejected the proposal last week when Martin Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told the subcommittee on employment and productivity that Mr. Quayle's notion was ''a far less useful way to spend Government funds'' than the President's recommendation. The Senator, who heads that subcommittee, replied that the President's proposal to accelerate Federal construction and other public works would provide relatively costly jobs for skilled workers while ignoring the rest of the unemployed. ''We want to look at the minorities, the women, the last-hired, first-fired aspect,'' Mr. Quayle said. These were unexpected words from the rich, conservative grandson of the late Eugene Pulliam, the very conservative publisher of The Indianapolis Star. They certainly seemed to represent a departure from the record Mr. Quayle, himself a former newspaper publisher and editor, compiled in two terms in the House of Representatves. Mr. Quayle unseated Democratic Senator Birch Bayh in 1980, using the slogan ''A New Generation of Leadership.'' During his first two years in the Senate, his biggest problem seemed to be that he was regarded as a Robert Redford look-alike. ''I started off thinking, oh God, I've got this pretty young thing on my committee and he hasn't a brain in his head,'' said a key aide to the Budget Committee, on which Mr. Quayle serves. ''He's turned out to be a lot tougher, more thoughtful and independent than I thought he would be.'' Conservative Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, sees Mr. Quayle as a ''very effective, hardworking guy who grabbed the unemployment issue and moved ahead with it.'' But a Democrat on the Budget committee said ''I don't get the impression that he's a heavyweight yet.'' The Senator's conservatism has doubtless been tempered by the economic plight of his state, where unemployment is higher than 12 percent. ''If I were from a Sunbelt state, I might have a different outlook,'' he acknowledges. ''The Federal Government has built the Sunbelt through dams and public works projects. Now it's our turn.'' He insists that his political instincts remain conservative. But, he adds, ''you accommodate to the times you find yourself in.'' And he thinks Republicans risk the voters' wrath if they don't ''take the initiative and deal with unemployment.'' Even before the jobs program, Mr. Quayle displayed some independence from both his party and the Administration. In his first year in the Senate, he supported the Administration's drastic cuts in Comprehensive Employment and Training Assistance programs. But he helped stave off cuts in youth job training programs, which received $1 billion more than the President had asked. The Senator also is a civil libertarian, especially protective of the First Amendment. Last year he sought unsuccessfully to narrow the criteria for prosecution under the Agents Identities Act, which penalizes those who publish the names of American secret agents. ''Conservatives are supposed to be for individual liberties,'' he said. They are also often expected to be hawkish on military spending issues. But Senator Quayle, a member of the Armed Services committee, has called for reductions in the President's proposed military spending. He says he has seen a marked decrease in public demand for military spending. ''I was elected in 1980 by a strong defense constituency, and unfortunately it's not there today,'' he said. Finally, Mr. Quayle believes that his party must show as much concern for those at the bottom of the ladder as for those at the top. ''The fairness issue is going to be the hidden issue in the 1984 elections,'' he said. ''The Republicans were elected to reverse priorities. But if we don't do it fairly, we're not going to remain the governing party.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS AND TRENDS; Courts Block Federal Rule on Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-courts-block-federal-rule-on-contraceptives.html,"The Reagan Administration's stated goal of fostering closer ties between parent and child may have been well-meant, but two Federal courts last week said the means -regulations requiring federally funded clinics to notify parents if teen-agers receive contraceptives -were unlawful. ''As a result of the regulations, substantial numbers of adolescents will become pregnant and will either elect abortion or suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancies,'' said Judge Thomas A. Flannery in Washington, D.C. And that, said Judge Henry F. Werker in New York, separately making the same point, ''constitutes a blatant disregard'' for one of Congress's main purposes in providing Federal funds to combat the problems of teen-age pregnancy. Each court issued preliminary injunctions preventing the regulations from taking effect on schedule this Friday in more than 4,100 clinics nationwide. The Administration last week said it would appeal the New York ruling; there was no decision on an appeal of the Washington case. At issue is how to carry out the intent of Congress to stem the number of adolescent pregnancies while at the same time ''encouraging family participation'' in a youngster's decision concerning contraceptives. About 450,000 girls under age 18 become pregnant each year. There is also a question of what Congress meant by ''encourage.'' Most clinics say they fulfill that requirement by trying to persuade teen-age clients to talk with their parents about contraceptive use. Last year, however, the Reagan Administration said that ''encourage'' meant clinics themselves must notify parents or guardians within 10 days of giving teen-agers under age 18 prescription contraceptives. Exceptions would be granted only in cases where the teen-ager might suffer physical harm. Without this notification, said Richard S. Schweiker, then Secretary of Health and Human Services, parents would not have a chance to participate. Mr.Schweiker said parental notification did not mandate family involvement but facilitated it. Judge Werker called the argument ''sophistry,'' accepting instead statistical and medical documentation submitted by the New York State Department of Health that ''parental notification would deter adolescents from obtaining prescription contraceptives.'' Recent studies support the notion that many teen-agers will forgo contraception - but not sex - rather than let their parents know they are sexually active. In 1979 and 1980, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research organization financed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, surveyed 1,200 unmarried minors receiving contraceptives at 53 family-planning clinics across the country. About 24 percent said they would stop using birth control methods if parental notification were mandated. A recent study of 1,200 teenagers in eight cities, conducted by Johns Hopkins University, found confidentiality the most important consideration in the choice of a clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books Of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/books/books-of-the-times-246128.html,"SECRETS: On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation. By Sissela Bok. 332 pages. Pantheon Books. $16.95 WHAT could be more interesting than secrets? It is one of the very purposes of secrets to inject some spice into our daily transactions; they spur us to detection and seal delicious compacts; we are provoked by the secrets of others and deploy them in the games - and the wars - we play. But secrets, of course, are also a more serious matter. As a metaphor for the obscurities of the human heart, and for the incompleteness of our knowledge, they have fascinated novelists to such an extent that one could speculate on their centrality to the novel's structure; one need only think of the grave and troubling secrets at the heart of novels from ''Great Expectations'' to ''The Portrait of a Lady'' or ''The Heart of Darkness.'' For psychologists, they are the signposts and sentry at the gate to the unconscious. And in collective life - the professions or government - secrets are the currency and the armor of power. But in her examination of ''the ethics of concealment and revelation,'' Sissela Bok has written a book that oddly misses the complexity or the deeper implications of her subject. Mrs. Bok, who has taught courses in ethics at Harvard, writes as a practical philosopher. Her aim here, as in her first book, ''Lying,'' is to consider concrete moral problems and discuss ''the choices of how to act and how to shape one's conduct in private and public life'' when dealing with issues of secrecy and disclosure. To bring the methods of philosophic discrimination to the problems of ordinary life is a commendable - and these days all too rare - enterprise. Unfortunately, Mrs. Bok's analysis, especially in her discussions of personal secrecy, is too general and often too obvious to advance our understanding much or throw new light on our perplexities. In her chapters on secrecy in private life, Mrs. Bok mentions almost every idea associated with secrets - their role in the formation of identity, the function of gossip, the practices of some rather curious secret societies, the patient's relationship with the psychoanalyst - but she doesn't explore or bring a strong point of view to any of them. Mrs. Bok defines secrecy as ''intentional concealment,'' and her attitude toward it is almost relentlessly rationalist and evenhanded. In the private realm, at least, secrecy is necessary in some situations but harmful in others. It is needed to protect ''identity, plans, action and property,'' (a rather odd collection of categories, incidentally; surely, the ontological status in ''identity'' is not the same as that of ''plans''), but it can ''hamper the exercise of rational choice.'' It ''may heighten a sense of equality and brotherhood among persons sharing the secret,'' but it ''can fuel gross intolerance and hatred toward outsiders.'' Given such all-too-balanced conclusions, the ideal that Mrs. Bok proposes is that we should be able to exercise control over concealment and openness, and use our own discretion - or ''discernment'' - in deciding whether to tell or not to tell, to probe others for information or to maintain respectful distance. Such advice is sensible enough as far as it goes - but it doesn't go nearly far enough. Aside from failing to give us much guidance for making choices in difficult situations (and, for a book of practical philosophy, ''Secrets'' is surprisingly sparse in actual examples), Mrs. Bok's descriptions never come to grips with what is emotionally vexing or, for that matter, meaningful to us about secrets. There is no insight here into the compulsion to confess that Dostoyevsky knew so well about, or of the burning of the secret unconfessed that so preoccupied Hawthorne - no awareness of the irrational conflicts, the ambiguities, or the doubleness of motives that secrets often portend. To be sure, Mrs. Bok mentions such matters as theories of repression or dangers of forced disclosure - but she glosses over them so briefly, and in such unmodulated tones, that their import, or her interpretation of them, is quite lost on us. Nor does she show much appreciation in this book for the fact that secrets are in part a social convention (it's of no small interest, for example, that we are more close-mouthed these days about our salaries than about our love affairs) and that our sense of sin, shame, taboo, or reserve is largely dependent on the larger culture's values. But without some examination of the specific contexts of secrecy, or an inquiry into their inward significance for us, her formulations remain empty and schematic - a kind of ethics in a vacuum. Mrs. Bok is more persuasive when she turns to secrecy in the public realm. In these chapters, she addresses such timely issues as professional confidentiality, secrecy in science, whistle-blowing, undercover police operations and the ethics of investigations by journalists and social scientists who conceal their identities. On such questions, she takes more definite, though never absolutist positions - essentially against collective secrecy and for individual right to privacy. Mrs. Bok performs a useful service in alerting us to the growing pressures for governmental secrecy and to the excesses committed in the name of such principles as professional confidentiality (she would presumably be highly critical of the American Bar Association's new Code of Ethics, which requires lawyers to keep confidential their clients' criminal intentions), or ''the public's right to know'' (investigative journalism can go too far, she warns, and involve unnecessary invasions of privacy). Still, even in these sections, one wishes for a deeper analysis of causes as well as a dismantling of the official rationales for secrecy. Some conflicts over confidentiality indicate shifting rifts and alignments in our society -the debate about whether a doctor should tell the parents of a teen-age girl that their daughter is planning an abortion, for example, involves our uncertainty about loyalties owed to the family. And other battles over secrecy or acquisition of information are intractably conflicts over power, professional ascendancy, or privilege. The limits on the Freedom of Information Act will surely depend partly on relative influence of various contending groups, as much as on the moral arguments that anyone brings to the debate. In underplaying such factors, and calling for openness, free debate and respect for the individual, Sissela Bok invokes principles on which all reasonable people can agree - and which therefore don't sufficiently explain where the sources of the problems - or the passions - lie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: BIOGRAPHY OF FRANCES FARMER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/arts/tv-biography-of-frances-farmer.html,"Suddenly, it seems, it's Frances Farmer time. The late actress, whose life disintegrated into a pathetic public spectacle, is now the subject of two film biographies. Already released in theaters across the country, ''Frances'' stars Jessica Lange, whose performance has been nominated for an Academy Award as best actress. Now, tonight on CBS-TV, there is the television movie ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'', with Susan Blakely playing the severely troubled woman. Obviously, the Frances Farmer story provides an actress with ample opportunities for demonstrating her acting range. At the same time, though, the story is so unrelentingly ghastly, so horrifyingly grim, that one cannot help wondering if there is much point in its being told at all. The television version, with a script by Dalene Young, is based on Miss Farmer's autobiography, completed shortly before she died in 1970 at the age of 56. ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'' was a title taken from a poem by Emily Dickinson. One of the premises, never completely proved, of this production is that Miss Farmer was an exceptionally sensitive woman whose talent was too precious to be squandered on mere Hollywood movies. Because her writing abilities were smothered, primarily by an ambitious publicity-mad mother, she became very difficult to control and work with. In fact, ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'' sticks far closer to the facts of Miss Farmer's life than the film ''Frances,'' which is something of a scripting mess. A fictious character, played by Sam Shepard, was invented in the film to pluck Miss Lange out of all sorts of terrible situations. The relationship between Frances and her mother was brought into focus only half way through the film even though Miss Farmer's autobiography stressed that ''from childhood on our relationship was strained and torn by strife - every encounter between us ended in screaming hysteria and slamming doors.'' And the film leaves Frances lobotomized and vegetablelike, which was not the case. She went on creating havoc for herself and others for a good many years after that. With the accomplished veteran Fielder Cook as director, the television production tackles the character of the mother from the very opening scene in which we see Mama boisterously singing to a World War I bond rally while her shy little girl stands by watching her in awe and not a little fear. As the years go by, Mama remains the figure in control, giving her defeated husband visiting rights only on weekends and keeping a tight rein on her daughter's career. She is played with fearsome strength by Lee Grant. Meanwhile, although delicate and somewhat otherworldly, Frances is drawn into acting at the University of Seattle. She also gets involved in leftist political causes and wins a free trip to Moscow, where she is able to watch the famed Moscow Art Theater. On her return trip, she stops off in New York, making contacts that will eventually result in her getting a leading role in the stage production of Clifford Odets's ''Golden Boy.'' The character of Odets is played by John Heard, a WASP-ish sort who doesn't bear the slightest physical resemblance to the playwright. Odets is portrayed as the most obnoxious character in the entire story - pompous, petulant, deceiving, vicious, even sadistic. In Hollywood, Frances quickly becomes nervous, edgy, neurotic, gaining a widespread reputation for being impossible. She remains convinced that she is better than her material although the heights of her descriptive talents are suspiciously mundane: ''As a woman, I was plunging downhill to the depths of despair.'' Urged on by Mama, she marries a nice-guy actor who is a total failure as a husband. She takes to liquor and pills. After a disastrous affair with Odets, she drifts into sexual promiscuity. Neither film mentions that she underwent several abortions. When a minor drunken-driving incident makes national headlines, Frances Farmer gets trapped in a series of situations that will lead to her being placed in an insane asylum for eight years and, worse, having her mother being made her legal guardian. These are the years of ultimate horror that would color the rest of her days. This CBS movie tries to end on an upbeat note. Frances begins writing poems and says, ''I had found my place - the beautiful sunlit morning for which I had waited so long.'' Not so, she would go through many more years of alcoholic terrors before finding some relief in 1968 in, among other things, her conversion to Catholicism. Miss Blakely, like Miss Lange, provides a harrowing, in many ways memorable performance. Unlike Miss Lange, she is not as prettily attractive as Frances Farmer, but she fully captures the emotional turmoil of the woman. She and Miss Grant whip up scenes of almost frenzied power. In the end, though, it has to be remembered that the subject of all this energy is an actress who was never in the league of such contemporaries as Bette Davis or Katharine Hepburn. She was a modestly talented performer who never made an important picture. Somewhere along the line, there has developed a nagging imbalance in the perceptions of her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Archbishop of Detroit Demands Nun Resign,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/us/around-the-nation-archbishop-of-detroit-demands-nun-resign.html,"The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Detroit today demanded the resignation of a nun who directs Michigan's welfare programs and refuses to oppose state payments for abortions. The nun, Sister Agnes Mary Mansour, was appointed director of the State Department of Social Services on Dec. 29. The position of a nun in an organization that administers payments for abortion ''negates her effectiveness,'' said Archbishop Edmund Szoka. Archbishop Szoka called on Sister Mansour's religious order, the Detroit Province of the Sisters of Mercy, to decide whether she was in violation of the teachings of the church.

"ASKEW, EX-GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA, TO SEEK PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/us/askew-ex-governor-of-florida-to-seek-presidential-nomination.html,"Reubin O. Askew, a former two-term Governor of Florida, announced today that he was seeking the Democratic nomination for President in 1984 on a platform calling for a ''new union'' of labor and management to rebuild American industry. At a news conference at the National Press Club, Mr. Askew said his experience in state government and as Special Trade Representative for President Carter ''qualifies me to lead this nation during this time of transition.'' He conceded, however, that carrying the party convention would involve an ''uphill fight.'' Without providing details other than some general allusions to sacrifice, Mr. Askew declared that, as President, ''I will challenge business and labor, along with agriculture, education and government, to enter into a fundamentally new relationship, a new union, with one another and with all the American people.'' The declaration put the former Governor into official competition with Senators Alan Cranston of California and Gary Hart of Colorado and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale for the Democratic nomination. Others whose announcements are expected shortly include Senators Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and John Glenn of Ohio. Outlook on Party Ticket Some Democratic leaders believe that Mr. Askew is, more realistically, a candidate for the Vice-Presidential nomination on a ticket that might benefit from a Southerner with somewhat more conservative views than the standard-bearer. Mr. Askew denied that he was a regional candidate, but he noted that ''Democrats have not won the Presidency in modern times without the South.'' While devoting most of his 18-minute announcement to such concerns as international trade and the domestic economy, Mr. Askew was called upon to deal at his news conference with more sensitive social issues like abortion and homosexual rights. Although he has been cited by the anti-abortion movement as a ''right-to-life'' advocate, Mr. Askew said he was opposed to a flat Constitutional ban on all abortion. He said he supported termination of pregnancy where the mother's health or rape or incest was involved and favored the use of government funds for both abortion and birth control for the poor. Mr. Askew said he was taking ''a closer look'' at the issue of homosexual rights but was ''not willing to say'' that the subject fell in the same category as denial of civil rights. ''There are some problems,'' he observed. A homosexual activist, who distributed attacks on Mr. Askew before the ceremony, left the room at the request of the candidate's staff and took up station in the National Press Building lobby. Equal Rights Stand Some feminist critics have charged that Mr. Askew should share responsibility for the failure of the Florida Legislature to approve the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, but he said today the proposal should be part of ''a renewed national allegiance to social justice.'' Mr. Askew said the goals of his ''new union'' would include ''a domestic Marshall Plan to modernize and revitalize our vital industrial base and to assure the continued growth of advanced technologies.'' Asked for a prospective price tag on such a program, he said he favored spending ''whatever it takes.'' As Mr. Mondale and Senator Hart had already done, Mr. Askew pledged that he would not accept campaign contributions from political action committees, the union and corporate groups that funnel funds of special interests to candidates. Senators Cranston and Hollings have said they would continue to receive such donations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IN JERSEY, A VOICE FOR WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/25/style/in-jersey-a-voice-for-women.html,"A public advocate in government service is often caught between the pressures of politics and the call of conscience. Soon, Assemblywoman Joan R. Wright of New Jersey is likely to learn this lesson. A woman who has known both widowhood and divorce and a mother with four children and some new-found notions about the role of women in society, Mrs. Wright, of Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County, was confirmed yesterday by the New Jersey Senate as head of the state's Division on Women. During a recent interview at her legislative office in Emerson, Mrs. Wright, a 44-year-old first-term assemblywoman, talked about balancing a philosophy that incorporates feminist views and a political career as a loyal Republican. ''I plan to go wherever I have to go in this state to raise people's consiousness to the kinds of subtle and blatant discrimination against women that still exists,'' she said. Women and Politics ''It's tough for women to gain any political clout because we still lack money,'' she continued. ''The old-boy network still exists. ''I think I'm a feminist and feminine. If women are going to be credible, they have to have access. You have to realize that decisions for the most part are being made by white males, and if they are going to listen to a feminist point of view, your demeanor has got to be a reasonable one.'' All of this leaves her sounding like a Republican with a Democrat's voice. And yet her message is that most women defy political stereotypes. ''We look at all Republican women as being like Phyllis Schlafly and all Democratic women as being like Bella Abzug,'' Mrs. Wright said. ''The truth is most of us are somewhere in the middle.'' The division she is to run was formed in 1974. It is a tiny agency with a modest budget and a large mission. Eight employees and a director must carry out a mandate to serve the state's 3.8 million women and must do it on $257,000 a year. The division serves as a clearinghouse for information and works with the network of women's groups and organizations in the state. It provides referrals to various county and private agencies that run day-care, support and counseling programs. It organizes task forces and conferences to study legislation that affects women. It addresses issues like sexual harassment. And it runs a 24-hour hot line that answers some 15,000 calls a year. The agency has been drifting and leaderless since May when its former director, Clara Allen, resigned to become a union official with the Communications Workers of America. Late last year, Governor Kean nominated Virginia Bell of Upper Saddle River to the post, but she withdrew after her nomination ran into oppostion in the State Senate. The delay in finding a director angered many women. ''I was becomming more and more frustrated,'' said Mrs. Wright. ''One day I said, 'I'm going to take the job myself.' This started a rumor, and I thought, 'Maybe it isn't such a bad move after all.' So I put my resume in and solicited support.'' In her new $37,000-a-year post, Mrs. Wright, in effect, will become the chief spokesman for women in state government. Her career and her rise to such a visible post followed a classic pattern. She served as president of the Junior Woman's Club of Westwood, was elected to the Woodcliff Lake school board and town council, ran an unsuccessful campaign for county freeholder and then in 1981 won a seat in the State Assembly. Not long ago, however, she was ''financially dependent on my husband, who was the head of the household and who made all the decisions,'' she said. Then in 1971, David K. Wright died suddenly, and Mrs. Wright took over the operation of the family-owned heavy construction company. She remarried in 1974, but that marrige ended in divorce. ''I found that I had grown beyond that old taking-care-of life style,'' Mrs. Wright said. ''I was an individual in my own right.'' This metamorphosis, she said, gives her a certain practical understanding for the her new job. ''There are diverse women's groups out there,'' she said. ''You have NOW on one side and Junior Leaguers on the other who don't identify with the women's movement. My message is: No matter what their life is now, it could change tomorrow morning.'' Mrs. Wright has supported the passage of proposed Federal equal rights amendment and supports Federal financing for abortions. ''I absolutely hate the thought of abortion,'' she said, ''but after one is in that postion, all women should have the opportunity to choose.'' She also knows she will have to come to grips with a political philosophy that many women believe has hurt their cause. ''Yes,'' she said, ''I'm a Republican. My party provides tools for people to do for themselves. The Democrats provide programs and say, 'We'll do it for you.' Where I think the national Republican Party has gone too far is that it has taken away the tools. But I guess we'll just have to learn to to do more with less.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEWS SUMMARY; SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/nyregion/news-summary-saturday-february-26-1983.html,"International Moscow was accused of meddling in West Germany's general election next month by the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A spokesman for the Government said that it ''regards with concern the massive and hitherto unprecedented manner in which the Soviet Union is interfering in the election and the internal politics of the Federal Republic of Germany.'' (Page 1, Column 1.) The United States has been hurt abroad among its allies by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's refusal to endorse the nomination of Kenneth L. Adelman as United States arms control chief, President Reagan said. He said the committee was ''very irresponsible'' in its refusal Thursday to endorse his nominee. He vowed to ''do everything I can'' to win approval of the nomination on the Senate floor. (2:3.) Talks on a preliminary cease-fire in South-West Africa between South Africa and Angola appear to have been sidetracked by the infiltration of an unusually large number of insurgents into the territory. At the third of round of talks that were over in only three hours, the South African representatives apparently made the point that Angola would be reponsible for curtailing the military activities of South-West Africa People's Organization if a cease-fire were to hold. (3:1.) National A jobs emergency bill was approved by the House Appropriations Committee in the first step toward passing such legislation. The $4.6 billion package is a supplementary appropriation for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The bill is scheduled for debate on the House floor next week. Congressional leaders hope to have it on President Reagan's desk by mid-March. (1:6.) A study of the E.P.A.'s management by a professor of political economy is being considered by President Reagan, a senior White House official said. Prof. David F. Linowes of the University of Illinois may head a special committee to recommend changes in the Environmental Protection Agency that might prevent the troubles that have led to investigations by a half-dozen Congressional committees and the Justice Department. (1:5.) The prime lending rate was cut by several of the nation's major banks by half a percentage point, to 10 1/2 percent, the lowest level since November 1978. They responded to intense pressure by the Reagan Administration for lower bank interest rates. Most of the nation's banks are expected to join the cut next week. (1:2.) A strain on the V.A.'s medical funds is threatened by the number of War II veterans who will soon reach the age of 65, making them eligible for free medical care. Most of the 11.5 million veterans of the war will reach that age within the next few years. (1:6.) Curtailment of the Supreme Court in decisions regarding access to abortion and other issues might be tolerated by President Reagan's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services. This was indicated by the nominee, Margaret M. Heckler, who hinted at Senate confirmation hearings that she might tolerate Congressional efforts to strip the Court of its power to decide, in addition to abortion, such issues as school prayer and the use of busing in school desegretation. Senators of both parties pleaded with Mrs. Heckler to give some assurance that she would resist proposals to curtial the Court's power, but she declined to do so. (7:1.) Tennessee Williams died in Manhattan. The playwright was found dead in his apartment at a hotel. Officials said death was due to natural causes and that he had been treated for heart disease. He was 71 years old. (1:3.) John Cowles Sr., publisher, died at his home in Minneapolis. He was the publisher of The Minneapolis Star and The Minneapolis Tribune from the 1940's through the 1960's. His newspapers reflected his views on internationalism, education and religious tolerance. (11:3.) Metropolitan 99-cents-a-gallon gasoline is back in the New York area and other parts of the nation for the first time in four years. Dealers say they expect prices to continue to fall. In Texas, some stations are selling regular gasoline at 95 cents a gallon. In Oregon, prices are as low as 89 cents a gallon. The factors in the price decline, according to dealers and analysts, are that people are driving less, cars are more efficient, gasoline supplies are plentiful and world oil prices are falling. (1:3.) Mayor Koch's work camp program for felons convicted of minor crimes is faltering. Last May, the Mayor said he hoped that up to 9,000 quality-of-life criminals - including three-card monte players, small-time marijuana sellers and turnstile jumpers - would be sent to the camps. However, between last September, when the program began, and the end of January, only 338 such offenders served sentences in a camp. (1:1.) School officials have not complied with a court order to provide handicapped pupils in New York City schools with special-education programs and services, a Federal judge ruled. Judge Eugene H. Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who issued the order three years ago, instructed a magistrate in his court to determine the extent to which the officials and their subordinates ''are now in contempt of this court's judgement'' on key issues.

STANFORD OUSTS PH.D. CANDIDATE OVER HIS USE OF DATA ON CHINA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/us/stanford-ousts-phd-candidate-over-his-use-of-data-on-china.html,"A graduate student nearly ready to take a Ph.D. has been dismissed from the doctoral program by the Stanford University anthropology faculty in a dispute over his use of information he collected at a village in China. The Chinese have cut off scholars' access to rural areas since they started criticizing the behavior of the graduate student, Steven Westley Mosher, 34 years old. His first published research data on the village appeared in a news magazine in Taiwan under the name ''Steven Westley.'' It was illustrated by his photographs of young Chinese women being prepared for abortion when they were seven and eight months pregnant, he said. In an interview, he defended publishing the material about the abortion program, saying, ''It is occurring all over China. I had a right and a personal obligation to tell about it.'' However, he said he did not have ''a good answer'' to why he had altered his name in the news magazine. 'Rocking the Boat' ''The people at Stanford believe I should have written in an obscure scholarly journal,'' he said. ''And academics all over the United States have complained that what I did was rocking the boat.'' Mr. Mosher said he felt that his academic career was at an end. He said that he had been attacked by the Chinese Government because he disclosed excesses in the birth control program and that he felt betrayed by the the Stanford anthropology faculty. He said he had written a book about the village, ''Broken Earth: The Rural Chinese,'' to be published by MacMillan later this year. He would not identify the village, but in a letter from Zhao Fusan of the Chinese Academy of Science it is said to be in Shunde county in Guangdong province. The letter, made public by Mr. Mosher, was written to Prof. Jane Collier, chairman of the committee that recommended his expulsion. ''I found that abortions were regularly carried out on women seven, eight, and even nine months pregnant, often against their will, and that there were even occasional cases of officially instigated infanticide,'' he said in a written statement that he said he had read to the Stanford faculty. 'I Apologize to No One' The statement added that he did not ''expect that these abuses will be curbed by embarrassing the P.R.C. before Western public opinion,'' using the initials for People's Republic of China. It went on: ''But I have at least borne witness to them in articles and photographs. And I apologize to no one for having done so.'' Mr. Mosher told the faculty, ''It was this graphic evidence of human rights violations that led Peking to go public with the charges against me.'' He said the Chinese accused him of trying to smuggle antique gold coins, a brass bell and property ownership papers out of the country. He denied any wrongdoing. Prof. Clifford Barnett, chairman of the anthropology department at Stanford, said four members were absent and three excused themselves from the discussion and vote on termination of Mr. Mosher's studies, and that the 11 remaining members voted to drop Mr. Mosher. 'Unprofessional Conduct' Cited ''We have not issued a clear-cut statement to the public on why we voted to terminate his studies,'' Professor Barnett said. ''We gave him a copy of our investigation report, which makes the reasons clear. I guess I must say only that the reasons are under the general heading of unprofessional conduct.'' The Stanford public information office distributed a statement by Professor Barnett reviewing aspects of the case. It said of a researcher's responsibilities that ''unconsidered action taken by the anthropologist after leaving the field to further the welfare of the study population may foreclose the opportunity of other researchers to carry out research in the same area, and might harm the populations the anthropologist would like to assist.'' Mr. Mosher is a native of Fresno, Calif. He won bachelor's and master's degrees in biological oceanography at the University of Washington, where he studied on a grant after enlisting in the Navy. On graduation in 1973, he was commissioned and ordered to the Orient, where he met and married Maggie So, a Hong Kong Chinese whose father came from the village where Mr. Mosher did his field research. A Chance to Go to China He said he enrolled at Stanford in September 1976 and took a master's degree in Asian studies before shifting to anthropology in 1977. He went to Taiwan in 1979 to do his research for his doctoral dissertation. Then, because he spoke Cantonese, he said, the opportunity came for him to study life in rural China. He said Miss So, from whom he was divorced in 1981, did not help arrange his trip, although he selected her father's former village because ''I would have local relatives who would help me to breech the wall of secrecy.'' He has since married Hwang Hui Wa, he said, an assistant professor of English and Chinese at Fu Hsing Technical College in Taiwan. In three weeks, he will return to Taiwan where he said he lived ''precariously.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN'S NOMINEE BACKS COURT LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/us/reagan-s-nominee-backs-court-limit.html,"Margaret M. Heckler, President Reagan's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, hinted today that she might tolerate Congressional efforts to strip the Supreme Court of its power to decide cases involving certain issues, such as abortion. At her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mrs. Heckler repeatedly declined to criticize such efforts, being made by conservatives who oppose Supreme Court rulings on abortion, school prayer and the use of busing to desegregate public schools. Senators of both parties pleaded with Mrs. Heckler to give some assurance that she would resist proposals to curtail the Court's power, but she declined to do so. Given her longstanding opposition to abortion, she said, it would be difficult for her to fight the proposals to limit the Court's jurisdiction over the issue. But she said she wanted to study the legal issues further. ''I have very little respect for the Roe v. Wade decision,'' she said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed women access to abortion. ''I have read it extensively. I cannot follow its legal reasoning.'' Would Back Congress Vote Mrs. Heckler, a lawyer, said that if a member of Congress wanted to reverse a Court decision interpreting the Constitution, ''a constitutional amendment is the usual approach, and that is a correct one.'' But she said she would not foreclose other options, such as passing a law to remove abortion from its jurisdiction, which requires a simple majority vote in Congress. A constitutional amendment, by contrast, requires approval by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress and takes effect only if ratified by Legislatures in three-fourths of the states. Mrs. Heckler, a former Representative from Massachusetts, declined to give a direct reply to questions about the propriety of efforts to restrict the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. But she said, ''My own strong convictions on the right to life will dominate my own thinking.'' She noted that she had ''consistently voted in favor of the prolife position.'' Liberal senators engaged in a filibuster last year to block efforts to restrict the Supreme Court's authority. Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, said today the efforts were a ''most dangerous ploy to undermine our form of government.'' He said he was amazed that Mrs. Heckler had not considered the issue more thoroughly. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said the nominee seemed to be hiding behind ''the cloak of ambiguity.'' Despite the sharp exchanges over abortion and the Supreme Court, members of the Finance Committee said there was little doubt that Mrs. Heckler would be confirmed by the Senate. The committee chairman, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, a Republican, said the panel would vote Wednesday on the nominations of Mrs. Heckler to be Secretary and John A. Svahn to be Under Secretary of Health and Human Services. Mr. Svahn is now Commissioner of Social Security. High Praise for President Mrs. Heckler was lyrical in her praise of Mr. Reagan, saying she had ''never, never admired a President'' so much. Senator Dole said her comments sounded like a nominating speech, and Mrs. Heckler quickly replied that she hoped she would have a chance to nominate Mr. Reagan for a second term. Mr. Dole, who has Presidential aspirations of his own, said drily, ''We better get off that subject.'' Mrs. Heckler expressed no reservations about the rule that would require federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents when minors receive prescription contraceptives. Two Federal judges, in New York and Washington, have blocked the rule, saying it is illegal. The Reagan Administration is appealing the decisions. Mrs. Heckler said that she would pursue the appeal because the rule embodied a policy set by the President. As a member of Congress and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, Mrs. Heckler last year urged the Administration to withdraw the rule. But today she said, ''My own prior views are personal views.'' Mrs. Heckler was defeated by a Democrat, Representative Barney Frank, in a race that put two incumbents against each other. The 51-year-old nominee was chosen six weeks ago to succeed Richard S. Schweiker, who resigned to become president of a trade association for the life insurance industry. Mrs. Heckler said that, if confirmed, she would be at least as loyal to the President as any other member of his Cabinet. A study by Congressional Quarterly, a weekly publication, found that Mrs. Heckler voted against the President's position more frequently than any other Republican member of the House last year. Mrs. Heckler said that in casting those votes, she represented one Congressional district, but that as Secretary she would serve the entire country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twenty Years After 'The Feminine Mystique',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/books/twenty-years-after-the-feminine-mystique.html,"It is 20 years now since ""The Feminine Mystique"" was published. I am still awed by the revolution that book helped spark. That I was able to put it together at the time it was needed is something of a mystery to me. Even now, women -and men - stop me on the street to reminisce about where they were when they read it - ''I was in the maternity ward with my third kid, and then I decided to go to law school.'' I keep being surprised, as the changes the women's movement set in motion continue to play themselves out in our lives - the enormous and mundane, subtle and not so subtle, delightful, painful, immediate, far-reaching, paradoxical, inexorable and probably irreversible changes in women's lives - and in men's. Firewomen, chairpersons, housespouses, the gender gap, ms., palimony, takeout food, women priests, women rabbis, women prime ministers, women's studies, women's history, double burden, dress for success, assertiveness training, male consciousness raising, role strain, role reversal, networking, sexism, displaced homemakers, equal pay for work of comparable value, marriage contracts, child custody for men, first babies at 40, the two-paycheck family, the single-parent family, ''Victor/ Victoria,'' ''Tootsie' ... . Who could have predicted some of these changes? Not I, certainly. It's hard enough for me, both personally and politically, to cope with the realities of our revolution, as its daughters and sons take its terms for granted and face new problems, new pressures, new choices and conflicts, and express the need for new dreams. It's hard to go on evolving, as we all must, when some who now follow, or fight, or study, or seek power within this revolution seem to want to lock it in place forever as an unchanging ''-ism.'' Early this year, I fled to Harvard as a fellow at the Institute of Politics of the Kennedy School of Government, pursuing with relief a new scholarly quest, retreating (or so I thought) from feminist power struggles, disheartened, less by the attacks of our acknowledged enemies than by the fury of some of my sister feminists over the position I took in my book ''The Second Stage.'' I said the women's movement had to move anew, that the feminine mystique, which defined women only as husband's wife, children's mother, server of the family's physical needs and never as person, had been transcended. I said that we had come about as far as we could with the male model of equity and that now we needed a model encompassing female experience and female values, which men are beginning to share. ''Thesis, antithesis, synthesis,'' as Karl Marx said. As our revolution converges on larger economic upheavals, I said, we must come to new terms with family and with work. Some didn't like my saying that. Well, we are in the second stage now, whether or not anyone wants to admit it. And I am still a feminist. But I am sick and tired of the new spate of pronouncements claiming that the women's movement is finished and the revolution is lost because the ''postfeminist generation'' is moving from a different place. Of course the postfeminist generation is in a different place. The women's movement put them there. Their mothers were the ones who rejected the feminine mystique and went back to school and went to work and otherwise started to change their lives 20 years ago. I, as a feminist, do not find it a cause for grief that this new genera-tion simply takes the personhood of women for granted. If they take women's rights and the opportunities we fought for too much for granted -if they are worried now about jobs, difficult choices about having children, how to pay for a house with or without two incomes and double burdens they can't refuse now even if sometimes they'd like to - it's a mark of how far our revolution has come, and a summons to its own next stage. As far as I'm concerned, the daughters have to move on; they don't have to say, ''Thank you'' - though it's nice when they do. It's also nice that so many now study women's history in college, even in high school. But I am impatient to get those women's studies integrated into history, into every subject from grade school on. I still remember how surprised I was, taking the bus in from my suburban dream house in Rockland County to the New York Public Library when I was writing my book, 20-odd years ago, to uncover the women's history that had been so buried by the feminine mystique in the 1940's and 50's: Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Fuller, Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, women whom most educated women like myself had never studied. Will our memory be buried in another generation as theirs was? Will some future great-granddaughter have to invent feminism once more from scratch? I doubt it. Emily, my own daughter the doctor, went from taking it all for granted in college (''I'm not a feminist; I'm a person. It's not necessary to fight for women anymore'') to fervent feminism after one year in medical school (''There are so many of us now, they don't dare do it openly the way they used to. It's worse now that it's so subtle''). But it's not worse that women are 30 percent of the medical-school class, rather than 3 percent. After organizing the women in her medical school on the unfinished business of sex discrimination, my daughter began to concern herself with fundamental issues as to the practice of medicine itself and her own life. She has decided to go into family practice, dealing with the patient as a whole person in the concrete family setting, not as a specimen of isolated symptoms. Her current problem has to do with 800 miles of distance between her hospital residency and his. Neither of them would consider asking that the other sacrifice his or her own goals for the sake of their relationship, which somehow survives the obstacles of distance and time. y daughter-in-law, Helen, is technically, at the moment, a housewife. The baby was not exactly planned. There were difficult choices to be made, since both she and Jonathan, my younger son, had just finished college, after having dropped out for some years. One day last summer, when they'd brought the baby out to my house in Sag Harbor, Helen overheard me on the phone discussing how to stop new attacks on the Supreme Court decision asserting women's right to legal medical abortion. ''The right to abortion is very important to me,'' said this postfeminist mother, nursing her baby. ''It's important knowing that we had the baby because we chose to. It makes a big difference.'' I relish their mutual joy, their new confident maturity and sense of themselves in their chosen parenthood -which Jonathan truly shares. Watching him skillfully maneuver Rafael into his snowsuit and throw him over his shoulder into the backpack, I sense he gets at least as much of his male identity from being a father as from being an engineer. But Helen is unmistakably the mother. She does not let any male doctor-as-God tell her what to do with her baby the way we let Dr. Spock instruct us. She does not apologize for sometimes being ''bored out of my gourd'' in this ''hiatus'' during which she concentrates on mothering. The choices in themselves seem to create a new sense of values and of self in such a postfeminist woman. And I, as grandmother at last, am the envy of my friends, whose doctor-lawyer-banker daughters are too caught up in their careers to consider babies. With my beautiful, incredible grandbaby - such a beaming, bright bundle of energy, smiling at me with his father's big ears and dimples and his own deep blue eyes, so familiar, so intensely alive, so awesome a miracle - I exult in the generation of life, though I've been too busy this year to baby-sit much. This year, a number of my family of friends had their first babies at 35, at 40, some undergoing rather scary, unexpected complications at birth. Other friends made me fear for their sanity as they suddenly became obsessed, in their mid-40's, after 20 years of brilliant careers, with the wish to have a child. Again and again, in Cambridge or California, one or another notso-young woman would ask my advice about having a baby ''by myself.'' I would reply that it seemed to me difficult enough, and costly enough, to bring up a child with two parents. But the power of this desire to have a child - when women no longer need to have a child to define themselves as women - seems to be as great as or even greater than ever. Choice has liberated an exultant mother; choice has also liberated women to be generative in other ways. Gloria Steinem, for instance, and Germaine Greer have been fine role models for that pattern. But there is unfinished business here for many women. Now that economic necessity dictates that most women must continue to work after they become mothers - nearly one out of two married women with children under 6 now works, compared with 19 percent in 1960; and nearly two-thirds of married women with children over 6 work - someone is going to have to battle, in a new and serious way, for institutions that will help the new family. Imaginative thinking should be done about maternity leave, paternity leave, time off for parents when their children are sick, parental sabbaticals, reduced schedules, flextime, job sharing and child-care supports that don't now exist. But who will take up this battle, and how, in a time when jobs themselves are so scarce that people must take what they can get, when budgets for social programs that already exist are being cut down? It is crucial for feminists to understand the power of the choice to have children and to keep fighting for the right to abortion. But they must give new priority to a child-care crusade and to restructuring work. If these issues are not addressed soon, we can fear a new feminine mystique, invoked to send women home again to have babies instead of competing for dwindling jobs. During this time of recession-depression, President Reagan, who has declared a new campaign against abortion, has also suggested that there wouldn't be as much unemployment if women would stop looking for jobs. After the elections in 1982, political analysts finally began to take seriously the ''gender gap,'' though it had been building for some years, a reaction, in part, to the Administration's attitudes toward the equal rights amendment and abortion. Month after month, women had been indicating their sharp disapproval of President Reagan. The latest Gallup poll found that just 36 percent of women approved of Reagan's job performance, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender gap seemed to be based on women's greater outrage at Reaganomics and a national budget that destroyed services essential to the old, the poor, to children, students, the handicapped and the environment while increasing billions were shoveled into nuclear missiles. The human suffering caused by high unemployment seemed particularly galling to women. It didn't matter that Ed Koch, in his New York gubernatorial race, said the proper words about women's rights, when he had been so opportunistic about Reaganomics. It did not matter that Margaret M. Heckler and Millicent Fenwick were women and had been for the E.R.A.; when they went along with Reagan in 1982, they were defeated. Political analysts now agree that women were crucial to the election of Mario M. Cuomo as Governor of New York and to the defeat or near defeat, in Texas, New Jersey, Missouri and elsewhere, of favorites who had been insensitive to women's basic concerns. At any rate, it is clear now that women's rights and women's issues are no longer minor political items, worth a patronizing sentence on the sixth page of the political speech or tea and cookies in the Rose Garden. President Reagan has just named two women to the Cabinet - Elizabeth H. Dole as Secretary of Transportation and Margaret Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Getting into position for 1984, Democrats often begin their speeches with passionate pledges to equal rights. ''With the gender gap,'' a Democratic aide said to me recently, ''issues like child care could be politically sexy in '84.'' Indeed, this month, an extraordinary meeting of leaders of women's groups, church groups, unions and civil-rights organizations was held in New York City to plan a child-care crusade for 1983. E.R.A. was reintroduced in Congress this year, and I say there will be an equal rights amendment to the Constitution by the end of the decade, after we get the Government turned around. A few months ago, I was invited to Rome by women leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Party. The idea was to speak to them and to leading Italian feminist, Socialist and Communist women about ''The Second Stage,'' which had just come out in Italy. But I don't think they had really read it. Evidently the Christian Democrats realized they had made a big political mistake by supporting a referendum that would have taken away Italian women's right to abortion. The referendum was overwhelmingly defeated, and now, it appeared, I was being brought over to show a conciliatory position toward feminism. Someone must have told them I ''believed in the family.'' To my horror, I heard them introducing me as a ''repentant feminist'' (femminista pentita). I had to clear that up, of course. I had to go back to the feminine mystique, and that necessary, wonderful first stage of women's liberation in Italy, when they had marched in the thousands and voted in the millions for women's right to divorce and to abortion. In their country, as in mine, I said, reactionary forces were still trying to take those rights away, as their abortion referendum demonstrated. Of course, I said, I respect those who, out of religious or other personal conviction, would not choose to use that right. ''The value is life,'' I said. ''The life of the woman and the right of the child to be wanted in life. Abortion is simply a necessity for some when birth control fails. ''But that issue is behind you now, as I hope it will be soon for us,'' I continued. ''We must all move into the second stage, where we face new problems of economic survival, personal survival and family survival. We must be able to surmount the dangers of nuclear war, terrorism and economic chaos. We must continue to be able to choose to bear children.'' I don't know if that's what the Christian Democrats quite expected. The other feminist leaders present, the Socialist and Communist women, seemed to pick up my second-stage suggestions about the need for new child-care supports and new kinds of communal housing for working parents and for those divorced or widowed men and women who now live too much alone. I went from Rome to Paris, where Yvette Roudy, who originally translated ''The Feminine Mystique'' into French, is now President Mit-terrand's Minister for Women's Rights. She is no token under secretary but holds a full cabinet ministry for women's affairs. Yvette described her efforts, in all the regions and departments of France, to protect women's rights in jobs, education, marriage and divorce and to give them training for new nontraditional work. As we walked through the lofty arches of the splendid building that houses her ministry, I was proudly shown a ''gallery of honor,'' where, after Colette and Susan B. Anthony, there was a larger-thanlife portrait that was supposed to be me. ''That's not me!'' I said. The artist had painted us all to be pretty. Like taking the warts off Napoleon's nose. Oh, well. Is this new burst of women's power in France and Italy merely a belated epilogue to that same women's movement that they say has crested and is on its way out over here, or a preview of greater power to come? The fact is that women are given credit for having put Mitterrand in power in France, as we did Cuomo in New York State. I'm worried now about the new polarizations hinted at by recent polls, cutting across the gender gap, as sharp differences emerge between the married and the unmarried, those with children and with none, the young and the old, the ones with jobs and the unemployed. While the new census shows that in the 1980's the great majority of young adult Americans will marry, and remarry, and that they will have children within marriage, they are having fewer children, and having themlater, than they used to. And 10 percent of young adults will never marry, a 100 percent increase over the 1970 rate. There is also a 100 percent increase in single-parent households, nine out of 10 of which are headed by women. A fourth of all households now contain no children. ''Nonfamily households'' have risen by 89 percent. But the number of divorces seems to be leveling off at about 50 percent. The need, or the choice, to marry, or to remain married, takes on new existential and economic importance, for women as for men. For families in poverty today tend primarily to be those headed by women, followed by those headed by men where there is no second income. But the fact that women earn only 59 cents for every dollar men earn still cuts through the illusion of equality. Will the married be the new elite and those living alone the underclass? Will men and women who make that cherished, costly choice to have children become the second class, while the singleminded take power? How can the trade-offs within marriage be measured? He makes more than she does, but he feels less strain now because he's no longer carrying it all. She makes less but also feels less stress, if she is just ''helping.'' She feels bitter if he is laid off and she has to carry the whole breadwinning burden, as well as take care of the house and kids. He certainly doesn't spend as much time on housework and the kids as she does; he doesn't feel that responsibility for the kids that a mother never quite escapes. But how much of that power does she really want to give up? Now that we've broken through those rigidly polarized male and female sex roles, will we settle for a diversity of patterns of sharing among women and men? Am I wrong to try to redefine our concept of ''family,'' to link the interests of the old and single with the needs of those in their childbearing years? Those who can't afford to stop working at 60 or 65 might welcome jobs that wouldn't demand a rigid 9-to-5 schedule. The option of shorter hours would not solve the unemployment problem, but it would provide more jobs for more people. My friends now in their 50's and 60's who fought the battles - the first woman to have a seat on the stock exchange, the first female network vice president, the first executive vice president of a major advertising agency, the nun who became a college president, the housewives who survived their own divorces and became labor arbitrators, the women, passed over for corporate promotion, university tenure or union leadership, who brought and won class-action suits -are facing now the frontiers of age. There are new questions to be asked beyond success, beyond marriage and divorce, as we face husbands' strokes and retirement, and our years to come, living alone. Those are the questions that are now my personal and professional concern. Feelings of deja vu wash over me as I hear geriatric experts talk about the aged with the same patronizing, ''compassionate'' denial of their personhood that I heard when experts talked about women 20 years ago. Much is being said among American women today about the strange dearth of vital men. I go into a town to lecture, and I hear about all the wonderful, dynamic women who have emerged in every field in that town. But, frequently, whatever the age of the woman, she says, ''There don't seem to be any men. The men seem so dull and gray now. They're dreary, they're flat, they complain, they're tired.'' And, if they're my age, they're dead. That women are now living so much longer and aging more vitally than men has wide ramifications. The latest census figures show that American women have a life expectancy of 77.8 compared with 69.9 for American men - an eight-year difference compared with just two years in 1900 and five in 1950. Despite all the gloomy predictions, women are not succumbing to men's patterns of Type A stress and heart attack, ulcers and premature death as they take on jobs in business and professions. Despite the phase of ''dressing for success'' and courses that taught women how to be more like men to get into the executive suite, women don't seem to be falling into the ''superwoman'' trap so easily anymore. (They are even spending less time on housework, new studies show.) On the contrary, data just published by Rosalind Barnett and Grace Baruch of the Wellesley Center for Research on Women show that women between the ages of 35 and 55 who combine work, marriage and motherhood do the best of all women in their age group in general psychological well-being. They have more control over their lives, which now seems essential to health; they are able to satisfy their needs for achievement and mastery as well as for pleasure and intimacy. And these women do not show depression, deterioration or traumatic crises at midlife and beyond as much as women used to and men still do. Women are not beginning to die like men. As a matter of fact, I've just been asked to address the Western Gerontological Association this spring on ''Why Can't Men Age More Like Women?'' The very terms of human achieve-ment, of moral values and mental development have, up until now, been defined by men and measured in terms of male experience. The highest peak of moral development was some abstract concept of justice, in terms of which philosophers and psychologists from Plato to Freud and beyond found women wanting. In 1971, a Harvard psychologist named Carol Gilligan began measuring women and men according to a scale based on female experience as well as male, and found a level of moral development beyond abstract justice. The research translated and tested the abstract concept of justice against the concrete experience of daily life in its actual human complexity. On this scale, women reached levels of moral development men did not seem even to conceive of. ''In a Different Voice,'' she called the book that resulted from the study. What new dimensions will emerge in every field as women begin to find that different voice, their own voice, and use it in medicine, law, theology, architecture, in all the arts and all the sciences? I got a curious insight into all this during my year as a fellow at Harvard. I immersed myself, for one, in the study of evolution, for I became increasingly convinced that breaking through the feminine mystique, and the women's movement for equality, and this second stage, as female values begin to be shared by the male, is not really a revolution at all but simply a stage in human evolution, necessary for survival. In that bastion of male excellence, Harvard, women were now admitted on equal terms with men, if not yet in equal numbers. During my year there, I was asked to meet with the women at the law school, women medical students and interns, the women's group at the divinity and ar-chitecture schools. These women were awesome in their competence, but they made me uneasy. They seemed too neat, somehow, too controlled, constricted, almost subdued and slightly juiceless. A dean of one of the professional schools said: ''We take in the most brilliant women, of course. Their record of achievement is breathtaking, as are their scores on the admission tests. But for some reason, they don't do as well as they should when they get here. Can you explain it?'' ''Not without interviewing them,'' I said, ''but I have a hunch it's because your structures - your whole ambiance - is so masculine; it alienates them somehow, though they might not be aware of it. Something around here must not elicit the best of female energy. But if that's so, you'd better find it out. Because it's also having an influence on the men that may not be conducive to the kind of leadership needed now.'' So just before I left, I ran a seminar on ''Masculinism at Harvard,'' sponsored by the Institute of Politics. The seminar made Harvard officials so nervous that it was closed to the public and the press. Women, and a few men, raised questions about the viciously competitive adversary models they were learning in their case studies, and whether, in fact ''a different voice'' was needed now in law, in business and in medicine. Among the men, mainly it was the wise old professors, like David Riesman and David McClelland, and some of the young professors, like Stephen Gould, who seem to be wise in a new way, who wanted to talk about such things. But the women, who had seemed to me so strangely subdued, kept nodding their heads. They knew exactly what it was - masculinism -and maybe even what it was doing to them. It is not easy for a woman to transcend or question the masculinism of a powerful, successful male institution. The first women there will necessarily try to succeed according to the male model. For women may have to reach a point of critical mass in any institution to raise that different voice and the institution may have to face its own critical crisis to hear it. It is not easy to question the masculinism of a powerful and succesful nation, until perhaps its most thoughtful men and women sense that it may be coming too close to economic collapse or nuclear extinction for such questions not to be asked. The political gender gap surfaced first among women on the basic issue of war and peace. But there were a lot of men among the half-million people who marched in Central Park last year for the nuclear freeze. At the first NOW convention after the defeat of the E.R.A., in Indianapolis in October 1982, the foremothers were asking each other which issue would emerge next to mobilize women's passions. I've heard this kind of thing often in these last months, from thoughtful students, from tired women and even from men, all people looking at the wreckage of their own beleaguered movements - liberal politics, civil rights, labor, the environment - and wondering where the kind of life-changing political passion that has fueled the women's movement these last years will come from next. What will be the issue? Equal pay for work of comparable value? Child care? Displaced homemakers? Rape? Lesbian rights? Discrimination in Social Security, in pensions? So diverse have the choices and patterns of women's lives become that there is no single issue now that could hold us all together as firmly as the battle for our constitutional equal rights. Now that women's rights are in danger, and women's outrage has taken concrete political form, that issue is no longer a separate women's issue. It is now an issue that can elect a President; it is an issue that the major political parties are now sprinting to catch up with. I'm not sure there is, or has to be, a separate, single women's issue in the next stage. I think women's most basic issues now converge on men's, the basic issues of war and peace and economic survival, of quality of life for young and old. But when that different voice, now emerging from women in politics and other fields, also begins to be heard from men, it will become a different politics. Are men changing? Those young men, like my son, who carry their little babies so proudly in their backpacks to the supermarket? Those men now suffering the midlife crises? Men must change. They must develop the flexibility and sensitivity to their own feelings and the feelings of others - the attunement to life that has been considered up to now feminine. Crazy? Well, who would have thought that the biggest movie hit of 1983 would be a picture called ''Tootsie,'' in which a male actor impersonates a woman so he can get a part as a hospital administrator in a soap opera and becomes a better man as a woman. And men love it, and so do women, even though some doctrinaire feminists claim it's macho for a man to make a hit playing a woman. But then, the women say, pointedly, Dustin Hoffman was much more attractive as a woman than when he went back to being a man, as if the only choice was between macho and wimp. Actually, the sensitivity he acquired, sharing woman's experience, made him a much better, stronger, more tender man. It was a wonderful, heart-easing, surprising movie. And not a snigger in it. Somethow, putting together the male and female halves of our being seemed to clean up the sexual act. We have clearly now broken through and beyond the masculine mystique for man and woman to find such hilarious joyous adventure in being a woman. Which is not the same thing at all as going back to the feminine mystique. It is the next clue in the human mystery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/magazine/twenty-years-after-the-feminine-mystique.html,"It is 20 years now since ""The Feminine Mystique"" was published. I am still awed by the revolution that book helped spark. That I was able to put it together at the time it was needed is something of a mystery to me. Even now, women -and men - stop me on the street to reminisce about where they were when they read it - ''I was in the maternity ward with my third kid, and then I decided to go to law school.'' I keep being surprised, as the changes the women's movement set in motion continue to play themselves out in our lives - the enormous and mundane, subtle and not so subtle, delightful, painful, immediate, far-reaching, paradoxical, inexorable and probably irreversible changes in women's lives - and in men's. Firewomen, chairpersons, housespouses, the gender gap, ms., palimony, takeout food, women priests, women rabbis, women prime ministers, women's studies, women's history, double burden, dress for success, assertiveness training, male consciousness raising, role strain, role reversal, networking, sexism, displaced homemakers, equal pay for work of comparable value, marriage contracts, child custody for men, first babies at 40, the two-paycheck family, the single-parent family, ''Victor/ Victoria,'' ''Tootsie' ... . Who could have predicted some of these changes? Not I, certainly. It's hard enough for me, both personally and politically, to cope with the realities of our revolution, as its daughters and sons take its terms for granted and face new problems, new pressures, new choices and conflicts, and express the need for new dreams. It's hard to go on evolving, as we all must, when some who now follow, or fight, or study, or seek power within this revolution seem to want to lock it in place forever as an unchanging ''-ism.'' Early this year, I fled to Harvard as a fellow at the Institute of Politics of the Kennedy School of Government, pursuing with relief a new scholarly quest, retreating (or so I thought) from feminist power struggles, disheartened, less by the attacks of our acknowledged enemies than by the fury of some of my sister feminists over the position I took in my book ''The Second Stage.'' I said the women's movement had to move anew, that the feminine mystique, which defined women only as husband's wife, children's mother, server of the family's physical needs and never as person, had been transcended. I said that we had come about as far as we could with the male model of equity and that now we needed a model encompassing female experience and female values, which men are beginning to share. ''Thesis, antithesis, synthesis,'' as Karl Marx said. As our revolution converges on larger economic upheavals, I said, we must come to new terms with family and with work. Some didn't like my saying that. Well, we are in the second stage now, whether or not anyone wants to admit it. And I am still a feminist. But I am sick and tired of the new spate of pronouncements claiming that the women's movement is finished and the revolution is lost because the ''postfeminist generation'' is moving from a different place. Of course the postfeminist generation is in a different place. The women's movement put them there. Their mothers were the ones who rejected the feminine mystique and went back to school and went to work and otherwise started to change their lives 20 years ago. I, as a feminist, do not find it a cause for grief that this new genera-tion simply takes the personhood of women for granted. If they take women's rights and the opportunities we fought for too much for granted -if they are worried now about jobs, difficult choices about having children, how to pay for a house with or without two incomes and double burdens they can't refuse now even if sometimes they'd like to - it's a mark of how far our revolution has come, and a summons to its own next stage. As far as I'm concerned, the daughters have to move on; they don't have to say, ''Thank you'' - though it's nice when they do. It's also nice that so many now study women's history in college, even in high school. But I am impatient to get those women's studies integrated into history, into every subject from grade school on. I still remember how surprised I was, taking the bus in from my suburban dream house in Rockland County to the New York Public Library when I was writing my book, 20-odd years ago, to uncover the women's history that had been so buried by the feminine mystique in the 1940's and 50's: Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Fuller, Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, women whom most educated women like myself had never studied. Will our memory be buried in another generation as theirs was? Will some future great-granddaughter have to invent feminism once more from scratch? I doubt it. Emily, my own daughter the doctor, went from taking it all for granted in college (''I'm not a feminist; I'm a person. It's not necessary to fight for women anymore'') to fervent feminism after one year in medical school (''There are so many of us now, they don't dare do it openly the way they used to. It's worse now that it's so subtle''). But it's not worse that women are 30 percent of the medical-school class, rather than 3 percent. After organizing the women in her medical school on the unfinished business of sex discrimination, my daughter began to concern herself with fundamental issues as to the practice of medicine itself and her own life. She has decided to go into family practice, dealing with the patient as a whole person in the concrete family setting, not as a specimen of isolated symptoms. Her current problem has to do with 800 miles of distance between her hospital residency and his. Neither of them would consider asking that the other sacrifice his or her own goals for the sake of their relationship, which somehow survives the obstacles of distance and time. y daughter-in-law, Helen, is technically, at the moment, a housewife. The baby was not exactly planned. There were difficult choices to be made, since both she and Jonathan, my younger son, had just finished college, after having dropped out for some years. One day last summer, when they'd brought the baby out to my house in Sag Harbor, Helen overheard me on the phone discussing how to stop new attacks on the Supreme Court decision asserting women's right to legal medical abortion. ''The right to abortion is very important to me,'' said this postfeminist mother, nursing her baby. ''It's important knowing that we had the baby because we chose to. It makes a big difference.'' I relish their mutual joy, their new confident maturity and sense of themselves in their chosen parenthood -which Jonathan truly shares. Watching him skillfully maneuver Rafael into his snowsuit and throw him over his shoulder into the backpack, I sense he gets at least as much of his male identity from being a father as from being an engineer. But Helen is unmistakably the mother. She does not let any male doctor-as-God tell her what to do with her baby the way we let Dr. Spock instruct us. She does not apologize for sometimes being ''bored out of my gourd'' in this ''hiatus'' during which she concentrates on mothering. The choices in themselves seem to create a new sense of values and of self in such a postfeminist woman. And I, as grandmother at last, am the envy of my friends, whose doctor-lawyer-banker daughters are too caught up in their careers to consider babies. With my beautiful, incredible grandbaby - such a beaming, bright bundle of energy, smiling at me with his father's big ears and dimples and his own deep blue eyes, so familiar, so intensely alive, so awesome a miracle - I exult in the generation of life, though I've been too busy this year to baby-sit much. This year, a number of my family of friends had their first babies at 35, at 40, some undergoing rather scary, unexpected complications at birth. Other friends made me fear for their sanity as they suddenly became obsessed, in their mid-40's, after 20 years of brilliant careers, with the wish to have a child. Again and again, in Cambridge or California, one or another notso-young woman would ask my advice about having a baby ''by myself.'' I would reply that it seemed to me difficult enough, and costly enough, to bring up a child with two parents. But the power of this desire to have a child - when women no longer need to have a child to define themselves as women - seems to be as great as or even greater than ever. Choice has liberated an exultant mother; choice has also liberated women to be generative in other ways. Gloria Steinem, for instance, and Germaine Greer have been fine role models for that pattern. But there is unfinished business here for many women. Now that economic necessity dictates that most women must continue to work after they become mothers - nearly one out of two married women with children under 6 now works, compared with 19 percent in 1960; and nearly two-thirds of married women with children over 6 work - someone is going to have to battle, in a new and serious way, for institutions that will help the new family. Imaginative thinking should be done about maternity leave, paternity leave, time off for parents when their children are sick, parental sabbaticals, reduced schedules, flextime, job sharing and child-care supports that don't now exist. But who will take up this battle, and how, in a time when jobs themselves are so scarce that people must take what they can get, when budgets for social programs that already exist are being cut down? It is crucial for feminists to understand the power of the choice to have children and to keep fighting for the right to abortion. But they must give new priority to a child-care crusade and to restructuring work. If these issues are not addressed soon, we can fear a new feminine mystique, invoked to send women home again to have babies instead of competing for dwindling jobs. During this time of recession-depression, President Reagan, who has declared a new campaign against abortion, has also suggested that there wouldn't be as much unemployment if women would stop looking for jobs. After the elections in 1982, political analysts finally began to take seriously the ''gender gap,'' though it had been building for some years, a reaction, in part, to the Administration's attitudes toward the equal rights amendment and abortion. Month after month, women had been indicating their sharp disapproval of President Reagan. The latest Gallup poll found that just 36 percent of women approved of Reagan's job performance, compared with 47 percent of men. The gender gap seemed to be based on women's greater outrage at Reaganomics and a national budget that destroyed services essential to the old, the poor, to children, students, the handicapped and the environment while increasing billions were shoveled into nuclear missiles. The human suffering caused by high unemployment seemed particularly galling to women. It didn't matter that Ed Koch, in his New York gubernatorial race, said the proper words about women's rights, when he had been so opportunistic about Reaganomics. It did not matter that Margaret M. Heckler and Millicent Fenwick were women and had been for the E.R.A.; when they went along with Reagan in 1982, they were defeated. Political analysts now agree that women were crucial to the election of Mario M. Cuomo as Governor of New York and to the defeat or near defeat, in Texas, New Jersey, Missouri and elsewhere, of favorites who had been insensitive to women's basic concerns. At any rate, it is clear now that women's rights and women's issues are no longer minor political items, worth a patronizing sentence on the sixth page of the political speech or tea and cookies in the Rose Garden. President Reagan has just named two women to the Cabinet - Elizabeth H. Dole as Secretary of Transportation and Margaret Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Getting into position for 1984, Democrats often begin their speeches with passionate pledges to equal rights. ''With the gender gap,'' a Democratic aide said to me recently, ''issues like child care could be politically sexy in '84.'' Indeed, this month, an extraordinary meeting of leaders of women's groups, church groups, unions and civil-rights organizations was held in New York City to plan a child-care crusade for 1983. E.R.A. was reintroduced in Congress this year, and I say there will be an equal rights amendment to the Constitution by the end of the decade, after we get the Government turned around. A few months ago, I was invited to Rome by women leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Party. The idea was to speak to them and to leading Italian feminist, Socialist and Communist women about ''The Second Stage,'' which had just come out in Italy. But I don't think they had really read it. Evidently the Christian Democrats realized they had made a big political mistake by supporting a referendum that would have taken away Italian women's right to abortion. The referendum was overwhelmingly defeated, and now, it appeared, I was being brought over to show a conciliatory position toward feminism. Someone must have told them I ''believed in the family.'' To my horror, I heard them introducing me as a ''repentant feminist'' (femminista pentita). I had to clear that up, of course. I had to go back to the feminine mystique, and that necessary, wonderful first stage of women's liberation in Italy, when they had marched in the thousands and voted in the millions for women's right to divorce and to abortion. In their country, as in mine, I said, reactionary forces were still trying to take those rights away, as their abortion referendum demonstrated. Of course, I said, I respect those who, out of religious or other personal conviction, would not choose to use that right. ''The value is life,'' I said. ''The life of the woman and the right of the child to be wanted in life. Abortion is simply a necessity for some when birth control fails. ''But that issue is behind you now, as I hope it will be soon for us,'' I continued. ''We must all move into the second stage, where we face new problems of economic survival, personal survival and family survival. We must be able to surmount the dangers of nuclear war, terrorism and economic chaos. We must continue to be able to choose to bear children.'' I don't know if that's what the Christian Democrats quite expected. The other feminist leaders present, the Socialist and Communist women, seemed to pick up my second-stage suggestions about the need for new child-care supports and new kinds of communal housing for working parents and for those divorced or widowed men and women who now live too much alone. I went from Rome to Paris, where Yvette Roudy, who originally translated ''The Feminine Mystique'' into French, is now President Mit-terrand's Minister for Women's Rights. She is no token under secretary but holds a full cabinet ministry for women's affairs. Yvette described her efforts, in all the regions and departments of France, to protect women's rights in jobs, education, marriage and divorce and to give them training for new nontraditional work. As we walked through the lofty arches of the splendid building that houses her ministry, I was proudly shown a ''gallery of honor,'' where, after Colette and Susan B. Anthony, there was a larger-thanlife portrait that was supposed to be me. ''That's not me!'' I said. The artist had painted us all to be pretty. Like taking the warts off Napoleon's nose. Oh, well. Is this new burst of women's power in France and Italy merely a belated epilogue to that same women's movement that they say has crested and is on its way out over here, or a preview of greater power to come? The fact is that women are given credit for having put Mitterrand in power in France, as we did Cuomo in New York State. I'm worried now about the new polarizations hinted at by recent polls, cutting across the gender gap, as sharp differences emerge between the married and the unmarried, those with children and with none, the young and the old, the ones with jobs and the unemployed. While the new census shows that in the 1980's the great majority of young adult Americans will marry, and remarry, and that they will have children within marriage, they are having fewer children, and having themlater, than they used to. And 10 percent of young adults will never marry, a 100 percent increase over the 1970 rate. There is also a 100 percent increase in single-parent households, nine out of 10 of which are headed by women. A fourth of all households now contain no children. ''Nonfamily households'' have risen by 89 percent. But the number of divorces seems to be leveling off at about 50 percent. The need, or the choice, to marry, or to remain married, takes on new existential and economic importance, for women as for men. For families in poverty today tend primarily to be those headed by women, followed by those headed by men where there is no second income. But the fact that women earn only 59 cents for every dollar men earn still cuts through the illusion of equality. Will the married be the new elite and those living alone the underclass? Will men and women who make that cherished, costly choice to have children become the second class, while the singleminded take power? How can the trade-offs within marriage be measured? He makes more than she does, but he feels less strain now because he's no longer carrying it all. She makes less but also feels less stress, if she is just ''helping.'' She feels bitter if he is laid off and she has to carry the whole breadwinning burden, as well as take care of the house and kids. He certainly doesn't spend as much time on housework and the kids as she does; he doesn't feel that responsibility for the kids that a mother never quite escapes. But how much of that power does she really want to give up? Now that we've broken through those rigidly polarized male and female sex roles, will we settle for a diversity of patterns of sharing among women and men? Am I wrong to try to redefine our concept of ''family,'' to link the interests of the old and single with the needs of those in their childbearing years? Those who can't afford to stop working at 60 or 65 might welcome jobs that wouldn't demand a rigid 9-to-5 schedule. The option of shorter hours would not solve the unemployment problem, but it would provide more jobs for more people. My friends now in their 50's and 60's who fought the battles - the first woman to have a seat on the stock exchange, the first female network vice president, the first executive vice president of a major advertising agency, the nun who became a college president, the housewives who survived their own divorces and became labor arbitrators, the women, passed over for corporate promotion, university tenure or union leadership, who brought and won class-action suits -are facing now the frontiers of age. There are new questions to be asked beyond success, beyond marriage and divorce, as we face husbands' strokes and retirement, and our years to come, living alone. Those are the questions that are now my personal and professional concern. Feelings of deja vu wash over me as I hear geriatric experts talk about the aged with the same patronizing, ''compassionate'' denial of their personhood that I heard when experts talked about women 20 years ago. Much is being said among American women today about the strange dearth of vital men. I go into a town to lecture, and I hear about all the wonderful, dynamic women who have emerged in every field in that town. But, frequently, whatever the age of the woman, she says, ''There don't seem to be any men. The men seem so dull and gray now. They're dreary, they're flat, they complain, they're tired.'' And, if they're my age, they're dead. That women are now living so much longer and aging more vitally than men has wide ramifications. The latest census figures show that American women have a life expectancy of 77.8 compared with 69.9 for American men - an eight-year difference compared with just two years in 1900 and five in 1950. Despite all the gloomy predictions, women are not succumbing to men's patterns of Type A stress and heart attack, ulcers and premature death as they take on jobs in business and professions. Despite the phase of ''dressing for success'' and courses that taught women how to be more like men to get into the executive suite, women don't seem to be falling into the ''superwoman'' trap so easily anymore. (They are even spending less time on housework, new studies show.) On the contrary, data just published by Rosalind Barnett and Grace Baruch of the Wellesley Center for Research on Women show that women between the ages of 35 and 55 who combine work, marriage and motherhood do the best of all women in their age group in general psychological well-being. They have more control over their lives, which now seems essential to health; they are able to satisfy their needs for achievement and mastery as well as for pleasure and intimacy. And these women do not show depression, deterioration or traumatic crises at midlife and beyond as much as women used to and men still do. Women are not beginning to die like men. As a matter of fact, I've just been asked to address the Western Gerontological Association this spring on ''Why Can't Men Age More Like Women?'' The very terms of human achieve-ment, of moral values and mental development have, up until now, been defined by men and measured in terms of male experience. The highest peak of moral development was some abstract concept of justice, in terms of which philosophers and psychologists from Plato to Freud and beyond found women wanting. In 1971, a Harvard psychologist named Carol Gilligan began measuring women and men according to a scale based on female experience as well as male, and found a level of moral development beyond abstract justice. The research translated and tested the abstract concept of justice against the concrete experience of daily life in its actual human complexity. On this scale, women reached levels of moral development men did not seem even to conceive of. ''In a Different Voice,'' she called the book that resulted from the study. What new dimensions will emerge in every field as women begin to find that different voice, their own voice, and use it in medicine, law, theology, architecture, in all the arts and all the sciences? I got a curious insight into all this during my year as a fellow at Harvard. I immersed myself, for one, in the study of evolution, for I became increasingly convinced that breaking through the feminine mystique, and the women's movement for equality, and this second stage, as female values begin to be shared by the male, is not really a revolution at all but simply a stage in human evolution, necessary for survival. In that bastion of male excellence, Harvard, women were now admitted on equal terms with men, if not yet in equal numbers. During my year there, I was asked to meet with the women at the law school, women medical students and interns, the women's group at the divinity and ar-chitecture schools. These women were awesome in their competence, but they made me uneasy. They seemed too neat, somehow, too controlled, constricted, almost subdued and slightly juiceless. A dean of one of the professional schools said: ''We take in the most brilliant women, of course. Their record of achievement is breathtaking, as are their scores on the admission tests. But for some reason, they don't do as well as they should when they get here. Can you explain it?'' ''Not without interviewing them,'' I said, ''but I have a hunch it's because your structures - your whole ambiance - is so masculine; it alienates them somehow, though they might not be aware of it. Something around here must not elicit the best of female energy. But if that's so, you'd better find it out. Because it's also having an influence on the men that may not be conducive to the kind of leadership needed now.'' So just before I left, I ran a seminar on ''Masculinism at Harvard,'' sponsored by the Institute of Politics. The seminar made Harvard officials so nervous that it was closed to the public and the press. Women, and a few men, raised questions about the viciously competitive adversary models they were learning in their case studies, and whether, in fact ''a different voice'' was needed now in law, in business and in medicine. Among the men, mainly it was the wise old professors, like David Riesman and David McClelland, and some of the young professors, like Stephen Gould, who seem to be wise in a new way, who wanted to talk about such things. But the women, who had seemed to me so strangely subdued, kept nodding their heads. They knew exactly what it was - masculinism -and maybe even what it was doing to them. It is not easy for a woman to transcend or question the masculinism of a powerful, successful male institution. The first women there will necessarily try to succeed according to the male model. For women may have to reach a point of critical mass in any institution to raise that different voice and the institution may have to face its own critical crisis to hear it. It is not easy to question the masculinism of a powerful and succesful nation, until perhaps its most thoughtful men and women sense that it may be coming too close to economic collapse or nuclear extinction for such questions not to be asked. The political gender gap surfaced first among women on the basic issue of war and peace. But there were a lot of men among the half-million people who marched in Central Park last year for the nuclear freeze. At the first NOW convention after the defeat of the E.R.A., in Indianapolis in October 1982, the foremothers were asking each other which issue would emerge next to mobilize women's passions. I've heard this kind of thing often in these last months, from thoughtful students, from tired women and even from men, all people looking at the wreckage of their own beleaguered movements - liberal politics, civil rights, labor, the environment - and wondering where the kind of life-changing political passion that has fueled the women's movement these last years will come from next. What will be the issue? Equal pay for work of comparable value? Child care? Displaced homemakers? Rape? Lesbian rights? Discrimination in Social Security, in pensions? So diverse have the choices and patterns of women's lives become that there is no single issue now that could hold us all together as firmly as the battle for our constitutional equal rights. Now that women's rights are in danger, and women's outrage has taken concrete political form, that issue is no longer a separate women's issue. It is now an issue that can elect a President; it is an issue that the major political parties are now sprinting to catch up with. I'm not sure there is, or has to be, a separate, single women's issue in the next stage. I think women's most basic issues now converge on men's, the basic issues of war and peace and economic survival, of quality of life for young and old. But when that different voice, now emerging from women in politics and other fields, also begins to be heard from men, it will become a different politics. Are men changing? Those young men, like my son, who carry their little babies so proudly in their backpacks to the supermarket? Those men now suffering the midlife crises? Men must change. They must develop the flexibility and sensitivity to their own feelings and the feelings of others - the attunement to life that has been considered up to now feminine. Crazy? Well, who would have thought that the biggest movie hit of 1983 would be a picture called ''Tootsie,'' in which a male actor impersonates a woman so he can get a part as a hospital administrator in a soap opera and becomes a better man as a woman. And men love it, and so do women, even though some doctrinaire feminists claim it's macho for a man to make a hit playing a woman. But then, the women say, pointedly, Dustin Hoffman was much more attractive as a woman than when he went back to being a man, as if the only choice was between macho and wimp. Actually, the sensitivity he acquired, sharing woman's experience, made him a much better, stronger, more tender man. It was a wonderful, heart-easing, surprising movie. And not a snigger in it. Somethow, putting together the male and female halves of our being seemed to clean up the sexual act. We have clearly now broken through and beyond the masculine mystique for man and woman to find such hilarious joyous adventure in being a woman. Which is not the same thing at all as going back to the feminine mystique. It is the next clue in the human mystery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CELEBRATING WOMEN'S HISTORY WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/archives/celebrating-womens-history-week.html,"THE struggles and achievements of women past and present and the issues facing women today will be the focus of events commemorating Women's History Week, from next Sunday through March 13. Sponsored by several county organizations and colleges, the programs will extend beyond the designated week and run throughout March. Related events will also be held in April and May. Next Sunday, ''Celebrating Westchester Women'' will begin Women's History Week in the county. For the second year, a group of ''unsung heroines'' - women who have made major contributions to the community but have had little or no public recognition - will be honored at the White Plains Public Library. This year eight women will receive awards. The selection committee included representatives of Women of Westchester, the Black Women's Political Caucus, the county chapter of the National Organization for Women, the County Office for Women, the White Plains Library and the Sarah Lawrence women's history program. Judy Lerner, president of Women of Westchester, said: ''It was really difficult to choose - we could have gotten 30 women of achievement to honor. We are astounded at the activities of women and the wide range of their activities in past decades.'' The women to be honored - Eleanore Collins, Alice Allen, Dorothy Markey (the writer Myra Page), Helen Glauber, Sarah Serra, Myrtle McGraw, Alma Woodland and Mattie Small - represent a diversity of backgrounds and interests. Many are now in their 80's and are still active in their fields, which include labor, housing, mental health, government, writing and youth activities. They worked both as volunteers and paid professionals, raised families and participated in many aspects of community life. ''In researching and learning about the lives and experiences of these women in our history, we are finding our role models,'' Mrs. Lerner said. ''We are seeing that there is a bit of ourselves in each of them.'' The awards ceremony will include the actress Chris Calloway and Dr. Amy Swerdlow of the women's history faculty of Sarah Lawrence College, who will deliver the keynote address. Carmino Ravosa, composer of a musical about suffragists, ''Seneca Falls,'' will sing selections from the show. At Sarah Lawrence, the women's studies program will celebrate not only Women's History Week but the 10th anniversary of the college's women's history program, the first graduate program in women's history in the country. The college is commemorating its 10-year program with the establishment of the Gerde Lerner Scholarship Fund, which will provide financial aid to graduate students in women's history. Now at the University of Wisconsin, Gerde Lerner, a well-known feminist scholar, taught women's history at Sarah Lawrence and helped to shape its master's program. Among the events scheduled by the college will be an unusual ''Women's History Walking Tour of New York City'' conducted by Joyce Gold, a historian and author of ''From Windmills to the World Trade Center: A Walking Guide to Lower Manhattan History.'' The tour will be conducted in Greenwich Village and Lower Manhattan. At The State University of New York at Purchase, a weeklong program, sponsored by Citibank, the National Bank of Westchester and the Chase Manhattan Bank, will mark the opening of the school's Women's Center to the community. Co-sponsored by the county's Office for Women, the events begin next Sunday with a program ''From Woman Suffrage to the Equal Rights Amendment.'' It will feature Sonia Johnson, who was excommunicated from the Mormon Church in 1979 for her support of the proposed equal rights amendment and wrote the book, ''From Housewife to Heretic,'' and Rebecca Reyher, an 87-yearold suffragist and author who is still active in the women's movement. The Women's Center is designed for women in the community seeking information and referrals on topics related to women. Elizabeth Sudler, a Hunter College graduate student in social work who is coordinating the activities, said the center was a place where women can ''learn, discuss, participate in activities and even start their own programs.'' In addition to its co-sponsorship of ''Celebrating Westchester Women,'' the White Plains Library will present programs on women throughout the month. On March 27, two county authors - Nancy Rubin, author of ''The New Suburban Woman: Beyond Myth and Motherhood,'' and Janet Gordon, author of ''The Volunteer Power House'' - will discuss ''Women in Westchester Today.'' Myrna Popper, publisher of the Westchester Women's News, will moderate.

PANEL URGES PREPARATIONS TO MEET BIG DEMAND FOR GENETIC SCREENING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/28/us/panel-urges-preparations-to-meet-big-demand-for-genetic-screening.html,"A Presidential ethics commission urged the nation today to prepare counseling services and make other arrangements to meet a likely ''huge demand'' for genetic screening tests to determine whether parents are likely to have defective children. Before the end of the century, the commission predicted, ''genetic screening and counseling are certain to become major components in both public health and individual medical care.'' The time ''can already be envisioned,'' it said, when all information about a person's ''abnormal'' genes and chromosomes will be readily accessible. The commission said genetic screening raised ''important ethical and legal concerns'' about who should have access to the tests and the information the tests reveal, whether tests should be voluntary or compulsory, and what the tests should be used for. It threw its moral weight against using genetic tests to choose the sex of a child or produce a superhealthy race of people. Up to now, genetic screening has been used sometimes to test newborn infants for a few rare genetic diseases or to screen selected population groups, like Jews or blacks, for specific genetic conditions that afflict them more often than the general population. But the commission predicted that a screening test for the most prevalent lethal inherited disease, cystic fibrosis, would be in hand by the end of the 1980's, thus making possible ''a new program of mass genetic screening of vast proportions.'' Various tests might be used on prospective parents, pregnant women or newborn infants, depending on scientific advances and practical considerations. Just how they will be administered and who will pay for them are problems that remain to be worked out. More and Better Tests Cystic fibrosis afflicts about one in every 1,800 newborn babies; it damages the lungs and digestive system and generally kills its victims before they reach the age of 20. A screening program primarily for whites of reproductive age, the group at highest risk of bearing infants with the disease, could conceivably require tens of millions of tests in a short period. The commission called such a task ''daunting in itself'' and warned that ''it is merely the harbinger of a still greater demand'' that will inevitably develop as scientists devise more and better tests ''to determine personal susceptibility to particular disorders or to the risk of passing them on to offspring.'' The recommendations were set forth in a report, titled ''Screening and Counseling for Genetic Conditions,'' issued for release Monday by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The 11-member commission is headed by Morris B. Abram, a New York City lawyer, and includes individuals prominent in medicine, theology, law and public affairs. It was created by Congress in 1978, started work two years ago, and will go out of business at the end of March. In its wide-ranging 115-page report, the commission found that ''on the whole,'' advances in genetics ''have greatly enhanced health and well-being'' and that genetic screening techniques ''give Americans new opportunities to understand their biological heritage and to make their health care and reproductive plans accordingly.'' Ethical Guidelines Proposed But it proposed a broad array of ethical and practical guidelines to insure that new and existing screening technologies would yield safe, effective, equitable and beneficial results and that parents, children and society were protected. The report focused on genetic screening for medical and reproductive purposes. It did not address the issues raised by genetic screening of workers to determine susceptibility to chemical damage in the workplace or by screening used for research purposes. In general, the commission argued that medical screening programs should largely be voluntary, that genetic information should largely be kept confidential and that access to screening services should be equitable. But it noted that these principles sometimes conflict, and it offered these specific recommendations for resolving difficult cases and for changing current practices to make them work better: - The current practice of limiting amniocentesis, a test for diagnosing the health of a fetus, to women age 35 or older should be re-evaluated to make it more available to younger women. The original notion that 35 is the age at which the risk of bearing a defective child rises sharply has been supplanted by more recent understanding that the risk rises gradually with increasing age. - The use of amniocentesis for sex selection ''should be discouraged.'' Although amniocentesis can determine the sex of a fetus, thus allowing parents to abort a fetus of unwanted sex, the practice is ''morally suspect'' for a variety of reasons apart from the abortion issue. - Screening programs may focus on particular racial or ethnic groups that have a high incidence of a genetic disease without violating principles of equity and fairness. - Men who donate their sperm to artificial insemination programs should be screened more thoroughly so that the risks of transmitting genetic disease can be minimized and women can be apprised of the dangers. - Adoption laws should be changed so that information about ''serious genetic risks'' can be communicated to all affected parties. Currently, adoption records are often sealed by the courts, thus making it impossible to convey information on a newly discovered genetic condition to either the child or its original biological parents, depending on circumstances. - Individuals screened should be encouraged to release genetic information that would benefit their relatives; if they refuse, it may sometimes be ethically acceptable to release it anyway to avoid serious harm to other individuals. - Mandatory genetic screening is justified only when needed to prevent serious harm to the defenseless, such as children. - Genetic information should not generally be provided to insurers or employers without the permission of the person screened. In addition, the commission said, mandatory screening is not justified as part of a program to produce a ''genetically healthy society'' or other ''vague and politically abusable social ideals.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SLOWLY, A NEW AWARENESS OF WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/us/slowly-a-new-awareness-of-women.html,"Sally Laird is a lobbyist for the League of Women Voters, and in the past when she asked Congressmen to consider the special problems of women she usually received a polite brushoff. But since Congress reconvened in January she has noticed a new attitude among many lawmakers. ''They really want to look very closely at how legislation affects women,'' she said. ''They start the conversation. We don't have to. And we love it.'' ''We find some folks are still somewhat patronizing,'' added Miss Laird, the league's legislative director. ''They say, 'We'll take care of you.' But we say that we want to be active players. We don't want to leave our fate to someone else.'' Consciousness raising has come to Capitol Hill. Women and their supporters, inside and outside Congress, are trying to change the mentality of an institution that has long been dominated by white males holding stereotypical views of women and their role in society. ''A lot of people up here don't understand women, particularly working women,'' said Senator David Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican. ''They relate to women like they do to their wives.'' 'It's a New Ball Game' But as Miss Laird observed, the insularity of Congressional males is starting to break down a bit. ''It's a new ball game,'' said Representative Bill Gradison, Republican of Ohio. ''Anyone who fails to consider the impact of legislation on women does so at his or her peril.'' Some of the plays in this new game include the following: - On Thursday the House is scheduled to take up a $4.6 billion emergency job bill that contains about $700 million for the sort of public service jobs usually held by women such as home health care or drug abuse clinics. Most of the money was included only after women in Congress complained that the bill concentrated too much on heavy construction. The legislation also lifts a strict limit on the use of community development funds for similar public service jobs. - A House subcommittee has started hearing testimony on a bill that would ban sex-based discrimination in insurance policies. - That bill is also included in a package of legislation called the Economic Equity Act that is to be introduced in both chambers later this month. Its aim is to improve the economic situation of women by revising pension and Civil Service laws, providing tax breaks for displaced homemakers and single parents and encouraging the establishment of more day-care centers. - Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat of Connecticut, became only the third woman to win a seat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and the first in five years. Democrats placed their first woman, Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens, on the Budget Committee. Representative Olympia J. Snowe of Maine became the first woman in the Republican leadership when she was appointed deputy whip. All three are now in key positions to help block further cuts in social programs that largely serve women. - Outside groups, such as the League of Women Voters, have increased their lobbying efforts on issues affecting women, and they played an important role in the drafting of the emergency jobs bill. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has made the proposed Economic Equity Act a top priority for Congress and organized a coalition of more than 50 groups to work for its passage. 'Feminization of Poverty' The first factor in creating this new attitude in Congress is the changing nature of the economy and its impact on women. In recent testimony before a Senate committee, Nancy Neuman, first vice president of the League of Women Voters pointed out that women make up 43 percent of the work force, double that of 1960. And most of them work for the same reason men do, ''to earn a living'' in Senator Durenberger's words. Moreover, more lawmakers are becoming aware of what has been called ''the feminization of poverty'' in America. One in every three households headed by a woman is below the poverty line, said Miss Neuman, and the vast majority of food stamp and welfare benefits go to women and their dependent children. ''Economic and equality issues are basic survival issues for women,'' said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado. ''These are not boutique, upper-middle class causes.'' The urgent nature of practical economic matters has overshadowed two other issues of great concern to women, the proposed equal rights amendment and abortion rights. And while these emotionally charged battles will almost certainly resurface later this year, many activists in the women's movement say that the economic issues give them a better chance for building broad coalitions. Emergence of the 'Gender Gap' Abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution have a ''for 'em or agin 'em'' quality, said Patricia B. Reuss, legislative director of the Women's Equity Action League. ''We've gone from black and white issues to a whole bunch of different shades.'' Economic conditions were also the primary cause of the ''gender gap,'' the emergence in the 1982 elections of an independent-minded female vote that went heavily against the Republicans and their economic program. And nothing will focus a politician's attention more vividly than election results. ''Legislators are perceiving that there is a new political force out there,'' said Ann Charnley Smith, director of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. ''They are getting the message.'' The caucus, which has become the focal point of lobbying activity in behalf of women, recently decided to admit men and now has 117 members, making it one of the largest caucuses on Capitol Hill. Republicans concede that the Reagan Administration ''appears to be insensitive'' to the impact of its economic program, said Senator Durenberger. As a result, they are particularly eager to identify with women's concerns and eradicate the ''gender gap''. ''It's extremely important for Republicans,'' said Senator Durenberger, the prime sponsor of the Economic Equity Act in the Senate. ''I wouldn't want to be running in 1984, and have voters think that I was opposed to these issues or not interested in them.'' Changes Could Cost Money Yet activists in the women's movement know that such expressions of sympathy and concern will be difficult to translate into legislative achievements. For instance, many changes in insurance and pension laws could cost companies a great deal of money, and the lobbying on the other side is expected to be fierce. Moreover, it is still an open question whether male politicians, who control Congress, will feel strongly enough about concerns affecting women to muscle them through the legislative maze. ''A lot of male politicians don't feel this deeply yet,'' said Representative Bob Edgar, Democrat of Pennsylvania. ''They'll try to co-opt the movement if they can. They'll co-sponsor a bill and forget it. It hasn't gotten into their fabric yet. '' ''We have to keep on them all the time,'' agreed Mrs. Schroeder. ''It's easy to fall back into the old ways. This is still a man's town.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CITIZENS' INPUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/04/opinion/l-citizens-input-009241.html,"To the Editor: Your editorial ''Poison Pens and a Sensible Tax'' leaves me very confused. First, by speaking of ''poison pens,'' do you really intend to disparage the motives of all investors who took the time to write to their representatives and who dared to express an opinion? I don't care if they used a printed form or personal stationery. Their letters do not deserve such a vicious description. Secondly, to suggest that such mail should be consigned to the dead-letter office is simply outrageous. Anyone who takes time to write to Congress should be complimented and encouraged rather than sneered at for exercising his or her right. When did Senator Dole and The Times abrogate this right? Thirdly, The Times should not encourage Senator Dole to take a threatening stance toward the banks simply because the banks are petitioning Congress. Rather you should be admonishing Senator Dole for even hinting at such retaliatory action. Such threats simply reinforce the poor estimation in which most politicians are held by the layman. Finally, what would your reaction be if a newspaper of record suggested that all pro-abortion letters sent to Congress be consigned to the dead-letter office and characterized as written by ''poison pens''? You would probably become highly indignant and issue an editorial extolling the right and duty of citizens to petition Congress. I guess it depends whose ox is being gored. JAMES F.

THE G.O.P.: A PARTY IN SEARCH OF ITSELF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/magazine/the-gop-a-party-in-search-of-itself.html,"In the morning of the State of the Union address, President Reagan and his aides ere briefing Republican leaders on their new program. One of those attending the White House session was Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, and after almost an hour of talk he became alarmed. ''I never heard the reality of unemployment raised except in passing,'' he recalled later. Senator Laxalt is close to the President, and blunt with his advice, and he told the meeting that he was ''really bothered'' by a recent incident in Minneapolis, where 12,000 unemployed workers applied for 200 jobs. Others complained that the story had been orchestrated by local unions, but the Nevadan felt differently. ''If that was orchestrated by the unions, then the people I saw interviewed on television were excellent actors,'' he said. ''They had the ring of truth. This is middle-class America, people who want to work, and are out of work. Plain political and moral reality dictates that we address the problem.'' The debate in that White House briefing room symbolizes a broader battle within the Republican Party, a battle that pits ideological conservatives against more practical politicians and legislators. In an important sense, the party divides between those who dismiss the workers in Minneapolis as tools of the union, and those who say they represent a problem that must be addressed. How that battle is resolved could have enormous implications for the party and the nation's political life for the rest of the decade. In the short term, the struggle centers on the mind of Ronald Reagan, and on the legislative agenda he and his allies will pursue in the new Congress. In the long term, the struggle will determine the future of the Republican Party. Who will lead the party, and in what direction, after Mr. Reagan leaves the scene? Will the party be able to solidify the gains it made in 1980, when some leaders talked confidently of a permanent ''realignment'' of the party balance and a new Republican majority? Or will the Republicans lapse back into the role of permanent understudy to the Democrats after a few turns on the stage in place of the injured star? American parties are vast, loosely organized coalitions, not ideologically cohesive units on the European model, and as Robert M. Teeter, a Republican poll taker, put it, ''The tent's so big, you always have internal struggles.'' Richard S. Williamson, the White House liaison with state and local governments, added: ''Parties are constantly in search of their own soul.'' What makes this battle more important and more intense than most such battles is that the Republicans control the Senate as well as the White House, and thus have major responsibility for running the Government for the first time in a quarter of a century. ''It was easy to be a united minority; we didn't have to answer for anything,'' noted a Republican aide in the House. ''Now we have to answer for a national agenda, and it's very difficult to do that.'' The battle for the Republican future has been described as a contest between conservatives and moderates. Liberals seem to be an endangered species in the G.O.P., almost as rare as Democrats who identify with Jimmy Carter. But in an important sense, the conflict is not really ideological, since most of the current and potential leaders cluster in a rather narrow band on the political spectrum somewhere right of center, say about the 40-yard line. The struggle really centers more on strategy than on ultimate goals, and the fissures cut across each other in confusing patterns: ideologues versus pragmatists, optimists against realists, those who scorn political calculation fighting those who welcome it. Probably the major clash is between Republicans who insist on maintaining certain principles and policies, no matter what, and those who say the party's job is to govern the country, even if that means messy compromises and imperfect solutions. So far, President Reagan has been trying to straddle both horses at once, but the strain is beginning to show. His budget calls for standby taxes, but no change in his basic three-year tax package; job training, but not job-producing Government efforts; a slowdown in defense, but no real change in his massive military buildup. To many listeners from both parties, the President's State of the Union address sounded soggy, almost soporific. For a generation, Mr. Reagan has basically given one speech, the paean to free enterprise that he first started refining as a good-will ambassador for General Electric and developed into an effective political document during his years as Governor of California. What he delivered on Jan. 25 amounted to only the second basic speech of his political lifetime, and as he grudgingly acknowledged the value of government intervention in the economy, the President seemed monumentally uncomfortable and unenthusiastic. Accordingly, the direction in which Mr. Reagan will lead the party remains uncertain. So is his decision whether to run again next year. What is certain is that the race to succeed Mr. Reagan, whenever he steps down, has already begun in earnest. It is also clear that the Republican brouhaha could rival the Democrats' well-known penchant for fratricide. John P. Sears, once the President's campaign manager and now a Washington lawyer, voices a common feeling when he says: ''Reagan is in charge of a broad group in the party. Once he's no longer running, no one can replace him.'' Peter Hart, a prominent Democratic poll taker, adds gleefully: ''It will be a bloodbath that I will be delighted to watch.'' Until Mr. Reagan drops the other shoe, his potential successors are trying to restrain their eagerness - but only barely. In the early weeks of the new year, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader, announced that he would not seek a fourth term in 1984, in order to give himself running room for a Presidential bid. Senator Robert W. Packwood of Oregon went prospecting for support in New England. Leaders of the New Right said they might not support Mr. Reagan again, and contemplated backing Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina for President, either on the Republican ticket or a thirdparty slate. Vice President Bush took off on a European mission that could enhance his credentials as a foreign policy expert.Senator Robert Dole seemed to be in the middle of every legislative battle, from Social Security to taxes to food stamps, burnishing his image as an effective legislator who can get things done. Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York, who campaigned vigorously for Re-publicans during the fall, was assiduously adding to his stock of political chits. Senator Laxalt gained greater public visibility by taking a new job as general chairman of the party and its chief public spokesman. The Great Mentioner, that vaporous but influential Washington sage, was popping up with some additional names, from Senator William L. Armstrong of Colorado to Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois. And all this with the first party caucuses in Iowa still a year away. These Republican machinations are not taking place in a vacuum. The two major parties interact constantly, borrowing ideas and tactics, giving shape to each other the way a head shapes a pillow. Accordingly, the fate of the Republicans will he heavily influenced by what the Democrats do. For a while, the G.O.P. dreamed of a leftward adventure by the Democrats that would leave the middle ground unoccupied. Those hopes were clouded by the decision of Senator Edward M. Kennedy to pull out of the Presidential race, and his announcement was mourned by Republicans who saw him as the perfect ''bogeyman,'' the one candidate who could horrify their party enough to keep it united. Richard M. Scammon, a well-known election analyst, said: ''If the Democrats erect a monument it should be to a noncandidate - Kennedy. He enabled them to stay in the middle.'' The party that Ronald Reagan eventually bequeaths to his successors does possess considerable strengths. For one thing, the Republicans have understood, far better than the Democrats, the changing character of political parties. As the traditional, locally based parties eroded under the hammer blows of modern life -suburbs, television, education - the G.O.P. created a whole new animal, a national party that turned the political world on its head. It was organized from the top down, not the bottom up, and its threads of allegiance were knotted together by computer banks, not precinct captains. Aggressive marketing techniques turned the party into a money-making machine, and Richard N. Bond, the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: ''We're in really good shape mechanically. In gross dollars, the money we raise in the next election cycle is going to be awesome.'' Institutionally, the Republican Party is in good shape despite Ronald Reagan, not because of him. The President came to partisan politics late in life, and he has always been a lone wolf, more devoted to promoting his own ideas and ambitions than the interests of his party. Accordingly, Mr. Reagan has played down the role of President as party leader, and has shown little concern for the inner workings of the complex organism that is the modern mass political party. The health of the Republican Party is really a testament to Bill Brock, who took over as party chairman after the Watergate humiliation and did a superb rebuilding job. The President's disinterest in the party structure was demonstrated by his choice to succeed Brock - Richard Richards, an obscure party functionary from Utah who almost disappeared during his two years in the job. The decision to replace Richards with Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the Nevada state chairman and a close associate of Senator Laxalt, reflected White House concern for the political future of Ronald Reagan, not the Republican Party. In recent years, the Republicans have been the more dynamic party, producing ideas, attracting recruits and conveying a sense of purpose. As a result, the party has exerted more influence over the national agenda, and has shaken the Democrats' domination of the political dialogue. As John Sears observed: ''The crucial thing in politics is who getsto say what's wrong with the country, and what should be done about it. That's up for grabs now, and that hasn't been true for 50 years.'' The best ideas of one party are often absorbed by the other, a process that blurs battle lines and frustrates purists, but generally guarantees the health of the system. As a result, many Democrats sound like warmed-over Republicans these days: hesitating to propose new spending programs without finding a way to pay for them; talking about the needs of capital as well as labor; accepting larger defense budgets and the premise that America must rebuild its military. In addition, the Republicans showed remarkable resiliency in the elections of 1982. While they lost 26 seats in the House, they retained control of the Senate, captured the governorship of California, and almost pulled off a major upset in New York. Ben J. Wattenberg, co-author of ''The Real Majority,'' an influential political analysis in the early 1970's, said of the Republicans' performance in 1982: ''They survived. That tells you something about the potency of their ideas.'' Finally, the same polls that show slippage in Mr. Reagan's approval rating do not show a corre-sponding surge for the Democrats. ''If the people believed that the Democrats could solve our problems, I'd be very concerned,'' said Fahrenkopf, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''But they're not saying that.'' Yet for all these brave words and hopeful signs, the Republican Party is blanketed today by a thick fog of confusion, a miasma of missed opportunities. Two years after Richard B. Wirthlin, the President's poll taker, talked confidently about a ''rolling realignment'' that would significantly alter the political landscape, many Republicans are saying frankly, ''We're blowing it.'' Or as Edward Mahe Jr., a former party official and current campaign consultant, put it, ''We are rapidly getting to the point where we're making Jimmy Carter look good, and I never thought that would be possible.'' ''We've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,'' lamented Michael S. Johnson, the press aide to Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican minority leader. ''We went at our programs and our goals with such fervor in 1981 that we got too far in front of the people who gave us our mandate. As we moved toward recession and high unemployment, we maintained too much selfconfidence in the long-term impact of our program. We believed our own rhetoric, and we forgot to be shortsighted. We didn't demonstrate a basic sensitivity to the problems that were being created.'' Scholars who study the evolution of political parties note that genuine realignments have generally occurred on a 30- to 40-year cycle. Since the Democrats became the majority party in the 30's, pressures are building along the fault lines that divide the electorate, and by historic standards, a shift might be imminent. But the major reason that the Republicans have not been able to trigger this political earthquake was the one pinpointed by Johnson: the widespread perception that they lack a ''basic sensitivity'' to the problems of average, working-class Americans. ''From everything I can see for the rest of the decade, it doesn't look like the Republicans can became a majority,'' said Prof. Robert L. Peabody, who teaches political science at Johns Hopkins University. ''To get a true realignment, you have to get a movement in the electorate, but all the data show that people are not changing their party allegiance. They voted for Reagan over Carter as the lesser of two evils.'' Prof. Joel L. Fleishman of Duke University believes that the Republican future will be determined at least in part by the Democrats. ''To the extent that the Democratic Party remains a middle party, leaning to the left, it will be hard for the Republicans to get majority status,'' said Professor Fleishman, the editor of a new book, ''The Future of American Political Parties.'' ''There are just alot more poor and moderate income people around who are attracted to the Democratic Party.'' In Fleishman's view, Reagan has pulled the Republicans to the right, and out of the political mainstream. ''The party of Ronald Reagan cannot be a majority party; it's too skewed toward wealth and privilege and corporations,'' the professor argued. ''I doubt that Americans are extremists one way or another. When Ronald Reagan was running, he was not perceived to be as ideologically extreme as he turned out to be.'' The Republican Party dominated the political scene from the Civil War to the New Deal. The Democratic coalition formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt did not start unraveling until the 1960's, and in an important sense it was a victim of its own success. Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. is fond of saying that the Democrats hoisted their own working-class loyalists into the middle class, and gave them the luxury of becoming Republicans. This natural political evolution was accelerated by Vietnam and the rise of the youthful counterculture, which seemed to mock so many of the values held sacred by traditional Democrats, from church to flag to family. As John Sears recalls, ''The Democrats denigrated the mainstream voter, and allowed themselves to look so avant-garde that they no longer could be trusted.'' George Wallace saw this chance and took it. So did Richard Nixon, who denounced hippies and praised ''hard hats'' and sought out disaffected Democrats. ''By 1972,'' notes Kevin P. Phillips, author of ''The Emerging Republican Majority,'' ''Nixon was thinking in terms of country and western singers and Polish archbishops in the White House. He finally understood it.'' Ronald Reagan codified this new appeal to traditional Democrats in a most cogent and perceptive way, through his campaign litany of neighborhood, work, family, peace and freedom. With those words, the party of the board room and the country club reached into the bowling alley and the union hall. Two key voting groups swung behind the Republicans: blue-collar workers, often urban Catholics from the Northeast and Middle West; and Southern Protestants, often rural and religious, who had been Democrats since the Civil War. The Republicans told them that they would fight crime, end racial disruptions in the schools, restore respect for the flag, shore up the family, cut taxes and throw the greedy off welfare. Said one Republican campaign strategist: ''You can't underestimate the degree of fed-upness there was going into the 1980 election.'' Have the Republicans failed to capitalize on their victory in 1980? Why, as Prof. Nelson W. Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley put it, is ''the Republican Party busily blowing a golden opportunity, handed it by the incompetence of Democrats in managing their own affairs?'' The basic answer is that the Republicans misread the 1980 elections in a number of profound ways. For one thing, they were too quick to proclaim a party realignment on the basis of only one election. Richard Scammon, co-author of ''The Real Majority,'' points out that the vote in House races, as opposed to the Presidential balloting, has stayed fairly steady since 1978, with Democrats winning 51 percent to 56 percent of the popular vote. Polsby notes that even when the Republicans were taking control of the Senate, Democratic Senate candidates outpolled their opponents by a total of almost three million votes. The professor, author of the forthcoming book ''The Consequences of Party Reform,'' concludes: ''The evidence for party realignment or for the emergence of a new majority backing the President's program is extremely thin.'' The Republicans interpreted their ''mandate'' as an endorsement of the full-dress program long nurtured by Mr. Reagan and his conservative colleagues; but exit polls from 1980 show that 38 percent of the Reagan supporters were voting against Carter, while only 11 percent were attracted by the Republicans' conservative agenda. Peter D. Hart, the Democratic poll taker, explains: ''You weren't getting fundamental shifts in attitude in the 1980 election. People sided with the Republicans because they didn't like the Democrats, not because the Republican Party made sense and they were buying in.'' Public support for Mr. Reagan's economic program was always shallower than the President and his allies maintained. But the tidal wave of enthusiasm generated by the President's victory swallowed up doubts and swept everyone along. Looking back, Richard Richards, outgoing chairman of the Republican National Committee, explains: ''There was a tendency to think that when we made a decision, certain things would happen. If we cut taxes or social spending the results would occur as an exact science. That just ain't so. Everyone who runs for office oversimplifies what he can and will do, and we did that. But things didn't follow as easily and routinely as we thought they would, and we've jeopardized our credentials and our right to lead.'' A growing number of Republicans also believe they are suffering from a ''compassion gap,'' a belief that the party has not done enough to recharge the economy or alleviate the suffering of the umemployed in the aging industrial areas of the country. To Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, Republicans who counsel caution and restraint are ''architects of disaster'' for the party. ''I don't see how you can go to Indiana and say you're for full employment, and at the same time say, 'There's nothing I can do about it,' '' said Senator Lugar, author of a housing stimulus bill that passed Congress last year but was vetoed by the President. ''There are things we can do about it and ought to do about it, and if we want to be the majority party, we have to be part of it.'' The Republicans also misread the election as a mandate for a wholesale attack on government spending and services, long favored by conservative ideologues. But as Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip, put it: ''Americans think of themselves as conservatives; they want government reduced. But in their hearts they are liberals; they want all the goodies coming in.'' The Administration's most damaging misinterpretation of the 1980 election came in the area of Social Security. V. Lance Tarrance Jr., a Republican poll taker in Texas, reports that for the first six months of the President's tenure, more and more voters were identifying with the Republican Party. Then came the White House proposal to trim pension benefits. ''Realignment officially terminated in June of 1981, with the Social Security pronouncement,'' notes Tarrance, who was monitoring the issue through public-opinion surveys. ''There's been not a single breath of life in it since.'' The third mistake flowed from the conviction that the social issues, such as abortion, school prayer and busing, would help cement the swing of Democrats to the Republican cause. But Republican strategists now admit that abortion is an emotional issue that ''cuts both ways'' and costs as many votes as it attracts, even among Roman Catholics. Moreover, it was one thing for voters to identify with a vague concern about moral decay, quite another to back legislation that would amend the Constitution or strip the courts of jurisdiction. Here again, the Reaganites projected the ideological views of their true believers onto the average voter, and paid for it. The fourth misreading of the election was more subtle. Because Ronald Reagan won such a large share of the bowling-alley vote in 1980, the Republicans became complacent, convinced that these voters had switched permanently. But they failed to realize how fragile this new-found allegiance really was, and how deep the ancient suspicions of the Republicans really ran.  ''When the Republicans got in,'' said Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, ''the image of the Republicans favoring the rich certainly resurfaced. And Reagan contributed to that, appearancewise, with the new china and all those other things. Many blue-collar people said, 'The Republicans really don't care about us.' '' Where, then, do the Republicans go from here? The struggle will continue on two parallel tracks, the legislative and the political. But in the immediate future, the focus will be on Capitol Hill. The pragmatist-realist faction of the party starts from the premise that the Republican resurgence is being choked off by rising unemployment and deepening despair. And they see no point in staying the course with an iceberg looming dead ahead. ''If we don't deal with circumstances as we find them, we're not doing our job,'' Senator Laxalt insisted. ''Two years ago we thought that our tax cut would stimulate the economy and we would have 6 or 7 percent growth rate by now. That hasn't happened, so we can't sit there and bury our heads in the sand and say go away.'' The pragmatists make their base camp on Capitol Hill, and that is no accident. Midterm elections are specifically designed to produce a report card on the Administration, to force the entire House and onethird of the Senate to return home and listen to their constituents. Representative Toby Roth, Republican of Wisconsin, described the experience this way: ''You get very isolated in Washington and lose touch. But on the campaign trail you get very realistic, very quickly.'' Moreover, the terms of 19 Republican Senators are up in 1984, and the party leadership has absolutely no desire to return to minority status in the Senate. They would like to re-elect President Reagan and retain the White House, but as one Senate aide conceded, ''Our No.1 one priority is to keep control of the Senate.'' To most Republican leaders in Congress, the way to do that is follow Laxalt's advice and ''deal with circumstances as we find them,'' not as they would like them to be. This bent toward realism, not always a highly prized characteristic in Republican ranks, has been accentuated by the experience of the last two years. Many Congressional Republicans have undergone a remarkable evolution, from minority to majority, from outsider to insider, from critic to craftsman. Senator Dole, the consummate pragmatist, expressed what might stand as the credo of his colleagues when he said, ''We are the majority party; we have to produce legislation.'' The determination of Mr. Dole and his colleagues to produce practical legislation, and not just accept White House dictates, is also animated by a dirty little secret: Many of them never really believed in ''supply-side'' economics, the idea that reduced taxes would stimulate the economy and wipe out deficits. They agreed with George Bush when he called it ''voodoo economics'' and with Senator Baker when he called it a ''river-boat gamble,'' and now they feel it is time for the party to cut its losses. They are still conservatives, rooted in the belief that smaller government is better government. But just as liberal Democrats have absorbed some basic Republican precepts in recent years, these Republicans see some good points in the Democratic belief that government intervention in the economy is right and proper. ''If we continue our hands-off approach, with government having no responsibility, there's going to be hell to pay in 1984,'' said Senator Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana. As Senator Quayle indicates, the 1984 elections are already dominating thought processes on Capitol Hill, and the legislative strategy of the pragmatist faction dovetails with its political belief: The government can only be run, and elections can only be won, in the broad middleground of the political arena. ''The question in both parties,'' says Ben Wattenberg, ''is who captures the horse of tough moderation.'' Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Middle West are particularly alarmed at the ''hands-off'' attitude of the ideological conservatives in the party, and they say that stronger government intervention in the economy is absolutely essential if their party is to have any chance of recapturing the blue-collar Democrats who backed President Reagan in 1980. ''I can't understand all this caution, the feeling that recovery can happen too soon,'' complained Senator Lugar, the new head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''In my part of the country it can't happen too soon.'' Senator Packwood of Oregon, the man Senator Lugar ousted from the campaign post, advances the critique of his party one step further. He points out that in 1982 Republicans were most popular with white males earning more than $40,000 a year, and he finds that a very narrow base for a mass party. In speeches around the country, the Oregonian is preaching that Republicans must make a major effort to attract women and racial minorities. ''The feeling now is that our party doesn't care about them, doesn't need them and doesn't want them,'' he said. Many Republicans who dislike the Senator's manner, and his personal criticisms of President Reagan, agree with his political analysis. It was no accident that Mr. Reagan appointed two women to his Cabinet within one week, and praised the Civil Rights Commission in his State of the Union address. At times, the Republican battle lines seem drawn across Pennsylvania Avenue, with the White House on one side and Congress on the other. But there are important pragmatist moles in the executive branch, just as there are plenty of ideologues in Congress. The chief pragmatist in the inner circle is clearly James A. Baker 3d, the chief of staff; and Charles Black, Republican campaign consultant, describes his role this way: ''Jim Baker knows how this town operates, and he's quicker to compromise than Reagan or Meese. But philosophically, there's not a big difference between them.'' 3rd jump But there is a difference in style and outlook. Baker and his allies are rooted in the Republican tradition - generally fostered in Ivy League schools and Wall Street law firms - that government service is a noble pursuit. So they do not share the burning hostility toward government that motivates many conservatives from non-Eastern, nonprivileged backgrounds. The other knock against the likes of Baker is that they are not true Reaganites, that they originally backed other Republican hopefuls and have not passed the loyalty test. To pragmatists on Capitol Hill, this makes the Bakerites invaluable sources of balance and skepticism in the White House, but to the ideologues, this makes them unreliable, and even treacherous. Indeed, it has become a part of the conservative canon that the interlopers in the White House have betrayed the Reagan revolution and caused its downfall. A typical view was expressed by Lyn Nofziger, the former White House political adviser, who said of the President: ''He's the victim of people who work for him, who are opposed to his philosophy.'' That philosophy is the wellspring of the ideological wing of the party. Its headquarters are in the White House, and its chieftains include Edwin Meese 3d, the president's counselor; Edward Rollins, the political adviser, and Richard S. Williamson, the liaison to local governments. But they get strong support from such lawmakers as Representative Kemp and Senator Armstrong, plus right-wing activists like Richard Viguerie, who refined the use of direct mail fund raising to a high art. This is the group that believes the country must ''stay the course,'' maintain confidence in the President and his program, avoid ''quick fixes'' and weak-kneed retreat. Its rallying cry was enunciated recently by James G. Watt, the Secretary of the Interior, who told a party celebrating the Administration's second anniversary: ''Let Reagan be Reagan.'' In their view, President Reagan is failing not because he has been too rigid, but because he has been too flexible. When the President calls for new taxes or jobs programs, no matter how small, they believe that he is crippling his own program, fuzzing the differences between the parties, and converting the Republicans into pale imitations of the Democrats. To right-wing activists like Robert McAdam, assistant director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, any battle fought on economic grounds will always be won by the Democrats, so there is no use compromising. ''The Reagan Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress say that nothing is important but economics,'' McAdam noted. ''But the blue-collar voters say, O.K., I'm a Democrat, and if all you want to talk about is economics, I'm better off with the Democrats. They'll at least guarantee my job.'' Mr. McAdam insists that the Administration must revive such noneconomic issues as crime and school prayer that motivated the conservative cadres in 1980. Bill Lee, a campaign consultant for Republicans, agrees, saying, ''You have to service the coalition.'' When it comes to the economy, the ideologues say that the President and the Republicans must stick with the original plan, and not alter it in the name of realism. Rollins sneers that there are ''many Republicans who have been bitten by the good government bug, who feel we have a responsibility to govern,'' but he is not one of them. Like many Reaganites, Rollins is mesmerized by the prospect that if their hero changes course he will be become ''Carterized,'' and will shrink in stature and will be viewed as weak-willed. Moreover, the ideologues see Reagan as their best, and perhaps last, chance to enact the conservative agenda they have been drafting for a generation. And as hopes for that agenda continue to dwindle, they are getting a bit desperate. The only answer, goes their argument, is for Reagan to stay firm, draw a clear distinction between Democrats and Republicans, and try to polarize the electorate. ''I personally feel,'' said Rollins, ''that the politics of confrontation is more effective than the politics of compromise. You can't run on the basis of compromise.'' One of the leading exponents of this approach on Capitol Hill is Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who says that Mr. Reagan and the Republicans have already been damaged by too much accommodation and now ''stand for nothing'' in the eyes of the electorate. Compromise, he says, ''helps you to govern, but it collapses your majority. To the degree you try to govern in the short run, at the cost of destroying your coalition, t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at's terribly destructive.'' The best example of how these different approaches play out in legislative terms came last fall, in the fight over the gasoline tax bill. Senator Baker and the rest of the Republican leadership backed the bill as an imperfect but useful compromise, a way of providing jobs and showing sympathy for the unemployed while not increasing the deficit. The orthodox right-wingers, as Mr. Gingrich implied, are not really interested in governing, and they used the occasion to abandon the ruling coalition in the Senate and return to their traditional role of opposition critic. ''When you're given the power to govern,'' noted Senator Quayle, ''and you don't like government, you're uncomfortable.'' On principle, the ideologues don't like the higher taxes and greater government responsibility embodied in the bill. But they also think that the gas tax is the sort of legislation that can be used to political advantage. Instead of supporting it as a jobs bill, they opposed it as a tax bill, and cast themselves in the role of defending the ''little guy'' - the motorist who would have to pay the new levy. The word of the year among hard-core conservatives is ''populism,'' and they share the view of the realists that the Republicans must shed their image as the party of the rich. But the remedies offered to eradicate that image are diametrically opposed. The realists say you win the worker's vote by using government to stimulate the economy and relieve suffering; the ideologues say you gain friends by reducing government and relieving the tax burden. In some ways the legislative battle is a preliminary for the main event, the fight for party leadership in the post-Reagan era. Of course, Mr. Reagan has to step aside before this struggle can emerge into the open, and the first question concerns the President's true intentions. Republicans generally agree that the President would be their strongest and most unifying candidate, and those who think he will run again argue some variation on the theme that he does, or should, want to finish the job he has started. However, analysts such as John Sears see only a ''50-50 chance'' that the President will try for another term, and their reasons are also familiar: he's too old, he doesn't like the job, his wife wants to go back to California and their rich friends. The key variable is the economy, and even a Reagan loyalist like Paul Laxalt says that: ''If I came to the conclusion that he was a political basket case, I wouldn't want him to take the party on a kamikaze mission.'' The President is coming under increasing pressure to make his decision by Labor Day, or even July 4. Even now there is a lot of discreet contingency planning going on, but it is hard to handicap a race that is still being run in the dark. Most Republicans agree with Robert Teeter, the poll taker, when he says that ''so much depends on personality, not ideology.'' This is particularly true since most of the leading contenders come from the pragmatic, or moderately conservative, camp, and agree on a good many issues. In addition to personality, Senator Laxalt suggests two other key qualities: tenacity and organizational skills. ''Running for President,'' he said, ''is a very substantial endeavor. You can have all the charisma in the world, and run well in your home state, but when you get on the national track it's a different animal. You have to pass the credibility test of the national media, and raise a tremendous amount of money and get out and pray that you sell.'' With Mr. Reagan out of the picture, and even if he stays in, Kevin Phillips foresees a fragmentation of the party that could produce two splinter efforts: a right-wing slate headed by someone like Jesse Helms, and a liberal-elite party headed by John Anderson. Any insurrection of this sort would certainly diminish the value of the Republican nomination, but there would be plenty of competitors anyway, and no clear favorite. As Senator Laxalt assesses the situation: ''I don't see any heir apparent at all. There's no consensus out there. The day of receiving a blessing and getting the nomination is over.'' Many questions continue to hover over the Republican Party as the 98th Congress, and the 1984 Presidential race, start to take shape. The latest struggle for the future of the Republican Party is just beginning. But as Teeter noted: ''It is not a struggle that ends some day. It is part of a continuing process that all political parties go through.'' If Reagan Doesn't Run ice President Bush has to be considered first among equals in the nomination sweepstakes, should President Reagan pull out. While he generally represents the pragmatic conservative wing of the party, even a hard-core Reaganite like Richard S. Williamson of the White House staff says of Bush: ''On a practical level he's done an enormous amount. He's helped 150 candidates in the last year, and you couldn't ask for more.'' In addition to a fistful of I.O.U.'s, Vice President Bush retains the skeleton of a good organization and an ability to appeal to a wide slice of the political spectrum. ''Bush is like a chameleon,'' said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a Bush backer. ''People see in him what they want to see, even if it's not always accurate.'' But Bush also carries a lot of baggage, and the biggest load, at least potentially, is his ''Hubert Humphrey problem,'' linkage to an unpopular and discredited President. ''No matter how you slice it,'' says Senator Laxalt, ''the President and the Vice President become Siamese twins.'' Others deride the Vice President as a ''walking watercress sandwich,'' a relentless preppy with little appeal to blue-collar Democrats. Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker, says that Bush has ''the soul of a Vice President'' and adds, ''I don't know who George Bush is, or what he's for.'' But then, the same thing has been said of Senator Baker, who is ranked second by most early oddsmakers. Baker is also more pragmatic than ideological. His advantage over Mr. Bush is a folksier image and more independence from the Reagan Administration. And by announcing his decision to leave the Senate, he managed to proclaim his own Presidential ambitions without dumping on the current President or appearing overeager. On the negative side, Baker has been despised by the right wing ever since he supported the Panama Canal treaties. Moreover, Baker is a superb back-room politician, an inside man doing an inside job. But as Lyn Nofziger, former assistant to the President for political affairs, notes, the qualities of a good majority leader - patience, affability, a knack for compromise -are ''entirely different from the personality and talent needed to be a good candidate for President.'' The third major candidate from the pragmatic conservative camp is Senator Dole, the tough guy turned statesman. Dole is a legitimate war hero, and that won't hurt the chances of a Republican who might have to run against the Democrats' Senator John Glenn, the former astronaut. Lance Tarrance, a Republican poll taker in Texas, adds that since economic problems seem so intractable, ideological candidates seem less viable than more practical, experienced types like Baker and Dole. For now, however, Baker seems to have the edge over Dole in their quiet jockeying for the same corner of the party. Moreover, Dole's responsibilities as chairman of the Finance Committee will keep him tied to Capitol Hill, and raising taxes is not exactly the best way to get people to vote for you. At this stage, the man most likely to emerge as the candidate of the more ideological wing of the party is Jack Kemp. The New York Congressman has traipsed across the country, speaking for local Republican hopefuls, and as Richard N. Bond, deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee says, ''Kemp has got as many chits as anyone.'' With his football stories, perfectly waved hair and toothpaste-ad teeth, Kemp exudes a star quality that more prosaic politicians find hard to match. The most frequently heard criticism of Kemp is that he is not decisive and that he sometimes seems full of ideas and theories that do not quite make sense. One of those theories, embodied in the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which cut taxes by 25 percent over three years, could poison his chances if the economy does not revive. Perhaps the one potential candidate who could span both camps with the same agility as Ronald Reagan is his good friend Paul Laxalt. The Nevadan would probably inherit a good chunk of the President's following, and since he led the opposition to the Panama Canal treaties, he has always enjoyed good support on the right. Yet most pragmatists regard him as an honest broker with a streak of realism in his makeup. Laxalt has never seemed to hunger for the Presidency, and he will do nothing to advance his own cause while President Reagan is a potential candidate. But he was clearly disappointed when he lost the Vice-Presidential nomination in 1980, and at times it appears that his near miss has left him with an aftertaste of glory. When I asked if he ruled out a Presidential bid, he replied," ''You can't rule anything out around here.''""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POPE, IN PANAMA, CAUTIONS AGAINST GUERRILLA WAR",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/world/pope-in-panama-cautions-against-guerrilla-war.html,"Pope John Paul II arrived here today on the third stop of his tour of eight countries and urged Central America's peasants to reject ''the temptation of violence, armed guerrilla struggle and the egoistic struggle of classes.'' ''This is not the path of Jesus Christ, the Church, or your Christian faith,'' he told a rally in Stadium of the Revolution. He expressed sympathy for people who live in ''conditions of misery'' and said he supported ''urgent reforms'' to improve their lives. The Pope flew here from San Jose, Costa Rica, where he had been spent the night after a visit to Managua, Nicaragua, on Friday. Against Taking Up 'Arms of Hate' Making clear that he was speaking to all rural workers in Central America, not only Panamanians, the Pope condemned guerrilla warfare. ''There are those who wish you to abandon your work and take up the arms of hate to struggle against your brothers,'' he said. ''You should not follow them. Where does this path of violence lead? Without a doubt, it increases hatred and the distance between social groups. ''These methods, completely contrary to the love of God and the teachings of your Church and of Jesus Christ, mock the reality of your noble aspirations and provoke new evils of social and moral decay.'' Groups of peasants and Indians were brought here from outlying parts of Panama in buses supplied by local churches. A capacity crowd of 30,000 filled the stadium, which is Panama's largest enclosed arena. Before he spoke, the Pontiff was entertained by costumed dancers who serenaded him with Panamanian songs. He appeared absorbed in their presentation and expressed his thanks before beginning his homily. Earlier in the day, John Paul gave an outdoor mass at which he exhorted his audience to respect the sanctity of the family and reject divorce, contraception and abortion. The Pope was met at Omar Torrijos International Airport by President Ricardo de la Espriella and other leaders. The man considered to hold ultimate power in Panama, Brig. Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, who is the National Guard commander, was not present but greeted the Pope during a brief stop before the outdoor mass. Security officers estimated that more than 100,000 people were gathered for the mass at Simon Bolivar Industrial Center when the Pope arrived by helicopter. From there, the Pope made a brief helicopter trip to the Papal Nuncio's residence, where he had lunch with Roman Catholic prelates. The Pope also paid a courtesy call on President de la Espriella, and addressed priests and seminarians at the cathedral. He was to return to San Jose tonight by helicopter before going on to El Salvador on Sunday. The Panamanian crowds were large and enthusiastic and flags and banners lined the Pope's route through the city, but not nearly in as great numbers as he has seen elsewhere in Latin America. Many of the banners were provided by corporations that identified themselves prominently below messages of welcome. The only unofficial sign seen along the route was painted in large red letters on a wall near the National University. It urged John Paul to ''demand freedom for political prisoners in Central America.'' The Government declared a ''day of national rejoicing'' and urged businesses to release as employees rom their normal duties so they could see the Pope, either in person or on television. Bars, casinos and many shops did not open for business, the major thoroughfares were all but empty and the airport was closed. The Minister of Justice, Justo Fidel Palacios, said Thursday that, as a gesture of good will, he would order the release of some prisoners convicted of nonviolent crimes. In contrast to some other countries in the region, Panama has avoided conflicts between Catholic leaders and the Government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ON LANGUAGE; THE SQUEAL RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/magazine/on-language-the-squeal-rule.html,"Rarely does one side in a controversy grab the moral high ground by the coinage of a phrase. A generation ago, opponents of the union shop urged the passage of what they called right-to-work laws, building their argument into the name of the game: Who could be against the right to work? (Organized labor called the legislation union-busting laws.) In the same way, the truth-in construction was effective, from truth-in-securities in 1933 to truth-in-packaging later. More recently, issue-titling was enhanced by groups that favored legal abortion and called themselves prochoice, a move that was then countered by antiabortion groups that selected the positive prolife. Now a debate revolves around (or centers on) a regulation propounded by the Department of Health and Human Services requiring those who use tax dollars to supply minors with contraceptive devices to notify the minors' parents. Supporters say the law on which the regulation is based calls for the agency to ''encourage family participation,'' and a family cannot participate unless it knows of the teen-ager's request; opponents call the rule an intrusion into privacy likely to result in more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions. The regulation is named ''the Squeal Rule''; its label is a powerful weapon in the hands of the opponents. In 1865, a British slang dictionary defined squeal as ''to inform, peach,'' and identified the term as ''a North Country variation of squeak''; squealer in the sense of ''informer'' is a derogation of a person who provides information to the police. The implication, of course, is that the one doing the squealing sounds like a pig. The sounds made by animals, applied to humans, reflect the human attitude toward the animal: Dogs can be authoritative (''he barked'') or mean (''he snarled''), while lions are intimidating (''he roared''), and mice are frightened (''he squeaked''). Birds are cheerful (''he chirped''), and criminals who talk are said to be singing. In metaphor, the lowest form of animal life is not the snake (''he hissed'') but the useful, delicious pig: Nobody knows the truffles he's seen. If you want to hail an informer, call him a whistleblower, and if you want to condemn him, call him a squealer. When did ''Squeal Rule'' originate? ''At the time the Parental Notification Rule was proposed,'' says Russ Mack, spokesman at H.H.S., using the official designation, ''which was in February 1982. That's when I first heard it called by Planned Parenthood and other opponents 'the Squeal Rule.' '' Did Planned Parenthood coin it? ''No,'' says Daisy Voigt, a mediarelations coordinater, who in the course of coordinating media relations answers questions like these. ''I'm tempted to say that I first saw it in The New York Times.'' A quick check at that coordinated medium shows an editorial of Feb. 5, 1982, titled ''Squealing on Teen-Agers.'' On Feb. 26, in an editorial blasting ''the Government's new squeal ruling,'' the headline was ''Abortion and the Squeal Rule.'' Three weeks later, the editorial capitalized the phrase in the copy: ''The strangest of all is the speciousness of the arguments with which the Administration suggests the Squeal Rule.'' The Times's editorial page fiercely defends the anonymity of its editorials, and nobody knows which writer has written which editorial, but this department ''has learned,'' to use television news's favorite phrase, that the coiner of Squeal Rule was Mary Cantwell. (Somebody squealed.) Thanks to the coinage, the battle is being won by the antisqueal forces; the proponents of the rule are stuck with the bureaucratic parental-notification rule. No imagination at all can be detected; nobody has tried full-disclosure requirement or truth-in-dispensing. This matter was brought to my attention by Irving Kristol, editor of The Public Interest, who heard an NBC-TV reporter say that the Squeal Rule was ''already creating problems.'' Mr. Kristol writes: ''As an illustration of such a problem, he turned his television on a 'sexually active girl of 13' - those were his exact words.'' ''I really think,'' comments the father of neoconservatism, ''you ought to take this phrase, sexually active -which I take to be what we used to call promiscuous -and do something with it. Is it possible to be promiscuous anymore? Or was Don Juan sexually active?'' Promiscuous, rooted primarily in the Latin miscere, ''to mix,'' originally meant ''elements mixed together without discrimination'' - a sort of ''Duke's mixture'' in the tobacconist trade. About the turn of this century, it began meaning ''sexually indiscriminate,'' the first citation in a 1924 letter from Cyril Connolly, the British critic and editor: ''I am not promiscuous but I can't be loyal to an icicle.'' (The word has been used frequently since then, but never more tellingly.) For the difference in connotation between promiscuous and sexually active, let us turn to lexicographer David Guralnik: ''Promiscuous is a judgmental word; the idea is that the behavior is not desirable. Sexually active is without judgment; it is neutral. Today, if a writer wants to be critical he will use promiscuous; if he wants to avoid sounding judgmental he will use sexually active. That is why you hear sexually active more often than promiscuous.'' Writers who dwell on these words should remember that the handsoff, I'm-not-knocking-it sexual activity should not be confused with sexual variety, which it overlaps: The latter denotes promiscuity (oops! I made a judgment) of a bisexual nature, its participants called swingers, or if single and frequenters of singles bars, swingles. They don't worry about the Squeal Rule at all. Don't Make a Move ''Clarity begins at home,'' adjures dermatologist Stanley Spatz of Hallandale, Fla. ''I call to your attention a headline in The New York Times: 'A Famed Pastry Chef's Moveable Feast.' Are we to resign ourselves to these nouveau acceptable spellings (likeable, loveable, sizeable), or can someone somewhere insist that the editors and proofreaders demonstrate at least a fourth-grade level of spelling ability before entrusting to them the power to set linguistic standards?'' Sorry, Stanley, you're scratching the wrong itch: Moveable has been spelled with an e since the days of the writing of the Book of Common Prayer in 1549, in which appeared a ''Table of Moveable Feasts.'' (The moveability referred to the dates.) Ernest Hemingway picked up the phrase and used it as the title of a book about life in Paris in the good old days. ''If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man,'' he wrote, ''then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.'' Unfortunately, when that quotation and the book title appeared in Bartlett's Quotations, it was spelled the way Dr. Spatz prefers: movable. Betsy Pitha, copy editor for that publication, says: ''The spelling of movable in your edition was caused by an overscrupulous proofreader. Hemingway spelled it with an e. The error was caught and corrected in the second printing.'' Does this mean that moveable is correct? Not necessarily; in Great Britain, the spelling with the e is preferred. In the United States, we go along with the rule that calls for the dropping of the e when the suffix is added. Go with likable, provable and -unless you were intimidated by Hemingway at an early age - movable. (That rule does not apply to an ending with a double e; let's not get disagreeable.) I spell movable without an e when writing about types of type, but defer to the old English spelling when using the word as a modifier for ''feast,'' because I like to preserve the phrase as originally used and because I am a generally lovable fellow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TOPICS; Dubious Loyalties,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/opinion/topics-dubious-loyalties.html,"Contempt Margaret Heckler, who was confirmed last week as Secretary of Health and Human Services, recently told the Senate of her contempt for the Supreme Court and the American constitutional process. ''I have very little respect for the Roe v. Wade decision'' permitting abortion, Mrs. Heckler told the committee considering her nomination. She is so hostile to the 1973 decision, in fact, that she won't rule out legislation stripping Federal courts of power to decide abortion matters. Mrs. Heckler may have thought she was thus showing loyalty to her new boss, the President. Yet Attorney General William French Smith told Congress last year that court-stripping bills would be unconstitutional if they threatened the Supreme Court's ''core functions'' of interpreting the Constitution, insuring uniform law throughout the land and maintaining the supremacy of Federal law. Roe v. Wade has its critics, but most of them are respectful of the separation of powers. They would only attempt to change a Supreme Court interpretation in the proper way, by amending the Constitution.

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/07/us/briefing-015108.html,"'Pro-Life Activists' Poll Conservative groups that believe President Reagan has shortchanged them politically continue to lob blunt warnings over the fence into the White House grounds. The other day the National Pro-Life Political Action Committee circulated results of a poll of 1,394 ''pro-life activists'' as evidence of ''lukewarm'' support for the President, both on the abortion issue and over all. The figures showed 53 percent of participants rating Mr. Reagan's overall performance as very good or good and 47 percent as fair, poor or very poor. On the President as an effective antiabortionist, the ratings were 32 percent very good or good and 68 percent fair, poor or very poor. Peter B. Gemma Jr., treasurer of the committee, said the poll indicated that ''a small number of pro-life voters'' would support the Democratic Presidential candidate in 1984 while ''a sizable portion of our supporters may just sit out the election.'' Celebrity Cooking James S. Brady, the White House press secretary, will have a special cooking station set up in the ballroom of the Sheraton Washington Hotel where he can prepare his own chili recipe from his wheelchair. His will be only one of 16 stove-and-counter combinations at which celebrity cooks from all walks of Washington life will be on public display Wednesday evening, competing for prizes awarded by culinary professionals at the March of Dimes Gourmet Gala. Nancy Thurmond, wife of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, is chief organizer of the benefit, at which some 500 guests will pay $150 each to observe the cooking competition and judging and then sample a buffet dinner of the same dishes, as prepared by the hotel. In addition to Mr. Brady, the cooks will include Mayor and Mrs. Marion S. Barry Jr., Senator and Mrs. Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., Larry Brown, the former Washington Redskins running back; Diana McLellan, the local gossip columnist, and Secretary General and Mrs. Alejandro Orfila of the Organization of American States. A Change of Style Washington associates of Moshe Arens, the new Israeli Defense Minister, have noticed a marked sartorial change since he returned home. During his service in Washington as Ambassador to the United States, he wore a necktie on all public occasions. To judge from recent television and news photos, his shirt collar is now open and undecorated, vintage Israeli style. A Budgetary Passion For much of Washington, the Federal budget is a mystifying maze of multimillion-dollar figures and illusory promises. For Stanley E. Collender, it is a cottage industry. Mr. Collender is a 32-year-old student of public administration who has devoted virtually all his adult life to the Federal budget, which may account for the fact that he is still a bachelor. After serving on the staffs of both the Senate and House Budget Committees and as a budget expert for the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, he decided it was time he put seven years of fiscal expertise to work for him. The result has been the Budget Research Group, a consulting service established in 1981 for corporations, public interest groups and trade associations; the Federal Budget Report, an insiders' newsletter begun the next year with a number of members of Congress among its 250 subscribers, and ''The Guide to the Federal Budget,'' a 160-page paperback, the second edition of which is emanating this weekend from the Urban Institute Press. The 1982 version sold 3,000 copies. Last season, from the staff of his enterprises, Mr. Collender fielded a softball team in the Congressional league, the red-clad ''Deficits'' whose T-shirt numbers ranged from 0 on down. For Immediate Release? There are limits to the awesome power of modern technology, at least as it is haltingly applied on Capitol Hill. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which says its job is ''to analyze complex issues involving science and technology for Senate and House committees,'' issued a news release last week marked: ''For Immediate Release, Feb. 29, 1983.'' New York's Whip Representative Charles E. Schumer of New York is breathing the heady atmosphere of his party's House leadership, or at least its lower reaches. The secondterm Brooklyn Congressman was chosen last week as whip of the New York City Democratic delegation, defeating Representative Mario Biaggi of the Bronx for the post in a 10 to 9 caucus vote.

NUN DEFIES ARCHBISHOP ON MEDICAID ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/us/nun-defies-archbishop-on-medicaid-abortions.html,"A Roman Catholic nun here is defying her Archbishop's order to resign as state director of social services because she will not denounce the state-financed abortions for poor women that her department administers. Archbishop Edmund C. Szoka has vowed to take the issue to the Vatican if she does not resign. The Archbishop says it is not too late for the nun, Sister Agnes Mary Mansour, to satisfy his demand that she denounce the Medicaid abortions. The nun, a college president who has a doctorate in biochemistry, has met the Archbishop's challenge with two months of silence. She has been bolstered by a groundswell of support from liberal elements in the archdiocese, although most Catholics here apparently side with the Archbishop. The nun, who is 51 years old, is scheduled to appear for a State Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday in Lansing, where the question of her loyalty and obedience, issues usually reserved for ecclesiastical proceedings, may be investigated in a political setting. Appointment Not at Issue Archbishop Szoka does not oppose Sister Mansour's serving in Gov. James J. Blanchard's Cabinet as director of social services. In fact, he said, her appointment could be a ''blessing'' to the poor with whom the department deals. But before he will give the approval for her to accept the job, he said, she will have to denounce the abortions. ''This declaration has not been made by Sister Mansour,'' the prelate said in his first public comment on the issue, ''and therefore I must now state, without any qualification, my objection and opposition to her appointment as director of social services. I also call for her resignation from that office without delay.'' Sister Mansour's supporters argue that the Archbishop has been inconsistent and wavering, hardening his stand as time passed and the nun remained in office pending confirmation. These supporters say that the good she can do, as a member of an order dedicated to helping the poor, outweighs the difficulty of reconciling church and state on the abortion issue. Potential Problem for Governor If the issue is not resolved, however, it may turn into a political problem for Governor Blanchard, a Democrat and Unitarian who announced Sister Mansour's appointment in December, apparently unaware of the ecclesiastical pitfalls that lay in its path. In their cautious comment on the dispute, newspaper editorials have focused on the lack of political foresight by the Governor and the nun rather than on the church issues involved. All indications are that most of metropolitan Detroit's 1.2 million Catholics side with the Archbishop, but Sister Mansour's defenders have been gathering strength. Groundwork for a Just World, an organization of nuns and brothers who work in social welfare here, has rallied behind her, and so, lately, has Msgr. H. Clement Kern, a well-known Detroit priest. Sister Mansour's supporters argue that abortions, however repugnant to the church, are legal and cannot morally be denied to people who cannot afford them. Last year Michigan spent just over $4.6 million to help pay for 19,500 Medicaid abortions. Sister Mansour's immediate superior is her motherhouse, the Sisters of Mercy, Province of Detroit. The order's superior, after a long silence, has sided with the nun in the dispute. But the Archbishop has vowed to pursue his claim to the right to approve or disapprove such an appointment to the Vatican and to the Sacred Congregation for Religious, which rules on disputes involving religious orders. Sister Mansour made a losing run for the Democratic nomination to the House of Representatives last year, also without the Archbishop's approval. He later accepted her explanation that she did not know she needed his permission, and the matter was dropped. Although the Archbishop has not yet invoked Pope John Paul in the current dispute, the pontiff has in the past restricted the right of priests to serve in political offices, forcing the resignation of a member of Congress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DUBIOUS READING OF INFANT MORTALITY BAROMETER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/opinion/l-dubious-reading-of-infant-mortality-barometer-017425.html,"To the Editor: There is plenty of sound evidence that the availability of medical services, including maternal and prenatal care, along with adequate nutrition will tend to decrease the infant mortality rate. Thus, cuts in programs offering these services could have the effect of raising these rates. However, the implication that this Administration's economic policies and budget cutbacks have caused an increase in infant deaths (news article Feb. 13, editorial Feb. 20) is such a serious charge that it requires adequate documentation. Unfortunately, The Times, which has the responsibility to reasonably winnow out evidence from advocacy on such important issues, did not per-form well. Using data provided by a Washington-based advocacy group indicating a rise in infant mortality rates from 1980 to 1981 in nine states, The Times assumed that the rates have now turned upward and that, if they continue upward, the reason must be basic service cuts. It is extremely doubtful whether anything can be inferred from a number of states exhibiting a rise in infant mortality rates from one year to the next, for while it is true that nationwide rates have been declining steadily for many years, state statistics will frequently show this type of rise. For example, data from the National Center for Health Statistics show that, while the infant mortality rate rose in 15 states from 1980 to 1981, it also rose from one year to the next in an average of 12 states per year over the past 10 years, and in three of those years the number of states exceeded 15. In addition, provisional data from the state vital statistics offices indicate that in six of seven states cited by the Washington group the infant mortality rates had resumed their downward trend in 1982. Although infant mortality has been called a sensitive barometer of the social, economic and medical well-being of a society, because it is subject to so many factors it is very difficult to determine the effect of one or several of these factors over the others. In addition to socio-economic conditions, such factors as the body build and smoking habits of the mother, along with her age and the number of infants she has had, all have their effect on infant mortality. It is also likely that increased availability of abortion tends to decrease the infant mortality rate, especially for very young women and for older women, who often have small, premature, high-risk infants. Indeed, if the infant mortality rate should show a significant increase in the future, it is possible that a decrease in access of the needy to abortion services may play a major role. The American people are not well served by those who, on the ba-sis of inadequate data, claim that our Government is allowing infants to die. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of the Administration to support potentially harmful budgetary policies with concrete assurances that they represent no danger to the mothers and infants of this country. On such vital issues, the public deserves to be treated, by both sides, to more than advocacy posing as evidence. LEROY L.

''For those of us that are pro-life, we have the obligation to be convincing and not condemning in conveying our beliefs,'' said Sister Agnes Mary Mansour, who is awaiting confirmation as state director of social services. ''There is the need for a change of attitude relative to abortion that I feel will be more greatly delayed without such sensitivity and openness to some flexibility,'' she told legislators at her confirmation hearing. ''That is why, although I am opposed to abortion, I can tolerate Medicaid funding for abortion through the Department of Social Services.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN IN THE PULPIT; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/reagan-in-the-pulpit-news-analysis.html,"Talking of morality to a degree that Presidents usually avoid, President Reagan yesterday adhered not only to old-fashioned religion but to old-fashioned political wisdom: ''Dance with the girl you came in with.'' Before he got to the nuclear freeze issue and the opposite poles of a God-fearing America and a Godless Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan's speech to the National Association of Evangelicals meeting in Orlando, Fla., sounded the themes that won him support and votes from the so-called religious right in his 1980 election. In speaking forcefully against abortion and for prayer in school to identifying himself as one of the ''many God-fearing, dedicated noble men and women in public life,'' Mr. Reagan appealed to a constituency that seemed, after his election, to have retired to the political sidelines. To Paul Weyrich, a conservative who has urged Mr. Reagan to hew to the social issues that drew ordinarily nonvoting evangelicals to the polls in 1980, yesterday's speech ''might as well have been a declaration of candidacy.'' That view was backed by a high-ranking Republican strategist who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. He said, ''It could fairly be interpreted as another in a series of signals that a candidate is talking.'' Moral Arguments Against Freeze Mr. Weyrich, who heads the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, said he told Mr. Reagan personally Monday to stress the moral arguments against a nuclear freeze. He also said ''If Ronald Reagan had sounded like that in 1982, the Republicans wouldn't have lost as many seats as they did.'' Mr. Reagan's campaigning for Congressional Republicans last November concentrated on a defense of his economic policies and a plea to stay the course he had charted. There was little evidence of interest in the election, or voting, from the white Protestant evangelicals who appeared to have registered and voted in unusually heavy numbers only two years before. But yesterday Mr. Reagan sounded like the candidate who in 1980 said in a Dallas speech, ''The First Amendment was written not to protect the people and their laws from religious values, but to protect those values from government tyranny.'' In Orlando yesterday he said, ''Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God acknowledged. When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference. They never meant to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself.'' Pledge on School Prayer That passage introduced a pledge to campaign for a Constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer in public schools. ''Let our children pray,'' Mr. Reagan said. He also promised to fight in the courts recent judicial decisions that have prevented his Administration from informing the parents of young people who get contraceptives from family planning clinics that receive Federal aid. Mr. Reagan complained that the critics' voices were ''louder than ours'' on this issue, but he insisted, ''The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers.'' National polls do not identify clearly the beliefs of the audience to whom his appeal for, and promise of support were directed. But last September a New York Times/CBS News Poll found that white Protestants who said they attended church weekly or almost every week did indeed support school prayer and oppose abortion more strongly than the rest of the public. In a survey of registered voters, 79 percent of the churchgoers backed a school prayer amendment. Only 62 percent of the others surveyed said they did. Thirty-six percent of the Protestants said they favored a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion, as against 25 percent of the others in the poll. Most Approve of Arms Control But this group, which in the poll included more people than some other surveys might identify as Mr. Reagan's primary audience yesterday, was only barely less approving of a freeze on the deployment and production of nuclear weapons. Sixty-four percent of the white Protestant churchgoers supported a freeze, while 70 percent of the others surveyed did. However, Mr. Reagan sought to connect his audience's religious concerns with his opposition to a freeze, going easily from ''we will never abandon our belief in God'' to asserting that a freeze would be tolerable only if it would ''freeze the Soviets' global desires.'' Even so, one high-ranking Republican strategist said yesterday that all these issues were important to strengthening Mr. Reagan's ties to the religious conservatives who were part of his 1980 base. The speech had its fire and brimstone moments, which the strategist said was important to ''reigniting the coalition.'' Another conservative, however, indicated the ambivalence with which the political right has viewed the President cannot be washed away with a single speech. Richard Viguerie, the direct mail specialist and publisher of Conservative Digest, praised Mr. Reagan for ''moralizing and sermonizing'' on vital issues. But, he added, ''The President has always been very good at giving the conservatives their rhetoric. It remains to be seen if the White House staff will stay the President's course and fight for these issues.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN DENOUNCES IDEOLOGY OF SOVIET AS 'FOCUS OF EVIL',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/reagan-denounces-ideology-of-soviet-as-focus-of-evil.html,"President Reagan, denouncing Soviet Communism as ''the focus of evil in the modern world,'' today warned Protestant church leaders not to treat the arms race ''as a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil.'' Appearing before a convention of evangelical Christians, the President delivered one of the most forceful speeches of his Administration on the subjects of theology and war, morality and government. In what White House aides privately said was something of a rebuttal to recent criticism of Administration policy by church officials, notably the Roman Catholic hierarchy, Mr. Reagan delighted his audience by declaring: ''In your discussion of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride - the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.'' 'Very Dangerous Fraud' In an addition to his prepared text, the President used some of his strongest language in again rejecting as ''a very dangerous fraud'' calls for a nuclear freeze without additional Soviet arms reductions. ''That is merely the illusion of peace,'' he said. ''The reality is that we must find peace through strength.'' He continued: ''A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously at Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed.'' The speech, to the National Association of Evangelicals, received a standing ovation in the Sheraton convention center as the orchestra played ''Onward Christian Soldiers.'' The President also issued renewed calls for Federal laws that would restrict abortions and permit organized prayer in public schools. But the strongest thrust of his address appeared to be his response to unspecified church leaders who have criticized his foreign policy. ''Simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly,'' Mr. Reagan said as he discussed the nuclear freeze issue. ''It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom.'' The President argued, in effect, that his national security goals were parallel to with the nation's founding spiritual values. He echoed a debating point of the past in praising as a ''profound truth,'' a young father whom Mr. Reagan said he once heard discussing Communism with his daughters. ''I would rather see my little girls die now, still believing in God, than have them grow up under Communism and one day die no longer believing in God.'' There was strong applause as Mr. Reagan the President delivered this line with dramatic emphasis, and an undertone of cheers could be heard in the hall, too. ''Let us pray for the salvation of all those who live in that totalitarian darkness,'' the President Mr. Reagan said, adding that Americans also must not forget that Communists ''are the focus of evil in the modern world.'' He then criticized unidentified people, individuals who, he said, would have the nation accept Communists ''at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses.'' ''So I would urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority,'' Mr. President Reagan continued. Catholic hurch Stands on Freeze The National Conference of Catholic Bishops is scheduled to vote in May on a final draft of a pastoral letter on the arms race. Earlier drafts have endorsed a two-waybilateral nuclear freeze and the final version is expected to include such a statement. Many Protestant denominations have taken similar stands against nuclear arms. Last month, in another major statement, the Synagogue Council of America, representing six leading groups of Conservative, Reform and Orthodox organizations, asserted that the United States was ''morally bound'' to reduce the danger of nuclear war. The statement further urged Mr. President Reagan and the Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, to seek a ''total cessation of production and deployment of nuclear weapons.'' In discussing domestic issues that have been dormant induring the Administration's recent budget troubles, Mr. Reagan the President stressed a full list of social proposals being pressed in the Congress by conservative legislators lawmakers and church leaders. ''No one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex,'' Mr. Reagan said in asserting complaining that ''sexually active'' hads replaced ''promiscuous'' as a description of for some girls. He Mr. Reagan defended the so-called ''squeal rule,'' proposed by his Administration and enjoined temporarily by two Federal judges, under which parents must be notified when children receive contraceptive help from Federally -aided clinics. The rule has been and temporarily enjoined blocked temporarily by two Federal judges. Court Fight Pledged ''Is all of Judeo-Christian tradition wrong?'' Mr. Reagan asked, drawing strong applause as he added: ''We are going to fight in the courts. The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers.'' In quick order, with his comments punctuated by the crowd's frequent applause, Mr. Reagan urged these steps: - A renewed fight for a constitutional amendment for organized public school prayer. ''Let our children pray,'' he said. - A renewed fight to end ''abortion on demand.'' He said, ''You and I must never rest,'' he said, until abortion is outlawed. - Congressional hearings on ''infanticide'' legislation to protect the handicapped against ''mercy killing.'' Mr. Reagan The President said this was a growing problem directly related to ''a decline in respect for human life,'' generated caused by the growing prevalence of abortion. 'Enjoined by Scripture' ''There is sin and evil in the world,'' the President Mr. Reagan declared. ''And we are enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might.'' The President He called on the Christian preachers to use their pulpits to denounce ''hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice.'' The gathering applauded. in approval. The National Association of Evangelicals is the largest umbrella group for conservative Protestants. Formed in 1942, it is a loosely knit organization of 38,000 individuals and church groups from 40 denominations with a total membership of 3.5 million. While members affirm central religious beliefs common among evangelicals, the association has generally refrained from taking strong stands on social issues. But an activist group has been gaining strength within the association in recent years. Many in the group, called Evangelicals for Social Action, have pressed the association to consider making an antinuclear statement. In May, the activists plan a large conference ion Pasadena, Calif., on the subject of war and peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/excerpts-from-president-s-speech-to-national-association-of-evangelicals.html,"Following are excerpts from the text of President Reagan's speech as prepared for delivery here today to the National Association of Evangelicals: This Administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of America in you, her people, and in your families, churches, neighborhoods, communities - the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under God. Now I don't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to, or at least out of step with, a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern-day secularism, discarding the tried and timetested values upon which our very civilization is based. No matter how well-intentioned, their value system is radically different from that of most Americans. And, while they proclaim they are freeing us from superstitions of the past, they have taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation. Sometimes their voices are louder than ours, but they are not yet a majority. An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington. Since I'm involved, I've been waiting to hear from the parents of young America. How far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents? Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can. An organization of citizens sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent established clinics nationwide to offer help to these girls and hopefully alleviate this situation. Order on Birth Control Clinics Again let me say, I do not fault their intent. However, in their well-intentioned effort, these clinics provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents. For some years now, the Federal Government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics. In providing for this, the Congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation. Nevertheless, the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification. Girls termed ''sexually active'' - that has replaced the word ''promiscuous'' -are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion. We have ordered clinics receiving Federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given. One of the nation's leading newspapers has created the term ''squeal rule'' in editorializing against us, and we are being criticized for violating the privacy of young people. A judge has granted an injunction against enforcement of our rule. I have watched TV panel shows discuss this issue, have read columns pontificating on our error, but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex. Is all of Judeo-Christian tradition wrong? Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm? And isn't it the parents' right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives? Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government. We are going to fight in the courts. The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers. Rule of Law Under God But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy. Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God acknowledged. When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference. They never meant to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself. The evidence of this permeates our history and our government: The Declaration of Independence mentions the Supreme Being no less than four times; ''In God We Trust'' is engraved on our coinage; the Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation; and the members of Congress open their sessions with a prayer. I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court Justices and Congressmen. Last year, I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools. This week I am resubmitting that amendment and calling on the Congress to act speedily to pass it. Let our children pray. Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups, even when the group meetings were held during the students' own time. The First Amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech. Senators Denton and Hatfield have proposed legislation in the Congress on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech. Such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students and I hope the Congress considers these bills quickly. And with your help, I think it's possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the Congress this year. Court Decision on Abortion More than a decade ago, a Supreme Court decision literally wiped off the books of 50 states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children. ''Abortion on demand'' now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year. Human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday pass the Congress - and you and I must never rest until it does. Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity, then its right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be protected. You may remember that when abortion on demand began many, indeed, I'm sure many of you warned, that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life, that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life, infanticide or mercy killing. Tragically enough, those warnings proved all too true: Only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant. I have directed the Health and Human Services Department to make clear to every health care facility in the United States that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps, including infants. And we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of Federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that ''discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by Federal law.'' It also lists a 24-hour, toll-free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant's life. Problem of Infanticide In addition, recent legislation introduced in the Congress by Representative Henry Hyde not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions, it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide. I urge the Congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children, including the disabled or handicapped. I'm sure you must get discouraged at times, but there is a great spiritual awakening in America, a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of America's goodness and greatness. One recent survey by a Washington-based research council concluded that Americans were far more religious than the people of other nations; 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a belief in God and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning for their lives. Another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of adultery, teen-age sex, pornography, abortion and hard drugs. And this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief. I think the items we have discussed here today must be a key part of the nation's political agenda. For the first time the Congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues - that's enormous progress right there. I repeat: America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal. With your biblical keynote, I say today let ''justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.'' Now, obviously, much of this new political and social consensus I have talked about is based on a positive view of American history, one that takes pride in our country's accomplishments and record. But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man; we know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or, as theologians would put it, the doctrine of sin. National Legacy of Evil There is sin and evil in the world, and we are enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might. Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal. The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past. For example, the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights, once a source of disunity and civil war, is now a point of pride for all Americans. We must never go back. There is no room for racism, anti-Semitism or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country. I know you have been horrified, as have I, by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice. Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst. The commandment given us is clear and simple - ''Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'' But whatever sad episodes exist in our past, any objective observer must hold a positive view of American history, a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality. Especially in this century, America has kept alight the torch of freedom - not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world. And this brings me to my final point today. During my first press conference as President, in answer to a direct question, I pointed out that as good Marxists-Leninists the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution. I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin, their guiding spirit, who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas or ideas that are outside class conceptions; morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war; and everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat. Fact of Soviet Doctrine I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of Soviet doctrine illustrates an historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are. We saw this phenomenon in the 1930's; we see it too often today. This does not mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them. I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent; to remind them that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the 40's and 50's for territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles. At the same time, however, they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards. We will never give away our freedom. We will never abandon our belief in God. A number of years ago, I heard a young father addressing a tremendous gathering in California. It was during the time of the Cold War when Communism and our own way of life were very much on people's minds. He was speaking to that subject. Suddenly, I heard him saying, ''I love my little girls more than anything in the world, but I would rather see them,'' and I thought - oh, no, not that. But I had underestimated him. He went on: ''I would rather see them die now, still believing in God, than have them grow up under Communism and one day die no longer believing in God.'' There were thousands of young people in that audience. They came to their feet with shouts of joy. They recognized the profound truth in what he had said. Let us pray for the salvation of all those who live in that totalitarian darkness - pray they will discover the joy of knowing God. Evil in the Modern World But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples of the earth - they are the focus of evil in the modern world. It was C.S. Lewis who, in his unforgettable ''Screwtape Letters,'' wrote: ''The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid 'dens of crime' that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labor camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.'' Because these ''quiet men'' do not ''raise their voices,'' because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace, because, like other dictators before them, they are always making ''their final territorial demand,'' some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses. But, if history teaches anything, it teaches: Simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly - it means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom. So I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority. You know, I have always believed that old Screwtape reserves his best efforts for those of you in the church. So in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride - the temptation blithely to declare yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil. Nuclear Arms Negotiations I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for this Administration's efforts to keep America strong and free, while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals and one day, with God's help, their total elimination. While America's military strength is important, let me add here that I have always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might. The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one; at root, it is a test of moral will and faith. Whittaker Chambers, the man whose own religious conversion made him a ''witness'' to one of the terrible traumas of our age, the Hiss-Chambers case, wrote that the crisis of the Western world exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God, the degree to which it collaborates in Communism's attempt to make man stand alone without God. For Marxism-Leninism is actually the second oldest faith, he said, first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation: ''Ye shall be as gods.'' The Western world can answer this challenge, he wrote, ''but only provided that its faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as Communism's faith in man.'' I believe we shall rise to this challenge; I believe that Communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written. I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material but spiritual, and, because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man. For, in the words of Isaiah: ''He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increased strength. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/10/garden/hers.html,"''MY hobby is acting out Civil War battles,'' the commuting businessman tells his fellow passenger on the New York-to-Pittsburgh run. ''What do you get out of it?'' ''Well, you know how you get the feeling that you just want to blast a guy? I get to do that every weekend.'' His enthusiasm reaches volcanic proportions. ''Guys come from all over. We have real Yankees, real Rebels and real cannons.'' I am on my way to Erie, Pa., to interview Sister Joan Chittister, O.S.B., Ph.D., prioress of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie, who sees in the nuclear arms race ''all the male values of the society run amok.'' Like our born-again Civil War hero. I boarded this plane after hearing talk among church leaders and peace groups that it was Sister Joan's protest that brought the bishops back to the table to strengthen the stand they had taken in the first draft of the Bishops' Pastoral Letter on Nuclear Disarmament. ''I don't know if anyone ever read what I wrote,'' she is to assert. ''But their second draft does address every issue I raised.'' Upon arrival I am greeted by a 46-year-old woman with brown curly hair who is not in a habit. Her bright eyes fasten on mine and lock them in place. There is no ignoring this presence. She throws her arms around me in welcome, grabs my hand and runs to breakfast to meet a group of sisters eager to hear about her recent week of meetings with some of the country's foremost feminists at Stanford University. Her own feminism she describes as ''not antimarriage, antimothering, antimale, but a commitment to the dignity and equality of opportunity of all people.'' She laughs with the pleasure that seems boundless in her soul.''Before I arrived at Stamford some of the women were concerned that a nun would not be able to cope with the high intellectual demands of the meetings.'' The rest of the sisters whoop with glee, for they know that their prioress is a genius. She also has the energy of a race horse and unshakable commitment. ''I'm very hard-nosed,'' she said of herself. ''You can't call me a romanticist. I won't permit that kind of flattery. I'm just entirely too mean and too stubborn to allow the corruption of military thinking to go unchallenged.'' Although she has been a major force in the Roman Catholic Church as president of the Conference of American Benedictine Prioresses, past president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious and a delegate to the White House Religious Conference on SALT II, it was her article in the August 1982 edition of Commonweal and the bishops' purported response to it that have brought her national attention. She took the bishops to task for failing ''to be morally absolute in their repudiation of the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons.'' She wrote that she was troubled by the contrasting ease with which they were able to take a clear stand against abortion. ''What is a woman to think?'' she asked. ''That when life is in the hands of a woman, then to destroy it is always morally wrong? But when all life is in the hands of men then destruction can be theologized?'' Did it take great courage for a nun to challenge bishops in this way? She responds: ''We must all become models of holy disobedience. We must say that 'Peacekeeper' is a lie for 'Death Reaper.' '' When asked about separation of church and state her eyes flash, she begins to walk around the room. ''When bishops bless bombs, salute the flag and pay taxes, nobody says the church shouldn't be involved in politics. But when a church begins to talk about the destruction of the planet, then they say, bishops, religious and priests should stay in the pulpit, should mind their prayers, should concentrate on mercy and forget the obstacles to justice. Tell that to Jeremiah and Daniel, to Deborah and Judith for me.'' I am reminded of a comment by Sister Mary Lou Kownacki, who says of her prioress: ''When she articulates a point it's helpful to imagine a Roman candle that starts with a slow burn, quickly bursts into a series of sparks and then shoots into the sky, exploding into myriad colors.'' That's what is happening before my eyes as we sit in her study and discuss deterrence. She pulls a chart down from her bookshelf lined with treatises on monasticism, feminism, pacifism and oil wells (one dug on the convent property had a strike). ''This was drafted by Geier and Green for Christianity and Crisis, Dec. 13, 1982,'' she said. ''It is a typology of the present nuclear environment.'' She points to a page that consists of 121 dime-size squares, each filled with dots. Each dot represents three million tons of TNT, the amount of firepower used in all of World War II. The total number of dots, 6,000, represents the number of megatons existing in the world. She points to three encircled dots: ''These represent the fire power of one American Poseidon submarine, or the equivalent of three World War II's. It is capable of destroying the major and minor cities of Soviet Russia. We have 31 Poseidons.'' ''Geier and Green say that if you put a dime any place on this chart, you will have identified enough firepower to destroy the entire planet.'' She leans toward me so that there is no chance that her words might get lost in the space between us. ''Tell me,'' she asks, ''what will you do with the rest of your dimes?'' Although she cannot pinpoint what brought her to this calling, this conviction, the elements become apparent as we talk. She was a sensitive and bright child growing up in a world that had just experienced the Holocaust and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. She remembers being told when she was in fifth grade that if a bomb were dropped, there would be no escaping it. ''And then my teacher said, 'Isn't it lucky that we are the only ones who have the bomb?' And I remember thinking, 'No, because we dropped it.' To this day, whenever I hear that we will never use nuclear weapons, I always think: 'But we did, we did.' '' ''We can now eliminate a culture as easily as the Nazis exterminated the Jews,'' she comments. ''But this time I want there to be evidence that some Christians said no.'' Her Benedictine tradition demands a commitment to peace. ''It was Benedictines who provided sanctuary during medieval wars,'' she said. ''It is Benedictines whose most ancient motto was 'Pax.' '' She has come to realize, she says, ''that to be monastic is not to be cloistered but to have burning eyes and a steel voice. As a Benedictine I am compelled to face the nuclear issue.'' It's a nice image - a nun bringing the military complex to its knees. She departs for a news conference in town. The black community has asked various local leaders to attend the conference in support of a black woman lawyer whose appointment to the County Commission of Industrial Management has been stalled. All but Joan refuse. Everyone is terribly polite. The local N.A.A.C.P. representative assures the commission and the press that this is not a racial issue. Sister Joan, who has been growing increasingly agitated, suddenly jumps to her feet: ''Of course it's racial! And furthermore, it's sexist. The world is not white and the world is not male, and when institutions don't reflect the various perspectives of the communities they purport to represent, then they are institutionally racist and sexist.'' She is amazed by the standing ovation that begins and does not end. She later explains her outburst: ''I just can't stand pussyfooting.'' As she moves to leave, the audience parts to open a path, arms reach out to pat her on the shoulder. An elderly black woman steps forth, embraces her and says, ''You're some woman, Sister Joan. You are some woman!''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An Archbishop had ordered her to resign from the job because of her refusal to repudiate state-financed abortions. The Roman Catholic nun's religious order, the Sisters of Mercy, said last week she could keep the post despite orders by Detroit Archbishop Edmund Szoka to resign for failing to condemn state financing of abortions for welfare recipients. Archbishop Szoka said he would take the issue to the Vatican if she did not resign the job given her by Gov. James J. Blanchard. The vote of 28 to 9 to confirm the nun to head the state's largest agency came after an hour of emotional debate on the abortion issue.

REAGAN'S JAB AT RUSSIANS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/10/world/reagan-s-jab-at-russians-news-analysis.html,"President Reagan's denunciation of a nuclear freeze and of the Kremlin as the focus of evil in the world is viewed by some politicians as the keynote of a drive to induce Congress to approve a large rise in military spending and to deflect pressures for what Mr. Reagan sees as undesirable concessions to Moscow. Other politicians called his speech on Tuesday before a convention of Evangelical Christians in Orlando, Fla., ''a vintage Reagan performance,'' intended to mend fences with disgruntled right-wing supporters. Some said it might have a wider unintended impact. There are Democrats who fear that the President's polemics may harm the arms-control negotiations with the Soviet Union. Others, rankled by Mr. Reagan's attack on a nuclear freeze as ''a very dangerous fraud,'' said his comments would further polarize the national debate on arms issues. May Get People's Backs Up ''That speech is going to get people's backs up,'' said Senator Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat. And Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, another Democrat, commented: ''The President either does not understand what the American people are saying or he is deliberately misrepresenting it when he says the freeze is unilateral disarmament. To the degree that the speech will influence debate on these policies, it can only serve to polarize that debate further.'' Pursuing the offensive, the Pentagon has now issued a booklet asserting that the Soviet Union has not slowed its military buildup - despite some recent intelligence readings to the contrary -and is bent on achieving ''military superiority in all fields.'' This touched off a tart reaction in Moscow. Sentiment Against Arms Increase In Congress, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, sought to postpone committee work on the 1984 budget to give Mr. Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger more time to make their case for a 10 percent real increase in military spending, after inflation. But other Republicans objected, and the Budget Committee will start work next week, with sentiment running against accepting much more than half the proposed Pentagon increase. The tone of Mr. Reagan's Orlando speech may also have ramifications in Western Europe, where it may be seen as running counter to expectations that he might come forward with a new proposal in the Geneva talks on medium-range nuclear systems in Europe. Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo of Italy, who is visiting here, said he would urge Mr. Reagan in a meeting on Sunday to make a new arms offer. In Orlando, Mr. Reagan said he would ''do everything I can'' to persuade Moscow ''of our peaceful intent'' and desire for arms reduction. But his hard-line thrust marked a departure from other speeches, notably one to the American Legion on Feb. 22, signaling flexibility in the arms-control talks. A Persistent Theme in Office Mistrust toward Soviet motives and morality has been one of Mr. Reagan's persistent themes since taking office, though some advisers told him in recent months that polemical attacks only irked the Russians and intruded on the arms negotiations. Mr. Reagan's latest jabs were a throwback to 1980 campaign speeches and to comments reportedly made to staff members and visitors. In the context of the Evangelical convention, the jabs against Moscow matched the fire-and-brimstone tenor of his remarks on abortion, school prayer and the nuclear freeze. Nor was the shift in tone uncharacteristic. Mr. Reagan has proven to be a more complex figure than both his supporters and his critics had imagined. One trademark has been his oscillation between between toughness and pragmatic compromise, between dogmatic ideological speeches that echo his years as a missionary conservative and politically realistic pronouncements that bear the mark of careful deliberations within his Administration. Irritation at Catholic Bishops His denunciation of a nuclear freeze as ''the illusion of peace'' that would reward Moscow for its buildup, remove incentives for Soviet concessions at Geneva and ''divert us completely'' from arms reduction seemed as much a matter of pique at his opponents as a rallying cry for his supporters. His comments about opposition from within ''the church'' seemed to reflect irritation at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which plans a vote in May on a nuclear freeze. ''Simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly,'' Mr. Reagan said. More broadly, he was making the case for carrying on his military buildup in 1984 to enable his negotiators to bargain from strength. He said any domestic opposition undercutting this strategy was helpful to Moscow. In this context, some politicians said Soviet officials had grown as accustomed to American polemics as Americans had to Soviet criticism. But some said tough talk toward a new Kremlin leadership debating priorities might backfire by playing into the hands of Soviet hard-liners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Woman's Place Is Every Place,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/11/opinion/woman-s-place-is-every-place.html,"That men and women are different is a verity. That they live, or should live, in different ''places'' is a handy hypothesis, trotted out whenever the times, or an occasion, seem to demand it. National Women's History Week, which ends tomorrow, celebrates the search for the many places that have been women's over the centuries. In this country's hard first hundred years, for instance, male and female occupied the same sphere. But the Industrial Revolution brought the notion that home was less a part of society - described by John Todd in 1835 as ''a vast wilderness'' where men stood ''naked and alone surrounded by savages'' - than a retreat from it. In fiction if not always in fact, woman's place became the home, ''the sphere of woman's enjoyments,'' said a female contemporary of Mr. Todd, ''as well as of her duties.'' What place are women in today? A place where they make up 43 percent of the labor force. Where nearly two-thirds of all married women with children over 6 work. Where women head more than nine million families, one-third of them below the poverty line. It is a place where women have finally achieved the right to safe, legal abortion, only to see that right under constant attack by Congressmen, the President and, most lately, the new Secretary for Health and Human Services, Margaret Heckler. It is a place where the President, speaking this week of ''morality as playing a part in the subject of sex,'' spoke only of girls. It is a place where women constitute the majority of college undergraduates and will soon be voting in higher proportions than men. And where women were responsible for nearly three out of every five votes cast for Democrats in the 1982 elections - thereby making that party beholden and the Reagan Administration nervous. It is a place where it is still possible to read, as on this newspaper's Op-Ed page last week, that ''the two genders seldom come close to living the same lives ... nor do they value the same passions or plot the courses of their destinies against the same coordinates of space and time.'' Where, conversely, a recent study of college students revealed that males and females were starting to share the same goals. It is a place that embraces both that ''vast wilderness'' and the legendary retreat from it. It is, then, every place, and anybody who can't see that may simply be refusing to look hard at our world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A SENSE OF MISSION IN FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/nyregion/a-sense-of-mission-in-family-planning.html,"ONE day in the mid-60's, on a trip to Chile, Mary Lindsay paid a visit to a major hospital in Santiago. ''One-third of the beds were taken up with botched abortions,'' she said. ''That was probably the single thing that pushed me toward thinking I'd better push for this.'' By ''this,'' Mrs. Lindsay, who lives in Manhattan and in Laurel Hollow, is referring to family planning, a field in which she holds a variety of posts. In the last year, for example, she served as co-chairman of the 1982 fund drive of Planned Parenthood of New York City, a campaign that exceeded its goal of $3.1 million by $100,000. She is also president of the Family Planning Advocates, a statewide membership organization devoted to progressive family planning policies and composed of 90 member organizations as well as individual members. She is a past president and chairman of the board of Planned Parenthood of New York City. And she helped found Citizens for Family Planning, a political-action committee that lobbies in behalf of family planning. If the name Mary Lindsay sounds familiar, it should be explained that this Mary Lindsay is not the wife of the former Mayor of New York City, John V. Lindsay. But she is his sister-in-law, being the wife of George Lindsay, a lawyer with the New York City firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, who is the former Mayor's brother. ''I think I'm one of the rare people who came into Planned Parenthood because of my husband,'' Mrs. Lindsay said. George Lindsay is a former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and it was during a trip with him to an international family-planning meeting in Chile that Mrs. Lindsay made her pivotal visit to that hospital in Santiago. But it was not the visit alone that impelled her. ''I have a nurse's background,'' noted the Manhattan-born, Philadelphia-raised Mrs. Lindsay, who is a mother of four children. And as a nurse - she received an R.N. in 1945 from the Columbia University School of Nursing - she said she had ''seen too many women agonize over pregnancies they didn't want.'' ''Our very basic position,'' she said of the family planning movement, ''is the undercurrent of every single thing we do in planned parenthood: that a person's right to manage their own fertility is a human right and a freedom that should not be interfered with. I don't care whether you're talking about that in a global way or in a local way. That freedom, we feel, is worth fighting for, and that has been the basis of our fight for family planning.'' On the local front, she said, Planned Parenthood is at work in the South Bronx on a five-year program on teen-age pregnancy in collaboration with Bronx Lebanon Hospital. ''The inner city's most deprived areas breed the most children to children,'' she said. ''The cause is obvious. These are the young women who dropped out of school at an early age who have a very unstable family situation, who lived in poverty all their lives, who are usually children of parents who bore them when they were teenagers themselves. They have experienced abuse. These young women find themselves falling into an abyss. They have absolutely no agenda for their lives. They have no hope of being somebody, and so it's an escape to have a child.'' Around the country, according to the latest available figures, there are more than 213,000 births annually to girls 17 years old and under. Locally, there are more than 13,000 such pregnancies and more than 5,500 births. Planned Parenthood is trying to deal with the problem by reaching the teen-agers through young medical students - ''to alert them to a whole new type of adolescent medicine, to give them an opportunity to work with us to see if we can find some keys that we can punch that will work,'' Mrs. Lindsay said. ''If we can do that in the South Bronx, we can export that across the country to other areas.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE CONSIDERS BIRTH- DEFECTS REGISTRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/nyregion/state-considers-birth-defects-registry.html,"POSSIBLY nothing haunts a mother-to-be more than the fear that her baby will not be normal. That fear becomes a nightmarish reality for 2 to 3 percent of the 96,000 New Jersey women who give birth each year. Although some birth defects are as minor as an extra tab of skin or a small blemish, others involve major cosmetic flaws or physical or mental handicaps. In 1981, more than 200 newborns died of congenital defects, one-fourth of New Jersey's infant mortality. Legislators have unanimously approved a bill to set up a statewide registry to determine whether birth defects are statistically linked to such environmental factors as toxic waste sites, industrial chemicals or water pollution. The registry would be similar to one started for cancer in mid-1979. Sponsored by Senator Daniel J. Dalton, Democrat of Blackwood, the measure passed the Senate last November and the Assembly earlier this month. Governor Kean has not indicated whether he will sign the bill. (Last week, Senator Dalton recalled the legislation when he learned that, as a result of an administrative error, the Assembly had approved the bill without the amendments added by its Corrections, Health and Human Services Committee. The correct version is scheduled for a vote tomorrow and is expected to pass.) As amended, the measure would require the state's Department of Health to collect confidential data from health-care facilities and providers on birth defects detected in children up to a year old, in miscarried fetuses and in fetuses electively aborted after 15 weeks of gestation. The 15-week figure corresponds to the time that some pregnant women undergo amniocentesis, in which a sample of amniotic fluid is removed and analyzed for Down's Syndrome and other serious birth defects. Thus, pregnancies terminated after an amniocentesis had revealed a problem would be included in the registry. The Department of Health would set reporting criteria and procedures to insure strict confidentiality and compliance, but could not require anyone to take a physical examination. Senator Dalton said that he learned of the need for such a registry after a cluster of birth defects in Gloucester County, part of his district. Between January 1977 and August, 1982, 17 babies were born with neural tube defects. In this, spinal columns fail to close, leading to paralysis, retardation and sometimes death. Among those cases were five infants with anacephaly, a fatal condition in which there is a misshapen skull and virtually no brain tissue. Because no birth defects registry existed, investigators, to confirm the cases, had to review the records of every hospital used by Gloucester County residents. Only 14 families were found and, said Robert Smith, director of the county's Department of Health, the time-consuming research uncovered no common factors in the births. Another anacephalic baby has been born since. State Health Department statisticians say that New Jersey's birthdefect rate appears not to exceed the national averages. They acknowledge, however, that present reporting probably misses a significant number of cases. Senator Dalton and others contend the registry would correct that. ''We suspect that the state's heavy industrialization may contribute to a higher incidence of certain types of birth defects,'' Senator Dalton said. ''The registry will enable the Department of Health to detect any correlation between those birth defects and the environment.'' Dr. George Halpin, director of Parental and Child Health Services in the Department of Health, predicted that the registry could be started at little additional administrative cost. He noted that hospitals already reported birth defects to the state's Special Child Health Services, which replaced the old Crippled Children's Registry. Since 1930, that registry and its successor have tracked children with birth defects who needed publicly financed medical and educational services. Dr. Halpin said that statisticians began using the data only in the 1970's and found that they did not include late miscarriages, stillborns or babies who died in the first year. ''With the new registry, we can collect more-complete information, and the department will have more leverage with hospitals and physicians who do not comply with reporting procedures,'' said Charles Lawson, a public-health epidemiologist with the special child program. Dr. Halpin added that the new system also would enable his division to assess the need for special services and to see that families got ''good, comprehensive care, especially when finances are a problem.''  The proposed registry is supported by organizations concerned with birth defects. They include the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and the Human Genetics Association of New Jersey, an organization of individuals involved in genetic education, research and services. New Jersey Right-to-Life urged Senator Dalton to amend his bill to include elective abortions. Although the group originally wanted the registry to cover any electively aborted fetus regardless of gestational age, it accepted the 15-week limitation and now supports the measure, according to Rita Martin, the organization's legislative coordinator. The New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents, a statewide group that lobbies for parental rights, opposes the measure. John Tomicki, the associate executive coordinator, called the proposed registry ''nothing more than malevolent eugenics.'' ''It gives the Commissioner of Health too broad a power to determine what is a birth defect,'' said Mr. Tomicki, who added that his organization had 4,000 members and operated from a ''Biblical perspective.'' He also contended that the bill would violate the doctor-patient relationship by requiring disclosure of the child's name. ''We prefer that hospitals or clinics merely report statistics, not names, unless parental consent is given,'' he said. Dr. Elizabeth Feuer, a senior public-health physician in the Division of Epidemiology in the state's Department of Health, stressed that identifying families affected by birth defects was crucial to the usefulness of the registry. ''Suppose we do find a cluster of birth defects,'' she said. ''It would be very difficult to investigate its etiology if we couldn't contact patients.'' David Troast, chairman of the North Jersey chapter of the March of Dimes, views the registry as an ''essential first step'' in eliminating birth defects. ''With the information from this registry, special programs can be designed and implemented with the hope of improving the outcome of pregnancy,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DIOCESE ASSESSING 'COME HOME' CALL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/nyregion/diocese-assessing-come-home-call.html,"THE Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre's ''Come Home for Christmas'' campaign was, its sponsors said, a success in many ways. Yet its full effects, they say, may not be clear for months or years.  Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, director of the Office of Catechesis and Worship, suggested the campaign after reading about similar programs in New Orleans and Albany. The aim of the program was to invite inactive Catholics to ''come home'' to the Christmas liturgy as well as participate in dialogues with the church. In order to get in touch with Catholics not participating in church life, Bishop John R. McGann asked active Catholics to submit the names and addresses of friends and family members who might respond to an invitation. More than 11,000 names were submitted, and 375 people responded to newspaper advertisements. To each person, Bishop McGann sent a Christmas card inviting him to attend his parish's Christmas liturgy and ''re-membering'' sessions, two of which included a dialogue with the Bishop. Monsignor Maniscalco said the greeting was to express the Bishop's concern for these people ''with no moral judgment'' on their absence from the church. ''We tried not to make it an intrusion,'' he said. The carefully worded text also offered apologies if the card had been inadvertently sent to an active Catholic, as some were. The turning in of names of others apparently rankled many active Catholics, as well as a number of those whose names were submitted. ''I was insulted,'' one woman who received the invitation said, although she added that her anger was directed not at the diocese, but at the person who had anonymously submitted her name. The woman, who did not want her name published, said it bothered her to think ''I must be on a list somewhere.'' Both Bishop McGann and Monsignor Maniscalco took pains to state that no lists were kept and that the names had been used only for the Christmas program. ''I don't know how else you could address them,'' Bishop McGann said. He indicated that the approach seemed the only way to reach the inactive population effectively. He added that he had received a reply from one young woman who had written, ''Dear Bishop, Who blew the whistle?'' Monsignor Maniscalco said he had received five complaints about that aspect of the program, adding that the smaller the community, the more sensitive the recipients seemed. Displeasure with the method of reaching out may have also kept some from responding. Of the 11,000 people sent cards, 250 attended the first session with Bishop McGann, and 50 went to each of the 13 subsequent sessions; the second dialogue with the Bishop was Dec. 12, when a large snowstorm hit the Island. Those who attended the dialogue indicated they had stayed away from the church because of a few common issues, although they represented opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. For many, the main area of concern centered on divorce and remarriage, where they had found the church's position too conservative. For a smaller number, birth control and abortion were important questions. A surprising number of people, according to the Bishop and Monsignor Maniscalco, took issue with the church over what they saw as too liberal a trend since the Second Vatican Council. Some of the disaffected have become ''born again'' Christians, turning to religions with a more fundamentalist orientation. Other people, objecting to the use of the vernacular and similar modernizations in the liturgy, have subscribed to such traditionalist groups as the Ave Maria Church of Father Gommar de Pauw in Westbury. Another reason why some Catholics have slipped away, Monsignor Maniscalco suggested, is the mobility of our society, which prevents many people from putting down roots in a community or settling into a congregation. For others, he said, the reason might be ''laziness'' or their losing the fear of the spiritual consquences of missing Sunday mass. The fact that 300,000 out of 1.1 million Catholics on the Island are considered inactive shows that, for many, ''religion is not a high priority in their lives.'' he added. The largest group for whom names were submitted were young adults, although few of them attended the sessions. Monsignor Maniscalco said their absence highlighted the dearth of programs appealing to the group. Of the people invited to the sessions, those most likely to respond were in the 35-to-50 age group. Many have children being raised as Catholics and attending religious instruction and services, although their parents no longer go. For many who feel alienated because they have been divorced and remarried, the discussion groups on those topics were able to reconcile some of their differences. Members of the Diocesan Tribunal explained that the annulment process had become much more open, based on a deeper understanding of the ''psychological disposition'' needed for marriage. Conceding there was a wide gulf on some issues, Bishop McGann said: ''I'm sure we didn't answer satisfactorily all the questions that were raised. I think it was sensitizing for us to hear their concerns. If in our Sunday sermon we talk about the Holy Family as the ideal family unit, that doesn't speak to the 50 percent of families who are no longer intact.'' The diocese has distributed evaluation questionnaires to the parishes, and it will be reviewing the responses. Participants in the program felt it offered insights about the church as well as the feelings of those who ''came home.'' Patricia Megale, a coordinator of religious studies, assisted at a session. She said: ''There was a lot of reluctance among 'professional Catholics' '' -those who work for the church or are actively involved with the diocese -''at first to invite people back to the 'mess' we are now. We don't completely have our act together.'' ''We're the best we have,'' she said, ''an unfinished, sinful community, working on being better.'' She said it was valuable for those in the church to hear from those who had been away because ''we need to know what their pain has been - we need them to make us whole.'' Any follow-up to the campaign will be in the parishes, through discussion groups and other methods. Although no strong resurgence in attendance at masses was expected or has occurred, interest has been stirred. Some who were invited but did not return said the program had made them stop and think about religion again. The program's impact may only be evident ''way down the road,'' Mrs. Megale said. ''Its flowering may be in God's time, not in ours.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COLLEGE REPUBLICANS OPEN A DRIVE AGAINST STUDENT ACTIVIST GROUPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/us/college-republicans-open-a-drive-against-student-activist-groups.html,"The College Republican National Committee has started a campaign against a group of student organizations throughout the country that advocate such things as environmental and consumer protection and safety in the workplace. The organizations, which are known as public interest research groups and have also opposed nuclear power and supported the right to have abortions, were inspired by Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, and they continue to receive his encouragement. Jack Abramoff, national chairman of the College Republican National Committee, says the groups promote leftist political ideas and are ''instrumental in leading anti-Reagan and anti-free market forces on campuses.'' In a 50-page packet that went out in early February to college Republican chairmen in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the student groups are described as ''a major threat to democracy on American campuses'' and as ''unethical, undemocratic and unconstitutional.'' 'Total Smear,' Nader Says ''This is a total smear,'' Mr. Nader said. The groups ''are as ethical, as clean, as democratic and as selfless as any citizens' organization can be,'' he said. ''They are about as nonideological as you can get. They deal with fundamental issues of equity, justice, health and safety in the consumer and environmental areas. A lot of students who classify themselves as conservatives work in the groups.'' Mr. Nader also said the groups were not ''institutionally'' opposed to President Reagan but added that they opposed his position on toxic waste, consumer fraud and other issues. Mr. Abramoff said that before the college Republicans started their national effort last month, challenges of public interest research groups had already been begun on 37 campuses, including the University of Michigan, the University of Colorado, the State University of New York at Binghamton and Florida International University. He said he expected challenges to be opened on 10 other campuses in the next two weeks. Two Groups Facing Lawsuits Two lawsuits have been filed opposing public interest research groups, objecting to the way they are financed. One was filed by a student at Rutgers University who is a college Republican and a member of the Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative group. Another suit was filed last month by eight students from various campuses of the State University of New York, some of whom are college Republicans and some of whom are members of Young Americans for Freedom. The expense of pursuing both lawsuits is being borne by the Mid-Atlantic Legal Foundation, which is part of a network of legal offices called the National Legal Center for the Public Interest. James R. Richards, vice president of the center, said the network's purpose was to ''provide a balance against extremist environmentalist organizations such as the Sierra Club and consumeroriented groups such as the Nader organizations.'' Most of the public interest research groups are financed by funds that are automatically collected from students in college registration as activity fees and support other campus activities. In many cases students can demand refunds, and in a few cases they have a choice at registration time on whether any of their money goes to the public interest research groups. System Described as 'Unfair' Mr. Abramoff, a student at Georgetown University Law School, describes the system as ''mandatory funding'' and says it is unfair to students who do not share the views of those involved in the activist groups. Mr. Nader said the financing of all the 160 public interest chapters in 26 states was approved either by student petitions or referendums or by decisions of elected student governments. ''They are a major expression of democracy on campus,'' Mr. Nader said. ''Their legitimacy comes directly from the consent and support of the students.'' According to Mr. Nader, the largest public interest research group is in New York. It has a staff of 150 people, including lawyers, scientists, organizers, researchers and writers. It also has chapters on 19 campuses and an annual budget of $2.5 million. One-fourth of the budget comes from student contributions, an aide to Mr. Nader said. The rest comes from foundation grants and other contributions. First Groups Formed in 1971 The groups around the country are independent, nonprofit corporations, Mr. Nader said, that elect their own student boards, hire their own staffs and decide what social issues they will pursue. There is no national headquarters and no funds are provided by Nader organizations, he added. The thousands of students who work in the groups as volunteers do tasks ranging from making posters to lobbying state legislators, in some cases for college credit. The first of the groups were formed in 1971 at Oregon State University and the University of Minnesota. Thomas A. Walthen, director of the public interest research group in Colorado, which has units on three campuses, said the groups were ''meant to be a major educational program on campus with the resources to get students involved in a meaningful way in public policy.'' Mr. Abramoff said the College Republican National Committee received most of its $250,000 annual budget from the Republican National Committee, and described college Republicans as being ''on the conservative side of the Republican Party.'' Asked if the Republican National Committee approved of the college Republican's program, William I. Greener 3d, director of communications for the Republican National Committee, said, ''To the extent that they are trying to diminish the strength of groups opposed to the President, especially when those groups receive obligatory funds, that's something we generally support.'' In its information packet to state chairmen, the College Republican National Commitee urges its members to criticize public interest research groups in fliers and posters, to collect signatures on petitions calling for new referendums on financing and to appeal directly to campus trustees and administrators. In areas where new groups are being formed, the committee suggests that college Republicans call or write to school officials and ''hint'' that '' 'our lawyers are looking into this situation,' '' adding, ''No school wants to be involved in court litigation that may drag on for years.'' If that does not block the public interest research group, the national committee suggests that a new organization be formed with a name such as ''Students Against Mandatory Fee Abuse.'' 'Attack the Funding Policy' ''At this stage,'' the committee wrote, ''don't attack their political leanings but attack only the funding policy.'' It also urged college Republicans to get ''all groups riled up'' over the ''special treatment'' given to public interest research groups, saying that such treatment was ''not fair to everyone else who has to raise money the hard way.'' ''This way,'' the committee added, ''it doesn't look like an attack on the left by the right.'' Steve Baldwin, national projects director of the college Republicans, wrote in the information packet that a successful campaign against the public interest research groups would ''return literally millions of dollars to students' pockets.'' ''Plus,'' he said, ''it will mean that the organized left will not have students' money to lobby against President Reagan.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TO FIGHT TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/opinion/to-fight-teen-age-pregnancy.html,"Old ideas never die. Unlike old soldiers, they don't even fade away. It is in the service of an old idea that two Federal district judges have ruled against a regulation that Governmentfunded family-planning clinics notify parents of teenagers who obtain prescription contraceptives. In Manhattan, Judge Henry F. Werker based his ruling on an interpretation of what Congress intended under Title X of the Health Service Act, which encouraged, but did not make mandatory, family involvement in family-planning services for adolescents. In Washington, in a separate decision based entirely on Congressional intent, Judge Thomas A. Flannery also struck down the notification restrictions. But in 1981, Congress amended the Health Service act further in the family life amend- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Eunice Kennedy Shriver is executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, which focuses primarily ''on issues relating to mental retardation.'' ments (Title XX), in which Congress insisted on family involvement in the sexual decision-making of minor children. Accordingly, I think the judges' interpretations of Congressional intent are too narrow. In Title XX, Congress clearly recognized that the growing problem of adolescent pregnancy cannot be solved by the secret and wholesale distribution of contraceptives, but that services encouraged by the Government ''should promote the involvement of parents with their adolescent children.'' What could be more explicit an expression of intent than this? If Congress had wanted to create just another system for delivering contraceptives to adolescents, it would have put more millions into family planning under Title X. But it did not. Adolescent family life legislation obviously was intended to differentiate between services to teenagers and to adults, to help young people understand their sexuality, to encourage them to recognize the seriousness of starting a family, to teach responsibility and to underscore the need for communication and openness between parents and children. Conferring adult status on children 13, 14 and 15 years old by substituting professional intervention for family involvement has been a failure in such critical areas of adolescent conduct as drug and alcohol abuse. It has not worked and Congress did not intend to perpetuate it. For years, family-planning agencies have secretly handed out contraceptives, and the rate of adolescent pregnancy has not significantly declined. Tragically, it has increased among girls under 15, who most need parental involvement in learning to deal with awakening sexuality. Working in the field of adolescent pregnancy for more than a decade, I have spoken to hundreds of pregnant adolescents. The chief reason that teenagers become pregnant is not that they lack access to contraception, but, as one 15-year-old said: ''I'm pregnant because I want to be pregnant. I could have controlled it. I wanted a baby so I could love it and just make me feel good.'' These young women engage in sex not out of grand passion but because of emotional problems, school problems, peer pressure and trouble at home. What they need most is the support and encouragement of their families, churches, community institutions -not official sanction to keep their problems hidden from their families. In Title XX, communities were challenged to develop family-centered programs. In St. Paul, Minn., teenagers get the chance to care for infants and young children at a day-care program so that they can gain an appreciation of parental responsibilities. In demonstration programs in Albany, N.Y., Tacoma, Wash., Elkins, W. Va., and Dorchester, Mass., parents attend training sessions with their teenage sons and daughters. In adolescent pregnancy programs such as the one at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, research shows that when families become involved in their pregnant teenagers' lives, the young women are more likely to stay in school, remain off welfare, get a job, develop a more positive self-image and take better care of their babies, and that they are less likely to have an early repeat pregnancy. If this family support works with pregnant adolescents, why shouldn't it work for those not yet pregnant? I challenge those who interpret our laws and regulations to recognize that Congress clearly intended that families be involved in decisions concerning their children's health and safety. I challenge professional familyplanning agencies to reject the old idea that pregnancy can be treated only by private decisions for contraception, sterilization or abortion. I urge them to try developing new approaches to prevention of adolescent pregnancy based not on secrecy but on trust, openness, strengthening of families. With or without the regulations that the courts have temporarily suspended, let us concentrate on positive family values and build on them instead of alienating the family from the most difficult of life's decisions and trying to solve problems with a pill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPANISH CHIEF'S 100 DAYS: PEACE THE KEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/world/spanish-chief-s-100-days-peace-the-key.html,"Seven years of democracy have already spawned the tradition that 100 days in the life of a new administration is a time for taking stock. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who is called President here because he heads the executive branch of government, used the occasion of this anniversary today to put on his most conservative gray businessman's suit and face an auditorium full of reporters for his first news conference since assuming office. Mr. Gonzalez pointed to some general directions on such critical issues as the economy, Spain's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and his own involvement in the search for peace in Latin America. But mostly, as he answered the questions with ease and informal good humor, he projected the image of moderation and reasonableness. Good Contacts With Military Asked to sum up the achievements of the 100 days, the 41-year-old Prime Minister said it had now been shown that ''a Socialist Government can function in this country, without trauma and in peace.'' He neatly sidestepped a chance to eulogize Karl Marx on the 100th anniversary of his death. He said he had good contacts with the Spanish military. And he sought to smooth the fears of entrepreneurs by asserting that some parts of Rumasa, the huge holding company taken over by the Government last month, would be returned to the private sector. Mr. Gonzalez also backed away from setting a firm date for a public referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was a campaign pledge of the Socialists. The Government has frozen Spain's integration into the military structure of the alliance while reaffirming its political commitment to it. The Communist Party, which fared poorly in the October elections, has just began a campaign to try to force the referendum. Debate Called Inopportune It would be most ''inopportune'' for Spain to hold such a public debate that could ''contribute to East-West tensions,'' the Prime Minister said, and he appeared to rule it out for next year as well. He attacked ''certain sectors'' agitating for the referendum. Only once did the Prime Minister show a flicker of annoyance, when a reporter asked him to account for a ''mood of disillusionment'' in the country. ''How can people think we're going to resolve decades and decades of problems in 100 days?'' he shot back. ''Everyone wants a solution to everything right away.'' Up until last month, the first Socialists to come to power since before the 1936-39 civil war moved cautiously in bringing about the ''change'' that was their campaign slogan. The Cabinet was filled largely with young moderates, many with backgrounds in economics. They put together a program for modernizing, not radicalizing, Spain. The first moves were on issues that were to some extent hidden from public view, tackling corruption and social security fraud, trying to force bureaucrats to work full eight-hour days and limiting the holders of public office to one job. Dramatic Shifts Avoided At the same time the Government paid a certain homage to the military. One of the first public acts of Mr. Gonzalez was to visit the key armored division at Brunete outside Madrid for a wreathlaying ceremony. On foreign policy, the Government has avoided dramatic shifts. It has continued to press for membership in the European Economic Community. It laid the groundwork for negotiations with Britain over the future of Gibraltar by partly easing restrictions against the colony. After minor adjustments, it upheld a five-year treaty with Washington that grants the United States access to military bases in Spain and it appears to be following through on a major contract to purchase 84 F-18A fighter planes from the American company McDonnell-Douglas. Within the last month, the Government has taken a more assertive approach on a number of sensitive issues. One is abortion, which the administration is seeking to legalize in cases of rape, malformation of the fetus or danger to the mother's life. This has brought a strong campaign of opposition from the right and the Roman Catholic Church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETHICS COMMISSION'S LEGACY: ANSWERS TO PAINFUL QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/science/ethics-commission-s-legacy-answers-to-painful-questions.html,"A presidential commission that has been wrestling with some of the most troubling ethical issues confronting modern medicine will go out of business this month, leaving behind advice that is bound to be influential in helping citizens, doctors, scientists and political leaders find morally acceptable answers to painfully difficult questions. Were parents and doctors justified in refusing life-saving surgery to a baby who was doomed to mental retardation? Definitely not, according to a report that will soon be published, because mental retardation is not a severe enough handicap to warrant denial of life. Are cuts in Medicaid benefits to the poor an ethical way to contain health-care costs? Probably not, according to a forthcoming report that caused bitter dispute on the commission, with one Reagan appointee threatening to resign unless early drafts were changed and another accusing the commission's staff of writing a ''socialistic manifesto.'' Should genetic screening be used to help parents abort a fetus of unwanted sex? Generally not, according to a report issued last week. The practice would be ''morally suspect'' because it might encourage sexual prejudice, undermine the ''virtually unconditional acceptance'' essential for successful parenting and foster the ''very dubious notion'' that children are artifacts to be designed by their parents. Should genetic engineering be used to produce half human-half animal slaves to do people's bidding? That issue raises important questions about what characteristics are uniquely human, the commission said last year, but fortunately there is time to study the problem because the ability to create such slaves ''will not be available in the foreseeable future.'' How much should a doctor tell mortally ill patients about their condition? A lot more than they usually do, according to a report issued last year. Surveys conducted for the commission found that physicians are often unwilling to be candid, but that sick patients almost universally desire all available information on their condition and treatment. The commission urged better communication by doctors so that patients can participate in making decisions about their own health care. Such has been the scope of issues confronted by a small group of commissioners and staff who operate under the mouth-filling title of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission was created by Congress in 1978 to extend the work of a previous commission that had dealt primarily with protecting people who serve as experimental subjects for biomedical and behavioral research. The original 11 commissioners were appointed by President Carter and the group started work in January 1980. The bulk of its work has been carried out by a small full-time staff of about a dozen professionals, including lawyers, sociologists, ethicists, doctors and policy experts, backed by additional support and research staff members, who operate from offices at 2000 K Street N.W. in the nation's capital. The driving force, according to staff members and outside observers, has been Alexander M. Capron, a law professor who left the University of Pennsylvania to become the commission's executive director and who will now become a professor of law, ethics and public policy at the Georgetown University Law Center here. The commission itself consists of 11 members, appointed by the President, who meet once a month to direct and discuss the staff's work. By statute, the commissioners are supposed to be distinguished in such fields as research, medical practice, ethics, theology, humanities and the law, among other relevant professions. The chairman throughout has been Morris B. Abram, a New York City lawyer who has been president of Brandeis University and of the American Jewish Committee. The composition of the commission has changed radically over the last few years. The original Carter appointees were weighted heavily with academic experts, women and members of minority groups. The subsequent Reagan appointees, who now dominate the commission, are largely white male doctors over the age of 50. Held 28 Public Meetings In carrying out its work, the commission held 28 public meetings, heard testimony from more than 300 witnesses, sponsored scholarly studies, sought advice from panels of experts and pored over pertinent reading material, spending roughly $4 million in the process. It produced 11 substantive reports in all. The commission strove hard for consensus and largely succeeded. Only one report, dealing with access to health services, carries a dissenting view. The rest were approved unanimously. But the price of consensus was occasional timidity. The commission deliberately ducked the abortion issue lest it engulf the group in controversy. And the report on access to health services was revised again and again after the fiscally conservative Reagan appointees clashed with the largely liberal staff. The commission's most widely acclaimed and influential report so far has been its first: ''Defining Death.'' The report urged the law to recognize new criteria for establishing that a person has died, beyond the traditional standard that heart and lung functions have stopped permanently. The issue arose because medical advances allow doctors to keep the heart and lungs functioning even in patients who have irretrievably lost the capacity to breathe spontaneously. If these patients were considered ''alive,'' then turning off their respirators or removing a vital organ for transplantation to another patient might be deemed murder. Thus the commission recommended that death be defined by an additional standard: irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain. By this definition, in the celebrated New Jersey case, Karen Ann Quinlan would be declared alive because, although permanently unconscious, she has not lost all brain functions. About half the states already had some form of brain-death statute and various professional groups and scholars, including Mr. Capron himself, had proposed model laws. But the commission's contribution was to develop a new model statute in cooperation with the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and to set forth an extended explanation of its purposes, thus ending the confusion caused by a multitude of competing proposals. About a dozen states have already adopted the new statute. And a separate set of guidelines for doctors, drawn up by medical consultants to the commission, was declared ''a landmark document'' by an editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association. But this early success may be less significant in the long run, according to Mr. Capron, than the potential impact of two other reports that have not yet received wide distribution. Anxiety Over Gene-Splicing The first, titled ''Splicing Life,'' deals with issues raised by genetic engineering research. It was prompted by concerns expressed by leading Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant organizations and was presented at a Congressional hearing in November. The commission found that much of the anxiety over gene splicing -such as the possibility that genetic engineering might be used ''to remake human beings, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster'' - was ''exaggerated.'' But it called for the creation of an overseeing group drawn from a variety of backgrounds to keep a wary eye on the fast-changing technologies. Some critics charge that the commission's gene-splicing report evaded a responsibility to frame ethical rules for that distant day when scientists will be in a position to alter the very nature of man; others consider the commission's call for oversight a courageous stand in opposition to scientists who fear that overseeing groups will needlessly restrict the advance of research. The second potentially significant report, ''Deciding to Forgo Life-Sustaining Treatment,'' is due to be issued later this month. More than 1,000 people have already requested copies, and parts of the draft have already been incorporated in some medical and nursing school curriculums. Issues Examined by Panel The commission's overall contribution is impossible to assess at this point because few of its reports have yet been widely circulated. The panel's subjects have included, among others, the privacy of medical information, informed consent, compensation for injured research subjects, handling of reports of fraud or misconduct and protection for ''whistleblowers'' who reveal improper activities. Comments by staff members and by outside observers suggest that the panel has done little or nothing intellectually new but that it has performed a valuable service in bringing together ideas and publishing consensus views. Efforts were made at the end of the last Congress to extend the commission's life so that it could tackle a whole new batch of ethical issues in medicine and research, but the attempt was abandoned. However, key legislators are now talking of introducing bills to establish some kind of followup group, perhaps to watch over genetic engineering or to review an even broader range of ethical problems. The issues raised by biomedical advances, they say, are not going to disappear just because the commission does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The O.M.B. Bomb-Throwers,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/opinion/the-omb-bomb-throwers.html,"Several weeks ago, the Office of Management and Budget recklessly tossed a grenade at Washington's left-wing lobbyists. But the explosion burned many of the Administration's best friends as well, and touched off an outraged counterattack that left the O.M.B. in full retreat and the White House with embarrassing questions: Who authorized this nonsense, and why? The original idea was to restrict ''political advocacy'' by groups that receive Federal funds. If Washington pays for an exhibition by, say, the National Center for Basket-Weaving, the group may charge the Government for a portion of salaries and overhead as well as the direct costs of the show. But what if the head of the center spends a lot of time in Washington talking up basket-weaving and hustling more Federal grants? Why should taxpayers have to give general support to his lobbying? The issue obviously becomes more pointed when the activity in question is abortion or welfare rights. That's why trying to ''defund the left'' has for years been part of the far right's agenda. The Reagan budget office proposed a radical form of defunding: prohibiting any reimbursement for overhead if more than a small part of it supports lobbying, or for salaries of people who engage in lobbying, even on their own time. The proposed rules defined political advocacy with oceanic breadth. They included efforts to ''affect the opinions of the general public'' and ''communications with'' state and local as well as Federal officials. Under such rules, the basket-weavers would apparently not even be able to go before a zoning board without risking Federal support. What O.M.B. evidently failed to grasp was that so to defund the left would inevitably defund everyone else too: trade associations, service groups, defense contractors. Once the implications sank in, a coalition of groups as diverse as the Girl Scouts and the National Association of Manufacturers rose up in fury. A humiliated O.M.B. withdrew the rules, at least for now. That may quiet the flap, but not questions about judgment. What possible case could be made for the initiative? O.M.B. refers to a Government Accounting Office report that found some family planning clinics to have used small amounts of grant money for lobbying. The agency also recounts recent defense contracting scandals. But that doesn't document a crisis or make clear the need for action. In fact, Congress already accepts some publicly supported lobbying. Groups supported by tax-exempt contributions may engage in limited advocacy. Attempting to defund such activity down to the last penny goes so far as to raise serious First Amendment issues. O.M.B. had no business trying to use its rule-making authority to impose so radical a policy. It's hard to escape the conclusion that the bomb-throwing responded more to far-right ideology than to a generally recognized problem. The rules have been withdrawn but the questions remain: Who in the White House imagined this could be sensible public policy? Why?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COOKE: THE QUIET LEADER OF NEW YORK'S CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/17/nyregion/cooke-the-quiet-leader-of-new-york-s-catholics.html,"Only hours after he became Archbishop of New York in 1968, Terence Cardinal Cooke was attending a church reception in his honor when news came that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been slain. The tragedy in Memphis thus became the focus of his first day as the leader of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Now, nearly 15 years later, and with a certain diffidence, the Cardinal continues to find himself at the behest of the wider world, as the city's Irish-American community is divided over the selection of a supporter of the Irish Republican Army as grand marshal of today's St. Patrick's Day Parade. His associates say that, by background and temperament, the Cardinal, who turned 62 years old March 1, would rather concentrate on local church issues than plunge into national or world affairs. When in Rome, he longs to get back to New York. In the company of other bishops from the United States, according to those who have seen him, he sometimes seems to be less effective as a leader. A Cheery Outlook The Cardinal prefers to work quietly behind the scenes, shaping policies over a long time and allowing considerable discussion among various church groups, according to associates. He works prodigiously, listens carefully, follows Vatican guidelines scrupulously and retains a cheery outlook. His associates say he wants to believe the best about people. ''He wants to find good people to work with,'' an official said, ''rather than take on the bad guys.'' ''He doesn't like to admit the existence of problems,'' said Msgr. Florence D. Cohalan, author of a history of the archdiocese that will soon be published. ''He's the most ebullient man you'd meet.'' Some church leaders say that the Cardinal dislikes confrontation, and that his desire to find amicable solutions through lengthy consultations sometimes masks a quality of indecisiveness. Efforts to Unify Church Among the 1.8 million Catholics in the archdiocese, he has been widely lauded for his efforts to unify a church still in the throes of the major changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council. The archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties, has undergone dramatic shifts during the last 15 years. The majority of its constituents now live in the suburbs, the number of Hispanic Catholics has steadily risen and the number of priests has dramatically declined. Those close to him say he is most at home as an administrator. ''He loves annual reports,'' said one of several officials who asked that their names not be used. ''He can sit with a 70-page memo on how to rescue the hospitals and master it. He has a terrific memory for such things.'' The Cardinal has fully engrossed himself in the task of administering the archdiocese, associates say. Last year, according to one aide, he attended 200 board meetings of organizations sponsored by the archdiocese, sometimes rushing from one to another. As some prelates have increasingly addressed such national and global problems as poverty, nuclear arms and abortion, Cardinal Cooke, too, has been pressed to expand his involvement. Because of his Irish heritage and the large number of Irish-Catholic New Yorkers, the problems of Northern Ireland have never been far away, although until now he has managed to stay above the fray. Meanwhile, he has led the American Catholic Church hierarchy in its fight against legalized abortion. And on nuclear-arms issues, he has been a conservative voice who has argued that nuclear deterrence can be ''tolerated'' as a step toward meaningful negotiations. Some fellow bishops privately believe that he should be removed as head of the New York region of the National Conference of Catholic bishops. They say a new leadership would be able to develop a stronger role for the region in setting a national agenda for the bishops. Last November, in a closed-door meeting, a group of bishops within the New York region voted on his removal. The Cardinal prevailed, 13 to 12. He has approached the problem of the St. Patrick's Day Parade in a manner that tells much about his style of leadership. Faced with a grand marshal who openly supports the Irish Republican Army, Michael Flannery, the Cardinal issued a statement denouncing I.R.A. violence and urging his divided flock to seek harmony. At the same time, however, he refrained from personal criticism of the parade committee's choice and did not say whether he would review the parade from the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, as he usually does. In trying to steer a balanced course, church officials say, the Cardinal was trying to keep divisions from deepening while tacitly ackowledging that he is far less able to determine the outcome of such a situation than were some of his predecessors. Some church officials point out that the day of the ''powerhouse,'' as the chancery was once called, is over. ''If there was really a time when a fiat was acceptable,'' said Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, the vicar general of the archdiocese, ''that time is gone.'' Similar Case in 1972 Seldom has the Cardinal been drawn into such a heated public debate. Aides say that he was caught largely unaware by the parade committee's choice, and that he was angered at having been put in what he considered an untenable position. He was forced to make a statement and risk increasing the dissension. The Cardinal faced a similar showdown in 1972, when antiabortion groups criticized him him for inviting Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the annual Alfred E. Smith dinner after the Governor had vetoed a bill that would have repealed the state'e liberalized abortion law. Cardinal Cooke explained that ''public officials have always been invited to it, impartially across political lines.'' Terence James Cooke was born on Manhattan's Upper West Side and grew up in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx. His father, Michael, and his mother, Margaret, were from County Galway in Ireland. In the United States, His father worked first as a chauffeur and then in construction. The child was baptised in Corpus Christi Church on West 121st Street, and he attended the archdiocesan seminary, St. Joseph's, in Yonkers. Master's in Social Work He went on to earn a master's degree in social work from Catholic University in Washington, and taught at the Fordham University School of Social Work before beginning 11 years of service under Francis Cardinal Spellman, first as secretary, then chancellor and auxiliary bishop. He regularly dined with his mentor and was chosen to become New York's seventh Archbishop after Cardinal Spellman's death. Cardinal Cooke has declined requests to be interviewed. By nature, the Cardinal is a manager rather than a philosopher. Though many detailed statements have been issued under his name, he is not a stirring speach maker. From early morning to late at night, he focuses on the details that keep the archdiocese in running order. ''The Cardinal can do many of the routine things very well,'' said Monsignor Cohalan. ''He was on every rung of the ladder himself. When you bring him a problem, he has such a phenomenal memory that his mind goes back to when he was in your job.'' Compromise With Koch On a number of occasions, the Cardinal's methods have borne results. For example, in the early days of Mayor Koch's first term, the two men met to discuss some proposals for cutting the city's reimbursements to church hospitals and treatment centers. The Cardinal reportedly asked if the city really could do without the church's care facilities and pointed out that cuts below a certain level would force the archdiocese to close many of its institutions. Mayor Koch agreed that some of the proposals would indeed be unwise, and some of the proposals were revised. The Cardinal has impressed many Catholics with his sensitivity to the changes within the archdiocese. They give him credit for allowing parishes to initiate their own programs, restoring the broad range of archdiocesan institutions, focusing energy on the poor and reaching out to scores of people with a touch of pastoral concern. His penchant for detail has served the Cardinal well in his drive to keep the church's schools, hospitals and other service institutions financially solvent. One innovation, the Inner City Scholarship Fund, allots over $1 million for the education of poor children, and another, the inter-parish finance program, allows wealthier parishes to contribute to parishes that are unable to support themselves. Social Unrest of 60's The Rev. Phillip Murnion, an archdiocesan parish researcher, said the Cardinal had held things together as the social turbulence of the late 1960's shook the society as well as the church. ''He managed to provide a context within which lots of viewpoints could be at home,'' Father Murnion said. At the same time, Father Murnion said, many Catholics in the archdiocese ''lack a sense of solidarity around some collective mission.'' Among the challenges, he said, was to develop closer coordination between the chancery and the parishes. Others within the church would like to see bolder initiatives from the top. ''I really don't think the New York Archdiocese is nearly as impressively active as it should be,'' a chancery official said. ''It lacks charismatic leadership. He has created a highly organized, complicated bureaucracy, and he is not the kind of a person who is able to transcend that.'' The desire by some for a stronger voice is offset by the apparently deep reservoir of appreciation for those qualities that the Cardinal most easily exhibits. 'Good Religious Leader' ''A lot of priests comment about his being a good religious leader,'' said the Rev. John Foley, chairman of the Archdiocesan senate of Clergy. ''He gives the image of a holy man and gives a lot of time to people's opinions. People can disagree with him and his attitude is to give equal play to that and not to put them down.'' The decline of the church as a force in an increasingly secular culture during this century has been noted by many social scientists. The Cardinal's associates say that he has acutely felt the effects of the shift to what one priest called ''a world less friendly to the church,'' and that he will continue to try to explain Catholic views. But he is primarily an ''inside man,'' the priest continued. ''He is no swinger. He might like to go to a ball game or to an opera, but that just wouldn't be him.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expelling the Messenger,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/19/opinion/expelling-the-messenger.html,"Until recently, Steven Mosher was considered a brilliant student at Stanford University, where he was completing a doctoral dissertation in anthropology. His subject: a rural commune in China. Living among villagers, he found that China's own laws were being violated by coerced abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy. By publishing his alarm, Mr. Mosher made the wrong kind of waves in a bitter sea, and Stanford has now expelled him for allegedly illegal and unethical conduct. It is a tangled and touchy matter, involving the 34-year-old scholar's personal life, academic access to China and the ethics of anthropology. Yet by the available evidence, Stanford overreacted for what may have been unworthy political reasons. The truth of Mr. Mosher's account seems not at issue, nor his competence as a linguist. His judgment is something else. Instead of publishing first in an American scholarly journal, Mr. Mosher magnified Peking's wrath by publishing his expose in Chinese, with photographs, in a Taiwanese weekly. Giving a propaganda gift to a blood enemy is a poor way to help endangered villagers - or to promote Sino-American exchange programs. Stanford may thus have had grounds for cen-sure. But it was apparently swayed by more personal charges, made against Mr. Mosher in Peking after he published the article in 1981. He was accused of illegally bringing a van to the village, bribing informants and smuggling out coins - charges that have a suspicious smell to any foreigner who has attempted free research in a police state. So what really aroused the university? Stanford isn't saying. His dismissal was urged in a 47-page report of three faculty members, which his department declines to make public; it contends that would injure innocent third parties. Mr. Mosher won't publish it either because he contends he would be disseminating slanders against himself - from a bitter former spouse. She is of Chinese origin and is now in China, with relatives in the village where he studied. Still, here are a few realities. The Peking regime has been at pains to discredit Mr. Mosher. His former wife is plainly subject to its pressure. And so are all scholars who yearn for continued access to China. Unless we lack essential facts, we conclude that Mr. Mosher deserved better. It would have been salutary if academic ranks had instead closed against a tyranny that aims to hide the truth and to impose its standards on a free university.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/21/us/briefing-046502.html,"Stockman's Return David A. Stockman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, almost went into full eclipse 16 months ago when a magazine article revealed him as unduly candid about the Administration's economic policies. In recent weeks, however, the White House press corps has been treated to an occasional glimpse of the budget director in action, indicating that his exile, if not his penance, is over. When President Reagan visited the briefing room last week for a personal attack on the proposed Democratic budget, Mr. Stockman was at his side and took all questions after the President had left. The budget director had called the Democratic plan ''a political document,'' and a reporter inquired: ''Have you ever submitted a political budget?'' ''No,'' Mr. Stockman snapped, ''absolutely not.'' The room, which held Administration aides as well as reporters, dissolved in a hoot of laughter. The rehabilitated budget director allowed himself one brief smirk, then sternly moved on to the next question. Budgeting for the Primaries The vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Lee Ann Elliott, told a Senate hearing last week that the agency was assuming, for budgetary purposes, that 10 Presidential candidates would qualify for matching funds in the 1984 primary season. Since there are only seven or eight Democratic contenders in the potential field, this would mean, for political purposes, that there would be two or three Republican candidates, either President Reagan and a challenger or two, or a two- or three-way contest to succeed him. In fact, the commission was not trying to predict that Mr. Reagan would not run again or would be opposed if he did. It was merely seeking to justify its request for $10.3 million for the fiscal year 1984 and had to make some estimate of campaign activity in order to project costs. In 1980, when the Republican nomination was open and President Carter was challenged on the Democratic side, 10 candidates received Federal primary subsidies. Abortion PAC Assignment Mary Crisp, whose support of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution cost her the co-chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, has taken a new assignment, heading the political action committee of the National Abortion Rights Action League. The group is already gearing up for the 1984 Congressional and state legislative elections, raising money and organizing logistic support for candidates it favors. In 1982, the group contributed more than $430,000 to campaigns and helped elect eight of the 12 Senate candidates it endorsed, 73 of 100 House candidates and 30 of 38 legislative candidates. Officials of the league say they have not prepared any ''hit list'' of lawmakers they will attempt to defeat next time out, but concede there may be some ''attractive'' targets, such as Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who has pressed, thus far unsuccessfully, for a Constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion. Back on the Court Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is a restless man. After he was hit below the eye by an opponent's squash racket 10 days ago, a blow that did some bone damage, doctors told him he could not play the game for six or seven weeks. Mr. Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, heard that Dick Young, a trainer for the Washington Capitals hockey team, had devised a protective mask for one of his players with similar injuries. On call, Mr. Young provided a hockey helmet with a transparent plastic visor bolted to the front, and the Senator was back on the squash courts Thursday, only a week after the accident. For his return to combat, however, he chose to play Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island rather than Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, whose racket it was that had crossed Mr. Specter's cheekbone. Marking the T.V.A.'s 50th When you decide to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a Congressional milestone with contemporary testimony, your speakers tend to be a little long in the tooth. Tuesday on Capitol Hill, at the formal observance of the enactment of legislation establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of the headliners will be Senator Jennings Randolph, the 81-year-old West Virginia Democrat who is the only person still in Congress who voted on the original bill. Also expected are the deans of the T.V.A. delegation, Senator John C. Stennis, 81, and Representative Jamie L.

WASHINGTON; WHAT'S GOING ON?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/23/opinion/washington-what-s-going-on.html,"The Center for Defense Information is a think tank in Washington that keeps a box score on the wars, rebellions, and other violent uprisings going on in the world. Its latest report reminds us of some things we're inclined to forget: * In the last three years, six new wars have started while only two have ended - with over four million people engaged in combat. * Forty-five of the world's 164 nations are involved in these wars and even the C.D.I. can merely estimate that the number of people killed ranges from one million to five million. * About 500,000 foreign combat troops are involved. There are ten conflicts in the Middle East/Persian Gulf, ten more in Asia and Africa, seven in Latin America, and three in Europe. Five are conventional wars and 35 are internal guerrilla struggles. * The United States and the Soviet Union and its satellites are the major suppliers of military arms to 13 nations now at war, and in l981, the 45 nations involved in 40 conficts spent over $528 billion on their armed forces. These, of course, are only rough estimates, and cannot take into account the suffering of families or the loss of property, but they may remind us of the madness and cost of violence in a world where half the human race is going to bed hungry every night. We need to be reminded. The facts being debated now in Washington are important: How much for missiles, how much for El Salvador, how much for education and unemployment relief and food-stamps? It's a hard call for the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate. Secretary of Defense Weinberger tosses around not billions but trillions for the Pentagon, and President Reagan delivers sermons about the importance of religion and prayer in the schools. All this is worth debating. But very little is added to this debate about what's going on in these wars and rebellions, what can be done to get at the causes of these conflicts - except to vote more money for more military weapons. As the Center for Defense Information points out, over 50,000 Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in December of 1979; over 10,000 Libyan troops intervened in the civil war in Chad in December of 1980; around 100,000 Israeli troops went into Lebanon in June, 1982, and the cost in human life there and elsewhere is staggering. According to the Center for Defense Information, between one million and four million have died in Cambodia since 1970. In East Timor, it has been 100,000 to 250,000 since 1975. In Afghanistan, 100,000 since 1978. In the conflict between Iran and Iraq, 80,000 to 100,000 since 1980. In Lebanon, nobody knows. And this, of course, is not all. In past centuries, we had religious wars between believers in conflicting faiths; now we have ''religious'' wars between people who believe more in fighting than anything else. See Ireland, the Indian subcontinent, etc. Obviously, the United States Government cannot be expected to grapple with all these human and political tangles all over the world - it's having a tough enough time dealing with them at home - but when you look at the spread of nuclear knowledge, the outbreaks of terrorism, rebellion and war, you have to think more about the causes of wars, rather than how to fight them or survive them, the issues that tend to preoccupy the debate here now. There is general agreement in Washington these days about the ''interdependence'' of the world, and endless talk about economics and statistics and the world balance of trade, and what to do about the consequences of world turmoil but very little about the causes of that turmoil. President Reagan talks a great deal about the gross national product and about religion, but very little about the sanctity of individual life - except when he's arguing against abortion. ''We are,'' said Archibald MacLeish, ''the best informed people on earth. We are deluged with facts, but we have lost or are losing our human ability to feel them . . . We know with the head now, by the facts, by the abstractions. We seem unable to know, as Shakespeare knew, who made King Lear cry out to blinded Gloucester on the heath: 'You see how this world goes' and Gloucester answers: 'I see it feelingly.' ''Why we are thus impotent,'' MacLeish added, ''I do not know. I know only that this impotence exists and that it is dangerous: increasingly dangerous.'' This apparently is what also troubles the people at the Center for Defense Information. They monitor the facts of contemporary wars because they think we don't know the facts, let alone feel them, and they may be right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four births at Madison General and two others at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals prompted an outcry. The babies all died within hours. Since the last live birth, the hospital has not performed abortions after 18 weeks' gestation unless the pregnancy threatened the woman's health. ''We might go to setting a specific gestational age of 23, 24, 25 or 26 weeks,'' Mr. Warner said. ''We might continue to do it if there was a threat to the mother,'' but not on the basis of genetic defects. ''No decision has really been made,'' he said.

After a vote of 3 to 0, the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee sent the proposal to the full committee. The amendment would say, ''A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution.'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said legal experts on both sides of the abortion issue believed this language would overturn the Supreme Court's landmark decision in 1973 legalizing abortion nationwide. Senator Hatch said he expected the Judiciary Committee to consider the proposal sometime after Easter. He said he had a commitment from the Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, to bring the issue to the Senate floor before the end of spring. The proposed amendment approved by the subcommittee was an revised version of Senator Hatch's original proposal. The approved version dropped language stating that when a state law was more restrictive than a conflicting Federal law on abortion, the state law would prevail. Senator Hatch said that dropping the language did not prevent states from outlawing abortions but might make the proposal more acceptable to lawmakers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was, he explained, about to head home to London empty-handed, having failed to land a big contract because the product his company made did not meet the standards of reliability insisted upon by a potential Japanese client. He ordered a second brandy and savored it in silence. Then he jumped off his bar stool abruptly and, just before disappearing into the night, said loudly to no one in particular: ''They are so damned efficient, these people, it's bloody frightening.'' The frustrated Briton was voicing a sentiment shared by most of the world's non-Japanese population: that the Japanese are incurable workaholics who uncomplainingly accept constraints that subordinate their personal interests to the achievement of collective purposes. There is one country, however, in which this view is often dismissed as obsolete - or at least obsolescent. That country, somewhat ironically, is Japan itself. ''The kind of society we have had up till now cannot endure,'' said Yoshiya Ariyoshi, one of the elder statesmen of the Japanese shipping business, shortly before his death last year. ''Our youngsters nowadays are born with silver spoons in their mouths and, as a result, Japanese industry is doomed to be Americanized.'' A professor at Kyoto University put the point even more succinctly: ''We follow you Americans with a lag of about 10 years in all things - including your most counterproductive social attitudes and practices.'' The fact is that Japanese society is changing extraordinarily quickly. Arrests for drug abuse increased 20-fold between 1970 and 1980, and though the crime rate in the country has actually decreased in recent years, juvenile crime rose by 48 percent between 1978 and 1979. Women, once the solid foundation of Japanese homelife, are entering the work force in great numbers - more than half of all women over the age of 15 hold jobs, and 57 percent of all working women are married. In addition, the movement of women into the workaday world is significantly altering child-rearing practices - as of 1980, approximately one-fifth of all Japanese children of 6 and younger were attending day-care centers, and the percentages are growing. Finally, the postwar urbanization of Japan means that 87 percent of the population now lives in cities - and most inhabit tiny apartments too small to provide any privacy at all, let alone the calm sanctuary that the Japanese home has symbolized for centuries. Many of these changes reflect the emergence of attitudes and behavior patterns long familiar in the West - but new to Japan. And all are having an impact on what most Westerners think of as immutable Japanese social and economic practices. Perhaps the most significant of the changes confronting Japan is the transformation of the status of women, because it affects so many different aspects of Japanese life. Most Westerners believe that the Japanese male is lord of all he surveys. In fact, that has not been the case for a long time. Even before World War II, when they had almost no legal rights at all, Japanese wives were not the powerless, purely decorative creatures of legend. I first learned the Japanese phrase for henpecked - kaka denka - in the 1940's, when a Japanese friend applied it to his country's dreaded military leader, Gen. Hideki Tojo. To be sure, a Japanese husband is rarely visibly henpecked. But often, he spends so little time at home that he is essentially a nocturnal boarder in his own house. Partly for that reason, the typical Japanese household is a rather thinly disguised matriarchy. In the majority of Japanese families, the husband turns over his entire salary to his wife, who then doles out to him a daily allowance - usually a rather modest one - for cigarettes, drinks and sundries. And in most Japanese homes, it is the wife who decides such matters as where the family will live, what car it will buy and what schools the children will attend. (In one 1979 survey, 41 percent of the men polled admitted they left the education and disciplining of their children entirely to their wives.) But now all that is changing. To a great extent, the fact that so many women are joining the work force simply reflects new economic realities. Japanese have become avid consumers: As of 1981, for example, there were 1.4 color television sets in use in Japan for each man, woman and child in the country. (In the United States, there are only .3 color sets per household.) And many Japanese families now count among their ''necessities'' automatic rice cookers, money-guzzling automobiles and expensive vacations. But it is not just the appetite for material possessions that has driven so many married women in Japan to find jobs. Though many Japanese men will heatedly deny it, their country today is in the midst of a kind of underground feminist revolution. Among younger women who have been to college, aspirations for significant achievement outside the home are increasingly common and aggressively pursued. And in some degree at least, this attitude on the part of the educated elite has been transmitted to the rest of the female population. In the early 1970's, polls showed that 80 percent of Japanese women believed that a husband should work and a wife should take care of the home. By 1979, however, only 36 percent of them still accepted that proposition and, even more significantly, some 60 percent of the female population had come to believe that women with the desire and ability should be allowed to enter fields previously reserved for men. As in most other countries, the majority of working women in Japan occupy lower-level jobs and are relatively poorly paid. Some Japanese companies that freely employ young unmarried women deliberately ease out those who are still on the job at 27 or 28, and still others simply decline to hire women for career-track positions in the first place. Yet despite all this, career prospects for Japanese women are steadily improving. In recent years, largely because a declining birthrate has created a shortage of new male entrants into the labor force, there has been a sizable influx of women into the highly technical field of computer programming. Some of the most prestigious Japanese Government agencies now routinely include at least a few women when they hire recent university graduates earmarked for the upper reaches of the bureaucracy. And a growing number of women in their 30's and 40's now hold influential positions in retailing and the service industries - a matter of particular significance since these are among the fastest-growing sectors of the Japanese economy. In their struggle for equality, Japan's feminists have for the most part scrupulously avoided the kind of hard-nosed political pressure and confrontational rhetoric that have characterized the women's movement in the United States. Their methods reflect a difference in the nature of society in Japan and the United States. ''If you want to change the social structure in Western culture,'' explains Asahi Shimbun's Mitsuko Shimomura, the first woman correspondent ever stationed abroad by a Japanese newspaper, ''you first have to fight - to challenge the system. But in our culture, once you start to fight, that's the end; you have lost the game. In Japan, you have to try to do everything without big friction and to change the consensus in quiet, even tricky ways.'' And there is, in fact, ample evidence that in their quiet and tricky ways Japanese women have already significantly modified the national consensus on the status of women, most particularly where the marital relationship is concerned. To be sure, traditional patterns still prevail in the great majority of Japanese marriages where the partners are middle-aged or older. But this sort of marriage is becoming much less prevalent among couples in their 20's and 30's. More and more young Japanese husbands now spend a significant part of their free time on family activities such as weekend barbecues, visits to parks and playgrounds and summer excursions to the mountains or the seashore. And deference to husbandly whims is on a marked decline among younger Japanese wives. A woman, particularly a working woman, who has decided to appease her kids by giving them spaghetti or hamburgers for dinner - those now being the favorite dishes of virtually all Japanese children - is unlikely to offer Daddy an entirely different menu. The result is that a young Japanese married man who has a craving for a nice old-fashioned plate of grilled fish in soy sauce will often stop off after work at one of the burgeoning restaurants that specializes in o-fukuro no aji - ''food like Mama used to make.'' Even more horrifying, from the traditionalist's point of view, is the loss of the Japanese husband's immunity to such mundane chores as dishwashing and shopping. ''Since I sometimes can't get home in time to make dinner,'' one young career woman confided, ''I've been teaching my husband how to cook for himself. The idea shocks his mother, but he rather seems to enjoy it.'' One result of these changes in the roles of both women and men is a new trend in Japanese parent-child relationships. Historically, Japanese children under school age have enjoyed the undivided, almost obsessive attention of their mothers. In the traditional Japanese family, an infant or toddler basks in an all-embracing maternal love which, at least on the surface, is utterly supportive and uncritical. Rarely denied a wish, the child seldom has cause to cry, and if he does, he is immediately comforted. At bedtime, Mama croons him to sleep. And when the family goes out in public, he is indulgently forgiven for behavior that would earn most American youngsters a sharp parental reproof. But permissiveness as practiced by Japanese mothers is akin to jujitsu in the sense that it turns the natural emotional responses of the child into devices for his control. Specifically, it fosters a sense of dependence on Mama and induces powerful feelings of guilt about ever disappointing her. And this has far-reaching consequences. Carried over into adult life, these deeply ingrained psychic patterns - a taste for dependence and a horror of failing to meet the expectations of others - become major tools for the maintenance of social discipline in Japan. At the moment, this is still the kind of character molding that the majority of Japanese children receive. But as the number of working women increases, a growing percentage of Japanese no longer get all their early upbringing at Mother's knee. Since 1960, the number of day-care centers has doubled; it now stands at well above 20,000 and the end is by no means in sight. The majority of day-care centers, moreover, are operated by local governments and nearly all receive at least some governmental support. Despite this implicit governmental endorsement, there has been considerable controversy in Japan over the ultimate effect of this development on the Japanese character. Traditionalists like Jun Eto, a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who has argued - without data - that children dispatched to day-care centers lag in everything from speech skills to dexterity in origami (the art of Japanese paper folding), insist that it spells doom for the classic Japanese virtues. Though his view is somewhat extreme, it is possible that children who cease to be totally mother-oriented at 3 or 4 might be somewhat less likely to be imbued with a dependency complex than those who first venture out of the nest at 6. Another element contributing to the trend toward independence among members of the Japanese family is the country's rapid urbanization. After World War II, the Japanese population was almost evenly divided between country dwellers and city dwellers. Today, because of the postwar process that one top Japanese business executive describes as ''the second industrialization of Japan,'' all but 13 percent of Japanese live in cities. The result is that, in terms of effective living space, by my calculation, all 118 million Japanese are now crammed into an area slightly smaller than the state of Connecticut. Inevitably, this has caused the price of real estate and of housing in Japan's major cities to skyrocket. In the Tokyo area, a house with a total living area of 600 or 700 square feet - the equivalent of two or three modest-sized rooms in an American development house - sold in 1980 for five or six times the annual income of a highly paid industrial worker. Thus, a typical young Japanese bureaucrat or junior executive lives with his wife, their two children and a mindboggling array of household possessions in an apartment consisting of a small kitchen with dining area plus two additional rooms of perhaps 9 by 12 feet each. A few years ago, a sharp-tongued Common Market official, Sir Roy Denman, called this kind of apartment ''a rabbit hutch.'' Unkind as it was, the phrase quickly caught on in Japan itself. Because of such crowding, Japanese family members are moving their formerly home-centered activities elsewhere. Unless he is prosperous enough to rent a midtown studio, the father who wishes to do serious reading or research in his spare time must take refuge in a public library or reading room. If he is addicted to a pastime requiring concentration, such as board games like go or shogi, his best course is to betake himself to one of the special recreation centers that have sprung up in major cities. In some cases, the lack of privacy at home inhibits the sexual activity of married couples to such a degree that they are driven to patronize Tokyo's ''love hotels'' to escape the observation of their children. Inadequate housing is just as hard on Japan's children. Because few urban homes have yards, small children mostly have to go to parks or private playgrounds that charge admission for their outdoor play. And older ones, unless they come from unusually prosperous families, cannot hope for a room of their own. If they wish to study in relative piece and quiet, they too must resort to a library or an after-hours tutoring school. Because it has weakened the bonds of family unity, all this has induced in younger Japanese a greater sense of individual choice - and with that a greater insistence on self-gratification as a primary goal. In a 1980 survey of Japanese between 15 and 19, more than 71 percent of the youngsters polled said that they craved ''an individual life style,'' and fewer than 10 percent professed the desire to lead lives useful to society, almost exactly the reverse of a similar poll taken in 1960. Carried to extremes, these attitudinal changes have contributed to a disturbing development in contemporary Japan. Foreigners marvel at the law-abiding nature of Japanese society - and rightly so. At last report, New York had 279 times as many armed robberies as Tokyo does - and Japanese crime rates have actually decreased somewhat over the past decade. But a closer look reveals some trends in the pattern of crime in Japan that, in the words of a National Police Agency white paper, almost certainly constitute ''pointers to future social problems.'' One such pointer is a major increase in drug abuse. In 1980, some 20,000 Japanese were arrested for using illegal drugs, most often amphetamines - or speed. By American standards, this is a minuscule figure, but Japanese police believe that the total number of drug addicts in their country may now run as high as several hundred thousand. More than half the drug-related arrests currently involve people under 24, many of them high-school students. And the growing abuse of drugs by youngsters is only one aspect of a recent upsurge in juvenile crime of all kinds. In 1979, juvenile arrests jumped by a startling 48 percent to a total of more than 140,000. By 1981, 14- to 16-year-olds had outstripped adults as Japan's most frequent lawbreakers. What troubles older Japanese more than anything else is the increasing frequency with which schoolchildren are resorting to violence against their teachers - a special kind of blasphemy in a society in which the teacher has traditionally been held in particularly high esteem. Presumably, it will be some years before it becomes clear just how much of a threat to Japan's social order the current juvenile crime wave represents. But already, in far less aggravated form, the tendency of younger Japanese to seek instant gratification has begun to take its toll. ''Young people in this country have changed significantly since I first began to teach here in 1954,'' says the Rev. Joseph Pittau, an engaging Italian Jesuit who spent more than 20 years as an educator in Japan and at one time was the president of Tokyo's Sophia University. ''The kids back in those days,'' he says, referring to the children of World War II, ''had suffered when they were small and felt a compulsion to change Japan. But nowadays the motivation to be a leader or start something new is extremely rare even in brilliant students. ''The prevalent ambition, in fact, is to become a 'salaryman,' '' Father Pittau adds, using the fractured-English term that Japanese apply to white-collar workers, ''and to achieve more balance than previously existed between one's personal life and the demands of the job.'' One of the most striking evidences for this change is the amount of time that today's Japanese actually devote to work. As recently as 1971, only one-fifth of Japan's workers took all the paid vacation time to which they were entitled. Today, the willingness to forego vacations, while still common among management personnel, is far less prevalent among blue-collar workers. Even when they are not on holiday, Japanese do not work as hard as they used to. The number of hours the average Japanese spends on the job dropped from 186 a month in 1970 to 175 a month in 1980. Those figures, moreover, include overtime, which is an increasingly sore subject with Japanese bosses. ''People my age used to work Saturdays even if we weren't paid,'' says Kazuo Nukazawa, a Tokyo executive in his middle 40's. ''Today's young people not only don't work on Saturdays, they don't even do overtime on weekdays unless they get paid.'' As commitment to work begins to diminish, the emphasis on personal desires increases. As a nation, Japan has long had the highest rate of personal savings in the world - and it still does. Currently, the average Japanese puts about 20 percent of his disposable income into savings, roughly four times as much as the average American saves. But executives of Japanese finance companies report that they do a disproportionate amount of their business with people under 35; instead of saving for years to buy a car as their parents did, more and more young Japanese are prepared to go into debt to buy the things that they want right now. Still another sign of this new emphasis on immediate gratification is the growing fussiness which young Jap- anese display about the kind of jobs they will take. With easy abortion and the prevalence of birth control, Japan is a rapidly aging nation: In 1970, more than 2.4 million Japanese turned 20, but in 1980, only l.6 million did so. This means increasing competition among employers for recent high-school and university graduates - and young Japanese are taking advantage of their seller's market. Fewer and fewer are willing to work for the small manufacturing enterprises that are the backbone of Japanese industry - primarily because smaller enterprises cannot match the wages, benefits or working conditions offered by such major corporations as Toyota or Sony. Just as important as their choosiness about the jobs they will take is the attitudes young Japanese display toward those jobs they do find acceptable. ''They're taking things easier and have begun to ask, 'Why should we sacrifice for the company?' '' said Yoshiya Ariyoshi, the late shipping magnate. And this ''laid-back'' approach goes well beyond the mere reluctance to put in unpaid overtime. Young workers are beginning to question such seemingly immutable principles of Japanese corporate life as the necessity of spending one's entire career with a single company and of being paid according to age and seniority rather than personal performance. The most dramatic manifestation of these new attitudes occurred in early 1980 when 80 computer technicians walked away from lifetime jobs with Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, a major shipbuilder and maker of heavy machinery, and established their own systemsdesign consulting firm in which they were stockholders as well as employees. The move sent a tremor though Japan's industrial establishment. ''Up till now,'' Father Pittau told me shortly after the Ishikawajima-Harima episode, ''companies and Government agencies have been able to take these youngsters and reshape them, giving them the traditional social formation in which loyalty to one's company or ministry is paramount. But already it is not so easy as it used to be to instill a spirit of service in young people in this country - and I'm afraid that it may get harder and harder.'' A Detroit auto maker or the chief executive of a European electronics company can scarely mourn the fact that his Japanese competitors may one day face much the same kind of personnel and productivity problems that already confront Western industry. But before such people grow too euphoric at the prospect of a less dynamic Japan, they should carefully consider certain aspects of Japanese economic life and the Japanese character that seem likely to reduce sig-nificantly the impact of some of these social trends. To begin with, contrary to Western legend, the current competitiveness of Japanese industry does not fundamentally rest upon cheap labor or the exploitation of armies of indefatigable production-line workers. In fields ranging from steel to silicon memory chips, Japan's true competitive advantage lies in the fact that in the last couple of decades Japanese companies have been prepared to invest far more heavily than their Western rivals in automation and high technology. And as the rapid pace of robotization in today's Japan demonstrates, Japanese entrepreneurs are doing everything in their power to retain and even strengthen that edge. It is important to remember that decadence is a relative matter. There is, I am convinced, every reason to believe that Japan's doomsayers are right when they predict that the Japanese of tomorrow will not work as hard as those of the 1960's and 1970's and will show markedly less readiness to subordinate their personal ambitions and private lives to the success of the company that employs them. It is also likely - particularly if robotization creates significant unemployment or other forms of social dislocation - that Japan's labor unions will become more militant than in the past. It is one thing for the leaders of a union to moderate their demands in order to assure the continued survival of a corporation that guarantees their membership permanent employment; it is quite a different matter to do so for a company that is in the process - however gradual - of phasing out the bulk of its human employees. Yet even assuming all these things do occur, it still seems highly improbable that the competitive imbalance that now exists between Japan and the other major industrialized nations will be redressed. For even at their new, diminished levels of effort, the Japanese will probably still work harder and feel more responsiblity for the success of the enterprise that employs them than Americans or Europeans. Despite the self-absorption of so many young Japanese these days, the great majority of the population finds it almost impossible to conceive that anyone can achieve real stature or success except as part of a group. A salaried executive in a major corporation still enjoys more prestige -simply because of his affiliation -than the owner of a thriving medium-sized business, even though the latter may have a considerably larger income and more real power. And to let down the group to which one belongs by failing to observe its accepted standards of performance is to court ostracism by one's coworkers - the most appalling thing most Japanese can imagine. Admittedly, there are eminent Japanese thinkers who criticize the group orientation of their countrymen, arguing that it produces less desirable behavior patterns than the West's individual motivations. Indeed, Naohiro Amaya, at one time the top bureaucrat in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, points out that ever since Japan opened itself to Western influences more than a century ago, it has been living in a state of ambivalence on this score. My own view is that what is currently taking place in Japan so far as value systems are concerned is the classic Japanese process of synthesis. One of Japan's greatest strengths in its extraordinary evolution from the feudal society that it was at the time of Commodore Perry's arrival to the advanced technological one it is today has been that instead of totally accepting destabilizing and often unsuitable Western ideas and institutions, the Japanese have been remarkably successful in adapting these influences to their own needs and imperatives. One example of the way in which almost all things foreign are subtly transformed when they are absorbed into Japanese culture can be found in the workings of the Japanese parliamentary system. To all outward appear-ances, it closely resembles that of Great Britain. But while a British prime minister with even a paper-thin parliamentary majority feels free to ram through his or her programs with total disregard for the most deeply held convictions of the opposition, any sensible prime minister in Japan will go to great lengths to avoid such action. In the Japanese ethic, it is abhorrent for anyone, even if he is legally entitled to do so, to brush aside the feelings of his opponents and decline to make at least token concessions to them. In politics, in other words, the Japanese have succeeded in synthesizing two seemingly opposed principles, majority rule and government by consensus. And now, I believe, they are performing the same sort of Hegelian trick with the concepts of personal gratification and group responsibility. What will emerge from this process, it seems safe to predict, is a ''softer,'' more individualistic Japan - which will still boast the most purposeful and productive society of any great industrial nation in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON; THE APRIL FOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/opinion/washington-the-april-fool.html,"Chairman: The witness will take the chair and state his name. Witness: I am the April Fool. Q. The purpose of your testimony? A. I have come on my annual spring visit to defend the President's policies against the vicious opposition of the press. Q. All his policies? A. Yes, sir. Q. How very odd. Where would you like to begin? A. With outer space, Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind. I thought the President's idea of shooting down enemy nuclear missiles with laser beams and other clever devices before they blew up Washington was marvelous. Q. But I didn't know they had been invented. And didn't the President say that he had just begun to think and study how this might be done? A. That's why it was so marvelous. He has been unjustly criticized for not thinking at all, or studying anything, and always trying to drag the country back into the 19th century. But here he was thinking and studying about how to save the Republic from destruction in the 21st century. Q. Anything else? A. He tried to take the mind of the country and the Congress off merely temporary problems such as unemployment, budget deficits or taxes and give it a vision of the coming age, when computers and high technology would relieve people from such nuisances as war. He was restoring hope for our children and our grandchildren. Q. Did it occur to you that this might have been a clever television political trick to divert attention from present anxieties into future hopes? Meanwhile, what about the present problems? A. He dealt with them with characteristic political candor. He argued for more nuclear weapons, so that he could convince the Russians to reduce them and eventually get rid of them. And also for larger deficits so that he could balance the Federal budget. Surely you see the logic of his proposals? Q. I'm not sure I do. Isn't this a vision of a fool's paradise? A. No, and I must say, Mr. Chairman, that it puzzles me why you mock fools, since there are so many of them here in Washington. With respect, I remind you that Mark Twain thought you should be thankful for fools, since sometimes they had more votes than anybody else, and that the country could not succeed without them. I think ... Q. What do you think? A. I think the first duty of the gov-ernment is to provide for the security of its people, defend its borders, restore its faith and assure that it remains No. l in the development of modern military and industrial science. That's why the President insists on his defense budget and is against abortion and for prayer in the public schools. Q. I agree with some of that. But how can the President get ''the government off the backs of the people'' when 12 million of them are unemployed and on their backs? He wants to revitalize the industry of the country so that it can compete more effectively in the export markets of the world. Right? A. Right. Q. Okay. He also wants to explore the possibilities of defending the nation from nuclear attack by getting the best scientists and the best possible students on his side. Wouldn't this require a much larger education budget than he has proposed to prepare the coming generation for these tasks? A. I don't know. The President has already proposed fantastic sums to subsidize their education, but a lot of them are bums who are borrowing money from the government and learning nothing except how to evade their debts, and even refusing to register for a military draft. Q. So you would punish the good along with the bad? Are fools pessimists or optimists? A. We're the last of the optimists, but it's not easy. Q. What about the poor nations and the hungry half of the human race, many of whom are also avoiding their debts? Should we apply your same rule of punishing the good along with the bad: ''Comfort the afflicted or afflict the comfortable''? A. I think you've got me wrong, Mr. Chairman. I'm a fool but not a knave. There are poor fools all over the world and we need money to help them, but to deal with the knaves we need power, which is all they understand. Q. So you come to Washington once a year in the spring. Why then? A. Because it's so beautiful, with the regularity, coherence and hope of nature. It's not like the contention and solid mass of ignorance and selfish pride of politics during the rest of the year. I like it around April Fool's Day because we can laugh together about our follies, including the folly of fools, politicians and the press. The Chairman: I thank you for your remarks, not about politicians, but about the press, and hope you'll come back next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/magazine/l-no-headline-055959.html,"The Feminine Mystique Plus 20 Betty Friedan's ''second stage'' is what some of us were not only talking about but also attempting to do 15 years ago ... with one important exception (''Twenty Years After the Feminine Mystique,'' Feb.27). Those of us who were both feminists and mothers of young children in the late 1960's tried various forms of shared child care and demanded significant contributions of time and energy from our husbands both in child care and in housework - this in the midst of a society that had scarcely any appreciation and certainly gave no tangible support to such enterprises. What happened? Many men ''helped,'' though the women still did more of the child care and housework. Still, we did not give up the notion that real equity was the goal. Many marriages of my contemporaries could not stand the strain, but many have survived. So what is my quarrel with Betty Friedan? In spite of the fact that I have not yet seen it happen, I have not given up the ideal of the equality of men and women, inside and outside the home. Acceptance of an arrangement such as she describes in the case of her son and daughter-in-law - he devotes himself to his profession but carries his baby on his back from time to time, while she interrupts her career to care for the baby -is not ''phase two''; it is a step backward. Until men equally compromise their careers for the sake of parenthood, they will not join women in demanding child-care facilities, shared jobs, flextime, etc., and women will not have an equal voice in society. The right to choose abortion is not nearly so important as the right to choose to have children without sacrificing or compromising a career. Mrs. Friedan is just an oldfashioned mother-in-law: Her feminist ideals go out the window when they might stand in the way of her son's career.

LEGISLATURE VOTES NEW YORK BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR '84,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/28/nyregion/legislature-votes-new-york-budget-for-fiscal-year-84.html,"The Legislature approved a 1984 tate budget early today calling for $220 million in added programs, but thousands fewer layoffs, than Governor Cuomo's original proposal. The budget, arrived at after weeks of negotiations, imposes nearly $1 billion in new taxes. Overall, it would add less than 1 percent to the Governor's proposed $31.5 billion budget. The last bill was passed in the Assembly shortly before 2 A.M. today, and in an unusual show of unity, Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, invited Governor Cuomo and the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, a Binghamton Republican, to the podium to speak. 'Proud of When We Did It' ''I'm not particularly proud of what we have done.'' Senator Anderson said. ''But I am proud of when we did it.'' Governor Cuomo said, ''What you produced is a better budget than the one I gave you, and for that I am grateful.'' Assemblymen who had debated for most of Sunday and into the morning cheered wearily. The Senate had completed action about an hour earlier. As the final bill, a measure imposing a series of taxes, was put to a vote, Senator Anderson walked over to several Republicans who voted against the measure, including Senator John E. Flynn of Yonkers and Senator Martin J. Knorr of Queens. They immediately changed their votes. The measure passed by a vote of 48-12. Immediately afterward, Governor Cuomo walked into the Senate Chamber, walked up to Senator Anderson, shook his hand and said, ''Thank you very much.' The layoffs of state workers became a key issue in Mr. Cuomo's first budget. News analysis, page 15. The State Budget Director, Michael Finnerty, said that because of the money restored during legislative negotiations, all layoffs of state workers would be delayed at least until May 5, and that only 3,100 of the 9,400 layoffs called for under Governor Cuomo's budget proposal might actually be carried out. He said that the figure would drop even further if state unions could persuade more than the expected 4,200 of their members to retire early under a plan passed by the Legislature this week. Under the plan, employees over age 55 who retire by the end of next month would get credit for three extra years of service in figuring their retirement incomes. ''We are talking about converting layoffs into attrition,'' Mr. Finnerty said. In negotiations overnight, agreement was reached on a plan to tax the gross receipts of only the 18 largest petroleum companies. One of the companies has threatened not the pay the new tax. The 2 percent tax can be passed along to consumers, but oil company officials have said they might not be able to pass it along because of competition from the companies not subject to the tax. ''Mobil Oil has instructed me to say it will litigate,'' said Victor Condello, a lobbyist for the company. ''They will not pay it.'' The budget also will make it more expensive to smoke cigarettes, drink alocholic beverages, drive a car and transfer real estate. But in negotiations, a proposal to impose a sales tax on movie and theater tickets, haircuts and other services was dropped, and replaced with a tax on profits from large real estate transactions. The Legislature was working to complete action on a budget before the April 1 deadline, the start of the new fiscal year. If it succeeds, it would be the first time in four years that the deadline was met, and the first time in some years that the budgetwas arrived at t ed by the Republican minority. Most of the measures were defeated by a p arty-line vote. The Senate recessed periodically as it waited for the Assembly to act. Republicans Denounce Taxes In the debate, Assembly Republicans argued that much of the nearly $1 billion of additional taxes was unneeded. ''The taxes,'' said the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., Republican of Norwich, ''will generate a monumental surplus just in time for the spring of another election year.'' Assembly Democrats said the budget would cause some pain, but that much of the pain had been eliminated by the restoration of programs. ''This is a tightly balanced budget,'' said Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, Democrat of Long Beach. ''We were the last state of the 50 to catch up with the national recession; we may be one of the last of the 50 to catch up to the upswing.'' Republicans in the Assembly voted against most tax bills, but most supported school aid legislation. In the Senate, most budget bills passed with support of both Democrats and Republicans. Medicaid Measure Defeated As in past years, both houses defeated amendments that would have barred the use of Medicaid to pay for abortion, after lengthy debates. Senator James H. Donovan, Republican of Chadwicks, said that if funding was cut out ''we could eliminate the tax on beer.'' Assemblywoman Cynthia Jenkins, Democrat of Queens said, ''It is no longer a matter of life or death; it is a class issue.'' The gross receipts tax on oil companies was passed in the Senate early last night, and it was approved by the Assembly this morning. As part of the same measure, the state authorized an increase of one percentage point in the sales tax in Nassau County to help close a county deficit. After weeks of negotiations during which little was disclosed, the Legislature released details of items restored this afternoon, following private party caucuses. Money was added for the state and city university systems, tourism, mental health, the arts, upstate cities, sewers and highways. Smaller Cut for Arts Council The New York State Council on the Arts will be cut about $500,000, not the the $4.5 million proposed by Governor Cuomo. The State University received $10 million to restore jobs, and the City University $9.4 million. Mental health and mental retardation received $45.3 million to restore jobs. Education spending was raised $292 million, or about 4 percent, above what Mr. Cuomo had proposed for the next school year. The total school aid budget would go up to about $4.6 billion. Democrats in the Assembly listed $346 million in appropriations added, mostly to increase aid to schools and localities. But Mr. Finnerty, the State Budget Director, said that not all the money would be spent during the state fiscal year. He put the ''cash value'' of the additions at $220 million. To help balance the increases, about $140 million in spending was cut, including $18.6 million from the courts and nearly $6 million from Governor Cuomo's proposed prison expansion, and increased savings were budgeted based on estimates of lower interest rates and petroleum prices. Revenue Estimates Raised New estimates of revenue were also raised, by about $80 million, according to Mr. Finnerty. The state lottery was projected to bring in about $30 million more, improved tax collection was estimated to bring in an extra $15 million, $30 million more was expected from abandoned property funds, and additional money from surplus state funds. Administration officials said the reduction in layoffs was made possible only by the Legislature adding spending. They insisted there was no change in policy on Mr. Cuomo's part. Mr. Finnerty said that the state still planned to eliminate 11,000 jobs during the year, though this was fewer than the 14,000 originally planned. At the Assembly's insistence, Mr. Finnerty said, the budget will require higher staff-to-patient ratios in state institutions than Governor Cuomo had proposed. ''There is another year,'' he said. Earlier Tax Replaced The gross receipts tax on oil companies, which can be passed along to consumers, is designed to replace an earlier tax that could not be passed along. Both taxes apply only to oil companies that do a large volume of business in the state, and are limited to 18 companies. The earlier tax was overturned by a state appellate court because it could not be passed along, in a case that is before the Court of Appeals. The state is in out-of-court negotiations with some oil companies over more than $450 million the state says it is owed. Last Friday, Governor Cuomo announced that the new tax had been revised to tax 400 oil companies, because of threats from the large oil companies that they would refuse to pay. In negotiations overnight, that position was reversed. Mr. Finnerty said the broader tax could have a serious impact on smaller oil companies. The new tax is designed to raise $200tmillion. Mobil and other oil companies have called it ''punitive'' and ''discriminatory.'' Mobil said it would challenge the tax in court and warned that the tax would not be collected and could as a result jeopardize the state's bond rating. But Mr. Finnerty said that the language limiting the tax to only 18 companies had been upheld by the courts so far, and that he was confident the tax could be collected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHICAGOANS DISPLAY NO SIGNS OF UNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/us/chicagoans-display-no-signs-of-unity.html,"As the campaign for mayor entered its final two weeks today, this city that is starkly divided along racial, residential and economic lines showed no signs of uniting behind either candidate. For 52 years, winning the Democratic nomination has been tantamount to election. But this year is different. The Democrats in a divided primary Feb. 22 gave their nomination to Harold Washington, a black Congressman. His Republican opponent is Bernard E. Epton, a white lawyer and businessman. Today, Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, an 82-year-old who is a hero to many of the nation's elderly, urged a group of senior citizens to elect his Congressional colleague. Mr. Pepper, one of many out-of-state Democrats who have come to Chicago to campaign this year, arousing some resentment locally, was booed. On Sunday, Mr. Washington left a church on the predominantly white Northwest Side after a crowd of 150 jeered him and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Today he vowed to campaign in the area again despite tactics by such an ''angry mob.'' The crowd, most of them parishioners of St. Pascal's Roman Catholic Church, yelled ''Crook,'' ''Tax cheat,'' ''Carpetbagger'' and ''Babykillers,'' apparently references to Mr. Washington's temporary disbarment, his conviction on tax charges, and his stand on abortion. Many in the crowd carried signs supporting Mr. Epton. ''I'm sorry to hear that,'' said Mr. Epton, who took today off for meetings and to celebrate the Jewish holidays. ''You should be able to go to church and worship without being bothered. If they were supporters of mine, I apologize.'' The incident underlined the depth of feeling over the mayor's race. While denouncing racism in their speeches, neither candidate has done much to calm their excitable supporters. Mr. Epton's advertisements urge his election ''before it is too late.'' And Mr. Washington, at a rally after yesterday's incident, said: ''In that small group, there was a lot of hate. You could cut it with a knife.'' Today Mr. Washington suggested that his opponent was behind the incident. ''Harold has a way with innuendo and half-truth,'' Mr. Epton responded. Election a National Issue The long line of national Democrats, such as Mr. Mondale, have by their appearance here helped turn this local election into a national issue. ''The soul of the Democratic Party is on the line here,'' Douglas A. Fraser, president of the United Automobile Workers, said at a rally for Mr. Washington Sunday. But Chicago's no-holds-barred style of municipal politics has always been a world unto itself, based not on ideology but on local services, like the police, and self-interest, like property values, which many white residents fear would fall under a black city administration. These fears, based on both prejudice and economics, are not susceptible to idealistic urgings by national politicians, and many here have expressed resentment at the outside support for Mr. Washington and criticized his raising of campaign funds in other cities, although that has become common among black candidates. Historically, Chicago politics has been a fractious business requiring a strong leader to weld a shifting coalition of alliances between insular neighborhoods and their ward chieftains. Since the 1976 death of Mayor Richard J. Daley there has been no strong central leader and old cracks have begun reappearing. Before Mayor Daley's death, William Dawson, the city's most powerful black politician, died, leaving a power vacuum at the head of black voters as well. Mr. Washington originally had no hope of winning the Democratic nomination. But two white candidates -Mayor Jane M. Byrne and Richard M. Daley, the county prosecutor and late Mayor's son - split the white vote, and an unprecedented turnout of black voters put Mr. Washington on the April 12 general election ballot. The two candidates' votes in their state legislative careers do not differ substantially. Mr. Washington has talked mainly of unifying the city, raising taxes and destroying the patronage system. Mr. Epton has published a long list of position papers and attacked the Congressman's integrity. That attack has given many Chicagoans a more socially acceptable reason for supporting a Republican than race, and Mr. Epton has benefited. ''Bernie,'' said one veteran Democratic worker who asked that his name not be used, ''is being carried along like a little piece of flotsam. No one is in control anymore. It's just a flood of feelings.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remembering Melissa,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/30/opinion/remembering-melissa.html,"Two weeks ago a 14-year-old girl named Melissa Putney knelt on a Maryland railroad track, made the sign of the cross and waited for Amtrak 141. ''I am a weak person,'' she had written to her mother a few hours earlier, ''not able to handle the weight of life.'' Suicide, she said, was ''the easy way out.'' Melissa was nine months pregnant, and wouldn't admit it even to herself. Her classmates knew it, though, and they also knew she'd never asked for help from the school's guidance counselors or psychologist. Maybe, like a lot of kids, she thought the truth would go away if only she denied it long enough. But the truth remained stubborn, and it was she who ended up fleeing - right into the path of a train. When the weather turns warmer there'll be a tree-planting ceremony at Melissa's school. ''Just something so the kids can remember her,'' the principal says. But we'd like to see Melissa remembered by a lot more people than constitute an eighth-grade class in Edgewood, Md. Every time someone pushes for the passage of the squeal rule, or decries sex education in the schools, or denies an abortion to an adolescent, we hope they'll remember Melissa. Because there are millions of Melissas in this country and there are millions more, now grown, who can recall what it was like to be one. ''I am not pregnant,'' Melissa wrote in her notebook. How many adolescents over how many decades have told themselves that lie? And how many more, unless America reinforces its commitment to family planning, will have to go on telling it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON; WHITE HOUSE REVUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/30/opinion/washington-white-house-revue.html,"In the last few days, President Reagan and his wife have never seemed happier. They have used the capital of the United States as a stage, and demonstrated the power of personality and the theater to influence politics. Last week Mrs. Reagan went on a commercial television show and played a most appealing and effective role in support of her anxiety about the use of drugs by young people in this country. A few days later she went on stage here at the Kennedy Center and read Ogden Nash's amusing commentaries to Camille Saint-Saens' ''Carnival of the Animals.'' She was the prettiest thing seen here this spring since the flowering of tulip magnolias. Meanwhile, the President addressed the annual dinner of the Gridi@ron Club, which is the original ''Carnival of the Animals.'' The idea here was that the newspaper members of the Gridiron were supposed to roast him, but he disarmed everybody by appearing on stage with his tormentors, singing and dancing in their skit and laughing at himself and his Administration in a self-mocking speech unmatched since the days of President Kennedy. The moral of this happy tale is that you don't try to be funny with the Reagans on stage. That is where they're in their element. The President understands the power of television and the theater better than anybody else in Washington. As Jimmy Carter said about his old buddy Bert Lance, you have to give him credit. The press has been charging Mr. Reagan with being old, which he can't deny, and also with being lazy. But he has never been more active or feisty than in the last few weeks. Lately, he has been all over the lot. He has been dominating the news, making his Saturday morning broadcasts, flying all over the place delivering sermons to the evangelicals about the glory of prayer in the schools, taking time to talk to foreign correspondents and domestic publishers, and strolling into the White House press room to argue his case just before some important vote in Congress and just before television's evening national broadcasts. Still, he has a problem. He's a master of public relations but not of policy. Like any other good actor, he concentrates on whatever audience he's addressing. If he goes to Orlando to talk to the evangelical preachers, he denounces the Russians as an ''evil empire.'' If he talks to the NATO allies, or to Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador, he talks of compromise and peace. If he meets with his right-wing supporters, he is all for supplyside economics, tax cuts and anti-abortion laws, and if he talks to Speaker Tip O'Neill he's for cooperation and nonpartisan compromises. In this sense, he's a puzzle beyond the reach of journalism; and like Messrs. Carter, Nixon, Johnson and Kennedy before him, he will probably have to be left to the novelists and the psychiatrists. For he balances the books every day. It is the performance and not the policy that dominates his thought, and the impression here is that there are no connecting rods between the two. When he denounces the new heads of the Soviet empire as ''godless men'' intent on the domination of the world, without knowing much about them, it's not really that he thinks this is a good idea and doesn't want to talk to them about peace, but merely that he was making a speech to the evangelicals that day and didn't think at all about the larger consequences. The NATO allies are also inclined to confuse Mr. Reagan's speeches with his policies and intentions. They tend to think that when he condemns Moscow as the center of an ''evil empire'' that he's really trying to pick a fight with Yuri Andropov. But it's not in his nature to pick a fight with anybody. His mind, so to speak, is not on policy for the coming age, but on performance before whatever audience he happens to be addressing. And it would probably be wrong to assume that in the coming battle for the Presidency in l984 that he's wrong. He is dominating the political stage in Washington, with the help of his wife, and the Democrats don't quite know how to handle them. The Democrats think they have the best policy arguments, given the present rates of unemployment, taxes and interest at the bank - but so far they don't have the personalities to match the television and theatrical performances of the Reagans. This is both the President's power and his weakness. He is a brilliant performer, and this helps him politically, but almost everything he does is a ''performance,'' even when he is dealing with the critical problem of the control of nuclear weapons, or the unemployment of 12 million at home. He has had his revenge against a critical press, because he beats them at their own game of dominating the news, but he has not convinced them or the allies or his adversaries that he has a coherent policy for the future either at home or abroad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT UPSETS MURDER CHARGE IN DEATH OF FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/31/us/court-upsets-murder-charge-in-death-of-fetus.html,"The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled today that a man accused of killing his wife's unborn fetus could not be charged with murder. In a 5-to-2 decision, the court said there was nothing to prevent the state from prosecuting Robert Lee Hollis of Monticello, Ky., for performing an illegal abortion or for first-degree assault on his wife, Barbara. A Wayne County circuit judge had dismissed a murder indictment against Mr. Hollis, 26 years old, but the State Court of Appeals reinstated the charge last May. The Supreme Court decision upheld the county judge's ruling. Mr. Hollis was indicted in July 1981 on charges of murder and assault on charges that he tried to remove the fetus with his hand. Justice Charles Leibson, writing for the majority, said the question of ''when does life begin is not the subject of this opinion.'' The questions facing the court, he said, were ''what is included in the common law definition of murder; second, what is the impact of United States Supreme Court decisions and third, using the recognized rules of statutory construction, what is included within the word 'person' '' as used in Kentucky statutes. 'Cannot Stand Up to Rule of Law' Justice Leibson acknowledged the status of a fetus had changed in the ''eyes of society.'' Lawyers for the state argued that a viable fetus was a person for purposes of criminal homicide. ''While this argument may appeal to us instinctively,'' Justice Leibson said, ''it cannot stand up to the rule of law which both guides and restrains our hand.'' He said that decisions in 19 states had held that life must exist separately from the mother to establish a charge of criminal homicide and said this was a position supported by the United States Supreme Court. ''Although it is well recognized medically that a normal, healthy fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy has a potential of sustaining life outside the body of the mother,'' Justice Leibson said, ''it is quite another matter to say that a particular fetus was viable at the time it was terminated.'' Chief Justice Robert Stephens and Justice Donald Wintersheimer dissented. Justice Wintersheimer cited testimony by a doctor who delivered Mrs. Hollis after the assault. He said that the seven-month fetus was a ''living person.'' ''Stripped of its rhetoric, this matter is simply a brutal murder committed on an innocent, defenseless victim,'' he said. ''It is directly connected to a savage criminal assault of the mother and on the child.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/us/briefing-071192.html,"Packwood's Noncampaign S enator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who has been at odds with the Reagan White House from time to time, scheduled a six-day visit to New England last January, and Pavlovian elements of the press at once speculated that his true motive was exploring running in the 1984 New Hampshire and Massachusetts primaries, either against the President or after Mr. Reagan's retirement announcement, should there be one. But the Senator's tour was cut short by an emergency flight home for a funeral. Now he is going to make up the engagements he was forced to cancel with a four-day trip north next week, and his office is passing the word that the purpose of the resumed New England tour is announcing that he is not running for President. Maybe so, but two Oregon television crews will be accompanying Mr. Packwood, just in case. 'Deduct This Book' Now that the dreaded income tax deadline is nearly upon us, J. Peter Segall is experiencing a surge of seasonal interest in his new book. It is immoderately titled: ''Deduct This Book! How Not to Pay Taxes While Ronald Reagan Is President'' and contains all sorts of suggestions for what the author calls ''socially useful tax shelters.'' Mr. Segall, a Washington lawyer, is against giving the Reagan Administration more money to spend, but he is also against cheating, so his 160-page paperback from the Involvement Group Press advocates reducing your liability to the Government by such devices as tax credits for political contributions and energy conservation, investing in tax-exempt bonds and rehabilitating an old piece of property. ''Since the New Deal,'' the author writes, ''the notion that paying one's taxes automatically results in a socially desirable transfer of income from the haves to the have-nots, has wound its way deep into our progressive ethic. Face it - it's not true. At least, not now.'' A Change of Plans Curt Donaldson is coming to Washington, but not exactly the way he had planned. Last fall the 34-year-old carpenter from Lincoln, Neb. ran for the House in the state's First Congressional District as a Democrat and lost, as expected, by a thumping 90,000 votes. But, in the process, Mr. Donaldson gained a measure of fame - well, notoriety - as a humorist. Two Washington newspapermen happened upon him at a campaign dinner, where he was saying that the Administration's agricultural policy ''consists of praying for bad weather in Argentina, Australia, the Ukraine and Canada, all at the same time,'' adding, ''Personally, I think that's asking too much of God.'' Mr. Donaldson also proposed organizing a ''Farmers Anonymous'' with this procedure: ''Whenever you farmers get the urge to go to the bank to borrow more money than you can possibly pay back after harvesting next year's crops, call me and we'll go do a little drinking instead.'' On the international front, he advocates building a Soviet-American War Memorial now, ''while materials are cheap and labor is generally available.'' The Nebraskan is flying into the capital to appear tonight at the first anniversary celebration of Wacpac, the Whimsical Alternative Coalition Political Action Committee. Monday he speaks at a Washington Press Club luncheon and a Capitol Hill cocktail party given by Bob Walters, a columnist who was one of his journalistic discoverers, and his wife, Martha Angle, a news editor at Congressional Quarterly. Abortion Group Moves The National Abortion Federation, a professional organization representing 250 clinics and medical facilities, is moving its headquarters from New York City to Washington in June. Dr. Uta Landy, executive director of the federation, said the group had found it increasingly important to participate in the legislative process and help deal with medical and technical aspects of the issue that are sometimes overlooked in the political controversy. The move is part of a continuing pattern of national trade and professional associations moving their headquarters here. In 1982, according to the Washington/Baltimore Regional Association, 45 such groups relocated in this area, raising the local total to 1,650, or half again as many as the nearest competitor, New York City.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SHARP RISE FOUND IN DISEASE THAT IS DANGER IN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/us/sharp-rise-found-in-disease-that-is-danger-in-pregnancy.html,"The incidence of a life-threatening disease of pregnancy in which the fetus develops outside the uterus has increased dramatically in the United States in the last decade, researchers said yesterday. ''This is a very great public health problem, and an increasing cause for worry because it's becoming worse,'' Dr. George L. Rubin, head of a research team at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said of the disease, ectopic pregnancy. He pointed out that not only had some 400 women died of the disease in the period studied, but that it had also caused the deaths of more than a quarter of a million unborn children. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum fails to reach the uterus and instead develops in the ovary, Fallopian tube or other extra-uterine location. Unable to Determine Cause Scientists have not been able to find a direct cause of the increase in ectopic pregnancies. But they suspect that an important factor is that many women are becoming pregnant at older ages than in the past. Other significant causes are believed to be sexually related diseases and inadequate gynecological care. The findings, derived from three independently conducted studies, were reported in two medical journals, and the results of the studies concur with several similar surveys that have shown comparable rates of increase of the disease in Finland, Sweden, England and Wales. The American surveys, like the earlier surveys conducted abroad, indicated that the disease was most prevalent in older age groups, in blacks and among women with previous pregnancies or earlier diseases of the reproductive system. Ectopic pregnancies cause potentially fatal consequences to the mother, since the fetus grows in a place much too small to contain it and, if not removed, will burst the tube within about 10 weeks of pregnancy. 4 Major Causes of Death On rare occasions the fertilized egg may lodge in an ovary or in the abdomen. In any case, the condition must be corrected by surgery to remove the fetus. Along with toxemia, infection and hemorrhaging, ectopic pregnancy is one of the four major causes of death among pregnant women. The most probable causes of tubal pregnancies, as they are also called, are considered to be pelvic inflammatory diseases, sexual activity-related diseases such as gonorrhea, other infection and inflammation of the Fallopian tubes or the ovaries and adhesions or scars from previous abdominal surgery or ailments. Although scientists have found no evidence that intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUD's) cause the disease, they cite some studies that show a correlation between their use and a higher than normal number of tubal pregnancy cases. The three independent studies of the rise of the disease were made in New York City, upstate New York and the United States as a whole. The latter study was made by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control while the two New York surveys were conducted by separate teams from the New York State Department of Health. The national survey and the upstate New York research were reported in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association and the New York City study was published in the June 1982 issue of The American Journal of Public Health. The nationwide study showed that from 1970 through 1978 about 262,000 women aged 15 to 44 were discharged from United States hospitals with a record of tubal pregnancy. These cases increased from 17,800 in 1970 to 42,400 in 1978. The disease rate per 1,000 reported pregnancies more than doubled in the same interval and rose to 9.4 from 4.5. 261,000 Cases Estimated Dr. Rubin noted in an interview that out of about 33 million live births in the nine-year period, there were about 261,000 cases of tubal pregnancy. And for every 1,000 cases, he said, there were about 1.7 maternal deaths. Since scientists still have not determined the precise cause or causes of the disease, they also are not sure of the best way to prevent it. ''We can't tell a woman that she shouldn't be promiscuous, but we can suggest that there ought to be more use of contraceptives,'' Dr. Rubin said, though he made an exception for intrauterine devices, because of the possibility of their connection with ectopic pregnancies. A greater use of contraceptives would reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. He also noted that there were now some 1.3 million legal abortions each year. In the New York City study, made at 73 hospitals, the number of ectopic pregnancies rose from 1,457 in 1975 to 2,080 in 1980. The rate of the disease per 1,000 reported pregnancies in the same period rose from 6.48 percent to 9.62 percent. The study attributed the main causes of maternal fatalities to patient neglect and errors by physicians. Dr. Rubin said the trouble signs often resembled those of other gynecological disorders. ''The main symptoms are pain in the lower abdomen and any alteration of the menstrual pattern, such as small blood loss during a period instead of the normal flow,'' he said. He said symptoms of tubal pregnancy could be found within four to eight weeks of conception. ''There is usually some sort of warning,'' he said, adding that the growing fetus would probably rupture the Fallopian tube in the first four to six weeks and would certainly do so by the tenth week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A DISMISSED STANFORD PH.D. CANDIDATE'S WRONG PROTEST FORUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/opinion/l-a-dismissed-stanford-phd-candidate-s-wrong-protest-forum-070721.html,"To the Editor: It evidently takes only clairvoyance - in this case the ability to see an unreleased report - and a strong belief in a wide-ranging conspiracy to write an editorial about the expulsion of Steven Mosher from the Ph.D. program at Stanford (''Expelling the Messenger,'' March 19). However, not only did you lack essential facts (as you conceded you might), you chose to ignore facts you had at your command. You had in your possession a quotation from the report of the ad hoc investigating committee which deals explicitly with the issue of Mr. Mosher's publication of information on the Chinese birth-control program and Chinese controls on foreign scholars: ''We feel that although the Chinese are clearly linking Mosher's article to the restrictions they are imposing on foreign scholars, we cannot hold Mosher responsible for actions the Chinese are taking. ''Although we believe that Mosher was unwise to publish his article in a popular Taiwanese weekly where it would be read as a political attack on the P.R.C., we cannot judge this act to be misconduct, both because we are not convinced that Mosher fully understood the implications of his choice of publishing medium and because we believe that Mosher's right to publish where he chooses is protected by the right to freedom of speech.'' That report was discussed, and endorsed unanimously in a secret ballot, by the faculty of the Stanford University Department of Anthropology. Anthropology is made up of independent-thinking, contentious schol-ars (witness the latest controversy on the work of Margaret Mead). Do you believe that 11 faculty members, none of whom are Sinologists with an apparent ax to grind, would unanimously vote to terminate a student on the flimsy and unconstitutional grounds stated in the editorial? As you know, Mr. Mosher published his article on Taiwan in May 1981. In response to comments by individual faculty members, he apologized for publishing the photographs of identifiable, semi-nude women about to undergo abortions and also for his choice of publishing medium. Thus, when the anthropology faculty met in September 1981, all the information pertinent to the publication of the article was before it. We did not need an investigating committee to determine the facts, and if that were the critical issue for dismissal, the faculty could and would have dismissed him then. You are correct in stating that the Anthropology Department will not publicly release the report, because the material in it might injure innocent third parties (Mr. Mosher has a copy and all documents used in drawing it up). However, you do not say that Mr. Mosher has stated in writing that the crucial evidence against him would physically endanger innocent persons. You accept Mr. Mosher's latest statement, that he will not publish the document because ''he would be disseminating slanders against himself.'' But if you accept the first part of his argument - that he was dismissed because of exercising his right to free speech - then release of the report, by his account, can only exonerate him. Mr. Mosher has attempted to try his case in public, where he can control all the information released, rather than use avenues within the university. He has claimed, to those who have no access to the evidence, that his rights have been violated. But to have his case reviewed and his objections considered, all Mr. Mosher need do is file a grievance with the dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford. At that point, university officials, up to the president, will be in the line of appeal to review the case and all pertinent documents. Now, one month since his termination, Mr. Mosher continues to obstruct such a review by failing to appeal the decision. To paraphrase your editorial, unless we lack essential facts - and since we do lack your creative clairvoyance - we cannot even speculate on the reasons for your groundless attack on us. CLIFFORD R.

TV VIEW; A RARE PORTRAIT OF THE POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/arts/tv-view-a-rare-portrait-of-the-pope.html,"Think of Pope John Paul II as an evangelist, preaching where he can. Think of him also as a modern man, a media personality, who uses television to further his evangelism. The Pontiff in both these roles is the subject of an unusual hour-long documentary, ''The Pope and His Vatican,'' on ABC at 7 o'clock tonight. Since his election to the papacy in October 1978, John Paul, the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI in 1523, has made 17 trips outside Italy, carrying his message to a large part of the world's population. The constant exposure opens him to the charge, noted in the documentary, that he is a showboat, artfully playing to the crowd. In fact, he does play to the crowd, and, as the documentary proves, he does it wonderfully well. The Pope, it is clear, regards television as a tool in this. The film tonight opens with ABC's assertion that its documentary crew was ''granted unprecedented access'' to the Pope, with its ''cameras allowed behind the walls of the Vatican.'' Actually, the cameras were not allowed everywhere - the Vatican and its policies are too complex for that - but certainly they were allowed in sufficient places to ensure a rare look at a Pope. So, we see an obviously cooperative John Paul, walking in the garden, receiving visitors, celebrating mass in his private chapel. He is aware the camera is on him, of course; a few times he obviously moves or stands to facilitate the making of the film. Still, he shows no discomfort in this. He is at home with the camera; he regards it as a friend. He is very much like Ronald Reagan in this respect. Mr. Reagan is a secular spokesman, which the Pope is not, but in large part their message is themselves. In offering himself to the camera, the Pope is offering his persona, trusting it will televise well. The trust is not misplaced. The persona televises superbly. The film, meanwhile, is respectful, although scarcely reverential. The Pope kisses a baby; he waves to crowds; he slaps someone on the shoulder. A monsignor, briefing a group of priests who are about to meet the Pope, tells them not to kiss his ring, but to shake his hand and look him in the eyes instead. The Pope is not made of plastic; the odor of sanctity clings to him not at all. There have been ascetic popes, political popes and pastoral popes, each formidable in his own way. John Paul is no less formidable, although it is not hard to imagine a layman inviting him, say, to drop in for a beer. It is not that John Paul looks folksy or that he exudes the paternalistic geniality of Pope John XXIII. It is more that he seems so comfortable with himself, so much of a whole, that the layman would not be afraid to extend the invitation. The apparent anomaly here is that this very modern man, this great natural for television, is preaching, and indeed reinforcing, a traditional set of rules: celibacy for priests, strictures against abortion, a return to old standards. They are rules associated, sometimes incorrectly, with conservative politics. The Pope's political positions, however, seem to be transcended by his religious convictions - and in ''The Pope and His Vatican'' we see how John Paul uses political situations to further his religious message. In the documentary, John Paul is shown ignoring the counsel of advisers, at a peace rally in Rome. Leftist politicians there want to prevent the opening of American missile bases in Italy. This is not a position approved by the Vatican; the Pope's attendance at the rally could be seen as an endorsement. John Paul, however, is onto something else. ''The Pope is with you as you run through the streets of peace,'' he tells the crowd. Then, having caught everyone's attention, he says, ''Do you really want to cheer for peace? Then study the original disciple of peace, Christ.'' He said much the same thing on his recent trip to Central America, some of which we see in the documentary. In Nicaragua, he publicly chastized a priest who had become a government minister, saying that the priest had to ''straighten out'' his relationship with the church. In El Salvador, the Pope told his bishops to mediate between extremes, and he urged all sides to come together for political negotiations. He seemed to be taking issue with American policy in this, inviting Communists to sit down and talk. He used his extraordinary persona to place Christianity not so much in the partisan battle but above it, an arbitrator, if you will. Television, of course, helped to deliver the message. In a thoughtful commentary during the film, John Cardinal Krol says that the Pope's predilection for reaching out to people, however he can, grows out of his Polish background. ''In Poland,'' he says, ''the church was denied free access to the media. They could only approach the people directly. And that's why in Poland if you have a church that was repainted, you'll find five or six bishops walking in procession to inaugurate the repainted church....When the Communists were out simply to destroy the church as an institution, the bishops and priests had no defense other than to become acquainted with the people themselves.'' Meanwhile, a recent investigation by The New York Times connected Soviet intelligence agents with the attempt to kill the Pope last year. Evidence was found that the K.G.B., believing John Paul's election was engineered by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's security adviser, thought the Pope might be used to take advantage of political unrest in Poland. In the documentary, we see what could have been the basis of Soviet fears. In a moving sequence, the Pope is shown in Poland, addressing an enormous crowd. His power is palpable. The crowd is moved. The Pope is helping the Poles to unite and to see themselves as one people. In ''The Pope and His Vatican'' we hear the extraordinary power of the Pope's voice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SELECTION; THE UNEASY CATHOLICISM OF GRAHAM GREENE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/books/selection-the-uneasy-catholicism-of-graham-greene.html,"Later this month Simon & Schuster will publish ''The Other Man,'' a series of interviews with Graham Greene conducted by Marie-Francoise Allain. Much of the material contained in Greene's answers to her questions will be familiar to readers of his two autobiographical books, ''A Sort of Life'' and ''Ways of Escape'' - his despair during adolescence, his adventures with Russian roulette, the lifelong restlessness that led to his extensive travel, his introspection and his early conversion to Roman Catholicism. But the following selection reprinted, in a somewhat emended form, from ''The Other Man'' is perhaps a fuller and more lucid explanation of his uneasy relationship to the church than exists elsewhere. * Did you become a Catholic the way one falls in love? No, I needed convincing arguments for the possibility that God exists. I'm very fond of an Anglican divine, Bishop Gore; he was also a writer, and he opened one of his books with the words ''The hardest thing is to admit the existence of God.'' I'm with him there. I was perfectly ready to accept the historical existence of Christ, but how was I to start from a hypothesis as vague as that of the omnipresence of God? So you were an atheist? No, but religion bored me to death with its Sunday services and its endless readings from the Bible. Anglicanism meant absolutely nothing to me, no more than Buddhism or Catholicism. One of my grandfathers was a clergyman with a great sense of personal guilt, so one day he had defrocked himself in a field and ended his days in an asylum! You see, I've inherited some bad genes. I too rebelled but not from a sense of guilt. At Oxford one had the choice between having breakfast sent to one's rooms if one attended the morning service in chapel or of going to breakfast in the hall. I opted for the second solution. Your rebellion did not go very far! That's because I was so indifferent. I knew nothing about Catholicism; it was a closed book to me. It was a long time later, when I was working in Nottingham, that I slipped a note into a collection box in the cathedral, asking for instruction because my fiancee was Catholic. I wanted to understand what she believed in, I wanted a better grasp of the nature of her faith. I had no thought of becoming a convert myself. So would love have been responsible for your conversion? I've told you, my conversion was not in the least an emotional affair. It was purely intellectual. It was the arguments of Father Trollope at Nottingham which persuaded me that God's existence was a probability. How do you explain his success? I enjoyed our discussions. I was stubborn as a mule, but he got me interested in his game. Subsequently I plunged into books of theology, which fascinated me. You see, I wasn't in the position of a Protestant who is searching for an alternative. I believed in nothing. Father Trollope and I saw each other regularly for six months, sometimes at the cathedral, sometimes on the open upper deck of a bus, when we'd pursue our arguments for the entire journey! (When I was baptized, I made it clear that I had chosen the name of Thomas to identify myself not with St. Thomas Aquinas but with St. Thomas Didymus, the doubter.) I eventually came to accept the existence of God not as an absolute truth but as a provisional one. So you could not say, like Sarah in ''The End of the Affair'': ''I've caught belief like a disease. I've fallen into belief like I fell in love''? I should have been pleased if my faith had been like hers. But I must say in my defense that unlike her I had also to be converted to the idea of Christianity. When did you begin to ''feel'' your faith? I recognized the first inroads during my visit to Mexico in 1938. It's all bound up with my loyalty to the underdog - and so it has been ever since. In Mexico the underdogs were the Catholics. When I heard a woman tell of the death of one of her family, how they had to send in secret to the capital for a priest to come and celebrate the funeral rites in Tabasco (the persecutions did not affect the inhabitants of Mexico City, who were in a way ''protected'' by the tourists); when I had witnessed the fervor of the peasants, who would go back and forth on their knees across the flagstones of those churches in Chiapas which were still open (though not to priests) and who would kneel for ages with their arms outstretched as though crucified - I tried to pray this way, and I found I could keep my arms up for a few minutes, perhaps, no longer, while they would stay as though crucified for the entire service - when one has been with believers who suffered for their faith - the masses said in secret in Chiapas and Tabasco, where there were no longer either churches or priests - this endowed the church with such grandeur, the fidelity of the believers assumed such proportions that I couldn't help being profoundly moved. I expect I'm explaining myself badly. I would compare these worshipers with the polite little congregation in Chelsea which I sometimes joined and the ladies in hats, and I'd feel that religion was the peasant approaching the altar on his knees, his arms outstretched as though crucified. But did you not in 1938 have a sense of being torn between a form of superstition (as witness the Mexican peasant) and a belief of intellectual origin? No. The two aspects coincided. I still believe in magic, even in the art of writing. If Catholicism has succeeded in reaching the remotest corners of Africa, it's no doubt because of certain magical characteristics. Its sense of magic is closer to the African than the abstractions of the Methodists and Anglicans. I'm inclined to find superstition or magic more ''rational'' than such abstract religious ideas as the Holy Trinity. I like the so-called primitive manifestations of the faith. What are they? Oh, the ones I've been telling you about, and others which are harder to describe. One comes across people, for instance, endowed with a strange aura. I'm thinking of a friend of mine, a Spanish priest with whom I go traveling every year. He has a faculty for bringing people to life. He is not a conventionally pious man, but he is possessed by an absolute faith. When I asked him to describe it, he modestly replied, ''I do not believe in God, I touch Him.'' What do you think of miracles? I want to believe in them. I have myself experienced what could be called a small miracle. I was in despair about someone - someone I had left rather brutally but whom I still kept seeing. The break was far from clean, and when we met we always ended up having an angry scene. So I went into a church and prayed to Padre Pio, the Italian Franciscan, to change the woman's attitude. From that moment all was calm. For me it was more striking than the sudden healing of a skin disease. Perhaps it was coincidence, but I like to think that it was magic. I have also seen with my own eyes the stigmata on Padre Pio's hands in the south of Italy. He was not a man who looked as though he suffered from a nervous disorder. I was so convinced of his powers of goodness that I refused to approach him and speak with him. I explained to the friends who had brought me along that I was too afraid that it might upset my entire life. As you see, ''superstition'' made a late appearance in me. As a child and an adolescent I didn't know the meaning of the word. I only became superstitious when I started to accept the existence of God and therefore of miracles. Is not your view darkened by the Christian consciousness of sin? Not in the least. I don't like the term ''sin'': It's redolent of a child's catechism. The term has always stuck in my throat, because of the Catholic distinction between ''mortal'' and ''venial'' sin. The latter is often so trivial as not even to deserve the name of sin. As for mortal sin, I find the idea difficult to accept because it must by definition be committed in defiance of God. I doubt whether a man making love to a woman ever does so with the intention of defying God! I always remember the example of a Dominican priest who found his life in Europe too easy and left for Africa, where he lived for years in a hut made out of old tin cans, only to discover that he was suffering from the sin of pride. He came back to England and confided to a friend that during all this time of hearing the confessions of the faithful, he had never come across a single mortal sin. In other words, for him, mortal sin didn't exist. The word ''mortal'' presupposes a fear of hell, which I find meaningless. This being the case, I fear that I'm a Protestant in the bosom of the church. In your novels you are content to substitute yourself for God! All writers, even the worst, are led into assuming a role vaguely comparable to God's, for they create characters over whom they exercise almost total control. I should add, though, that a writer is even more like a double agent than he is like God: He condemns and sustains his characters by turns. Their relationship is so ambiguous that when the characters come to elude his control - as with Scobie in ''The Heart of the Matter'' - one doesn't know whom to blame. You are a believer, even though you say that you are only ''keeping a foot in the door.'' In your opinion, does faith give an additional dimension to writing? Human beings are more important to believers than they are to atheists. If one tells oneself that man is no more than a superior animal, that each individual has before him a maximum of 80 years of life, then man is indeed of little importance. I think that the flatness of E.M. Forster's characters and Virginia Woolf's or Sartre's, for example, compared with the astonishing vitality of Bloom in Joyce's ''Ulysses'' or of Balzac's Pere Goriot or David Copperfield, derives from the absence of the religious dimension in the former. Francois Mauriac's characters are equally endowed with this strange substantiality. In ''La Pharisienne,'' when one of them - a very minor character - crosses a schoolyard, we have a sense of having seen him in flesh and blood, while Mrs. Dalloway doing her shopping leaves one indifferent. She moves out of our minds as easily as she moves out of Harrods. Along the same lines I should say that very few good writers have emerged from the Communist world, with the exception of a Solzhenitsyn or a Pasternak or a Sinyavsky, who have in fact retained their sense of the religious. The welfare state has driven God off the stage, just like the Devil, but it has failed so lamentably that I have the impression God is making a timid reappearance. History tends to prove that faith is reborn from its own embers. Would a Solzhenitsyn have existed if Communism had met with a more obvious success? What is God like? A mystery, an inexplicable force. That's why, when one prays one shouldn't in my opinion address oneself to this inexplicable and mysterious force but to His intermediary, Christ. I think there's an element of truth in the myth about man being created in His image. But it is easier to pray to Christ than to an abstract entity. Human love can be only a pale reflection of the emotion that God must feel for what He has created. Do you think that the Catholic Church today has at last ''rediscovered the technique of revolution,'' the absence of which you deplored in 1939 in ''The Lawless Roads,'' which you wrote after your journey to Mexico? What lay behind that remark were the abuses of the Catholic Church in Mexico, which had had the unfortunate result of bringing down on her priests the persecutions of the 30's. But the church could no doubt be grateful for these persecutions: She was purged by them and is now in good health there. I know that all too often throughout history the church has sided with the powerful, but this has happened less frequently in the 20th century. I think that at the moment, especially so far as Latin America is concerned, she has effectively rediscovered a technique of revolution. In Nicaragua, for example, the bishops aligned themselves clearly with the Sandinistas, and two priests are in the Government, while in El Salvador the bishops have united against the Government and provided a martyred archbishop. The influence of Dom Helder Camara in Brazil is not to be underestimated - though I know less of what's going on there. In Europe it's still too early to pronounce on the surprising appearance of a non-Italian pope, whom I for one heartily admire. John XXIII was one of the most remarkable popes we've ever had. Paul VI was a good and honorable man, but strangely enough he damaged the church. He was too much influenced by the Curia, not sufficiently independent. The present Pope inspires confidence because of his experience of life: He has worked in the mines, he has fought in the Resistance; he had a genuine political experience. I believe moreover that he is playing an important role in Europe's political geography -witness the warmth of his welcome in Ireland. The concrete effects are evidently not yet perceptible, but it's very possible that in the long run his visit there will have a valuable impact: He addressed himself to thousands of young people -very enthusiastic young people - and this cut the grass from under the feet of the Provos. His visit to the United States, on the other hand, was disturbing. I think it a pity that he raised the tired old question of contraception. In 1966, during the final session of the papal commission on birth control, nine cardinals and bishops pronounced themselves in favor of contraception - this proved that it couldn't be an intrinsic evil - and only three voted on the opposite side. It seems to me that one has to choose between that and abortion. I'm sure that most people are instinctively repelled by the idea of abortion, but abortion is very often nothing but the result of an absence of contraception. What do you think of this rigorous stand on priestly celibacy? There I'm in complete sympathy with him - though I know that it's not very well viewed at the moment. I think there has been too much laxity in this area. (Not that I'm the one to talk: When I became a Catholic I was very worried in case I turned out to have a vocation for the priesthood. I'd have made a very bad priest, for chastity would have been beyond my powers!) But if priests were allowed to marry, why not let them divorce as well? In that case, why shouldn't they marry four or five times, like Americans? I think that for many people, especially the young, the priesthood must have the attraction of a crack unit. It's an organization which has to train for combat, one which demands self-sacrifice. I've nothing in particular against priests' marrying - as you know, in the Eastern Catholic Church marriage is permitted, a single marriage -but I'm convinced that the drop in vocations has to do with the fact that we don't put across clearly enough the attraction to be found in a difficult and dangerous calling. One enlists in a venture which is total. People are attracted to the church where there's danger. I don't think there's a crisis of vocations in Latin America or in Poland. You express yourself like someone seeing these problems from the inside! Not altogether. Once again I'm speaking not as a theologian, only as a writer who happens to be a Catholic and perhaps even a Protestant inside the church. For I've always considered it better to be a Protestant inside rather than outside. Your name has often been associated with Mauriac's. Do you feel closer to French Catholic writers than to your English colleagues? I was very close to Evelyn Waugh, whose Catholicism was so orthodox that it clashed with mine. But, strangely enough, we never quarreled in spite of substantial disagreements in the field of politics as well. Evelyn was conservative right down the line. I made him very unhappy with ''A Burnt-Out Case'': He concluded from it that I'd lapsed from the faith. We exchanged a sequence of letters on this subject, and our correspondence ended on a humorous note. Our friendship was deep, genuine and in no way affected by the disparity of our ideas. Among my contemporaries I appreciate Anthony Burgess. We have seldom met, but I admire his talent. I don't consider him a Catholic writer, though, any more than I consider myself one. The French press often couples our names because we are both labeled exiles. (I don't have the slightest sense of living in exile.) The worst of it is that our names are also linked with Lawrence Durrell's, with whom I haven't the slightest affinity. The French are not always sound judges of English literature. Look at the way they took to Charles Morgan, who was held in small regard by British critics. (He probably read better in translation!) For me -perhaps I shouldn't say this -Lawrence Durrell and his cloying prose is the Charles Morgan of his generation. What do you mean when you say you have ''broken the rules''? In my private life, my situation is not regular. If I went to communion, I would have to confess and make promises. I prefer to excommunicate myself. That's why I said, at a conference in Paris with Mauriac, that I could only speak in the name of the ''semilapsed,'' comparable in this respect with certain Communists who have reached the dangerous edge where faith wavers. The priest in ''The Power and the Glory'' also broke the rules, since he was father of a little girl, and he was a drunkard and fornicator, and yet. ... But he could always say mass. He was never stripped of that right. While you, you are happy to torture yourself, are you not? No, I have become less depressive with age. I have, if you like, more doubts, but my faith has grown too. There's a difference between belief and faith. If I don't believe in X or Y, faith intervenes, telling me that I'm wrong not to believe. Faith is above belief. One can say that it's a gift of God, while belief is not. Belief is founded on reason. On the whole I keep my faith while enduring long periods of disbelief. At such moments I shrug my shoulders and tell myself I'm wrong - as though a brilliant mathematician had come and told me that my solution of an equation was wrong. My faith remains in the background, but it remains. So you are happy. ... Not very. Who is? Well, then, at peace? I'm just not bothered. I'll have it sorted out soon enough ... or else I won't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONGRESS FACES TOUGH DECISIONS ON ITS RETURN FROM RECESS TUESDAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/us/congress-faces-tough-decisions-on-its-return-from-recess-tuesday.html,"Congress returns to work Tuesday to confront a series of tough decisions on domestic and foreign issues that it managed to avoid before the Easter recess. After postponing action for weeks, the Senate Budget Committee will finally take up the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1984, and the Republicans who dominate the committee will have to detail their differences with President Reagan's spending blueprint on such key issues as military spending and additional taxes. In addition, both chambers will have to grapple with the short-term suffering of more than 11 million unemployed workers and the longterm crisis of industries and regions that show few signs of economic revival. Congressional leaders acknowledge that the $4.6 billion measure adopted last month to create jobs will have only a minimal effect on the unemployment problem. In the foreign policy area, the full Senate will be facing the thorny issue of Kenneth L. Adelman, President Reagan's choice to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. And the House is scheduled to renew consideration of a resolution calling for a freeze on nuclear weapons. Earlier Bipartisan Efforts As these issues move to center stage, the underlying question is whether the legislators will continue to follow the bipartisan spirit of cooperation that marked their successful deliberations on the job bill and the overhaul of the Social Security System in the early months of 1983. In both those cases there was a wide consensus on the wisdom and urgency of the legislation, and the White House went along with the compromises after sensing the mood of Capitol Hill. But as the next election inevitably begins to affect the judgments of both Congress and the White House, the possibility for partisan clashes will rise steeply. House Democrats signaled the start of the political season when they used their 102-vote majority to adopt a budget resolution that was openly designed to serve as a statement of party principles. Votes could be gleaned, they reasoned, by advancing less money for the military and more for social programs than Mr. Reagan proposed. Some Republicans, who avoided proposing their own budget, believe Democrats went too far and left themselves vulnerable to the charge that they were resurrecting the days of big government and higher taxes. But many Republicans who face re-election next year, including 19 incumbent senators, are eager to counteract the Democratic charge that Mr. Reagan and his allies are unfair to average working people. And they seem to have little stomach for further assaults on the domestic programs that Mr. Reagan wants to reduce. Arms and Food Stamps ''If I were running,'' an aide to the Senate Republican leadership conceded, ''I'd hate like hell to try to sell a big increase in defense while cutting food stamps.'' Both sides know they are entering a bargaining process and staking out their initial positions. In the end, since the Democrats control the House and the Republicans control the Senate, they will have to compromise their differences on the budget in conference. At that point, a strong dose of bipartisanship will be needed to pass a budget. While the budget sets overall spending targets, individual legislation is needed to authorize and appropriate specific funds. And some of the earliest battles could come over additional proposals to deal with unemployed workers and inefficient industries. One of the first bills will probably provide funds to bail out families that face mortgage foreclosures, and another would protect unemployed workers from a loss of health care benefits. Proposals have also been made to provide training for workers with obsolete skills and investment capital for industries with obsolete plants. The House-passed budget plan leaves room for $17 billion worth of new programs, but Democratic leaders privately admit that the figure will shrink substantially by the end of the budget process. They also wonder whether they can pass legislation that will add significantly to the already huge deficit. Congress generally has little say over foreign policy matters, but it gets a chance to exert influence when an administration wants either more money or a new appointment. As a result, the fight over Mr. Adelman's nomination has given critics of Mr. Reagan's arms control policy a chance to express their concern. Some Senators are threatening a filibuster against the nomination. Similarly, the White House invited Congressional action on El Salvador when it asked for $110 million more in military aid for that country. Other Key Issues Other issues that could well emerge in the coming weeks include these: - A bill to repeal the 10 percent withholding tax on interest and dividend income will come to the Senate floor on April 15. Supporters of withholding managed to hold off repeal last month, but the issue has wide public support. - The Senate leadership has promised to allow a debate on a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at banning abortions, but the amendment seems to have little chance for passage. Hearings are also starting this month on a Constitutional amendment to permit organized prayer in public schools, but that proposal also faces a rough road. - Legislation to change the nation's immigration laws passed the Senate last year but stalled in the House, and supporters are trying again. Lawmakers also have to decide whether to transfer $8.4 billion to the International Monetary Fund. The money is needed for loans to enable the international organization to lend to developing countries suffering huge debt burdens, but the move faces opposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEVILLE SPICES ITS HOLY WEEK WITH REVELRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/world/seville-spices-its-holy-week-with-revelry.html,"Throughout southern Spain the agony of Christ's ascension to the cross is celebrated with fervor - almost with gusto - and nowhere more so than here in Seville. The perfume of jasmine and orange blossoms mixes with incense and burning tapers. Night after night the drums pound like heart throbs, keeping time for the ''cofradias,'' the spectacular century-old processions mounted by 57 religious brotherhoods. They compete in splendor. Each procession centers on two immense gold or silver litters, one for Christ and one for the Virgin Mary, bedecked with flowers or shimmering with candles, borne by 36 or 48 men hidden underneath who pay for the privilege of excruciating labor. Hooded 'Brothers of Light' Each is accompanied by thousands of robed and hooded penitents. They are ''brothers of light'' or ''brothers of blood,'' carrying either candles at their sides or wooden crosses on their backs. The peaked caps with eye slits remind Americans of the Ku Klux Klan. When the cofradias pass along the official route, past the tribunal in front of City Hall and into the cathedral, it is the moment of glory. But when they return to the barios of their parish churches, they are serenaded with love songs and greeted with cheers stolen from soccer matches. It is, the aficionados say, the supreme moment, the moment of joy. True aficionados speak often of perfection. They will station themselves at favorite sites, a niche in a narrow cobblestone street, to judge the ''paso.'' They look for certain elements, like the movement of the canopy, which must sway slowly but not too much, and how a difficult turn is negotiated within inches of the walls. Shouts of 'Ole!' A ''paso'' that is perfect is said to be ''completo,'' or complete. It can inspire a crowd into frenzied applause and shouts of ''Ole!'' Then, the procession halts and the crowd falls silent. The float of the Virgin or Christ is carefully lowered to its legs. A solitary figure dressed in black steps out onto an iron-grill balcony, raises one hand and begins a haunting song of lament. ''Oh blessed Virgin, when I see your eyes of sorrow ...'' A crowd can be moved to tears. The foreman of the ''costaleros'' who haul the float on the backs of their necks raps three times on a golden door knocker. The men heave the 6,000-pound float aloft and move on, leaving the singer open-mouthed. In recent years some brotherhoods have taken to hiring professional flamenco singers to station themselves at strategic points. But purists frown on this practice because it cuts down on spontaneity. Revelry and Religion Holy Week was born in the grim spirit of the Counter-Reformation in the 16th century. But over the centuries it has lightened under the Andalusian spirit. Now it is one part revelry to one part religion, a mixture that sometimes surprises tourists from northern Europe.Baptised paganism, it has been called. ''What do people expect?'' said Jose Luis de Vicente. ''With this sun and this earth, who could be serious all the time?'' From Palm Sunday to Good Friday, the whole town stays up until dawn. The bars and cafes reap a whirlwind. Vendors line the routes, selling cigarettes, lottery tickets, cotton candy, peanut brittle laid out on marble slabs to cool and giant lollipops shaped like baby pacifiers. This morning at 6 o'clock the crowd was still there on the Calle Sierpes, where Cervantes was jailed, Don Juan dined and Carmen gave the slip to Don Jose. Charity is supposed to be a mark of the ''hermandades,'' or brotherhoods. Unlike those in other Andalusian cities, the brotherhoods of Seville operate all the year round. Some of them run a kind of unofficial employment office. Seville has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Europe, above 20 percent. The brotherhoods are supposed to eschew politics, although in the Franco years the ceremonies were larded with symbols of support for the regime. Even now, the largely conservative brotherhoods take positions on political issues deemed to have moral overtones, such as a declared opposition to the Socialist Government's move to liberalize laws on abortion. Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist Prime Minister, comes from Seville. During Holy Week, political considerations are put aside and even Communists join in the processions.

Letter: On Lobbying How O.M.B.'s Defunding Plan Misfired,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/05/opinion/l-letter-on-lobbying-how-omb-s-defunding-plan-misfired-079924.html,"To the Editor: Your March 15 editorial ''The O.M.B. Bomb-Throwers,'' concerning regulations recently proposed and then withdrawn by the Office of Management and Budget, states that O.M.B. cited a study of familyplanning clinics done by the General Accounting Office as a reason for the rules being needed in the first place. For the record, the G.A.O. Comptroller General, Charles A. Bowsher, testified on the proposed regulations at a hearing of the House Legislation and National Security Subcommittee on March 1. He stated that the G.A.O. report on family planning should not be used as a rationale for the proposed O.M.B. regulations. The G.A.O. report, issued last year, was done at the request of Senators Orrin Hatch and Jeremiah Denton. At the Senators' request, a number of audits were conducted by the G.A.O. to determine if any grantees of Title X of the Public Health Service Act (the nation's family-planning program) illegally used Federal money to perform abortions, to finance abortion-related activities or for lobbying activities. In all, 39 Title X grantees, including 13 Planned Parenthood affiliates, were audited. G.A.O. found ''no evidence that Title X funds have been used for abortions or to advise clients to have abortions.'' As your editorial points out, G.A.O. did find that a very small amount of funds was used for phone calls and other activities which could be construed as lobbying. However, since the rules regarding these expenditures were unclear, the G.A.O. recommended that the Health and Human Services guidelines needed clarification. It was this finding, and not any evidence of significant wrongdoing on the part of the nation's family-planning providers, that O.M.B. used as a rationale for the proposed regulations. By attempting to regulate both Federal and privately raised dollars, O.M.B. was clearly guilty of trying to silence most of the advocates for America's poor and disadvantaged. It was this incredibly arrogant and probably unconstitutional abuse of authority as much as anything that prompted the enormous outcry against the regulations.

SENATE STUDY CALLS FOR CHANGES TO UNRAVEL THE TANGLED LEGISLATIVE PROCESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/08/us/senate-study-calls-for-changes-to-unravel-the-tangled-legislative-process.html,"A study group headed by two former Senators today recommended wide-ranging changes in Senate rules designed to make the lawmakers more efficient in their procedures and more respected by the public. The main thrust behind the suggestions would be strengthening the ability of the Senate leadership to move legislation forward, while reducing the power of individuals and small groups to paralyze the proceedings. ''I think we have a very serious problem in reaching decisions,'' said Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., the Maryland Republican who heads the Rules and Administration Committee, which commissioned the study. ''This will have disastrous results if we don't deal with the issue in a serious way.'' The 41-page study was prepared by two widely respected and recently retired Senators, James B. Pearson, Republican of Kansas, and Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut. Hearings have been scheduled by the Rules and Administration Committee next month to review their 18 recommendations, many of which are expected to evoke considerable controversy. Would Eliminate 7 Committees Some of the more significant suggestions include establishing annual agendas and weekly schedules for the Senate; appointing a permanent presiding officer; eliminating seven of the 20 current committees, including the Budget Committee; passing a budget every two years, instead of annually; reducing the power of subcommittees; limiting the right to filibuster legislation or delay Senate business through procedural maneuvers, and restricting opportunities to offer extraneous amendments. Senate leaders acknowledge that many of the recommendations will face tough opposition from lawmakers who view them as a threat to their powers and prerogatives. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader, called the suggested changes ''sweeping and far-reaching'' and added that they ''will scare some people to death''. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the minority leader, said in an interview that, ''It's very important that we make some changes now because the Republican leadership is very much in the mood to do it. That is largely because of the problem the leadership had within its own ranks last fall.'' Fight on Gas Tax Senator Byrd was referring to the lengthy and ultimately successful fight in the last Congress to increase gasoline taxes by 5 cents a gallon. The bill was delayed for weeks by a small band of conservative Republicans using parliamentary maneuvers to postpone a final vote. The tactic infuriated many of their colleagues and increased pressure for rules changes in the new Congress. But the gasoline tax battle was only the latest example of the way ''a little determined handful'' of Senators, in Senator Byrd's words, have come to dominate the Senate in recent years. At times, they have tried to block legislation they do not like. At others, they have used the rules to offer nongermane amendments on emotional subjects like abortion. In both cases, said Senator Mathias, ''the rules have been abused,'' and lawmakers have conveyed the perception ''that the work of the Senate was being trivialized.'' Two Forces Behind Problems Many analysts trace the Senate's current problems to two political developments. The rise of mass communications undermined the power of Senate barons who once enforced, through their seniority and prestige, the unwritten rules that governed Senate life. At the same time, a new generation of lawmakers invaded Capitol Hill who had little previous experience in government and little loyalty to established parties or leaders. Accordingly, there is a broad belief on Capitol Hill that the Senate's tradition of virtually unlimited debate must be adapted to the new nature of the Senate membership. ''The giants of the Senate are gone,'' one senior aide to the Senate leadership said. ''They were the glue that held this place together.'' While many of the panel's recommendations face extended scrutiny, leaders from both parties say they are determined to seek changes in the rules that govern filibusters. Now, a filibuster can be ended by invoking cloture, a procedure to cut off debate that takes the votes of 60 senators, but determined and resourceful lawmakers can keep their delaying tactics going long after the cloture vote. Would Impose Time Limits The Pearson-Ribicoff report suggests placing strict limits on how long members can speak, and how many amendments they can offer, after cloture is invoked. Some version of this proposal seems likely to be adopted. Senate leaders would also like to curb the practice of offering extraneous, or nongermane riders to pending bills. Many senators are particularly incensed at the tactic of conservative lawmakers, who regularly offer amendments on such volatile issues as abortion or school prayer to ''must'' legislation. The Pearson-Ribicoff report suggests making it possible for the Senate to prohibit all nongermane amendments to a bill through a ''premium'' vote, either two-thirds or three-fifths of the membership. Senator Byrd and other leaders favor a similar change. Some of the other suggestions in the report include: - Setting annual agendas and weekly schedules for Senate business, and allowing television coverage of major debates. Now the Senate schedule is often uncertain from hour to hour, and television is banned. - Appointing one senator as permanent presiding officer, in order to strengthen the authority of the chair and enable him to enforce existing rules. Under the Constitution, the Vice President presides over the Senate, but in practice, the chair is usually taken by a freshman member who exerts little or no authority over the debate. - Banning the ability of senators to bring up an issue more than once in a session. This suggestion would inhibit lawmakers who insist on introducing controversial riders at every oportunity. - Reducing the number of committees while broadening their jurisdiction, and eliminating the staffs, and legislative authority, of subcommittees. The report notes that some lawmakers belong to as many as 17 different panels, and are often scheduled to appear at several different places at the same time. The authors hope their suggestion would cut down on the amount of legislation, and the ''extreme specialization'' of many lawmakers. - Absorbing the Budget Committee into existing committees. The authors argue that the current situation has ''upset the committee balance'' and given the Budget Committee far too much power. - Stretching the budget process over two years. The report maintains that ''the workload is becoming too great'' for Congress to pass a budget and individual appropriations bills every year. Senator Mathias admitted that there was some ''tough stuff'' in the report, but he promised serious consideration of the recommendations. ''I think this is an important thing,'' he said. ''The effectiveness of the Senate over the next few years depends on our doing something.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RULES TO AID HANDICAPPED INFANTS FACE COURT TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/09/us/rules-to-aid-handicapped-infants-face-court-test.html,"A Federal district judge heard an impassioned argument here today on the legality of Federal rules that require doctors and hospitals to provide food and medical care to infants with severe birth defects. Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he would decide next week whether to uphold or strike down the rules, which took effect March 22. The judge, who is the son of a famous child psychologist and pediatrician, Dr. Arnold L. Gesell, said the new rules would have a ''profound effect'' on the practice of medicine and would ''reach into a hospital's apportionment of its life-sustaining resources.'' The rules require hospitals to post notices saying, ''Discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by Federal law.'' Anyone who knows about a handicapped infant's being denied ''customary medical care'' is asked to call the Federal Government on a toll-free telephone number. Removing the Parents' Role Judge Gesell, without indicating how he might rule, said at today's hearing, ''The regulation purports to take away from the doctor any consideration except pure medicine.'' At present, he said, ''the primary consideration affecting many hospitals and physicians is the parents' wishes'' about whether a newborn handicapped infant should live or die. The regulation, he added, is ''designed to remove the parents from that role.'' Stephan A. Lawton, a lawyer for the American Academy of Pediatrics, one of the plaintiffs, denounced the rules, saying they ''injected the Federal Government directly into the hospital nursery and into the physician-parent-patient relationship.'' Neil H. Koslowe, a Justice Department lawyer, defended the rules, which were issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. ''The Secretary's effort,'' he said, ''is not an effort to supplant the medical judgment of the health care provider or even to establish any standards of treatment.'' Rather, he said, the Government wanted to insure that ''extraneous nonmedical factors,'' such as the cost of rearing a handicapped infant, did not intrude into the decision-making process. Thus, he said, the Government ''is protecting the medical sphere from nonmedical intrusions.'' Indiana Case Is Recalled The question of medical care for handicapped infants was widely debated after a retarded infant, known only as ''Baby Doe,'' died last April in Bloomington, Ind. Food and medical treatment had been withheld from the child, with the approval of his parents and a state court. Anti-abortion groups have complained that the withholding of food and care in such cases amounts to infanticide. President Reagan took an interest in the issue, and directed the Department of Health and Human Services to remind hospitals of their responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law says that no handicapped person shall be excluded from a federally supported program ''solely by reason of his handicap.'' Many doctors and hospitals contend that Federal officials violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they did not give the public an opportunity to comment on the regulations before they took effect. The formulation of these rules, involving complex medical, legal and ethical issues, ''cried out for public participation,'' Mr. Lawton said. The Government, in issuing the rules, said it could not wait for public comments because ''any delay would leave lives at risk.'' The Children's Hospital National Medical Center here and the National Association of Children's Hospitals have joined the 25,000-member academy of pediatrics as plaintiffs in the case. In opening his argument today, Mr. Koslowe, the Government lawyer, quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as saying, ''Of all forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman.'' Mr. Koslowe added that the new rules represented the Government's effort to investigate inequality and injustice in the care of handicapped infants. Dr. M. Harry Jennison, executive director of the academy of pediatrics, said in an interview that the dispute was ''really a product of high technology developed in the last 15 years.'' With such technology, he said, ''we can salvage the tiniest premature babies,'' including some who weigh less than two pounds and were born after 220 days of gestation instead of the normal 280.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TELEVISION WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/arts/television-week-078001.html,"Playing It Again The prolific David Wolper has not produced many weekly television series, but he has produced about 500 films including such miniseries blockbusters as ''Roots'' and ''The Thorn Birds.'' Now he's translated the revered, 1942 Oscar-winning Hollywood film ''Casablanca,'' which starred Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, into a three-part limited-run series that begins Sunday at 10 P.M. on NBC. If they prove successful, NBC will probably continue the series in the fall. The cast includes David Soul, Scatman Crothers and Hector Elizondo. There is no Bergman character. Mr. Wolper says, ''We're not doing that story.'' The story Mr. Wolper is doing is set during the days just before the onset of World War II, a period prior to that depicted in the classic film. It all takes place in 1941 French colonial Casablanca, controlled by the Free French government that was beholden to the Nazis. The series will focus on the relationships among the characters. ''My star is not playing Humphrey Bogart, he's playing Rick,'' says Mr. Wolper of Mr. Soul. He explained that he chose ''Casablanca'' because ''I felt that the relationships between the characters were so strong that other people could play the roles and it would work. To me that makes a good series.'' ''I'm not doing 'Casablanca' as it was done in the film. I just want the character and the settings of Rick's place. This television version looks like 'Casablanca.' I put smoke in muted colors and have terrifc actors, not look alikes. If it's a hit I'll be a hero and if it's a disaster - after 35 years in the business - I will survive to the next show.'' Bing, Bang, Smash The 55th Academy Awards ceremonies, streamlined for speed, will be broadcast by ABC on Monday beginning at 9 P.M., continuing until the last tears are shed. ''We are changing the format,'' said Howard Koch, who has produced 14 of the Oscar shows. ''In the last four years we've had Johnny Carson with a 10-minute monologue on the top. We've changed that completely. We're doing a number with four people at the front of the show - the four hosts are Liza Minnelli, Dudley Moore, Richard Pryor and Walter Matthau.'' Each will preside over one quarter of the show time. When the four appear at the beginning, their routines will be interwoven with details about Academy rules and regulations. Previously, Mr Koch said, the monlogue used up so much time that ''we'd been going way past 30 minutes on the first award. Now, probably in about 17 minutes, we'll be into our first award, right into the show - bing, bang, smash.'' Incidentally, Bob Hope, who has been one of the Academy regulars over the years, will present an Oscar-less Mickey Rooney with the Academy's Honorary Award for his 50 years in films. Holocaust Reexamined To refute those he called ''the revisionists,'' James Spear produced and directed ''From Dust and Ashes,'' a documentary about the extermination of 6 million Jews by the Nazis before and during World War II. This program, based on a holocaust conference held in 1982 at Kent State University in Ohio, will be broadcast Tuesday on Channel 13 from 10 to 11 P.M. Mr. Spear is production manager at KSU Teleproductions Center at Kent State. Particularly in the Midwest, he said, people are ''writing books and making lectures and saying the Holocaust never happened.'' In this show, some survivors talk about their own experiences; other survivors and scholars relate the experiences of Jews in Italy, France and Switzerland during World War II and some talk about what President Roosevelt did for those Jews who were fortunate enough to escape the Nazi onslaught and who subsequently entered the United States. Clergymen and scholars have their say as well. Frank Blair narrates. Mr. Spear said he culled 300 photographs from thousands in the collection at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, and from the National Archives in Washington, D.C. As a result, previously unseen footage - he estimated that 95 per cent of this film has never before been shown - that was captured from the defeated Germans will be used. Privacy and the Press A principal issue faced by working reporters is the question of a person's privacy. Whose life does a reporter have the right to dig deeply into - a government official who allegedly uses drugs, an actress trying to hide her past, an apparently upstanding citizen who was a guard at Auschwitz, a right-to-life advocate who had an abortion as a teen-ager? ''We're a people'' said Harvard Law School professor Arthur R. Miller, ''who both like privacy and like to gossip and, in a sense, you can't have it both ways.'' Professor Miller last year moderated a panel of 16 people - some of whom are well known - who discuss the privacy dilemma in ''Eye on the Media: Private Lives, Public Press.'' The 16-member panel's discussion, which originally ran about two-and-a-quarter hours, has been edited to one hour and will be broadcast on Monday by CBS beginning at 10 P.M. Participants include: from the media, Charles Kurault, Barbara Walters, Morely Safer, Ed Bradley, Bob Schieffer, James Hoge, Sally Quinn, Joan Richman, Van Gordon Sauter and William F. Buckley Jr., the actress Lauren Bacall, the corporate executive Mary Cunningham-Agee, former public officials Shirley Hufstedler and Millicent Fenwick, and the lawyers Floyd Abrams and Gerry Spence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOW WE LIVE NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/books/how-we-live-now.html,"U/S A Statistical Portrait of The American People. Edited by Andrew Hacker. With the Assistance of Lorrie Millman.300 pp. New York: Viking. Cloth, $25. Penguin Books. Paper, $8.95.STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES: 1982-83 National Data Book and Guide to Sources. 103d Edition. U.S. Department of Commerce. Bureau of the Census. 1,008 pp. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office. Cloth, $15. Paper, $11.By CHRISTOPHER JENCKS ONE of the more bizarre byproducts of the Reagan Administration's distaste for big government has been talk about turning over part of the Government's statistical services to private enterprise. In reality, while the Federal Government is collecting, analyzing and publishing somewhat less information about American life than it did two years ago, the private sector has shown little interest in filling the gap. It has, however, continued to repackage Government statistics, which it gets free, in forms the public is willing to pay for. ''U/S,'' edited by Andrew Hacker, a professor of social sciences at Queens College, is such a venture. The Government has been publishing a Statistical Abstract of the United States annually since 1878. The 1982-83 paperback edition runs to more than 1,000 pages, sells for a mere $11 and contains something like 500,000 statistics, plus a 39-page index running from ''Abortions'' to ''Zoology, degrees conferred.'' Every library buys one, but bookstores don't stock it and only a handful of private citizens own it. The fact that the current edition is only now appearing, six months late because of budget cuts at the Census Bureau, has passed completely unremarked by almost everyone. Mr. Hacker's ''U/S'' includes fewer than 15,000 statistics culled from the Statistical Abstract and other Government publications. But while it provides far less data per dollar, it embeds its numbers in prose rather than tables, displays them in large type with ample margins and provides useful explanations of where the numbers come from and what they mean. It contains too little information to be a useful reference work, but because it focuses on statistics that either tell us something about American society or have some interest as highbrow gossip, it should have considerable appeal to browsers. The way ''U/S'' and the Statistical Abstract treat crime statistics provides a good illustration of their respective strengths and weaknesses. The Statistical Abstract begins its section on crime with a dramatic chart titled ''Selected Crime Rates: 1971 to 1981.'' According to the chart and the supporting table, crime rates rose dramatically during the 70's. From 1973 to 1980, for example, forcible rapes per 100,000 inhabitants rose 49 percent, assaults rose 45 percent, robberies rose 33 percent, and burglaries rose 36 percent. Readers who accept such statistics at face value, as many have done, mostly seem to conclude that the country is lapsing into anarchy. But the data on crime in the 70's come from statistics local police departments send to the Federal Bureau of Investigation every year. Local police departments only record those crimes that have been reported to them and investigated by them and that the investigating officers wrote up in a formal report as crimes that really happened. Needless to say, that method leaves a lot of crimes unrecorded. Recognizing this, since 1973 the Census Bureau has been asking large random samples of Americans whether they have been victims of various crimes. Its surveys show far more crime than the F.B.I. reports. But there has been no increase in the proportion of the population that reports having been raped, assaulted, robbed or burglarized. On the contrary, the incidence of all four crimes fell slightly between 1973 and 1980. It takes no Sherlock Holmes to infer that what changed between 1973 and 1980 was not the amount of crime but the efficiency with which local police departments recorded crime. So, the Statistical Abstract's chart showing changes in ''crime rates'' measures changes in bureaucratic efficiency, not in criminality. THE Statistical Abstract says nothing about why the Census Bureau finds more crime than the F.B.I., or about why F.B.I. statistics show increases in crime since 1973 while the Census Bureau statistics show decreases. It simply publishes both sets of numbers without comment. ''U/S,'' in contrast, explains why the Census finds more crime than the F.B.I. But even ''U/ S'' says nothing about the fact that F.B.I. statistics show rising crime rates while Census statistics do not. Indeed, it provides no data whatever on changes in crime rates. That is a puzzling omission, since the public seems to be more interested in trends than in any other aspect of crime. The one bit of information ''U/S'' does provide on trends in crime is misleading. Mr. Hacker presents a table showing that the percentage of crimes ''cleared by arrest'' fell between 1970 and 1980. Like the Statistical Abstract's chart on ''crime rates,'' this table is likely to convince readers that the police are losing the war against crime. But once again this apparent trend is a spurious byproduct of improved record-keeping by local police departments. If one compares arrest rates to victimization rates, there is no evidence that the police are arresting a smaller percentage of those who commit crimes. They are just arresting a smaller percentage of the people whose crimes they record. The rule that statistics require explanation to insure that browsers are not misled applies to almost every area, not just to crime. Both the Statistical Abstract and ''U/S,'' for example, contain tables showing that median family income rose 113 percent between 1970 and 1980, while the Consumer Price Index rose 112 percent. The tables therefore indicate that ''real'' family income was almost the same in 1980 as in 1970. Most people who see such statistics conclude that the American standard of living is stagnating. But the tables are seriously misleading, because what constituted a ''family'' changed between 1970 and 1980. As one can see by looking elsewhere in either ''U/S'' or the Statistical Abstract, American families were smaller in 1980 than in 1970. Families shrank partly because they had fewer children and partly because parents were more likely to live apart, leading the Census Bureau to count them as two families instead of one. As a result, the same amount of income per family meant more income per person. Real income per person rose 22 percent between 1970 and 1980, even after allowing for higher taxes. LEST there be any doubt that rising per capita income meant a rising standard of living for most Americans, it is instructive to look at changes in what the typical American family owned. Housing prices, for example, rose faster than family income during the 70's, and many commentators claimed that this was putting the dream of home ownership beyond the reach of most American families. Yet both ''U/S'' and the Statistical Abstract report that the proportion of families owning their own home rose from 63 percent in 1970 to either 64 or 65 percent in 1980. The explanation is clear. While interest rates were high during the 70's, interest on home mortgages was tax deductible, and after-tax interest rates were consistently lower than inflation. Borrowing money to buy a house was thus an almost surefire way of enjoying large capital gains; the more you borrowed, the more you gained. Millions took advantage of this opportunity, driving housing prices higher and higher. Nor did the high price of housing force more families to live in substandard dwellings. The average family member had 15 percent more space in 1980 than in 1970. The proportion of families with hot and cold water, an indoor toilet and a shower or tub rose from 93 to 97 percent. The proportion with a television set rose from 95 to 98 percent, and the proportion with telephones rose from 91 to 96 percent. At the same time, the proportion of families with an automatic clothes washer rose from 62 to 77 percent, the proportion with air conditioning rose from 41 to 56 percent, and the proportion with electric dishwashers rose from 27 to 43 percent. For a country that thought it was going to the poorhouse, we certainly went in style. While official statistics show that America's per capita income fell below that of many European countries in the 70's, these statistics reflect the vagaries of exchange rates, which depend as much on interest rates, trade balances and the whims of Saudi investors as on relative prices. On almost every traditional measure of material well-being I have been able to find -such as housing standards, food consumption and ownership of consumer durables - Americans still seem to be better off than Europeans. The one realm in which we clearly lag behind is health. This is not because we spend less than other countries on medical care. It may be because we take such poor care of ourselves, or it may be because of the way we run our health care system. None of this means we ought to be complacent about the state of the American economy. As the Statistical Abstract shows, the rate of output per worker has been stagnating. If that trend persists, living standards must eventually stagnate too. Living standards rose during the 70's largely because we chose to spend our money on ourselves instead of having more children. Since the Statistical Abstract shows that birth rates are no longer falling, that route to rising affluence won't take us much farther. AS these examples suggest, browsing through statistics can be instructive if they are presented in such a way that their limitations are clear. By that standard the Statistical Abstract is not just inadequate but downright dangerous. It will continue to appeal to hard-core number junkies like myself, but it would need much more detailed notes to become useful to the average citizen. ''U/S'' provides more guidance for amateurs than the Statistical Abstract but not enough. Instead of formulating specific questions that readers might want answered and then trying to assemble all the data relevant to answering them, it titillates the reader with numbers; some say a lot and some little. Nonetheless, it seems to me that in this instance free enterprise has filled a real need. An hour spent browsing in ''U/ S'' will probably tell readers more things they didn't know about America than an hour spent reading any other book of this kind, and in nine cases out of 10 what they learn will probably be true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE NATION; Ex-Senators Urge Major Reform of Senate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/weekinreview/the-nation-ex-senators-urge-major-reform-of-senate-rules.html,"The United States Senate could become a much more efficient legislative machine under rule-change proposals submitted last week - unless the new rules become captives of the old. The changes would, among other things, limit the power small groups can exert on legislation through filibustering and other delaying tactics. Such changes would ''scare some people to death,'' said Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Republican majority leader, and are likely to face tough opposition. The proposals, from a study commmissioned by the Rules and Administration Committee, were fashioned by retired Senators James B. Pearson, Republican of Kansas, and Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut. Besides limiting debate and making it easier to end filibusters, they would limit the practice of attaching controversial riders - such as school prayer and abortion measures - to ''must'' legislation. Some conservative Senators -Jesse Helms, Republican of South Carolina, in particular - nettled legislative leaders with such tactics last year. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic minority leader, said Republican leaders were ''very much in the mood'' for reform ''because of the problem within its own ranks last fall.'' He was referring to a period of several weeks during which, in his words, ''a little determined handful'' of conservatives stalled legislation, including the gasoline tax bill, supported by a majority of their colleagues. After much acrimony, the measures were passed. Other ideas include setting annual agendas and weekly schedules for Senate business; appointing one senator as permanent presiding officer to strengthen the largely figurative authority of the chair; eliminating the Budget Committee, along with six others; stretching the budget process over two years instead of taking it up annually; and prohibiting senators from bringing up an issue more than once in a session. Hearings on the proposals are to begin May 9 before the Rules Committee, headed by Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Republican of Maryland. Senator Mathias seemed serious about making at least some changes aimed at curing what he said was the Senate's ''very serious problem in reaching decisions.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: PRIVATE LIVES vs. A PUBLIC PRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/11/arts/tv-private-lives-vs-a-public-press.html,"CBS NEWS makes a brave attempt to define the indefinable tonight. In its second ''Eye on the Media'' seminar, it gathers together some bright, feisty people, seats them at conference tables and sets loose a Harvard law professor to stir them up. The seminar is called ''Private Lives, Public Press,'' and the participants discuss the individual's right to privacy, which is sometimes opposed to journalism's right - or at least, wish - to know. In theory, a line must be drawn someplace; in practice, hardly anyone knows where. The program may be seen on Channel 2 at 10. The participants in the seminar are people from the arts, law, business and, of course, journalism, mostly of the electronic kind. The Harvard professor, Arthur R. Miller, presents them with hypothetical cases: Should the press, for example, report on a Congressman, a whited sepulcher, who cheats on his wife, sniffs cocaine and is not what he pretends to be? Does his morality really matter? Meanwhile, what the distinguished participants make clear when they discuss the hypothetical cases is this: The positions they take depends on who they are. Self-interest and personal predilections are at least as important as the ambiguous reaches of Constitutional law. Consider, for instance, another of Professor Miller's hypothetical cases: Felicia Forthright (the people in the cases all have cute names) is the leading Right to Life advocate in her state. She is also a woman of unblemished reputation. Then someone discovers that 25 years ago, at the age of 17, she had an abortion. Should the press report it? It is an interesting question, the answer trickier to find than it may seem. In real life, a journalist who found out about Mrs. Forthright's abortion would be greatly influenced by whether he liked Mrs. Forthright or not. The Right to Life movement has some dreadful harridans in its ranks; it also has some warm, generous, loving women. If Mrs. Forthright was among the latter, one supposes, many reporters, or their editors, would be more likely to bury the story. Real life, however, is one thing, and the seminar, which is sponsored by both CBS and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, is another. A seminar demands absolute answers; principles must be laid down. At this seminar, the case of Mrs. Forthright inspires real passion. William F. Buckley Jr., the celebrated conservative, says he would not report the abortion. Bob Schieffer, the chief Washington correspondent for CBS, says he would. Mr. Schieffer says that ''rich people can afford abortions, and poor people can't, and that's what this argument is all about.'' Mr. Buckley, however, says, ''The point is that she had an abortion when she was 17 years old.'' Mr. Buckley is on the verge of anger; so is Mr. Schieffer. Each begins to interrupt the other. Then they cross the verge of anger; clearly they are angry. ''It's the worst kind of elitism. You're going around saying, it's all right for me, but it's not all right for you,'' Mr. Schieffer says. He goes on to call Mr. Buckley's position ''immoral'' twice. ''This is not a seminar that defines the lengths of your curiosity. It's a seminar that defines the lengths of your licit curiosity,'' Mr. Buckley says coldly. Mr. Buckley is being a little obscure here, but no matter. Other participants immediately jump in, all critical of Mr. Buckley. In fact, there hasn't been much elitism or immorality in what he has said; there has been instead a political position, tempered with what seems to be humanity. Mr. Buckley has argued that if Mrs. Forthright has had an abortion, it is nobody's business but her own. Simultaneously, his political position - support for the Right to Life movement -has surfaced. Mr. Buckley's respondents, in turn, argue from their own political position; they are opposed to the Right to Life movement. The original issue, privacy, has been replaced. How one feels about Mrs. Forthright now depends on how one feels about the politics of abortion. Ideology, morality and reason are not necessarily compatible. It proves that a decent journalist should operate by the seat of his or her pants. Meanwhile, there is a good deal of one-upmanship in the one-hour discussion. Often the participants - Barbara Walters, Lauren Bacall, Morley Safer, the lawyer Floyd Abrams, among them - seem to be playing ''Can You Top This?'' It is annoying. Still, they are trying to discuss a serious issue, and they should be heard. It is a shame CBS has scheduled the program opposite the Academy Awards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TELEVISION WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/arts/television-week-093163.html,"Explosion of Emotion The Public Broadcasting Service's ''Kennedy Center Tonight'' series consists ''of performance kinds of programs,'' Dale Bell, executive producer said recently, ''but, unlike the Lincoln Center and 'Live From the Met' stuff, I've tried to make this series different, much more human, if you will.'' His latest attempt is Robinson Jeffers's adpatation of the Euripides tragedy ''Medea,'' starring Zoe Caldwell and Judith Anderson. The two re-create roles that earned them critical plaudits last year at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and on Broadway. ''Medea'' will be broadcast on Channel 13 Wednesday from 8 to 9:30 P.M. In the first Broadway production of Mr. Jeffers's adaptation, 36 years ago, Miss Anderson's Medea won her a Tony award and later Miss Caldwell was in the chorus when this production played in Australia. In recent stagings, Miss Anderson plays the Nurse and Miss Caldwell portrays the passionate heroine driven to infanticide. Miss Caldwell's husband, Robert Whithead, produced the 1947 and 1982 productions. For television, he said in a recent telephone interview, he ''sort of collaborated'' with Mark Cullingham, the director. ''The most interesting problem,'' Mr. Whitehead explained, ''was finding a way in which you could project the kind of classic size - the rather massive explosion of emotion and massive tragedy - with a camera three feet from the actors and actresses.'' Therefore, Mr. Whitehead said, despite the actresses' familiarity with the work, the television production required nearly three weeks of rehearsals at the old Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street. Taping took place last November on a soundstage in Toronto. Incidentally, Channel 13 will present ''Reflections on Medea,'' individual recollections by Miss Anderson, Miss Caldwell and Mr. Whitehead - the same evening at 11 P.M. The Abortion Experience ''We made this film,'' said Mark Obenhaus, referring to his documentary ''Abortion Clinic,'' ''because we thought this was an issue that had very little human dimension.'' Part of the Public Broadcasting Service's ''Frontline'' series, ''Abortion Clinic'' shows, perhaps for the first time on television, a doctor performing actual abortions. Jessica Savitch is the host and it will be telecast Monday at 8 P.M. Ironically, Mr. Obenhaus believes the abortion issue has been ''so politicized that people are talking about basically abstract ideas to such an extent that the actual experience of abortion and the actual experience of protesting abortion are sort of forgotten. The complexity of the experience is not really understood.'' His film is far from abstract. At a clinic in Chester, Pa., Mr. Obenhaus filmed interviews with two patients by clinic staff members before surgery, and the patients' personal feelings about the termination of their pregnancies. Outside the clinic, Mr. Obenhaus recorded anti-abortion protestors and a right-to-life physician who leads the weekly picketing and counsels pregnant women. Mr. Obenhaus calls his film ''observational in character.'' Break for Young Writer John McNamara, only 20 years old and a junior at New York University, has won a national playwriting contest. And now, his first screenplay, ''Revenge of the Nerd,'' an hour-long comedy, will be broadcast on ''The CBS Afternoon Playhouse,'' Tuesday at 4:30 P.M. Mr. McNamara's ''Present Tense,'' which won the Young Playwrights Festival of 1981, was produced Off Broadway. ''Winning the prize just set off a whole chain of events,'' Mr. McNamara said last week. ''I saw it as a break, and I was fairly determined that this was a good opportunity that might not present itself for years. I was determined to get at least an agent out of it and, if I could, an agent and a television assignment.'' And he did precisely that. Frank Doeiger of Highgate Television Productions saw ''Present Tense'' and asked if he could write for television. Mr. McNamara submitted ''Revenge of the Nerd.'' Another student, Ken Kwapis of the University of Southern California, for the first time in his career, did the rewriting and polishing. Does Mr. McNamara believe writing can be taught? ''It always depends on the teacher,'' he said. ''A good teacher will give you a set of guidelines and he will never let you stray from them. He always kicks you in the butt if you're lazy, but he never constricts what you want to say or what you want you to do.'' Demystifying Banking This week, two of the networks will be attempting to analyze the current scene in domestic and international finance. ''Banking on the Brink,'' an hour-long NBC Report with Marvin Kalb, will be broadcast Friday at 10 P.M. And ''On Borrowed Time'' will be presented on ABC on Thursday beginning at 10 P.M., with Pierre Salinger. Both networks concede they face two challenges: To present the material clearly and to show viewers interesting and relevant pictures. ''Only the viewer can say if we succeed,'' says James Gannon. Mr. Gannon, the NBC producer, says his report focuses on the revolution in banking in the past 25 years, especially the way banks get and distribute money. Since prominent bankers don't talk too much in public - for example, Walter B. Wriston, the chairman of Citicorp, said he was too busy to be interviewed - NBC's research included scrutiny of testimony on the collapse of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City and examination of the Mexican fiscal crisis. That crisis inspired the ABC documentary. Mr. Salinger said that ABC aims to show how American bankers' loans to developing countries came about, how the United States and third world countries depend upon one another, whether the bankers are really worried, how banks' profits are affected and how American workers and their pocketbooks are also affected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE G.O.P. MODERATES MAY CHART AN INDEPENDENT COURSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/weekinreview/senate-gop-moderates-may-chart-an-independent-course.html,"During a Senate Budget Committee meeting last week, Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, the ranking Democrat, proposed increasing taxes by $30 billion in fiscal year 1984. Senator Mark Andrews, a North Dakota Republican, crossed over and voted with a solid block of Democrats for the proposal. The Chiles amendment failed on a tie. But Mr. Andrews's defection was an important symbol of a new development: the determination of moderate Senate Republicans to separate themselves from the Reagan economic policy and become a more organized force in a chamber that is basically run by conservatives of their party. A few days before the budget vote, five senior Republican moderates proposed an alternative budget that called for even higher revenues than Mr. Chiles, plus more than $7 billion in additional spending on such programs as child nutrition and Medicaid. Like Mr. Andrews, the five lawmakers believe that the Reagan economic program is staggering, and that higher taxes are necessary to reduce the budget deficit and restore investor confidence. ''It is my view,'' said Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, one of the five dissidents, ''that reducing the Federal deficit to manageable proportions is the most important step we can take to reduce interest rates and thus provide jobs. An unemployment rate of 10 percent is intolerable.'' Reviving the 'Rockefeller Wing' The moderates' potential power was demonstrated when the budget panel recessed until early this week without resolving the tax issue, because the White House and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the panel chairman, did not have the votes to protect the third stage of the President's tax reduction program, scheduled to go into effect July 1. During the week's deliberations, the committee also rejected Mr. Reagan's proposal to freeze most domestic spending and actually added more than $11 billion in nondefense outlays. ''The President,'' Senator Andrews asserted, ''continues to think that all our problems will go away. But things aren't working that way.'' There has long been a split between conservatives and moderate Republicans, that group once known as the ''Rockefeller wing'' of the party. During the first two years of the Reagan Presidency, the moderates' success was negative - leading the fight against attempts to ban abortion, permit school prayer, and otherwise tamper with court jurisdictions. But their frustration level was building. As Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, one of the coauthors of the alternative budget, put it: ''Invariably, we were given a choice between this conservative program or that conservative program, this conservative contender or that one. We felt very strongly that we had to put together a group and start to affect the decisions made up here.'' Their determination was bolstered in November, when Senator Weicker, Senator Chafee and Senator Robert T. Stafford of Vermont narrowly won re-election. Returned to Washington convinced that their party had to shift course, they joined with Senators Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland and Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon to draft their own budget. ''We are Republicans, and we're proud of that fact,'' said Senator Weicker. ''But the image that has been created - in social terms, Constitutional terms, and racial terms - has been entirely wrong. And that could be permanently damaging to the party.'' The moderates could matter. The Republicans hold 54 Senate seats. If the 46 Democrats remain disciplined, and the dozen or so moderate Republicans stick together, a new coalition could exert considerable leverage. Those are, however, big ''ifs.'' A near dozen conservative Democrats often cross party lines, and the moderate Republicans have yet to prove that they can buck their party leadership and the White House on a regular basis. (Many of them are likely to go against the President this week, on repeal of income tax withholding on interest and dividends. Mr.Reagan again urged that the provision stand in his national radio address yesterday. But then, many conservatives also favor repeal.) Strong forces are driving the moderates toward a more independent stance. One of their main motives is the economic stagnation in the Frost Belt states that many represent. ''I don't think the signs of economic recovery are conclusive,'' Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said. ''In my state,'' he added, ''there's been no pick up at all, and a lot more needs to be done.'' As their budget proposals indicated, the moderates advocate more direct Government aid to the needy. Senator Stafford spoke for many of them when he said, ''We cannot abandon the victims of the economy on the battlefield.'' On a deeper level, the moderates also want Government to deal with the longer-range structural problems of their aging industrial areas. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a state that relies heavily on the automobile industry, said, ''We have a very sizeable transition going on that won't cure itself.'' As Senator Chafee noted, the moderates believe that economic recovery can only be stimulated by higher taxes, lower deficits and declining interest rates. A specific aim of the moderates is the Senate leadership. When Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee retires next year, one of their number, they hope, will win a place among the powerholders. They also believe that their influence over the Administration's economic program could strongly color the elections of 1984. ''Our ability to get the President re-elected, and to keep Republicans in office, depends on our ability to do a good job running the Government,'' said Senator Specter. ''Republicans are responsible for running the government, and we've got to do it right.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN DEFENSE OF BUSING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/magazine/in-defense-of-busing.html,"Lee A Daniels is a reporter on the Metropolitan staff of The Times. Today, hundreds of school buses routinely traverse the 540 square miles that comprise the Charlotte-Mecklenburg countywide publicschool system, carrying 48,000 pupils every day - 12,000 of whom travel in accordance with the 1969 Federal court order that desegregated the public schools in this North Carolina community. Contrary to the popular opinion that ''forced busing'' has failed in the United States, it seems to have worked effectively in Charlotte, the nation's 31st-largest school system, with a total of 73,000 pupils. And busing is apparently supported by the vast majority of pupils, their parents and the city's leaders. The first wave of desegregation was turbulent despite the area's generally enlightened political and social tradition. From 1970 to 1973, this ''New South'' city of 324,000 saw each of its 10 senior high schools closed temporarily because of racial fighting. Alfred Alexander, a 1971 West Charlotte High School graduate whose classes had previously been overwhelmingly black, recalls his first year of desegregation. ''It was rough here,'' he says. ''We were so segregated that many blacks had never encountered whites close up, either. So there was a lot of tension. ... A fight between two people, if one was white and the other black, became not just a personal thing, but the start of a race riot.'' Today, the prevailing view of school integration in Charlotte is similar to that expressed by Christi Derreberry, a white junior at East Mecklenburg High School. ''I don't think segregated schools would be very interesting,'' she says. ''Here you learn to work with different kinds of people.'' Charlotte is one of busing's many success stories, yet busing is widely perceived as a failure. Certainly, as the end of another school year draws near and the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling outlawing ''separate but equal'' education aproaches, the controversy over busing refuses to go away. In nearly every session since 1968, Congress has passed antibusing legislation. Presidents Nixon and Ford publicly condemned mandatory busing and directed the Justice Department to defeat it through the courts. President Reagan and his conservative Administration have been even more outspoken in their denunciations of busing to achieve racial balance and have actively sought to curtail its enforcement. In recent months, in communities across the country, busing has been in the headlines: In an effort to avoid litigation, St. Louis and surrounding school systems are attempting a voluntary busing plan that would transport schoolchildren across district lines. Ordered to desegregate its schools in 1955, the East Baton Rouge, La., school system recently presented the court with an alternative to busing that critics have labeled a ''blueprint for segregation.'' In Los Angeles, a mandatory busing program was ended last fall by court decree after Californians voted to adopt the stricter Federal standards requiring proof of intent on the part of local or state authorities to segregate schools. Yet a remarkable transformation has occurred in school desegregration since the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that legally segregated public education was unconstitutional. As the Federal Government forced Southern state and local governments to desegregate, the region's public schools became more integrated - primarily because of racially focused busing - than many schools in the North and West. A report released in January by the Joint Center for Political Studies, a Washington-based research organization, indicated that Southern and border states continue to lead the nation in the desegregation of black students, while segregation is increasing in the Northeast; segregation of Hispanics has risen sharply nationwide. Yet President Reagan, Attorney General William French Smith and Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Divison, William Bradford Reynolds have repeatedly asserted that mandatory busing plans are ill-considered and unworkable and that voluntary measures are the best means of achieving desegregation. The Justice Department has joined in court other parties seeking to reduce or eliminate busing plans in Seattle, Tacoma and Pasco, Wash., and Nashville, Tenn., but the courts have ruled against all these attempts. Washington's political drumbeat against busing unquestionably reflects the opinion of many whites and some blacks and Hispanics. Polls show that while support for desegregated schools continues to increase, disapproval of busing as a means to accomplish it has hardened. ''If mandatory busing had proven to be effective in desegregating school systems across the country,'' says Assistant Attorney General Reynolds, ''then I think you would probably have a much different public response. But time after time, in jurisdiction after jurisdiction, it's been shown that (busing) has not been effective, and as a result of that, public education has suffered mightily.'' But many civil-rights professionals and academic desegregation experts argue that such remarks are completely at variance with the facts about racially focused busing, and they have presented substantial evidence that busing largely works. Their research shows that, contrary to popular opinion, busing has usually been imposed only after careful consideration and, in many cases, after voluntary desegregation measures have been tried and proved unsuccessful. It has found that minority students generally have made academic gains without damaging the scholastic performance of whites. In most instances, the health and safety of students has not been jeopardized; nor have they been forced to travel extraordinary distances to school. Busing does not consume a large portion of the school system's budget, nor does it subvert the so-called neighborhood-school principle. Their assertions have been bolstered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, which concluded after hearings in 1981 that ''busing achieves a degree of desegregation that is unattainable through other means.'' In addition, contrary to opinion polls that show an antibusing sentiment among a majority of Americans who have had little or no personal experience of racially focused busing, a March 1981 Harris poll found overwhelming support for it among families whose children had actually been bused for racial desegregation. Of those parents polled, 54 percent said the busing experience had proved very satisfactory; another 33 percent said it had been partially satisfactory, and 11 percent said it was not satisfactory. ''These latest findings,'' the Harris report stated, ''are diametrically opposed to the general impression that such busing has been a disaster where it has been tried.'' Statistics from Government agencies and desegregation studies show, for example, that busing is the norm rather than the exception in American school life: About 55 percent of all public-school pupils are bused daily. Of that number, only 7 percent - or fewer than 4 percent of all public-school students - are bused to achieve racial desegregation. Charles D. Moody and Jeffrey D. Ross of the University of Michigan School of Education found ''suggestive evidence that more pupils are being transported at public expense to racially segregated schools - including public schools, private schools, parochial schools and recently organized Protestant church-related 'academies' - than for purposes of school desegregation.'' Studies also show that the median travel time for all elementaryschool pupils being bused, for whatever reasons, is less than 15 minutes; only 15 percent of the youngsters travel more than 30 minutes to and from school; and busing generally consumes no more than 2 percent of a school department's budget. Because children in many deliberately segregated school systems often were bused long distances in order to maintain segregation, the number of miles buses travel after desegregation may actually decrease even though more students are being bused. A 1970 study found, for example, that the number of students bused in Georgia in the late 1960's to foster significant desegregation increased by 14,434, but that bus mileage declined by 473,662 miles. Federal District Judge James B. McMillan, who presided over the Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education case from the late 1960's to the mid-1970's, put it in plain terms before a Senate subcommittee in 1981: ''Busing is necessary, legal, cheap, safe and practical.'' harlotte's staunch resistance to the Federal court order weakened after 1971 when the Supreme Court upheld Judge McMillan's order to desegregate the county's school system. The city's business and political leaders began stressing the public's duty to obey the law. Parents of bused children organized themselves to make the busing plan less cumbersome. In 1973, Charlotte voters replaced three antibusing school-board members with candidates who had counseled acceptance of the court plan. Quiet returned to the schools. Last June, Charlotte, where the racial makeup of the schools has changed in 15 years from 71 percent white and 29 percent black to 62 percent white and 38 percent black, graduated its first class of ''desegregation babies'' - 4,900 seniors who had attended integrated schools all their lives. School desegregation and the busing still necessary to achieve it have largely disappeared as topics of public controversy, especially among the current crop of students, most of whom know nothing other than racially mixed schools. Jeffrey Taylor is student-body president of East Mecklenburg High School, where the 2,089 students are 76 percent white, 18 percent black and 6 percent Asian and others. ''It's evident from the way things go on here,'' he says, ''that black students are involved in the school just like white students.'' Jeffrey, a white senior, points out that his opponent in the presidential campaign was black. ''They needed a runoff to decide between us,'' he says. ''It was that close, and there was no racial bloc voting.'' Sonja Gantt, who is black, presides over the school's 630-student senior class, of which fewer than 100 are black. ''I feel very proud,'' she says, referring to her election as class president, ''because it shows me most of my classmates, whatever their color, look at me as a leader.'' ''Race isn't a topic here,'' says Lynne Cosper, another white East Mecklenburg student, whose family moved to Charlotte from New Jersey nearly two years ago. ''People don't separate along racial lines.'' ''It's hard to remember the pain and agony of those first years because we've now replaced it with something else,'' says Richard Cansler, the white principal of West Charlotte High School for two years and a veteran of Charlotte's schools for 19 years. ''We're still in the years of change; we don't have a perfect society here,'' he quickly adds, strolling across the school's campus. ''But we've come a long way.'' Leroy (Pop) Miller, West Charlotte's former assistant principal, who recently retired as head of East Mecklenburg, points out that his school has 41 extracurricular clubs, a ''very helpful'' parent Boosters' Club, a comprehensive program for handicapped students and the top girls' cross-country team in the state. ''A student body should be a reflection of the total community,'' he says. ''We have a school community that works.'' Charlotte owes its success to more than just its tradition of public spiritedness. Its switch to a countywide school system in 1960 meant that anxious parents could not flee to the suburbs to escape desegregation. Also, the area's schools have long enjoyed an excellent reputation, and, in sharp contrast to many other cities, Charlotte's black and white middle and upper classes kept their children in public schools throughout the desegregation crisis. Why, if busing can be as successful as it has been in Charlotte, is there such a gap between the reality of busing and antibusing rhetoric? Willis D. Hawley, dean of Vanderbilt University's George Peabody College for Teachers, believes one reason is the mixed conclusions of various studies conducted in the mid-1970's on the impact of school desegregation - far too soon to assess a situation that was limited both in scope and numbers of children bused. ''People found no conclusive evidence then that it outweighed the costs involved,'' he explains, ''and although that conclusion has now decisively changed, little attention has been paid to it.'' Gary Orfield, professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a desegregation expert, speculates that the gap partially results from a propensity of both politicians and others to focus on busing's glaring failures to the exclusion of its successes. Conclusions about busing and school desegregation are, more often than not, drawn from what occurred in Los Angeles and Boston, two major cities where school authorities fiercely resisted minimal desegregation plans, and not from what has happened in Charlotte, Pontiac, Mich., or Tampa-Hillsborough County, Fla., three of the far larger number of communities where desegregation and busing have been accepted after initial periods of turmoil. James M. Nabrit 3d, associate counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., suggests that mandatory desegregation has become a lightning rod for a range of grievances about social change and the influence of judicial and Federal authority. Like other such high-intensity political issues as abortion, the death penalty and school prayer, says Nabrit, the depth of emotion about racially focused busing simply overwhelms any countervailing data. Until the 1970's, school segregation outside the South was widely assumed to be incidental or de facto, the result of individual preference and the natural development of neighborhoods and communities. But the record of court cases in such communities as Boston, Detroit, Indianapolis, Denver, Dayton, Pontiac and Minneapolis proved that Northern officials could be as zealously discriminatory as their Southern counterparts. School officials in these cities were found to have manipulated school grade structures, locations and sizes, gerrymandered attendance zones and, when all else failed, bused pupils to foster and preserve segregation. Boston's legacy of institutionalized racism contributes today to its poorly desegregated public schools. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 1855 that Boston could build schools exclusively for black children and prohibit their attendance at other public schools. The decision later became an underpining for the United States Supreme Court's 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling in favor of separate but equal schooling. During the 1960's, Boston's black community sought to negotiate the end of a segregated school system in which black children represented 23 percent of the student population. Its requests were repeatedly rebuffed by the all-white Boston School Committee and later by the majority of the city's white electorate. A 1974 Federal District Court decision later found that during the 1960's the Boston school board had taken numerous and deliberate steps to segregate the schools further. Boston's English High School, founded in 1820 and the first public high school in the United States, offered a particularly poignant example of the lengths school officials went to in order to maintain segregated schools. The Federal Court determined that, starting in 1967, the school had changed, under the direction of school authorities, from an institution drawing its students from all over Boston to one largely limited to taking those from predominantly black elementary and junior high schools. As a result, English High's enrollment changed from 80 percent white to 81 percent black within five years. Simultaneously, the school board withdrew needed educational resources from the school. Intensive resistance to desegregation on the part of Boston's school officials stoked the embers of racial hatred that, coming from the ''Athens of America,'' surprised and fascinated the rest of the country in the mid-1970's. Resistance accomplished two things: It foreclosed the opportunity to establish voluntarily desegregation procedures that likely would have involved a minimum of busing, and it raised the hopes of whites that desegregation would never occur. In the face of the court ruling, which required busing within a single city district, whites continued to resist desegregation fervently, and white public-school enrollment began a precipitous citywide decline, from 53,593 in 1973 to 18,592 today. Although Boston has had tremendous difficulties - including sporadic racial violence - desegregation has forced upon the school system reforms that would not be possible otherwise. These reforms include an upgraded occupational-education program, a greater number of magnet schools and the direct involvement of area businesses and colleges in the affairs of the high schools. Unquestionably, busing suffered a political defeat because of the intransigence of whites, but busing advocates would argue that Boston's ''failure'' represents a lack of political will rather than a failure of busing itself. Boston's attempt at desegregation underscores two major new developments, both studied by Gary Orfield of the University of Chicago. Although viewed as a national policy problem, severe segregation now occurs in a relatively small number of states, often in only one metropolitan area. Yet these states have the largest percentages of minority children. Of these states, Illinois, New York, Michigan and New Jersey have the greatest number of black children in segregated schools; only Florida and North Carolina have achieved significant desegregation. Boston also casts in sharp relief the central role of metropolitan busing plans involving both city and suburbs. Most of the desegregated Southern communities were small or had countywide school systems like Charlotte-Mecklenburg. As Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and others cities outside the South were investigated, the problem became increasingly apparent: How could desegregation be achieved in school systems that were or would soon become predominantly black and Hispanic? In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that metropolitan desegregation plans could be ordered only if suburban or state officials had deliberately contributed to school segregation in the city. Such collaboration has been proved in several cases, including Wilmington, Del., Louisville, Ky., and Denver, Colo., among others. Despite the objections critics raise to compulsory desegregation on a metropolitan scale, advocates such as William Taylor, a former official of the United States Civil Rights Commission and now director of Catholic University's Center for National Policy Review, insist such a program is virtually the only way to break the racial and class segregation that consigns most black and Hispanic children to large core-city schools. Referring to studies showing that metropolitan plans lead to a greater integration of housing as well as to a greater socioeconomic mix of students, Taylor asserts, ''Metropolitan and countywide desegregation plans may be the most effective way to achieve integrated schools, stable integrated neighborhoods and bettereducated children in both large cities and rural areas.'' Over the next five years, for example, 15,000 to 20,000 black students from St. Louis's predominantly black school system will be bused to 22 predominantly white Missouri county districts as part of a desegregation plan arising from an 11-year-old suit. White suburban children will be encouraged to transfer to city ''magnet'' schools offering special programs. The suburban jurisdictions agreed to participate in order to avoid litigation about their responsibility for St. Louis's segregated schools. Busing's critics have charged that it causes whites to abandon the cities. James S. Coleman, the sociologist at the University of Chicago whose 1966 study, ''Equality of Educational Opportunity,'' played a significant role in broadening support for busing, reversed his position in 1975, claiming that later research proved mandatory busing had actually increased educational segregation because it drove whites to suburbia. Presented with countervailing facts gathered by other scholars, Coleman later conceded that his research was not conclusive, but says that he still believes busing is counterproductive. Attributing ''white flight'' solely to busing ''racializes'' the long-term exodus of middle-class children from urban public schools by ''focusing on race and not class,'' charges Michael Sussman, a former staff attorney in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, who is now an assistant general counsel with the N.A.A.C.P. This large-scale migration of whites to the suburbs began shortly after World War II, Sussman points out, and its causes included record levels of suburban housing construction, changing job patterns and discriminatory housing practices that made suburbs all-white enclaves. This pattern, combined with the sharply declining birthrate of whites relative to blacks and Hispanics, explains the continuing decline in white public-school enrollments in most large cities. The Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawing segregated schools required only that courts order school officials to correct intentional segregation, but judges have responded to the spirit of the law as well as to the demands of civil-rights groups and black parents that black children receive a quality education in their desegregated setting. The courts have ordered school faculties and staffs to be desegregated and curriculums changed to improve the education available to all students. In Charlotte, where the turmoil of the first years of desegregation noticeably affected the public school system's traditionally good test-score showings, scores in recent years have once again equaled or surpassed national norms in reading and mathematics. School officials also report that the gap between black and white students on the North Carolina Minimum Skills Competency Test continues to diminish. One review of 93 studies examining the academic impact of desegregation on various school systems found that minority students' performance in class work and on standardized tests noticeably improved and that white students' performance at least kept pace with predesegregation levels. These studies showed that, because of their previously inferior schooling, minority students required at least two years before any positive impact on their academic work became evident. They also determined that minority students with the longest experience with desegregated education performed the best. These findings, busing advocates contend, have been reinforced by those of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, surveys conducted by the Education Commission of the United States and the Government's primary means of monitoring elementaryand secondary-school students' academic progress. Beyond these relatively immediate results, James M. McPartland, codirector of the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University, has discovered that school desegregation also produces important long-term effects. In comparing black children in segregated schools with those in desegregated schools, he found that the latter were more likely to be aware of and have a positive outlook on career opportunities; have higher levels of educational aspiration and attainment; attend traditionally white rather than traditionally black colleges; pursue careers beyond those traditionally gained by blacks, and experience greater social mobility. In short, he found that ''present-day student experiences in desegregated schools lay the foundation for a natural reduction of segregation in adult life and in future generations.'' In 1981, a Federal District Court judge ordered substantial changes in the 10-year-old desegregation plan of Nashville-Davidson County schools, including the easing of metropolitan busing requirements and the return of most elementary-school pupils to neighborhood schools. Critics claimed the decision would have significantly increased school segregation. When the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned the decision, the Justice Department joined the local school board's appeal to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal without comment. The N.A.A.C.P.'s Thomas Atkins maintains that the Reagan Administration's other efforts to curtail busing will be equally ineffective ''because the facts and the law are against them.'' However, Nabrit of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund believes the Administration's active opposition is significant because ''the Justice Department has substantial resources it could bring to bear in a positive way on this issue.'' The Reagan Administration's actions have already convinced many civil-rights activists that current Federal policy, in the words of a recent report of the Washington Council of Lawyers, a private, nonpartisan association of attorneys, signifies that '' 'separate but equal' schooling, illegal for a generation, has again become acceptable.'' Reynolds of the Justice Department denies this, stressing that the Administration is simply seeking ''alternative ways to achieve more progress than has been demonstrated to be achieved under the old formulas. ... We're doing everything we can to enforce civil rights.'' But, according to Orfield of the University of Chicago, the Administration's insistence on the effectiveness of voluntary programs is not supported by the history of school desegregation. He maintains that of the hundreds of communities that have undergone school desegregation, only Teaneck, N.J., in the early 1960's and Seattle, Tacoma and Pasco, Wash., two years ago, have done so without at least the threat of a court order. Further, he says, several school desegregation cases have had to be re-opened after it became evident that voluntary programs were not eliminating segregation. In recent years, opposition to court-ordered busing has received additional support from an unexpected quarter: from blacks themselves. In the early 1970's, Atlanta's blacks were granted control over that city's school board in exchange for not pursuing a metropolitan-wide desegregation case through the courts. The blacks favoring the arrangement, the so-called Atlanta Compromise, asserted that once blacks had the authority to address the educational needs of black children, desegregation would be unnecessary. Their political success soon spawned similar but unsuccessful attempts by blacks in Dallas, Cleveland, San Francisco and Detroit. Recently in Boston, where a local poll found that a majority of blacks surveyed were against busing, a group of black parents asked the Federal judge to reduce the scope of the court-ordered busing plan, a request the N.A.A.C.P. is opposing. A Boston Globe poll found that about 75 percent of the blacks polled opposed the busing plan, arguing, among other things, that their children could get a quality education in their neighborhood schools. In fact, a group of black parents unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal District Court to change the busing plan to one allowing free choice as long as the school involved contained a student body whose racial mix corresponded to that of the school system as a whole, according to Larry Johnson, a staff attorney at the Center for Law and Education, a public-interest legal organization. Johnson, who has been involved in the Boston case since 1977, says the black parents believe ''we have reached the time when mandatory assignments are no longer required and free choice is in the best interests of them and their children.'' Johnson remarks that the parents who advocate this position do not necessarily think the ''momentum'' of the school board's past segregative activity has changed. Rather, it is that the nine-year struggle over the plan forced black parents to become more involved in school affairs and more sophisticated about getting what they want. In addition, black opinion makers such as the columnist William Raspberry and Derrick Bell, dean of the University of Oregon Law School, have argued that the busing issue wastes black political and educational energies in return for small, ambiguous gains. ''The issue that gets obscured,'' says Raspberry, ''is how to educate children who come from homes whose parents put little value on education, on discipline, and where they get little of the help which middle-class kids routinely do. ''These aren't racial problems at all,'' he continues, ''and you don't solve them by sending kids from one school to the next. ''I am an integrationist who believes nonetheless that as far as school desegregation is concerned a proper emphasis should be the education of the black children. I believe that black children can be taught and can learn in black schools.'' Atkins of the N.A.A.C.P. insists that fundamentally what black and white critics of busing advocate, though for different reasons, is ''separate but equal'' schools: They would rather forego desegregation in exchange for the allocation of greater resources to heavily minority schools. The separate-but-equal concept underlies last year's Federal court ruling establishing a voluntary plan for Chicago, where, civil-rights advocates say, school officials have resisted desegregation for nearly 20 years. Black and Hispanic students now constitute 81 percent of the system's enrollment; 320 of its 540 schools have student populations that are 85 percent or more nonwhite. Under the ruling, most of these schools will remain unchanged, but receive additional funds for staff and curriculum development. The N.A.A.C.P. plans to appeal the decision. Given that black and Hispanic students outnumber white pupils in most of the country's 50 largest central-city school districts, some ask whether the separate-but-equal approach might not be the only option for these schools. But in response, Atkins and Orfield, among others, raise several questions: What safeguards are there to insure that the promised extra resources will continue to be allocated in this era of strained local, state and Federal budgets? Will teachers' unions accept community control over school curriculums and personnel? And what is to be done for Hispanic students? Orfield stated in a recent report to the House Subcommitee on Civil and Constitutional Rights that, while the desegregation trends for blacks were varied, ''the pattern for Hispanic students is overwhelmingly toward greater segregation.'' They are, he said, ''more and more likely to find themselves in schools with large numbers of the poor, the non-English-speaking and other minorities.'' The separate-but-equal concept would seem to ignore the fundamental point of the Brown v. Board decision: One group's power to segregate another - no matter how disguised by equal or extra resources, or sweetened by political payoffs - effectively restrains that group's social mobility. Such power also imposes an overwhelming burden on the segregated group's material and psychological well-being. Doesn't ''separate but equal'' overlook, too, the evidence offered by communities like Charlotte that busing to achieve desegregation can work?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1965 MEMOS SHOW DOW'S ANXIETY ON DIOXIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/19/us/1965-memos-show-dow-s-anxiety-on-dioxin.html,"Almost 20 years ago, scientists from four rival chemical companies attended a closed meeting at the Dow Chemical Company's headquarters. The subject was the health hazards of dioxin, a toxic contaminant found in a widely used herbicide that the companies manufactured. Shortly after the meeting, in Midland, Mich., on March 24, 1965, one of those attending wrote in a memorandum that Dow did not want its findings about dioxin made public because the situation might ''explode'' and generate a new wave of government regulation for the chemical industry. Another scientist noted that at the meeting, Dow officials had disclosed a study showing that dioxin caused ''severe'' liver damage in rabbits. Dioxin, which has also been linked to birth defects and skin disorders in laboratory animals, is believed to be the deadliest chemical made by man, but its effects on humans have been difficult to prove. Since the Midland meeting, various studies have yielded conflicting evidence on whether dioxin increases the risk of cancer in humans. Although it has been known for many years that Dow held the 1965 meeting with its competitors, excerpts from corporate memorandums about the session are only now beginning to emerge as a result of a lawsuit filed in 1979 against Dow and several other chemical companies. The memorandums raise the possibility that Dow scientists have been saying one thing in private about dioxin while the company's management has said something else in public. ''There is absolutely no evidence of dioxin doing any damage to humans except for something called chloracne,'' Paul F. Oreffice, the president of Dow, said last month on NBC's ''Today'' show. ''It's a rash.'' Dow has performed medical tests on individuals suffering from chloracne for ''over 20 years,'' he added, ''and there is no evidence of any damage other than this rash which went away soon after.'' Dow's critics challenge the accuracy of Mr. Oreffice's flat assertion that there is no evidence that dioxin causes human damage other than chloracne and also charge that Dow has failed to publish all the information it has collected in its own dioxin research. Furthermore, they say, Dow has systematically resisted Federal and state efforts to learn about and regulate dioxin. According to a pretrial motion filed by Yannacone & Associates, the legal organization created to represent the Vietnam veterans in the Agent Orange case, the 1965 meeting on dioxin was attended by eight of Dow's senior scientists and six officials of Hooker Chemical; the Diamond Alkali Company, which later became part of Diamond Shamrock, and the Hercules Powder Company. A representative of the Monsanto Chemical Company was invited but did not attend. Donald R. Frayer, a spokesman for Dow, confirmed in an interview April 5 that the giant chemical company had called the meeting to discuss the health hazards of dioxin. ''We feel the meeting was pretty darn straightforward and proper,'' he said. ''I think on the balance that the record shows we discovered a problem, sought out our competitors and tried to give them information and a means to control the problem.'' Invitation to Meeting The pretrial motion filed by Yannacone & Associates quoted a number of documents. V.K. Rowe, then director of Dow's Biochemical Research Laboratory, said in his invitation to the meeting that Dow had been researching ''toxicological problems caused by the presence of certain highly toxic impurities in certain samples'' of the herbicide 2,4,5-T and wished to share its findings. The Dow laboratory was and is recognized as one of the world's finest privately owned toxicology labs. Two days after the meeting, C.L. Dunn, a chemist who was manager for regulatory affairs for Hercules, summarized in writing what he had been told. ''Dow says that their examination of their own and competitors' 2,4,5-T products contain what they call 'surprisingly high' amounts of the toxic impurities,'' he wrote. ''In addition to the skin effect,'' he wrote, describing the results of tests on rabbits, ''liver damage is severe, and a noeffect level based on liver response has not yet been established. Even vigorous washing of the skin 15 minutes after application will not prevent damage and may possibly enhance the absorption of the material. There is some evidence it is systemic.'' Fear on Situation Dr. John Frawley, the chief toxicologist for Hercules, who had also attended the March meeting, got a follow-up telephone call four months later from Earl Farnum, a Dow executive. Dr. Frawley immediately wrote a confidential memorandum to the file. Mr. Farnum, he wrote, said he was calling on behalf of a Dow vice president, Donald Baldwin, and ''stated that Dow was extremely frightened that this situation might explode.'' ''They are aware that their competitors are marketing 2,4,5-T which contains 'alarming amounts' of acnegen,'' Dr. Frawley continued, referring to dioxin, ''and if the Government learns about this the whole industry will suffer. They are particularly fearful of a Congressional investigation and excessive restrictive legislation on the manufacture of pesticides which might result.'' A second memorandum written by Dr. Frawley, and quoted in part by lawyers for the veterans, said he had just received new information about health effects of dioxin from Monsanto, which did not send a representative to the meeting. ''From the data provided, a sample which contained 5 parts per million would be acutely toxic,'' he wrote. ''Whether this refers to death or liver damage is not clear.'' Daniel Bishop, a Monsanto spokesman, said in an interview that his company ''didn't do any testing, period, not then and not now.'' He said that a fair reading of Dr. Frawley's full statement would make it clear that he had not received the toxicity information from Monsanto, but was not able to identify the information's source because the material in the Agent Orange case had been sealed by the judge. The documents were sealed at the chemical companies' request. Group of 75 Compounds Dioxin is the name given to any of a family of 75 compounds, called dibenzo-para-dioxins, composed of benzene molecules and oxygen atoms. The compounds are an unwanted byproduct of several chemical processes, including the manufacture of 2,4,5-T under certain circumstances; 2-4,5-T is one of the two major components of Agent Orange. Proving the specific effects of toxic chemicals on humans is extremely difficult; human experiments are generally prohibited by medical ethics. Animal tests, which are universally accepted by scientists as providing essential guidance on appropriate exposure levels for humans, are not a perfect guide because various species react differently. In laboratory rats, concentrations as small as five parts per 1,000 million have caused statistically significant increases of cancer in rats. Two studies, conducted on a group of forestry workers in northern Sweden and on a group of agriculture workers in southern Sweden, point to a possible association between exposure to herbicides contaminated with dioxin and an increased risk of soft-tissue cancers. Other studies, however, including one in New Zealand, show no higher risk of cancers for a group of farmers, foresters and fisherman exposed to dioxin than in men in other occupations. Dr. Samuel S. Epstein, a physician who is professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, cites the Swedish studies and other research on such questions as reproductive abnormalities to challenge the statement of Dow's president that there is no evidence that dioxin causes any more damage than a skin rash. ''For Mr. Oreffice to make that statement is absurd,'' he said in a recent interview. Warning on Dioxin Studies On March 23, Dr. Perry J. Gehrig, Dow's vice president for agricultural research and development and director of health and environmental science, cautioned the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources, Agriculture Research and Environment against ''ove@rinterpreting'' the Swedish studies. The reports, he argued, ''are too incomplete, both individually and in aggregate, to currently formulate a clear picture of the possible associations between TCDD and soft-tissue sarcomas.'' TCDD is a form of dioxin. In 1982, Dow scientists published a report of a company survey on the occurrence of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, infant deaths and several categories of birth defects among the wives of Dow workers who had been directly exposed to dioxin. The study concluded there were few differences in the number and kind of birth abnormalities found in these women compared with the wives of Dow workers not exposed to dioxin, and the report has been used frequently to support the theory that dioxin is not as dangerous as generally believed. But Dr. Marvin S. Legator, professor and director of environmental toxicology at the University in Texas in Galveston, questions the study. ''Initially,'' Dr. Legator went on, ''Dow planned on comparing the birth defects among the wives of Dow dioxin workers with two controls. First, a group of wives of Dow workers in Midland who had not been directly exposed to dioxin, and second, some wives of workmen who lived outside the Midland area. This second control group was important because the Midland area is quite polluted and the general population has a relatively high level of congenital abnormalities. But when they published the study the second control group was not included.'' A 'Sampling Problem' Mr. Frayer, the Dow spokesman, said the second group had been deleted because of ''sampling problems.'' ''The women could not be compared with those in the first two groups, and they were questioned in a different way,'' Mr. Frayer said. Information compiled by Dr. Alvin Young, an expert at the Veterans Administration, indicates that from 1961 to 69 American companies made a total of 154.5 million pounds of 2,4,5-T. Of that total, 44 million pounds were applied to the jungles of Vietnam, 23.4 million pounds were exported to other countries and 78.1 million pounds were used domestically. The balance, 10 million pounds, was destroyed by the Government after it was decided to halt the Vietnam defoliation program. Dr. Young estimates that 1,700 pounds of dioxin a year were produced in the United States from the mid-1950's to about 1975, when steps were taken to limit it through changing the manufacturing process. There is broad agreement that a substantial portion of dioxincontaminated wastes are buried in thousands of dumps around the country. The Environmental Protection Agency recently said there were 12,000 of these dumps. Other experts have estimated the number may be closer to 50,000. Suits Against Companies Billions of dollars are at stake in the answer to the question of what the chemical companies knew and when they knew it. In addition to the tens of thousands of veterans who have sued the chemical companies because of their exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, thousands of other Americans living near toxic dumps, such as the one in the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls, N.@Y., are seeking damages on the grounds that dioxin and chemical poisons left there have shortened their lives and caused cancer, birth defects and genetic damage. In January 1979, a group of veterans brought a Federal suit in New York, charging that the dioxin contained in the 2,4,5-T sprayed in Vietnam was a cause of cancer and other diseases among their members and had resulted in genetic damage and the birth of severely deformed children. Victor John Yannacone Jr., a principal organizer of the association of lawyers handling the class-action suit, said in a recent interview that the group now represents 20,000 Vietnam veterans, widows and children of veterans who are seeking damages against the chemical companies that provided the Government with Agent Orange. The suit against Dow and the other major manufacturers of 2,4,5-T is scheduled to go to trial in the Uniondale, L.I., court of Federal District Judge George C. Pratt Jr. in June. E.P.A. Action Opposed In an annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington called a 10-K, Dow said it was one of six chemical companies who were defendants in the suit. ''Dow believes it has not been scientifically demonstrated that the injuries claimed by the plaintiffs were caused or could have been caused by exposure to Agent Orange,'' the report said. The Dow report also noted that the chemical company was opposing a move by the Environmental Protection Agency initiated during the Carter Administration that would totally ban the use of 2,4,5-T in the United States. The herbicide therefore is still being used on rice fields, on range lands and in industrial areas such as refineries, to control weeds. The company's repeated public statements about the comparative safety of dioxin, including testimony to Congressional committees, press releases and scientific papers, have been accompanied by efforts on its part, particularly in the Reagan Administration, to block the Government from collecting information about the contaminant. Evidence of the repeated contacts between Dow and E.P.A. officials in Washington, if not of the subject of the meetings, is contained in the calendars and travel records of these officials that have been obtained by the House subcommittees investigating the agency. Links to Government Anne McGill Burford, for example, made at least two trips to Midland, Mich., in her 22 months as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rita M. Lavelle, the former head of the Government program to clean up toxic waste dumps, met at least 14 times with Dow officials in the 11 months she held office. Mrs. Burford, Miss Lavelle and 11 other political appointees recently resigned or were dismissed amid Congressional inquiries on allegations that the agency's toxic waste program had been mishandled. According to the public testimony of some officials of the agency, Dow used its connections with the top echelon of the agency's Washington officials to get its way on several important matters relating to the regulation of dioxin. Three weeks ago, for example, agency officials in Chicago told the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that their superiors in Washington ordered them to change an important report on dioxin to comply with the wishes of Dow. The key deletion from the report was the following central conclusion about Dow's Midland plant: ''Dow's discharge represented the major source, if not the only source, of TCDD contamination found in the Tittabawassse and Saginaw Rivers and Saginaw Bay in Michigan.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FULL SENATE GETS ABORTION MEASURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/20/us/full-senate-gets-abortion-measure.html,"The Senate Judiciary Committee today sent a constitutional amendment to the floor that would reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The vote was 9 to 9, which means that the committee acted without a positive endorsement. The committee's vote reflected the obstacles facing the proposed amendment. Two senators who have generally supported such antiabortion measures, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, and Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, switched sides and opposed the amendment. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who proposed the amendment, acknowleged in an interview, ''The odds are heavily against us.'' But Senator Hatch noted the Senate leadership had promised to hold a full-scale debate on the proposed amendment this spring. Debate is 'Important Thing' ''The important thing is the debate,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''Sometimes it takes years to get a constitutional amendment through.'' Lobbyists who advocate the right to choose an abortion said they were pleased by the tie vote, and they expressed optimism about blocking the measure on the Senate floor. A two-thirds vote is needed in each house of Congress to send a change in the Constitution to the states, and Joanne Howes, legislative representative of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said, ''There aren't the votes out there to pass it. We know it and they know it.'' The Hatch amendment, co-sponsored by Senator Thomas F. Eagleton, Democrat of Missouri, says, ''A right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution.'' Last year a similar amendment came out of the Judiciary Committee, but it specifically gave states the right to restrict abortions. That language was dropped this year. The Hatch amendment never came to a vote last year. It was withdrawn after the Senate killed an attempt by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, to overturn the Supreme Court through statute. For withdrawing his amendment, Senator Hatch won a promise for a debate this year. Now, even many anti-abortion lawmakers no longer believe that supporting the right to choice will cost them votes back home. Senator John P. East, a North Carolina Republican who is a strong foe of abortion, remarked, ''North Carolina is not unlike the nation at large. We're polarized on this issue. It cuts both ways.'' He added that the foes of abortion had undermined their own cause by fighting among themselves. Some groups, for instance, do not like the Hatch amendment because it does not declare that a fetus has the right of ''personhood.'' Others say an amendment is futile because it cannot command a twothirds vote, and they prefer a statutory approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCHOOLS VARY IN SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/nyregion/schools-vary-in-sex-education.html,"''OUR 11th-grade students can watch a film of a naked woman giving birth, and later have an open discussion about it in a coed classroom without any giggling or tittering,'' said Dr. Norman Schwartz, assistant superintendent of secondary education for Syosset public schools. ''Kids can discuss topics that would make some of their parents blush. The more educated we get about sex, the less prurient is our interest in it.'' The Syosset School District has a sex education program that is among the most comprehensive of any in the Island's 129 school districts. Since the New York State Department of Health Education does not mandate that sex education be included in the health curriculum, each district has the authority to determine if a sex education program should be mandatory, and how extensive the program should be. Consequently, some school districts have no sex education program, or a limited program for secondary-level students, while others have developed comprehensive programs that include detailed discussions illustrated by slides or films about birth control, pregnancy and abortion. An increasing number of districts are beginning sex education programs for elementary and middle school students as well as high school students. While some school boards and administrators are still struggling for parental approval of initiating elementary school instruction in sex education, the Syosset district has made considerable gains in acceptance. Currently, for example, it has received few parental complaints about its program, which began 13 years ago amid controversy. According to Wilson Gearhart, assistant superintendent for elementary education for Syosset schools, about 50 elementary students out of 2,400 were exempt from sex education by parental request when the program began 13 years ago; today, only one child out of 1,800 is exempt. ''Drugs, alcohol and tobacco must be covered in health education courses, but the rest of the content is up to the individual school district,'' said Carol Fairley, associate in health education at the New York State Education Department. ''Health education is supposed to provide students with all the facts on issues discussed to help them make their own intelligent decisions. What facts are presented is left to the school district's discretion.'' The reluctance of some parents to deal with sex education in the home and the increase in teen-age pregnancies in Nassau and Suffolk Counties indicate the extent of the need for sex education in schools, according to health educators interviewed. ''Parents are asking for more support, and more programs in sex education,'' said Rose Brown, executive director of Nassau County Planned Parenthood. According to Planned Parenthood statistics, in 1981 in Nassau there were 3,194 adolescent pregnancies resulting in 706 live births, 15 fetal deaths and 2,473 abortions. In Suffolk in the same period, there were 3,890 adolescent pregnancies resulting in 1,292 live births, 105 fetal deaths and 2,493 abortions. From 1971 to 1981, Nassau and Suffolk had the highest increase in teen-age pregnancies in the state. According to 1978 statistics from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 35 percent of girls aged 13 to 19 are sexually active, and 54 percent of boys 13 to 21 are sexually active. Although many school districts are responding to their communities' need for sex education in the schools, some school administrators were reluctant to discuss what their districts' sex-education programs covered. Dr. Charles W. Rudiger, Superintendent of Huntington schools, said that sex education was ''too delicate an issue'' for a telephone interview. The sex education programs in the Island's school districts range from open programs, in which speakers from a wide variety of public and private agencies are allowed presentations in classrooms, to self-contained programs in which no outside speaker or film is allowed. The Syosset district, for instance, has allowed in representatives from Planned Parenthood and Birthright, a private, nonsectarian, antiabortion group financed mainly by individual donations, but also by such Roman Catholic groups as the Knights of Columbus. Speakers have included Bill Baird, an abortion counselor who is also director of the Parents' Aid Society. Views of many other people and groups have been presented to secondary school students as part of the health education curriculum. ''The more open your program is, the more danger there is of making mistakes,'' said Dr. Schwartz, the Syosset administrator. ''But we'd rather make mistakes than deal with a closed program.'' Parents in both the Middle Island and Shoreham-Wading River districts have recently objected to a talk and slide presentation about the dangers of abortion given by Birthright. The graphic slides of fetal development and types of abortions were shown to 11th and 12th graders. Administrators from both school districts said they were striving for a balance of varying points of view in the school setting, and antiabortion views, while presented, were not endorsed by the school.  ''We offer students information and let them make their own decisions,'' said Don Webster, director of health, physical education and athletics for the Middle Island district. He acknowledged, however, that he did not have a representative of Planned Parenthood, or any group opposing the antiabortion viewpoint, speak to students after the Birthright presentation. ''I don't feel obligated to bring in organizations with contrasting viewpoints, as long as different views are discussed in class,'' he added. Joseph Ferreira, health educator at the Shoreham-Wading River High School, said the Birthright presentation was one of many shown to junior and senior students as part of the district's secondary sexeducation program. The district has also had speakers from Planned Parenthood, the Suffolk Health Department and a natural-childbirth group, among others, address students as part of the health education curriculum. ''I never take sides with the speakers,'' Mr. Ferreira said. ''It's up to the students to make their own decisions.'' Seth Rockmuller, a lawyer for the State Education Department, that teachers in the state were not allowed to advocate a particular point of view in a classroom, but simply to inform students. ''There is a difference between saying, 'This is the way to believe,' and 'This is the way we view the issue,' '' he said. ''When the abortion issue is studied, people can't try to sell their position, unless there is a public forum and both sides of the issue are presented.'' In the last year, Birthright has given presentations at 15 public schools on the Island, and Planned Parenthood has had representatives speak at about 60 districts. Mr. Baird said he had spoken at a few districts on the Island, but added: ''It's almost impossible for me to get on a high school campus here. On Long Island, I've been banned in some schools.'' Mr. Baird, who considers his organization the opposite of Birthright, also differs with Planned Parenthood, whose representatives view parents as children's prime sex educators. ''Teen-agers,'' he said, ''don't need their parents' permission to have an abortion, or to have intercourse.'' He added, ''Birthright doesn't tell students that abortions are nine times safer than childbirth, according to the American Medical Association.'' Speakers such as Mr. Baird are banned from the Island's 103 Roman Catholic schools, although Birthright speakers are allowed presentations at many parish schools that choose to provide instruction in sex education. Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, director of the Office of Family Ministry of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, said about 40 parishes on the Island have had their teachers trained by the diocese to ''prepare students to understand the Catholic view of family life.'' Only church documents are used in the preparation. Monsignor Maniscalco said any group or individual that did not present ''the Catholic point of view'' was not allowed to speak in family-education classes in parish schools. He added that parents had to give permission for students to take sex education classes in the Island's Catholic schools. Public school administrators and health educators interviewed said that all outside speakers invited to provide information in sex education classes were carefully screened. Also, if any students felt the material presented by an outside speaker was offensive, they had the right to leave the classroom without incurring disciplinary measures, the educators said. Lorraine Sorg, district coordinator for health education in the William Floyd School District, said she met regularly with parents, community religious leaders and the Shirley-Mastic Action Coalition to discuss the sex education program in the district. ''The community has a right to object to the program, or to debate about it,'' she said. ''Teachers don't want to send kids home with a sexual perspective their parents can't handle.'' Mrs. Sorg said that the Floyd district's sex education program focused on feelings as well as biological facts in coeducational classes. ''We talk about decision-making in class, and we view sexuality as it is interwoven into everyday living,'' she said. ''It's a holistic approach, taking emotions into account as well as the body.'' When outside speakers are invited to speak in the Floyd district program, parents are notified. ''No matter what viewpoint you take, there will be objections,'' Mrs. Sorg said. ''But we have to continue with our program. We have no choice. Each school district is responsible for its out-of-wedlock mothers.'' In the Patchogue-Medford district, sex education is a component of the curriculum in the seventh and 10th grades. Topics such as anatomy, reproduction and conception are introduced to seventh graders, and 10th graders discuss such subjects as birth control, venereal disease and abortion, according to the district's spokesman, Hugh MacLeod. The sex-education program is optional and requires parental permission. No private groups are invited to speak to students in the district's program. The Port Washington district offers a kindergarten-through-12thgrade approach to sex education that focuses on ''responsibility and decision-making,'' said Dr. Ed Berkowitz, assistant superintendent of instruction in the district. The program, begun in 1971, is taught by nurse-teachers and certified health instructors. Parents can opt that a child not participate. All outside speakers are carefully screened by the administration. ''We make every effort to maintain a balanced, reasonable position,'' Dr. Berkowitz said. The Lindenhurst district began its sex education program for secondary students last year. According to Lee McLaughlin, district coordinator of health and physical education, 93 percent of students received parental permission to attend the classes the first semester they were given. For the second semester, such permissions dropped one percentage point. Mr. McLaughlin said the sex education program in Lindenhurst schools was self-contained. No outside speakers are invited. Contraception is the most controversial issue discussed in the program, Mr. McLaughlin said, and students who do not have parental permission to attend the discussions are given alternative assignments. ''With the high percentage of single parents today,'' Mr. McLaughlin said, ''schools must provide the education that is lacking in some homes.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MR. SIKORSKI GOES TO WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/mr-sikorski-goes-to-washington.html,"STILLWATER, Minn., is an old lumber town on the St. Croix River. In the last century, when the white pine still stood high on the hills and when settlers traveled to the Middle West by steamboat and stagecoach, some enterprising pioneers built a sawmill there. Later, when the railroads inched west and when millions of logs were being sorted every year at the boom site just beyond town, a modest downtown started to grow, and there sprouted a brewery, an opera house and a series of mansions. The logging ended decades ago, but Stillwater endures, a small town with a hardware store, a drug store, a grocery store and an elegant old hotel. The butcher knows the name of just about everyone in town. The meters charge a dime for two hours' parking. Gerry Sikorski doesn't live there anymore. He has left the farmhouse on the hill, his horses, the deer that used to nose up to his stoop and the great horned owl that he used to hear in the night. He has packed up and moved away, to Washington. He has bought a city rowhouse and a tuxedo. He has an unlisted telephone number. And when he visited the White House early this year, he entered through the front door. This winter, when there was ice on the St. Croix, freshman Congressman Gerry Sikorski went back to Minnesota. He drove down Route 36, the highway leading from St. Paul to Stillwater, a road he has taken hundreds of times. He drove it when he worked in a law office and he drove it when he served in the State Senate. Over the years, he has seen houses spring up and trees grow from seedlings to robust sentinels. He has watched one of the farms along the road change, watched the number of cows increase and decline. This time, however, everything seemed different. ''This time,'' said Sikorski, who turns 35 on Tuesday, ''I felt sort of morose. It's like the two paths in the woods: I've taken a path, but I haven't gone so far that I still don't see the other path. I hope I don't lose that path.'' Across the country last fall, 80 men and women began the complex process that would transform them into members of Congress. Nearly three-quarters of them were Democrats and many of them, like Sikorski, were lawyers, had served in state legislatures and had borrowed heavily to run for Congress. They had based their campaigns on opposition to Reaganomics, support of efforts to freeze the level of nuclear weapons and reassurances that Social Security, which has 36 million beneficiaries, would be re-stored to financial health. They had, moreover, come to office with what Jonathan Moore, director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, called ''a skepticism of clear-cut solutions.'' Days after the voters of Minnesota's 6th Congressional District decided to send him to Congress, Gerry Sikorski was still campaigning. For months, he had driven from suburb to suburb, from farm to farm, across highways and down gravel roads. His campaign had been a page torn from an American scrapbook, greetings and speeches and parades and kisses, and now that it was over, now that he had won and was going to Washington, he almost could not stop. He got in the car and drove 60 miles through the November chill to Monticello for the annual Wright County Democratic Farmer Labor dinner. He was among the first to arrive, and was one of the few men there; it was deer season and most of the men were hunting. It was cold inside the restaurant and the barmaid, who handed out drinks with embossed cocktail napkins left over from somebody's wedding, wore a heavy cable sweater and skimpy black hotpants. Sikorski gave a short speech, telling the group how grateful he was for their support, telling them of the challenges that were ahead, telling them how much it all meant to him. The response was tumultuous. ''For us, a Congressman is a big thing,'' Mary Bray, a county worker, said as the cheering faded. ''We're far away from Washington. Most of us have never been there. He's our only direct line there. I think he knows that.'' Susan Erkel Sikorski was at home. The house smelled of cloves and she sat in the kitchen, going through the mail. There was a letter from Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, inviting her husband's opinions on the Social Security financing crisis. There was a letter from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, pledging that ''we shall stay our course together.'' There was a letter advertising a garden-apartment complex in suburban Virginia. And, less than a week after the election, there already were job requests, scores of them, opening with entreaties like this: ''I am an energetic young Democratic attorney with a variety of skills that can contribute to the success of your first team.'' For the Sikorskis, life was almost overwhelming: the speeches, the mail, the good wishes, the phone calls, the endless plans. In the confusion, Sikorski lost his pay check, his 20-month-old daughter screamed almost continuously and his wife, a Ph.D. in home economics, worried about whether she could find a job in Washington and whether it made sense to take their dogs and cats along. They were excited, they were exhausted, but most of all they were scared. One afternoon, Sikorski, who is lean and clean-cut in the oldfashioned way, was working in jeans and a down vest in his campaign headquarters in a Minneapolis suburb. He kicked away the large plastic 7-Up bottle that held his office door open and there, amid the piles of letters and files and phone messages, he took a deep breath. He talked about Minnesota's Red River Valley, where he grew up, and he talked about his parents, about how his father had been a railroad laborer and part-time bartender and how his mother had waited on tables, had taken in laundry and worked at a turkeyprocessing plant. Then came one of those moments, rare in the life of a politician, when he confronted, out loud, what really troubled him. ''More and more,'' he said, almost in a whisper, ''I worry about what this means for my family.'' In the early years of this century, before air-conditioning and before the United States was a world power, Congressional sessions lasted only a few months. Members of Congress would travel to Washington, stay in boarding houses, visit the bawdy houses and go home to their families before the heat and the oppressive humidity of the summer months set in. Today, Congress meets virtually all year round, and more and more of its members maintain homes in the Washington area. From the start, the Sikorskis had decided that they, too, would move to Washington. Gerry Sikorski knew about the late-night sessions, the dinner meetings and the rounds of Capitol receptions. His wife had multiple sclerosis, suffering occasional and sometimes persistent bouts of numbness in her hands, legs and feet. Their daughter was growing up quickly. He decided that he would try to put his family first. ''I draw lines,'' he said that first week after the election. ''I'm not going to a bunch of receptions and talk about the weather and the Minnesota Vikings all night. I'd rather be at home talking to my wife and my daughter. That's my choice. I'm not going to get fat, become an alcoholic and lose my family. I'm not going to do that.'' Later that week, he took a walk on Fairy Falls Hill, near his home. Long ago, before the white men came to Minnesota, the Sioux and Chippewa regarded that land as a sacred plot of earth where the spirits talked to them. That morning Sikorski walked in the snow, across the old logging road into the woods, and as he walked he thought of the river and the fields and he remembered how, when dusk deepened into night, he could see the lights of Wisconsin beyond the St. Croix. ''I get sort of sad,'' he said, ''when I think that we have to leave here.'' Two weeks after the election, the Sikorskis arrived in Washington and a campaign of a different sort began. Like many other freshmen, Sikorski sought out Congressional leaders in the tucked-away power centers where committee assignments are made. Sikorski wanted a position on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which puts its imprimatur on about half the legislation that passes through the House. He sought and won the support of Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minneapolis, a member of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which plays a major role in the committee assignment process. He then pressed his case in person before virtually every member of the steering committee, leaving a resume with each of them, and spent hours on the telephone trying to corral support from members of the energy committee itself. He found that his Polish heritage could be an advantage, dropping a few Polish words into conversations with Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the energy committee, and Representative Rostenkowski. ''The Polish connection doesn't hurt,'' he later said. Meanwhile, Susan Sikorski was scouring the real-estate listings. They decided that they wanted to live on Capitol Hill, where modest town houses routinely cost more than $100,000. After days of searching, they finally found a three-bedroom home, with a basement and a garage, only a few minutes' walk from the Capitol. He was discovering that his Congressional pay of $69,800 would not go far in Washington. ''It will be macaroni-and-cheese dinners for several years,'' Sikorski said the night they signed the house contract. Sikorski had always maintained a fast pace. Before the election, in fact, the St. Paul Pioneer Press said that he campaigned as if he were trying to run a three-minute mile. Now he was back in that mode. He dashed from one interview to another, fielding telephone calls along the way, yet somehow also managing to follow the rigorous orientation program laid on for new Democratic members of Congress. As freshman Republicans followed their own schedule, Sikorski and his fellow Democrats pursued a regimen of seminars, receptions, luncheons and even a session devoted to teaching them how to get reelected. There was a brunch with former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, a prayer breakfast, a reception sponsored by Anheuser-Busch and a lecture entitled, ''Customs, Decorum and Unwritten Rules of the House.'' The Sikorskis moved through the orientation period like timid college freshmen, following the schedule faithfully. Early in December, they went to a session held by the Democratic Study Group, a research organization for House members, and listened to a speech given by retiring Representative Bill Brodhead of Michigan. ''The hours are long and there will be embassy parties and dinners to go to,'' Brodhead warned. ''You can get caught up in the whole syndrome. The divorce rate is higher than it should be.'' Then he added: ''It doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to do all that. If you just do your job, you won't have to go out to dinner.'' The room was quiet. When it came time for the session on Congressional procedures, the class was led through the cavernous hallways of the Capitol to the House floor. Sikorski pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and wrote a note to himself: ''There's an incredible sense of pride and wonder on walking on the floor. Some sitting Congressmen told us that the sensation never leaves you.'' It was a special moment, the crossing of the shadowy line between a man's most cherished dreams and his realization that they were coming true. Sikorski was, like many youngsters in his hometown near the North Dakota border, born and bred a Democrat. When he was young and his parents had no money to contribute to the Democrat Farmer Labor Party, they contributed the labor of their five children instead. He made his first political poster, a sign for the Stevenson-Kefauver ticket, when he was 8. Sikorski was a college student during the Vietnam years, and quickly became swept up in the antiwar movement. He was a street demonstrator at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, but soon became deeply involved in local and state politics, working for such causes as the effort to lower the voting age. Now as then, Sikorski found himself left of center politically; in Congress he has spoken out for the nuclear freeze and against cuts in social programs such as school lunches and aid to education. However, as a devout Catholic, he strenuously opposes abortion. Sikorski has an aggressive streak. Once, running a campaign for former Representative Richard Nolan, Democrat of Minnesota, his zeal led him to tear down a lawn sign boosting Nolan's opponent. Sikorski himself made an unsuccessful try for Congress in 1978. Early in the orientation period, Sikorski announced his candidacy to be the freshman Democrats' whip, helping Democratic leaders maintain party discipline. He sent letters and resumes to the other new legislators and distributed orientation schedules complete with pictures of the members of the Steering and Policy Committee. He even called some freshmen at their homes during Christmas week. Yet the orientation could be disspiriting at times. The speakers droned on, often repeating themselves or each other, and before long even the anecdotes grew wearisome. Susan Sikorski went to a seminar, ''New Perspectives for Political Spouses,'' sponsored by a group of Congressional wives and Georgetown University, and sat restlessly as the speakers talked about the Constitution, explained how a bill became law and touched on the rudiments of life in Washington. In the audience, eyes rolled and groans were heard. ''I'm not an airhead,'' said one Congressional wife, sotto voce. ''I'm not sitting through this.'' Susan Sikorski later described parts of the session as a ''ninth-grade civics lecture.'' By the end of the formal orientation period, the Sikorskis had come to feel as if they were being suffocated, as if they were losing control over their own lives. Always, always there were things to do, appointments to keep. Weariness had settled in. On Dec. 9, Susan Sikorski flew home to Minnesota while her husband and some of the other freshmen legislators took a military plane to Massachusetts for yet another series of seminars, at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. As each lecture ended, the legislators rushed for a bank of telephones, and when they made their connections, they spoke quickly, almost breathlessly: The clock was running and the next seminar on agriculture policy or arms control was only minutes away. They had so little time. Many of them stayed up late in the Sheraton Commander Hotel, washing laundry in their sinks in the small hours of the morning. ''Talk about people making important decisions,'' Sikorski said after lunch one day. ''I haven't been able to make a decision since we started orientation. I'm tired of people telling me where to sit and what to eat. What I want is a little more free time, fewer speeches and a cheeseburger.'' There was little relief when he returned to Minnesota shortly before Christmas. ''Everybody is trying to nip at my time,'' he said. ''Everyone wants you to have breakfast, everyone wants you to be at their meeting, everybody wants you at their Christmas party.'' The bittersweet is a native Minnesota berry, and this was a peculiarly bittersweet time for the Sikorskis. They and their daughter, Anne, trudged out to the woods behind the house and chose a red cedar; Sikorski chopped it down and dragged it home. They decided to save money and forgo presents, exchanging ornaments instead. At year's end, Sikorski paused a moment to reflect: ''People don't understand all the pressures. You're trying to get on the committees, you're trying to start relationships with other members of Congress, you want to hire people, you want to stay in touch with the people at home. And you're tired.'' With the opening day of Congress, Jan. 3, a fresh atmosphere descended on the Capitol. It was a scene of mink coats, microphones and Minoltas. The nine-man Ortiz Mariachi Band from Kingsville, Tex., played on the Capitol steps, small groups of television reporters conducted interviews on the triangle of grass near the House office buildings and families took scores of snapshots. Sikorski found a seat in the first row of the House chamber for the swearing-in ceremony. Anne sat on the carpet in front of him, chewing gum. When she started screaming for her mother during Opening Prayer, Sikorski put his hand over her mouth. The House was now his home. Then the voice of Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. was heard in the chamber, and the members of the House raised their right hands and swore to defend the Constitution of the United States. ''You are members of this legislature,'' O'Neill said, and Representative Gerry Sikorski, Democrat of Minnesota, kissed his baby girl. Minutes later his entourage - his wife, his parents, his sister, his mother-in-law, some friends - was on its way to a reception in the Rayburn House Office Building. ''How do you get to the subway?'' Sikorski asked a Capitol guard. They followed the guard's instructions, rode the underground cars to the Rayburn Building and finally came upon a group of elevators. Sikorski pushed the ''up'' button and a door opened under the sign ''Members Only.'' He took a step forward, and started to enter the elevator, but then hesitated; he had, after all, only been a member for a few minutes. He waited for the public elevator. For freshman legislators, nothing is more important than assembling a loyal, efficient staff. Sikorski delegated that job to Dennis M. McGrann, 32 years of age, a close friend who had been a personnel manager for the Minnesota-based Control Data Corporation. McGrann had been feeling his own pressures. He was completing requirements for his Master's of Business Administration, his wife was expecting their second child and he was a stranger in Washington. Like other freshmen, Sikorski was assigned a temporary office in House Annex No. 2, one of the depressing, boxlike stone Government buildings scattered like breadcrumbs a few blocks off the handsome wide boulevards of the capital. The day after the swearing-in ceremony, some staff members were sitting in a small circle, open boxes behind them, 200 letters already awaiting answers. Ione Yates, Sikorski's executive assistant and a veteran Congressional aide, was typing up the letters that would give the staff entree to the House Office Supply Service. When she finished, she took a blue felt pen and signed: ''Gerry Sikorski.'' Then she led the staff in a quick survey. ''We need stationery,'' she said, ''the kind that says 'Congress of the United States.' '' ''We need letter openers,'' added Tom Meskan, the 26-year-old legislative assistant. ''Staples and staplers,'' chimed in Lynn Drake, the press secretary. ''Just buy one stapler,'' said Ione Yates. ''I have one at home I can bring in.'' ''Stamps,'' Lynn Drake said. ''We need stamps.'' There was an embarrassed silence. Tom Meskan, who had worked with her throughout the campaign, finally broke it. ''We,'' he said, ''don't need stamps anymore.'' Meanwhile, the Congress itself was getting down to business. House Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas called Sikorski's home with the good news that the Minnesotan had been chosen as one of the six freshmen on the Energy and Commerce Committee. And the next day brought Sikorski another triumph - he was elected freshman whip by a substantial margin. ''He seemed to emerge pretty quickly as the person who was going to be the pre-eminent spokesman for the freshman class,'' said Representative Dennis Eckart, the Ohio Democrat who preceded Sikorski as freshman whip. ''This is going to be a big edge for his career.'' Later that week, the new members of Congress were invited to the White House for dinner. Susan Sikorski had gone to the G Street Remnant Shop, purchased material and sewn her own dress. Her husband struggled with his new formal wear. Victor Kamber, a Washington political consultant, finally took pity on his friend and saw to it that the bow tie was straight and the cummerbund on properly. ''It was like sending your kids out to the prom,'' said Kamber. As legions of management consultants have been saying for years, Congress is not the most efficiently run enterprise in the nation, and the Sikorski staff was just discovering the dimensions of that inefficiency. By Jan. 10, they were settled in their permanent headquarters in the Cannon House Office Building, a magisterial, white-stone structure a few steps from the Capitol. However, their duplicating machine was broken, their long-distance telephone line had not been connected and the facsimile machine did not work. Meanwhile, banks and financial institutions across the nation were encouraging one of the largest mail campaigns in history, and the effects were being felt in Congressional offices. The banks wanted Congress to repeal a provision of the tax law passed last August, that would force financial institutions to withhold 10 percent of their customers' interest income from savings and investments. In a matter of days 1,000 letters on the issue had come into Sikorski's office, virtually paralyzing it. ''We have an answer prepared,'' said McGrann. ''But we're not even geared up mechanically to get the answers out. Our typewriters don't even work.'' Sikorski favors the repeal. After less than a week in session, Congress took its customary January recess. At month's end, Sikorski came back to the capital feeling invigorated and plunged into the basic work of Congress - meetings. Before long, he was sitting down with lobbyists from groups favoring the arts, working for help for Soviet Jews, seeking assistance for environmental causes and looking for support for a proposed coal slurry pipeline. There also were the sessions with constituent groups, including Minnesota delegations to the League of Cities convention and to police and firefighting conventions. And gradually, as a routine developed, Sikorski began to feel more at ease with himself and more at ease with life in Congress. Sikorski had been a leader in the Minnesota Senate in seeking the enactment of child-protection measures and in efforts to assist the victims of family violence. Early in February, he set out to win a place on the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. He went to the Speaker's Office, where many such decisions are made, and was urged to give a short speech on the floor to demonstrate his knowledge of the subject. On the day of the speech, his first before Congress, Sikorski was sitting by himself in a corner of the cafeteria in the Longworth House Office Building. There, surrounded by soiled trays, empty potato-chip bags and milk cartons, he nervously went over his prepared text. It was going to be a hectic day, he said. He had to be in two places at the same time, on the floor awaiting his turn to speak, and in the chambers of the Energy and Commerce Committee, where a critical vote had been scheduled. Soon Sikorski would grow accustomed to the tug of the floor. In a month, in fact, he would be able to go to the House gymnasium, lift weights, shower and still be able to reach the floor for the crucial votes on the Social Security bill. But in February, his first speech in hand, he made three frantic round trips between the floor and the committee chambers in the Rayburn House Office Building. There were only two dozen Congressmen on the floor, a small group of students in the visitors' gallery and a handful of reporters lingering in the press gallery when Sikorski finally approached the lectern. As he stood there, he told himself: ''Stop. Take a breath. Take your time.'' But like so many freshman Congressmen before him, he couldn't. He talked about drug and child abuse, family violence and divorce on Minnesota Indian reservations, in California barrios and in West Virginia hollows, and he raced through it all in only 40 seconds. The maiden speech of Congressman Sikorski occupied two and three-quarter inches of type in the Congressional Record. In the council chamber of the Stillwater Municipal Building, one of the cinder-block legacies of the largess of the Great Society days, there sat several dozen people in heavy boots, lumbermen's jackets and dungarees. It was a wintry Saturday afternoon and Congressman Sikorski was standing at the front of the room. ''Congress,'' he was saying, ''is a noble and old institution.'' It was the fourth town meeting Sikorski had held in two days, but the cold air of Minnesota seemed to stir him and he plunged into a monologue with vigor. He quoted John Kennedy, Mark Twain and Red Skelton, he talked about some of the nuances of general revenue sharing, he touched on local landfill issues. But it was Congress that he really wanted to talk about, and it was some of the back-room mysteries of the Capitol that his audience wanted to hear. ''There are a lot of egos in Washington, big heads,'' he said, the laughs starting to gather in the audience. ''I know that comes as a surprise.'' Later that afternoon, Sikorski held court just down the hall, greeting a stream of constituents who wanted to share their opinions and, just as often, to share their problems. At one point, he was confronted by 18 postal workers, angered by the prospect that new Federal workers would be forced under the Social Security umbrella. They stood in their woolen shirts and their windbreakers, arms folded every one, as Sikorski preached to a congregation that refused to be converted. They were afraid that without the pension contributions of new postal workers, their own benefits would be endangered. ''When our retirement system starts going down the tubes,'' one asked testily, ''is the Government going to kick in some money?'' ''I think we have to,'' Sikorski answered. ''I don't think there's any option.'' The questions continued for several minutes before Rex P. Johnson, general president of the St. Paul area local of the American Postal Workers Union, made his demand: ''We'd like a 'No' vote on a bill if it includes us in Social Security.'' Sikorski did not hesitate. ''You won't get it,'' he said. ''I won't vote no. You've got to accept that.'' The meeting began to break up. ''Thank you,'' said Paul Ryberg, quality-control specialist with the St. Paul Post Office. ''Thank you?'' Johnson asked, mockingly. ''Yes, thank you,'' Ryberg said, turning to Sikorski. ''He could have hid like the rest of them in his office in Washington.'' All that week Sikorski drove across his district, attending a nuclear-freeze meeting, addressing the Anoka County Chamber of Commerce, visiting a senior citizens' dance, dropping by a political fund-raiser, even taking a few minutes on a Saturday night to dip into a testimonial for a leading member of the Spring Lake Park Veterans of Foreign War. But during that trip back to his district, a journey to where he had come from, he also found time to reflect on where he was going. Things have, in truth, turned out quite well for him. His wife landed a part-time job with the National Governors' Association in Washington. He was earning his spurs as the Democrats' freshman whip. The Democratic leadership, for example, dearly wanted Congress to reject President Reagan's budget and adopt, in its stead, one fashioned by the Democrats themselves. It was a major test of the President's influence in Congress and the Democrats sought to exploit the opportunity to embarrass the Administration. Sikorski drew up a checklist of freshman Democrats and met with them individually and in groups, in the halls of the Capitol, in cloak rooms and in committee chambers and then, when the actual floor vote neared, he telephoned them or called upon them in their offices. In the end, he won the votes of all but six of the 56 Democratic freshmen, an accomplishment that earned him the praise of Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Democratic Whip. ''It's not until you start seeing people's problems and trying to do something about them that you actually know what it's like being a Congressman,'' Sikorski says. ''I didn't know what it would be like. And the thing is, I do like it. I like it more than anything else I've ever done.'' During that February visit to Minnesota, Sikorski was asked by the Rev. Bernard Reiser, pastor of the Church of the Epiphany of Coon Rapids, to be a lector at one of the church's Sunday masses. At the proper time, Sikorski went to the altar, picked up the Scriptures and did his two readings. But for most of the mass he sat in the front pew, a pensive look on his face. ''How often do we sell our soul for power and fame?'' Father Reiser asked in his homily. ''Lent is a time to look at our choices. What are our priorities? What are our principles?'' Sikorski listened to the prayers and readings from the liturgy. He listened to the choir. He listened to Father Reiser's questions and he listened to his own thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BETTY FRIEDAN DEFIES BRITONS, WINS DEBATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/25/style/betty-friedan-defies-britons-wins-debate.html,"Betty Friedan was, as she said later, irritated. She had endured the first gibes and sexist jokes in a sporting way, smiling pleasantly. The young British speakers in evening clothes and patent leather shoes at the Cambridge Union Society seemed to be testing the American feminist leader for a sense of humor. But as the onslaught continued, and each speaker who preceded her lampooned the feminist movement and painted rude oral cartoons of what they saw as manly activist women, her smile gave way to a frown. By the time it was her turn to address the Cambridge University audience as the seventh speaker in a formal debate Friday night on the benefits men have derived from the women's liberation movement, Betty Friedan was angry. ''I came here to Cambridge, accepting your invitation to speak at this male bastion and confront this serious social issue,'' she told the debating society, her voice husky and her dark eyes flashing. ''I can't tell you how more than irritated I was to hear it treated as a joke. It is not a joke.'' Freedom for Men and Women Then, in the ensuing 20 minutes, Betty Friedan, who had traveled 4,000 miles for the debate, proceeded to win her argument, although she left the hall thinking she had lost, because a clerical error had reversed the vote tally. She had to wait for word of her victory until today. She gave her British audience a passionate lecture. Feminism, she said, had not only freed women from old roles and culturally imposed limits, but had created a revolution that had also liberated men and contained the seeds for improving life for all humanity. Prowling the speaker's well, pounding a small fist on the table or into her palm, she took the role of a teacher imploring the privileged to open their eyes and remove ''the foppish mask,'' as she put it, of derision. When she took her seat on the black leather speakers' bench in the historic hall, the students gave her an enthusiastic though somewhat chastened round of applause. Her grit appeared to have won many hearts and minds. The proposition that she had defended was, ''This house believes that feminism is good for men.'' Afterward, the members of the union, which is open to all undergraduates at Cambridge, voted to approve the proposition 123 to 56, with 43 abstentions. But because of the clerical error that transposed the vote Friday evening, it was first announced that the proposition had failed. That error was not discovered and corrected until today. About half of the audience were women. Women were first admitted for degrees at Cambridge only after World War II, and about 40 percent of the students now are women. Melanie McDonagh, the fifth woman to be president of the society, led last night's debate. ''I had never run into anything like this on an American campus,'' Mrs. Friedan said later at a small reception with British and American students. ''Don't worry,'' said one of the young women there. ''These men just like to get sloshed and argue their prejudices.'' Another guest suggested that it was just the way he thought the British did things: classifying everything by sex, class, age or institutional affiliation. Mrs. Friedan shook her head slowly, as if still numb. ''You would never hear this in an American university,'' she said. ''I didn't realize just how conservative some of the students here were.'' She said she had been forewarned of the whimsy that British debating societies occasionally impose on serious subjects. But she said she had not expected the debate to wallow so much in what she regarded as self-indulgent ripostes instead of rapier wit. 'Foppish Humor' At the conclusion of her talk, in which she challenged the men in the audience not to continue hiding their feelings behind masks of ''foppish humor,'' one of her opponents in the debate said: ''Madam, I insist on my right to be frivolous! You will find that when I'm at my most foppish, I'm expressing my true feelings!'' The speaker, Peter Bazalgette, went on to characterize feminists as those who look upon men ''as nothing more than a set of marauding genitals.'' He called Mrs. Friedan one of the ''sad women who are running away from their radicalism of the 60's'' and whose views today are ''disowned'' by more militant feminists in America. ''Why should we listen to her?'' he asked scornfully. Mr. Bazalgette, a recent Cambridge graduate who is now a producer with the British Broadcasting Company, was interrupted briefly by a male student who was moved to defend the American guest. ''Surely,'' he called out, ''you are being unreasonable!'' But the 62-year-old Mrs. Friedan needed no defenders, as Mr. Bazalgette discovered in his next breath. When he looked across to her through half-closed eyes and began to define for her what a feminist was, she jumped to her feet. For the last 20 years, since the publication of her benchmark work ''The Feminine Mystique,'' she has been recognized not just as a leader of American feminism but as one of the movement's premier theoreticians. She made Mr. Bazalgette surrender the dais. ''You cannot tell me what a feminist is,'' declared Mrs. Friedan, a founder of the National Organization for Women. Leveling her gaze at Mr. Bazalgette, she said that women are able to be different now because of hard-won victories, and that feminists have earned the right to express different views while defining themselves. ''But it is not for you,'' she said, ''to tell any woman what a feminist is. You can call yourself a dinosaur, but don't tell me what a feminist is!'' She sat down again, folding her arms tightly as members applauded. This clash came after Mrs. Friedan had already expressed her distress at hearing men in the debate call feminists man-haters who sought the abolition of sexual distinctions and who were responsible for undermining ''Christian'' family values. Even the speakers who had preceded her in support of the proposition seemed to have no heart for it. One, Mary Kenney, a British journalist, said men had benefited from the women's movement because abortion and contraception now freed them from the consequences of sexual license. Mrs. Friedan later called Miss Kenny a ''traitor'' to feminism who had ''twisted'' the effects of abortion on women's lives. She said that the availability of abortion in the United States had reduced maternal mortality caused by illegal abortions in the past. But at the heart of her argument was her conviction that American men, seeing the gains made by women, are insisting on a new reality for themselves. That reality, she asserted, is one that allows men to be truer to their nature and to abandon their need for dominance and control, which she said suppresses their innermost feelings and shortens their lives. ''It enables men to be themselves,'' she said, her hands clasped in front of her. ''I listened to some of this - eh, if you pardon the insult - foppish humor tonight, and I thought, 'My God, maybe British men have to deny their feelings and have a worse time of it then American men do.' ''Dominance,'' she continued. ''It must make every man so defeated, so sad to have to put on the iron mask, or the foppish mask. ''But there is new life for men, ladies and gentlemen. It is good for men, and it is good for all humanity.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHINA'S VITAL BIRTH-CONTROL EFFORT DOES NOT INCLUDE INFANTICIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/25/opinion/l-china-s-vital-birth-control-effort-does-not-include-infanticide-118407.html,"To the Editor: I do not dispute the two Chinese students who write that there is infanticide in China (Op-Ed April 11) - an unfortunate but long-known fact, which only recently has attracted the attention of the American news media. I would only point out that instances of coercion in China's family planning cannot be discussed in the abstract but must be seen from the perspective of a population of over one billion that increases each year by some 12 to 13 million. What China faces in coping with such basic requirements as housing, education, transportation, sanitation, water resources, and so on, would overwhelm a rich, advanced nation. Yet these needs relate ''only'' to quality of life. The two critical problems that relate to national survival are food and employment. It is true that, although there were years of starvation and that imports had to supplement domestic grain production, China has managed to feed her population. But how long will it be able to surprise the doubters and continue to feed a billion people on 11 percent of the land that is arable? As the population is growing, some of China's most productive lands are being lost to urban development and erosion. Between 1952 and 1977 the average cultivated land per farm worker decreased by 50 percent. Is it any wonder the stipulation that the state shall encourage and enforce birth planning is written into the constitution of China? Peking estimates that since 1966 the annual increment of the labor force has been 17 million, and it anticipates that in each of the next 10 years about 20 million young people will be entering the job market - almost the total employed population of France. These are frightening figures for a country with a weak economic base, which knows that the bulk of the already disenchanted youths will somehow have to be absorbed by the countryside. Infanticide barely touches on China's problems. The two writers of the Op-Ed article admit that it is a reflection of ignorance, poverty and the persistence of feudal attitudes toward women. This is precisely where Peking places the blame, insisting that ''the whole society should resolutely condemn the criminal activities of female infanticide and maltreatment of the mothers, and the judicial departments should resolutely punish the offenders according to law.'' The use of ''extreme political pressures'' in the family-planning program may apply to abortions, but not to infanticide, which is the mindless (if practical) choice of the mother and/or the family, determined that their old-age security will not depend on a female child, who will marry and disappear - ''just like spilled water.'' It will take more time and the introduction of social insurance into the countryside to change the attitudes of Chinese peasants. Until then, short of abandoning the critical family-planning program, there is nothing that the Chinese Government can do to guarantee that, with some 25 million pregnancies every year, there will not be instances of infanticide. It is also important for us to understand that the success or failure of China's population-control program has global implications. Only a secure China can be a peaceful China, and it is not farfetched to suggest that China's stability depends not so much on how as on how well the family-planning program will be implemented. For our own sake, if not for China's, let us hope it will be successful. LEO A.

SCIENCE WATCH; Alcohol at Conception,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/science/science-watch-alcohol-at-conception.html,"The risks of drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy are now well established, and pregnant women have been duly warned about the possible harmful effects of alcohol on their unborn children. Now there is experimental evidence that large amounts of alcohol consumed just after fertilization may cause genetic abnormalities that ultimately result in miscarriage early in pregnancy. The studies, done in Cambridge, England, by M.@H. Kaufman, an anatomist, involved female mice that were given alcohol in amounts equivalent to what a woman might drink during a night of celebration. The mice had recently been fertilized and were exposed to alcohol at the time the fertilized eggs would have been undergoing chromosomal rearrangements that ultimately produce an embryo. While male fertilized eggs showed no abnormalities, those that would have become females showed a large percentage of abnormal chromosome arrangements - either one chromosome too many or one too few. Dr. Kaufman urged caution in extrapolating his findings to people, but he said his results ''draw attention to the potential danger to the conceptus of a single episode of heavy drinking by the mother at about the time of conception.'' Citing two recent studies linking alcohol intake in early pregnancy to an increased risk of miscarriage, he warned that any agent that can interfere with chromosomal divisions, as alcohol did in his study, should be considered a possible cause of spontaneous abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION BATTLE CATCHES DUBLIN LEADERS UNAWARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/27/world/abortion-battle-catches-dublin-leaders-unaware.html,"At a time when the new coalition Government of Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Ireland is making overtures to Unionists in Northern Ireland to discuss political reunification, his leadership of the republic is being eroded by an emotional debate on abortion. Abortion is already illegal in Ireland and no political movement exists to challenge this prohibition in a country where 95 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. But ''pro-life'' activists have succeeded in getting the two major political parties to press for a national referendum that could add an antiabortion amendment to the Constitution and, critics contend, reassert the Catholic nature of the state. Moreover, the abortion debate is so deeply emotional that Mr. FitzGerald is losing support inside his coalition as the Government tries to cope with worsening economic and social conditions that require firm government policies. Churchmen in Dispute How Mr. FitzGerald has managed to get caught in the trap of the abortion issue at a time when the republic faces urgent and complex domestic problems is something that perplexes his supporters and delights his opponents. He above all other political leaders in Ireland have been conciliatory in his approach to Protestants living in Northern Ireland who fear that political reunification of the island would mean a loss of their tradition. The abortion debate has already led to a rare public dispute between the Catholic hierarchy and the churchmen representing the small Protestant minority in the republic. Catholic bishops in Ireland recently made it clear that the wording of the antiabortion amendment hammered out by Mr. FitzGerald's advisers was not as acceptable as the one put forward earlier by the Government of former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, who was defeated by Mr. FitzGerald in a November election. The Anglican Primate of Ireland, Dr. John Armstrong, who also represents many of the Protestants living in Northern Ireland, said the intervention by the bishops was an attempt to impose Catholic moral teachings on all the people of Ireland. Parliamentary Vote Expected The Irish Parliament is expected to vote before the end of the month on the wording of the amendment favored by Mr. FitzGerald's Government, and if it is enacted to set plans for a national referendum on the matter. But several members of Mr. FitzGerald's Fine Gael Party have already angrily indicated that they cannot support his proposal and favor what they consider to be the tougher safeguards contained in the amendment of the opposition party, Fianna Fail. This in turn has led the Prime Minister to threaten the suspension of any party member who fails to support the party on this vote. If he is defeated, and the Fianna Fail amendment is accepted, the Prime Minister said he would campaign against its approval by the public in a referendum, a campaign that might further drain his administration of the support needed to address the nation's serious economic decline. The FitzGerald amendment is contained in one sentence: ''Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of the law on the grounds that it prohibits abortion.'' The Fianna Fail wording recognizes ''the right to life of the unborn'' in addition to other language that was opposed by mainstream Protestants. ''The absurdity of it all is that it's all so pointless,'' commented a Government official as the debate raged this week. Abortions are not performed in Ireland, he said, but an estimated 5,000 Irishwomen a year travel to England where they can obtain free abortions on demand in public clinics. ''The only real way to prevent abortions in Ireland is to forbid pregnant women to leave the country.'' Tax Protests Continue Meanwhile, in a month when unemployment went above 14 percent and inflation was hanging at more than 15 percent, Mr. FitzGerald was faced with other problems. Scattered tax protests and work stoppages continued around the country after mass demonstrations by Irish workers who say that the Government's new austerity budget and higher rates of taxation have cut deeply into their income while sparing farmers and people who can hide income from tax collectors. Government leaders discussed setting up community work programs for young criminals as the authorities acknowledged that the country's soaring crime rate had reached the point where there were no longer enough prison cells to hold all the convicted offenders. One Member of Parliament from Dublin said the crime reports from her district made her feel ''as if the major criminals were going out in tour buses into this area.'' The Department of Justice reported an alarming rise in drug abuse and drug-related crimes, with an estimated 6,000 heroin addicts in a nation of three million people where hard drugs were almost unheard of five years ago. With a countdown under way for a full-dress meeting in Dublin of the Forum for a New Ireland called by Mr. FitzGerald to discuss a blueprint for the reunification of Ireland, Ulster's Protestants have harshly rejected his overtures and refused to participate. Premier Expresses Determination In a recent interview, the Prime Minister said he expected that progress on the initiative would be slow but he was determined to go ahead with it even if the Unionists did not participate at first. ''What we are searching for is one or a number of models for progress in the relationship between North and South, something that might provide a way forward,'' he said. ''At the same time it is necessary to reassure those in the Protestant community who have genuine fears that any new relationship would threaten their identity and their civil liberty.'' His proposal, made last month, offered a forum that would include anyone from the constitutional parties in the North and South who rejected violence and were willing to discuss the future. ''I came to the conclusion many years ago that we were not helping our cause by leaving completely vague what we meant by a united Ireland,'' Mr. FitzGerald continued. ''The picture I think many Protestants in Northern Ireland have is that we are seeking a united Ireland in which they would be a permanent minority and in which laws would be enacted that would be contrary to their value system.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government's wording of the bill was defeated by 22 votes. A tougher version drafted by the opposition was carried overwhelmingly as the majority of Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald's Fine Gael Party abstained and a few voted for it. Some members of the Labor Party, junior members of the coalition, voted against both versions on the ground that any amendment was unnecessary. The defeat, while it did not mean the fall of the Government, was a major embarrassment for Mr. FitzGerald, who had branded the opposition wording ambiguous to the point where it could put the lives of women at risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAN VOTED TO EASE BANKRUPTCY DEFECTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/business/plan-voted-to-ease-bankruptcy-defects.html,"The Senate approved legislation today to create 229 new bankruptcy judgeships and to rectify constitutional defects in the bankruptcy system. The legislation, which passed on a voice vote, would also create 85 new Federal district and appeals court judgeships and permit judges to determine if individuals were seeking to abuse the bankruptcy code. Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to assign bankruptcy cases grounded in state law to bankruptcy judges who did not have the life tenure and guarantees against salary reductions called for by Article III of the Constitution. Although the 229 new judgeships that would be created by the legislation the Senate passed today would not receive those guarantees, they would be regarded only as adjuncts of the United States district courts. Federal district judges would be permitted to intercede in any case referred to the bankruptcy courts. House Has Not Yet Acted Federal district judges, moreover, would be required to decide bankruptcy cases involving interstate commerce or other questions outside bankruptcy issues themselves. The House has not acted on bankruptcy legislation yet but is contemplating a substantially different response to the Supreme Court ruling. A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee would establish 227 bankruptcy judges and give them two essential guarantees, life tenure and exemption from salary reductions. Since the Supreme Court's ruling, in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., the nation's bankruptcy courts have been in legal limbo. The Court postponed the effective date of the decision twice, once until early last October and again until late last December, but Congress still failed to act. The Supreme Court was unwilling to grant a further postponement so the bankruptcy courts have been operating under an interim rule proposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the top policy-making body of the Federal courts, and adopted in each district. The rule has the effect of placing bankruptcy under the purview of the the Federal district courts while permiting the district judges to delegate much of their authority to the bankruptcy judges. Credit Industry Victory A major provision of the Senate's legislation, the option for special judicial scrutiny of personal bankruptcy cases, represents a victory for the credit industry, which has argued that a 1978 bankruptcy law made personal bankruptcy excessively attractive. Under the provisions of the Senate bill, the bankruptcy judge would be permitted to dismiss a personal bankruptcy case if he believed that a settlement would constitute a ''substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code. The bill also calls for court-appointed trustees to set out, in an unbiased fashion, the options available to individuals filing for personal bankruptcy. The consumer credit industry had lobbied for legislation that would have required judges to consider an individual's future income before settling a bankruptcy case. Spokesmen for the industry said, however, that they were pleased with the provisions designed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy code. ''This recognizes the fact that there have been problems with the bankruptcy law, and it institutes procedures to insure that abuse will be curbed,'' said Frances B. Smith, a spokesman for the American Financial Services Association, which has been a principal part of the lobbying effort. ''Some of the people declaring bankruptcy have not been aware of the different options available to them.'' Major Issue of Contention The creation of 61 new district court judgeships and 24 new court of appeals judgeships was a major issue of contention in the Senate. The judgeships were created to handle growing caseloads that have become a burden to Federal judges, but some members of the Senate, principally from the South, considered the new judges unnecessary. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, attributed the heavy burden of work to ''judicial activism and usurpation by the judges themselves'' and added: ''The Federal judiciary has recognized any number of alleged constitutional rights that the framers of the Constitution never had any idea they were creating. The 'right' to abortion, the 'right' to drive voluntary school prayer out of the schools and the 'right' to massive forced busing to achieve racial balance would all be novelties to those who drafted the United States Constitution.'' The Senate actually acted on two separate bills today, folding its response to the Supreme Court decision into a bill intended to combat abuse of the bankruptcy code. Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has resisted attempts by the credit industry to win swift approval of legislation designed to make it more difficult for individuals to declare personal bankruptcy. Mr. Rodino, a Democrat from New Jersey, has repeatedly stated that he wished to act on the constitutional question of the bankruptcy judges before making adjustments in other sections of bankruptcy law. A House aide said that he believed the Senate bankruptcy package would not be acceptable to Mr. Rodino. ''You have to have a court before you can discuss substantive issues,'' the aide said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHICAGO'S ACTIVIST CARDINAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/magazine/chicago-s-activist-cardinal.html,"WHEN the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States convene in Chicago tomorrow to vote on a pastoral letter on nuclear warfare, their action will climax a two-year battle led by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, principal architect of the controversial declaration, who has fought for it as head of the bishops' committee that has seen it through three drafts. On that front, another and longer campaign is just beginning: The Cardinal sees the document, which will be distributed to parishes later this year, as a platform for continuing instruction and debate among the nation's 50 million Catholics. His long-term objective is the transformation of the Catholic Church in the United States into a ''peace church,'' and his public pursuit of that objective has brought him into conflict with some of his ecclesiastical colleagues and under severe criticism from the Reagan Administration. During the last decade, the youthful-looking 55-year-old Cardinal has earned a reputation as a polite but persistent warrior in social and ecclesiastical causes. There is some irony in the fact that the vote on the most controversial issue the church has ever taken up in this country, one it has debated in an unusually public way, will take place in Chicago. When Joseph Bernardin set out on this quest in 1981 he was Archbishop of Cincinnati. Last August, amid international furor over the letter, he was appointed Archbishop of Chicago, the nation's largest archdiocese, and less than four months later Pope John Paul II announced that he was giving the archbishop a cardinal's hat. In sending him to Chicago, the Pope may have set Cardinal Bernadin down in a more bewildering field than the arena of nuclear strategy, which for all its complexity is a tournament in which champions fight over a single issue. In the Chicago archdiocese, the problems are so complex, emotionally powerful and interlocked that just getting a grip on them requires heroic effort. The 2.4 million Catholics in the archdiocese account for almost half the city's population and more than half of its Cook and Lake County suburbs. The racial polarization the city so radically evidenced in last month's mayoral election divides the archdiocese in much the same way it divides the city: a broad range of European ethnic groups, a huge Hispanic population and the largest black Catholic group in the country. There are deeper problems, too. For almost 20 years, the Chicago archdiocese has drifted and decayed. Many reforms mandated by the Second Vatican Council were never even begun and there was very nearly an open rebellion by priests against Cardinal Bernardin's predecessor, the late John Cardinal Cody. The decline of the Chicago archdiocese became an obsessive problem for the Vatican in the late 1970's, with some Curia officials openly expressing fears that it could sink into anarchy. Yet its history has been one of innovation within the church and in social movements, and its size has long made it pre-eminent in the nation. Cardinal Bernardin's assignment is to pull it all back together, and he approaches his task with notions about spiritual renovation that virtually amount to creating a new kind of church. In a sense, he has the future of American Catholicism in his hands. There is no member of the American hierarchy who is more closely watched by church leaders in the United States and abroad. If he succeeds, Cardinal Bernardin will have many imitators; if not, the failure could be catastrophic. HE Cardinal's plunge into political controversy in the debate over nuclear warfare may be good preparation for the work ahead in Chicago, where eventually every question is political. In the case of the pastoral letter, he does not seem uncomfortable with politics.Nuclear strategy, he says, ''is a political issue, but it is also a moral one and we have an obligation to speak. The bishops have spoken on moral issues before, and some of them, like the rights of labor, have been political. We bring to bear on such concerns the light of a great moral tradition.'' It was he who devised the rules for the ad hoc Committee on War and Peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which heard testimony from an array of nuclear-war experts, political strategists and members of the Reagan Administration, including Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Eugene V. Rostow, then chief disarmament negotiator. Some bishops criticized the holding of hearings, but Cardinal Bernardin says, ''We were preparing to speak on a complicated international question and we couldn't do it without all the advice we could get.'' There was a sensation when he disseminated drafts of the proposed document to the media last year. But he regarded the circulation of them as ''an opportunity to teach and to learn.'' He and several other high-ranking American churchmen also went to Rome to meet with 30 European bishops who had asked to be briefed further. Although many peace-movement supporters feared pressure from the Vatican, Cardinal Bernardin insists that was not the case. ''The discussion was absolutely open,'' he says. The draft to be voted on this week, after what is expected to be a heated debate initiated by bishops still favoring a tougher stand, differs from earlier versions primarily in dropping support for a nuclear halt. There has also been a slight change in the language of earlier drafts which suggested that American targeting of nuclear weapons included civilian populations. The changes do bring the document more in line with the public stand of the Pope on the issue. But some Reagan Administration spokesmen have sought to leave the impression that behind-the-scenes lobbying turned the bishops around. The Cardinal denies that claim, saying that every change made through the various drafts was suggested by members of the bishops' commmittee, and that there were no conversations with Government officials except for those publicly announced and reported back to the bishops. ''For them to give the impression that the document was changed by pressure is simply wrong,'' he says heatedly. Although the Administration expressed mild satisfaction with the new draft, this document raises so many questions on the controlled use of nuclear weapons, that, in the Cardinal's words, it is ''skepticism bordering on outright disbelief.'' In the long run, what may prove most significant is that the pastoral letter limits the church's historical notion of what is a just war, and advises Catholics to consult their individual consciences about whether they can support a government that pursues a nuclear policy. Defining his notion of a ''peace church,'' Cardinal Bernardin has said that ''there is a need for a public voice willing to take risks on the side of reversing the arms race rather than reinforcing it.'' The potential constituency of the ''peace church,'' he adds, is the entire body of 50 million American Catholics. Whether that is realized will depend ultimately on the determination of individual bishops to keep the issue alive in their dioceses. Cardinal Bernardin's work on the pastoral letter and his promotion of it have unquestionably made easier his job as archbishop in Chicago, where the cause is popular and his international prominence receives a good deal of media attention. This leader of the ''peace church'' is what used to be called ''a prince of the Roman Church.'' But there is little about Cardinal Bernardin that one would associate with royalty, except, perhaps, for the rambling brick mansion bristling with towering chimneys where Chicago archbishops have lived for 100 years and where Cardinal Cody lived all alone. The new Cardinal has made changes: Heavy draperies were pulled aside, windows opened and ceremonial rooms and offices dismantled. The Cardinal invited two priests to move in with him and has welcomed a broad spectrum of Chicago society as visitors. The office he works in at the archdiocesan headquarters may be perfect for the image he is creating. A small room on the fourth floor of the crowded six-story building, it is Very Early Depression in style, furnished with an old desk, a round table with six side chairs, a television set and two Naugahyde arm chairs. On the walls are a crucifix, a painting of a Madonna and child and one of clowns. In that setting, the red telephone on his desk looks as if it might have been put there by Claes Oldenburg in a spirit of fun. The Cardinal seems at home there. He pulls his chair up closer to a visitor's and sits sideways in it, so that when his black jacket falls open it reveals a lining patterned with tiny white quatrefoils. Sitting does not describe his posture; there is more movement in his chair than in most joggers' routines, and as he talks, he uses both hands to shape and caress words and ideas. His conversation reflects an enormous range of interests and emotion, but popping up constantly amid talk of budgets, politics, family, music, war and peace are references to sanctity, salvation, God and prayer. He has a tendency to be serious about everything, but heavy-handed about nothing. Asked about his Cardinal's ring, he took it off and handed it to his visitor, telling a story about how it was made and commenting, ''I like it.'' That matter-of-fact sense of humor may be useful to him in Chicago, not only in church work but in politics. He had an early baptism in Chicago politics in the recent bitter mayoral campaign, into which he waded early with a warning to Catholics to keep racism, along with ethnic preferences and religion, out of the ballot box. There were racial demonstrations around churches during the campaign which were painful to him, but he continued to speak out against racism, and the day after the election he appeared at an interfaith breakfast with Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and pledged him his support. Those who knew the Cardinal in Cincinnati were accustomed to his taking stands on public issues. ''Nothing will intimidate Joe,'' says Dr. Alfred Gottschalk, president of Hebrew Union College there. Nor, he adds, is he susceptible to flattery. ''When he first came here, there were some old conservative Catholics who tried to win him over to their way of thinking,'' Dr. Gottschalk recalls. ''They did not stand a chance. He is open-minded but determined, and he is not going to be stopped or seduced.'' He will need all the determination he can muster to reinvigorate the Chicago archdiocese: to bring a sense of unity to its ethnic groups, reorganize its executive structure, involve lay people in decision making, recruit new priests and deal with the increasing exasperation of women anxious to play a more active role in the work of the church. If the people who applaud him sometimes talk as though he were a ''messenger from eternity,'' his world is hardly ''ephemeral.'' At least 15 languages are regularly used in masses at Chicago churches. The largest ethnic groups have traditionally been European, especially Polish and German. But in recent years, the Hispanic population - actually two groups; a Mexican-American one whose origins in Chicago go back 100 years and a Puerto Rican and Latino group - has risen to at least 500,000, with perhaps half again as many illegal immigrants. There are 100,000 black Catholics in the archdiocese, and that bloc is rapidly expanding. More than 2,400 priests serve 444 parishes and 5,000 nuns operate schools, hospitals and other institutions. The 61 Catholic high schools and 376 elementary schools have 186,000 students, and there are more than 36,000 enrolled in the two large Catholic universities and six colleges. CARDINAL Bernardin insists that the archdiocese has a mission and is not simply a giant corporation, but under Illinois law it is a corporation and the Cardinal is legally the whole works - chief executive officer, board of directors and sole stockholder. At the end of fiscal 1982, the archdiocese had securities investments of $150 million (market changes since have probably added another $40 million) and it held $27 million in receivable notes. Its revenues for the year, including investments, parish collections, school tuitions and Catholic Charities, were $294 million; its outlays, $281 million. The biggest expense item was for the schools (not including 48 high schools run by independent religious orders), which cost $121 million to operate, only half of which was covered by tuition. To finance its operations, the archdiocesan central office assesses parishes 5.87 percent of their collections. It also acts as their bank, paying 4 percent for funds deposited and charging 5 percent on loans. Last year, it held $65.9 million in deposits and had $18.7 million on loan. Deficits were shown by 117 parishes, mostly in the inner city, including 29 that are directly subsidized by the archdiocese. Church property, basically churches and schools, was listed at about $2.1 billion, but since property used by churches is neither depreciated nor taxed the figure represents only insurable value. The archdiocese owns no investment property. Historically, there has been little formal executive structure. There are two auxiliary bishops, but both are assigned to parishes.Cardinal Bernardin says he plans this year to nominate five or six auxiliary bishops, one to be a kind of executive vice president and the others to be given geographical jurisdictions, and he has said he is sympathetic to requests that one be black and one Hispanic. Recruiting priests has been a recent problem for the archdiocese, where there were only seven ordinations last year. That number, however, could double in each of the next several years. The two high schools where students who have an interest in the priesthood study have more than 1,000 students and the two seminaries where candidates study for priesthood now have 260 students, more than a third of whom entered this year. Recruiting priests and reorganizing his administration are hardly matters of controversy, but in most other areas Cardinal Bernardin is likely to encounter problems. For example, the status of women is a problem he has not yet tackled, despite pressure from many disparate groups. Sister Kaye Ashe, a Dominican nun and associate dean of Rosary College, whose new book ''Today's Woman, Tomorrow's Church,'' has won a top Catholic publishing award, recently wrote the Cardinal outlining some areas for consideration. He replied immediately, which impressed her, but she says he did not directly address such issues as promoting women to decision-making jobs in the archdiocese or giving them continuing education for pastoral duties. Asked what he will do eventually, the Cardinal says: ''This is a painful question for many people and it needs attention and study.'' But, reflecting the Vatican position, he adds that ''if the question being raised is one of participation, I am very sympathetic. If it is a question only of power, I would say, 'No.' '' In other matters, it is the Cardinal who will sometimes hear someone say, ''No'' -for instance, when he begins to implement plans to alter the strong ethnic identity of many parishes. While saying that it ''is very rich and should be preserved,'' he also says that he will find ways to stress the common identity of all. Although the realization of that vision in Chicago would seem impossible to almost any knowledgable observer of that city, those who knew the Cardinal in Cincinnati point out that he accomplished just that while archbishop there. Even more complex will be the difficulty of reshaping the structure of the large church school system, which is intricately woven into the city's political and racial structure. The potential for conflict in any reorganization is enormous. ''I know how attached people are to their neighborhood schools,'' he says, but he hopes that eventually ''they will see these things in a larger vision.'' He warns that ''the great danger is to just let things happen.'' The underlying instruction he has given to planners is that as the Catholic system is reshaped, it ''should not be seen as in competition with the public schools. They ought to complement one another.'' Even within the church, his view of education is quite different from the dominant ideas of the past. The schools are a part of Catholic education, he says, but only part. Catholic education is a lifetime process and part of the church's evangelizing efforts, he says, and the schools should be seen in that light, not as something unique. How much municipal social action he is willing to undertake is not yet clear. But his history in Cincinnati, where he became one of the most forceful activists in the state for jobs and equality for blacks and Appalachian immigrants, suggests it could be a great deal. To run the archdiocese's ecumenical and human relations programs he has brought back to Chicago Msgr. John J. Egan, a national social-action leader who worked in the city for 30 years before a falling-out with Cardinal Cody led him in 1972 to remove himself to the University of Notre Dame. For all his sophistication in church affairs and in politics, there is a lot of the small town in Cardinal Bernardin, and it works to his advantage when he is dealing with people. He was born in Columbia, S.C., to Maria and Joseph Bernardin, an immigrant stonecutter from northern Italy, and attended public and Catholic schools there before going on to the University of South Carolina, where he intended to prepare for a medical career. (One the jokes making the rounds in Chicago these days is that there, but for the grace of God, goes a good doctor). Like many children of immigrants, he has become more interested in his roots as he has grown older. He says that when they were young, he and his sister Elaine, now Mrs. James Addison, did not learn Italian ''because we were too busy becoming American,'' and it was only recently that he became proficient in the language. He did not visit Fiera di Primiero, the little town in the Dolomites, near the city of Trent, where his parents came from, until long after he had become a priest. When he received his cardinal's hat last February, his Primiero relatives rented a bus and drove to Rome for the ceremony. He likes to tell people about that, and many other things about his family, and those stories have a strong emotional appeal in Chicago - as indeed does the presence at some official ceremonies of his widowed mother, who now lives in a center for the aging operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor in the city. Cardinal Bernardin is now probably the best-known Catholic Church leader in this country. There are eight other cardinals, four of whom are retired, and the other three have not been national spokesmen for the country's bishops. Among American Catholic leaders, he is the one most often consulted by foreign leaders in the church. And in the American hierarchy he has no equals in the knowledge of church governance and structure. Yet his religious career has developed outside most of the rules that have governed Vatican appointments in this country for more than a century. He does not have a degree in theology, he never studied in Rome and he is not an alumnus of the North American College, whose old-boy network dominates Catholic episcopal thrones in the United States. He was already in college when he decided to become a priest and went to study Latin and philosophy at seminary colleges in Kentucky and Baltimore before taking his final training at the Catholic University of America in Washington. He has little interest in the status quo, and all his thinking about the church is in terms of action, which makes some church conservatives wary of him. On the other hand, he is loyal to the Vatican's positions on most theological and moral questions, and that makes some of the more eager innovators within the church uncomfortable. When, at 38, he became an auxiliary bishop in Atlanta, in 1966, he was the youngest bishop in the nation. Soon after, he began to play a broader role in church affairs. From 1968 to 1972 he was general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and was elected its president in 1974. He was one of four Americans elected as a delegate to the last three world synods of bishops, and at each was elected to the 15-member Permanent Council that writes the agenda of the next synod. One of his colleagues on the first two councils was Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, now Pope John Paul II. He has been a member of a number of important congregations of the Vatican Curia, including the Sacred Congregation for Bishops, and he was on the commission that recently issued a new code of church canon law. His official duties take him to Rome fairly often, and his acquaintance in the Vatican is wide. There is always speculation about how close he is to the Pope. Asked if he keeps in touch on the telephone, he laughs and says: ''I've never had a phone call from him. I do see the Pope when I am in Rome but otherwise the usual way is through the Apostolic Delegate in Washington.'' His innovative plans for the Chicago archdiocese are fully in line with its history, which has included leadership in social action, missionary work, the training of priests and the development of national lay organizations. In this century, the Cardinals George Mundelein, Samuel Stritch and Albert Meyer were not only outspoken liberals in the church and supporters of social-welfare programs in the country, but also very popular - in part for their notable willingness to allow a wide range of experimentation and spontaneous lay organization in the archdiocese. The fate of Cardinal Bernardin's immediate predecessor, John Cardinal Cody, was different. Although he promoted many programs, such as subsidizing inner-city schools, for which his predecessors would have been praised, he was autocratic, overly cautious, uncommunicative and isolated from his clergy. The fact that after his death a Federal grand jury dropped its investigation into allegations that he had diverted church funds to a woman friend did little to dissipate an air of scandal about his final years. When Cardinal Bernardin arrived in Chicago last August, he quickly created an image of himself as a reconciler, reopening an old church that had been closed amid great dissent, visiting a large high school once Catholic but since abandoned by the archdiocese, announcing plans to set up a Diocesan Council, a lay-clerical parliament. He also appointed a committee of businessmen to supervise an audit of church finances, which he distributed widely. During his first eight months in Chicago he has met as often as four or five times a week with many groups -labor unions, government bodies, civic groups, church organizations and lay people. To some he delivers simple pastoral messages, a few of which have become legend. At a Christmas mass in Cook County jail he startled inmates when he said: ''I ask you to accept my presence as a sign of my affection and respect and also as a pledge of continued prayers and support in the future.'' For other groups, he outlines agendas. He reminded city labor leaders that they had a tradition of social action and suggested they return to it. After telling Protestant leaders that there would be more ecumenical cooperation from his side, he noted that the dialogue between the two religions has become intellectually flabby and hinted that ignoring real issues is not very healthy. His talk to the Chicago Board of Rabbis and the Jewish Federation is almost a classic example of his style. He began by informing them that he had inaugurated programs to teach Jewish history and culture to Catholics, went on to restate the American bishops' support for Israel, and then spelled out their support for a Palestinian homeland in the Middle East. He rejected Jewish criticism of the Pope for having received Yassir Arafat in the Vatican last year, saying, ''Such comments deeply offend many Catholics and are not conducive to dialogue.'' He finished by urging public discussion of differences on such matters as abortion and public support for parents with children in private schools. He sometimes sets off an argument, but his reception is invariably enthusiastic. Martin E. Marty, a Lutheran minister and a professor at the University of Chicago, says: ''The secret is that what you see is what you get. He is absolutely open. He has no enemies.'' Critics he does have, but he tends to disarm them since he leaves the impression that a solution might be found to almost any problem. He will meet and listen to any group for hours, and will express entirely credible sympathy with them, but his own direction is clearly in line with Rome's. In fact, it is fair to characterize his pastoral theology, in general, as fairly conservative. Although he keeps a crushing 17-hour work day that worries many of his friends, he does know how to relax. One of the first things he did after arriving in Chicago was to subscribe to the Chicago Symphony. And, although he complains that he hasn't time to read much, his conversation and speeches are studded with quotations from news stories, movies and the works of many writers, including Luther, Emerson, Tolstoy and John Betjeman. He writes his own papers and speeches in a precise and direct style. And for all his accessibility - it is said he spoke personally with every priest in the archdiocese within a few months of his arrival - he values his privacy, finding it where he can, in his car as he drives to appointments or in airplanes on numerous trips, which he generally makes alone. Ask him what Joseph Bernardin is deeply, essentially, and he says: ''A priest.'' Two years ago he wrote a widely distributed pamphlet, ''Called to Serve, Called to Lead,'' a classic meditation on priesthood which includes practical suggestions about prayer, patience, sexuality and personality not often found in such guides. It is characteristic of him to have insisted in the pamphlet that a priest finds his true personal identity only in his priesthood. ''My principal role,'' he says, ''is to proclaim the Lord and the Gospel, and it has a very evangelistic thrust. I have tried to witness to that not only in preaching, but in the way I live and relate to people. There is a great spiritual hunger in this country. For some years we have gone through a period of questioning and a great loss of faith, but I see a reawakening.'' That the rebirth he sees is a faith found on the other side of disillusionment does not trouble him. ''People may be tired of the institutions, but they want the Lord. We may come out of this with a much stronger faith than before.'' Challenged about his traditional views on moral questions, especially sexual mores, he says: ''People have been given some strange notions, not only about sexuality, but about their own purposes and identities. I am not so much interested in do's and dont's. I support the rules, but I really want people to come to church, to have a relationship with the Lord. If they do,'' he says, ''they will find it is much more demanding than the rules.'' That kind of view is almost certain to bring the church into increasing conflict with the rest of society, if not with the civil order, and the Cardinal acknowledges that: ''If we live a religious life and encourage others to do that, there is no doubt we will come into increasing conflict with the prevailing values of this society.'' It is hard to guess how much he thinks is enough, but there is a lot of combative instinct in the man. His effect on crowds of Chicago Catholics is difficult to define. It is more than celebrity, although he knows how to use that very well, and there is a terrific excitement about him. He sometimes seems bothered by the applause, perhaps the only thing he talks about that makes him hesitant or nervous. ''Something strange is happening and it's a new experience for me,'' he says. ''I find it increasingly difficult to get out of the crowds I get into.'' The Cardinal does not seem to be running for anything except the next meeting on his busy schedule, but there is an extraordinary amount of speculation about his future among people in and outside the church. Dr. Gottschalk of Cincinnati's Hebrew Union College offers what he calls a Jewish perspective on the matter. ''If ever an American could be Pope,'' he says, ''Joe would be wonderful.'' Chicagoans have their own perspectives. There is the applause, the admiration, the apprehension, the questioning, many individual judgments. In a basement bar a block away from Holy Name Cathedral, a sometime church usher pondering a second Scotch offers this one: ''The Cardinal's a terrific guy, all in all. I guess he'll make it here. I hope he does. We need it. But I would find it all easier to take if his parents hadn't been named Mary and Joseph.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A LETTER NEVER SENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/archives/a-letter-never-sent.html,"WHEN I last wrote you I had had one miscarriage. You answered, ''Not to worry, the gleam in your eye will be a baby soon.'' Well, now I've had three miscarriages, the last one twins in my fourth month. That gleam in my eye seems to be a falling star. The womb is supposed to be a safe place, a place where stardust develops secretly, mysteriously into a tiny, new world. A place utterly secure, nurturing; a place that protects from all harm. Mine is disappointing, it does not fulfill its responsibility. It seems hostile. I feel I have failed in the most fundamental, most primitive, most feminine function. I cannot protect and nurture my own babies. This is a profound sense of failure, and in spite of my usual confidence and good sense, it calls into question the worth and validity of all I have accomplished. I must fight with this despair lest it pull me under. Could it be that I cannot have children because I do not deserve them, or because I deserve punishment? No. Violent mothers have babies, women who don't want them conceive and deliver. I am not a paragon of virtue, nor am I a reservoir of evil, but these questions and accusations come unbidden and unexpected. Sometimes, chatting at a party, I have to excuse myself for a cry in the powder room. It comes especially when yet another friend announces her pregnancy or describes her labor. Then back creeps the stealthy cat of self-doubt, and failure grabs me in the stomach and shakes me like a rag doll. Thank God I don't feel like this all the time. Only in my worst moments - the first - when the sonogram revealed the twins lying motionless and unresponsive. The worst moments ebb and flow. More and more, I feel optimistic and strong. Even if I never succeed in having a child, this experience has opened new doors, new insights into myself and others, into pregnancy and into grief. I have, what seems to me, an inordinate need to talk about losing the twins. Intellectually, I know this is normal. Many women need to but often can't because no one will listen, or because of their own inhibitions. I know talking helps to integrate this loss (as does writing this letter), will eventually help me to accept it and let it go. Talking, and reading about miscarriage and stillbirth helps me feel less crazy. Do you know that most people, after a loss, fear that another loved one - spouse, child, best friend - will die also? What a relief to learn that that fear is common. It makes sense. Suddenly we are face to face with how little control we have over our lives, over our own bodies. We feel that way when any loved one dies, or after being mugged. What surprises me most, perhaps, is how enormous an event this is. I never knew that before. I have been guilty of platitudes myself. God! How unthinking and inadvertantly cruel I was. Smug, too. I never thought it could happen to me. And if it does, no big deal. Just try again. The big deal is, even though you can't hold this child, even though its existence may be unknown to others, it begins to assert itself in your picture of yourself and your marriage. I don't think this happens to the same degree with the woman who does not want it - who plans to have an abortion. She wards off developing a bond with what is growing inside her. The embryo is an intruder, to be guarded against. It rarely takes on the identity of ''baby.'' The womb is not perceived as a miraculous, mysterious place, more as an accomplice to a break-in; awesome because she experiences its power, but infuriating because it has betrayed her. You cannot compare the feelings of a wanted pregnancy to an unwanted one. That early bonding does not occur, or has a different quality. In a pregnancy that is wanted the bonding between mother and infant begins very early. How rapidly and deeply it evolves depends on the mother's personality, how intensely she longs for a child, and her own experiences with pregnancies - with her own previous ones, her mother's, friends, sisters. The big deal is, even though you can't hold or see this little fellow growing inside, it takes on an existence of its own, an identity, very early. It has no reality except what the parents fantasize, opening wide the doors of possibility. This baby is a perfect baby. This baby is cute and smart, roguish and sweet, brave and strong. This baby is tiny and needs protection. He is loved and loves like no other baby in the world. This baby is the incarnation of all I've ever wanted or thought possible. And this baby is my friend; I am never alone while he is inside. When you lose a baby you lose a future. There is no past to recall, to give comfort. It is a broken promise, the despair of which lasts a long time; and the sorrow hides in the shadows for the rest of your life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AN ECONOMIST IN THE HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/books/an-economist-in-the-house.html,"HOW WE LIVE, By Victor R. Fuchs. 293 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $17.50. TOO often, economics is as dismal a science as many believe it to be. Most economists pass their days in sober contemplation of next month's price for hog bellies or last month's default rate on bank loans to non-oil-exporting, less developed countries. But during the last few decades, economics has broadened its horizons. Academic economists, frustrated by diminishing intellectual yields on their own ground, have been cultivating the fields of psychologists, philosophers, anthropologists, social historians - you name it. Economists, for example, have more or less convincingly demonstrated that the Southern plantation gentry carefully minded the morals of their female slaves, that the ancient cultures of China, South America and Europe were driven in diverse directions by their choice of feed grains, and that the certainty of punishment is a better deterrent to crime than the punishment's severity. The economists' latest enthusiasm, serendipitously coinciding with popular concerns, is the family. ''How We Live'' is a compendium of economic research on the subject, an economist's eye view on everything from why some women smoke during pregnancy, to whether it makes sense to send Junior to Harvard, to why Junior's widowed mom won't move back in with the kids. Victor R. Fuchs, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, promises more than he can deliver. But this accessible little book is chock-full of fascinating facts and educated conjectures. Some of the most interesting of these are only marginally related to economics. Consider, for example, the question of why infant mortality among black Americans has remained 60 to 90 percent above that among whites since the 1940's. The conventional wisdom is that blacks suffer from poor diet and medical care, which leads to smaller babies at birth, which puts the infants at greater risk. When econometric techniques are used to eliminate these factors, however, most of the weight difference remains. Why, then, do black women give birth to so many infants below the crucial 5 1/2-pound mark? Mr. Fuchs doesn't know for certain, but he infers from other studies of disadvantaged ethnics that the causes are social not medical. Puerto Rican and Mexican women living in the continental United States, he notes, are on average equally poor and equally deprived of good medical care. But many more Puerto Rican babies are born underweight than Mexican babies, and Mr. Fuchs argues that this must be attributable to the relative instability of Puerto Rican families. What is more recognizably in the realm of economics rather than of sociology is Mr. Fuchs's explanation of why more married women are now working than in years past - more accurately, why more married women are working outside their homes. The obvious explanation is that their families need the money. That may be true, but it doesn't explain why a higher proportion of married women were typing letters or working on assembly lines during the affluent 1960's than during the relatively poor 1950's. A larger female labor force could be a byproduct of feminism; a growing percentage of women no longer feels fulfilled by housework. That's a plausible explanation, but it's not correct: The first surge in female participation in the work force came during the early 1950's, a decade before ''The Feminine Mystique'' was published. How did the availability of timesaving innovations - dishwashers, TV dinners, wash-and-wear clothes -affect women's decisions to go to work? There is a temptation here, Mr. Fuchs says, to confuse cause and effect. Supermarkets, the biggest timesavers of all, existed at least 35 years ago. But they did not really catch on until women felt the need to reduce the time they devoted to shopping. Perhaps, then, women's going to work in increasing numbers is related to the postponement of childbearing? No way. In 1948, 10 percent of the married women with children under 6 were working. By 1980 the figure was 47 percent. The key to understanding changes in women's participation in the labor force, Mr. Fuchs says, lies in the higher ''opportunity cost'' attached to staying home. Women's wages have been rising for a long, long time. But only during the last few decades have many women been able to earn enough to make it worthwhile to cut back on housework, or to hire someone else to clean and baby-sit. This explanation, he notes, is consistent with the fact that women with more education (and earning potential) were among the first to enter the work force in the postwar years. ACTUALLY, Mr. Fuchs says, simple principles such as ''opportunity cost'' form the basis on which most of the new economics of the family is built. For example, the University of Chicago economist Gary Becker would liken the institution of marriage to Adam Smith's pin factory. When pin workers began to specialize in the separate steps needed to create the finished product, they became far more productive. Analogously, couples historically benefited by dividing the labor between home and field or factory. Now, for a variety of economic and cultural reasons, the benefits from the division of labor in marriage are fading. And that, perhaps, also explains why divorce rates have risen. Once you get the idea, just about anyone who got a B+ in Econ 101 is eligible to play the game. Why are better educated mothers more likely to have their children immunized against polio? The answer is that schooling lowers mom's rate of ''time discount,'' the future payoff she requires to invest time and money now rather than later. Why do more unmarried mothers keep their babies today than did in the past? Due to the reduced economic and psychic cost of contraception and abortion, fewer unwanted babies are now born. And because of more generous government income-support programs, the cost of setting up a single-parent household is lower than it has ever been. Why, even when the results are controlled for family income, are firstborn and only children healthier, and why do they do better in school? The answer: Parents value the ''scarce product'' more highly and therefore invest more in its care. ''How We Live'' may irritate those who believe that people can't be explained by simple economic principles. And it is sure to infuriate those who believe that competing disciplines - psychology, politics, biology - tell us all we need to know about human behavior. It is not fair, though, to judge the book or its author from extreme perspectives. Economists aren't going to revolutionize the study of family life. Yet, larded between the obvious and the ridiculous in ''How We Live,'' there is much insightful research. And Mr. Fuchs's compact style makes the book a pleasure to read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/04/nyregion/about-new-york.html,"Public School 15 is on one side of East Fourth Street between Avenues C and D. On the other side of the street are four bricked-up abandoned buildings and a grocery store that is never open. On one side of the school building, there is a big, vacant lot in which someone has put up two solitary swings. The lot glitters in the sun with green broken glass and offers a fine view of Fifth Street, where there are more vacant lots, more glass and more bricked-up buildings. Across from the big lot is what was once a little lot and is now a brave little community garden, with a patch of tall red tulips and some slender stalks of grape hyacinth. All the plants have signs in front of them, with Latin names and information. ''Lavandula Angustifolia,'' it says in front of the lavender. The gates to the garden are padlocked. Across the street, in P.S. 15, the children in the after-school arts program put on their spring play the other day. It was typical of elementary school programs in a lot of ways. There were a great many mistakes. The anatomy chart that was supposed to be a major prop in ''Captain Nemo and His Magic Submarine'' never showed up on stage because someone left it in the back room. The Isadora Duncan gowns in the rose petal dance lost a little something in the translation because all the dancers wore T-shirts underneath. It was sometimes difficult to hear all the words to ''Aba Daba Honeymoon.'' But there was something special about the performers' energies and the audience enthusiasm for a simple little entertainment in a neighborhood in which children complain about how many junkies there are on the streets, and how sometimes they fall in front of you and you have to step over them. There was something wonderful about the ordinariness of it all, the cardboard swords and the police officer's uniform made from a brown paper bag. First there was a circus parade, with paper masks. Then William Mason, a skinny boy with a baby face who is 10 years old and lives in the projects nearby, came on stage in a satin cape and made a rubber ball appear from beneath a black handkerchief. ''Oh, wow!'' cried someone in the front room, and the students applauded respectfully. Then there were some cartwheels and piggyback rides set to music. ''Captain Nemo'' came later, a greatly doctored version featuring a long first-act speech between three girls about the relative virtures of Charlie, Miguel and Ricky of the Puerto Rican rock group Menudo. But the high point of the show came when all the performers gathered in a line and sang ''Blue Skies'' as though it was brand new. Their clear voices filled the room: Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see. The children had chosen that song over ''Physical'' to perform in the show. The after-school program is directed by the Third Street Music School Settlement and financed by the New York City Youth Board. About 40 children stay every afternoon from 3 until 5 P.M., learning from dancers, artists, singers. Some of their parents send them because they hope the program will keep them off the streets, and some send them because they hope it will keep them out of their hair. Pablo Delano directs the program. ''I have to kick somebody out every once in a while,'' he said. ''They're just too wild. It's scary at 5 o'clock when I send them home and the street is all filled with junkies. But they know everything - junkies, pregnancy, abortion. They learn everything in this neighborhood.'' The children live right around P.S. 15. ''It's a little bit bad because they sell drugs on Third Street,'' said Eduardo Ortiz, who is 12. ''It's an all right place, but there are too many druggies,'' added William. All over the streets there are men with bright eyes and fast patter selling heroin and the needles to use it with. All over the streets there are sleepy people who bought what the men had to sell. Down the street from P.S. 15 there is the famous mural of the eagle with a hypodermic needle clutched in his claws and the legend ''Come fly with me, fool.'' There are less sophisticated messages nearby: ''Shoplift something'' in black on one wall, and ''Warfarin,'' the name of the rat poison. But the amazing thing about the area around P.S. 15 is not how much of it is dead or dying, but how much of it is still alive. Here and there are other gardens. On some lampposts are pasted leaflets that say ''Drugs Kill.'' Another reads ''Community Garden Now Being Organized'' with a number to call. Someone is putting together a block party, a group spent a day sweeping the streets. And the other day the children in the after-school program put on their play and had a party afterward. William got angry at Pablo and said, ''Shut up, man,'' but he still signed the card the girls were passing around for the director, with a printed bouquet of pink flowers and the message ''It's a joy to know you.'' ''I love you, Pablo,'' said Lucy Gonzalez, 11, who was still wearing the blue eye shadow and eyebrow pencil from the show, and who looked disquietingly old. Pablo has been working on the after-school program for three years. It was the end of another season when he sent the children home. Across the street from the school a man was on the nod, the crook of his arm all pitted with little red holes. ''Junkie,'' said one of the performers disdainfully, holding one of the flowers that had been given out after the play. Each year the program loses some children. They move on. They grow up. Some of them may fly with the fool's eagle and some of them may plant gardens. At the very least, they know the words to ''Blue Skies.'' They all did that one perfectly: Blue days, all of them gone, Nothing but blue skies from now on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, MEETING THIS WEEK, IS FACING DISCORD",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/09/us/council-of-churches-meeting-this-week-is-facing-discord.html,"The National Council of Churches, the largest ecumenical organization in the United States, will confront some of the most difficult issues in its history when it meets in San Francisco this week. The four-day gathering, beginning Tuesday, comes on the heels of renewed charges that the council leans too far to the left on social issues and growing concern that it may have lost touch with the members of its 33 Protestant and Orthodox denominations. The council's 180-member governing board is scheduled to spend an entire day discussing whether the Metropolitan Community Churches, a denomination formed as a haven for homosexual Christians, is eligible for membership. The board will also hear a preliminary report from a panel appointed to chart the future of the 32-year-old council. When complete, the report is expected to suggest major changes in the way denominations cooperate with one another. Panel members say church leaders believe the council has a cumbersome bureaucracy that confuses church officials and fails to respond to the interests of member churches. Need for Change Acknowledged The council's president, Bishop James Armstrong of the Indiana Conference of the United Methodist Church, acknowledges that changes are needed. ''If we try to do things today the way we did them 15 years ago, we have signed our own death warrant,'' said the Bishop, who named the panel on the council's future as soon as he was elected president in 1981. Bishop Armstrong and several other leaders would also like the council to include a broader range of American Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church is not a member, though it joins in some activities. Most major evangelical and conservative churches also shun the council because of its liberal theological and social positions. Recent public criticism of the council focuses on allegations that it supports leftist groups in Central America and elsewhere and that it gives insufficient attention to the value of democracy. The allegations were made largely through a Washington organization, the Institute on Religion and Democracy, composed mainly of neoconservative theologians and political activists. Under its present system, the National Council of Churches creates committees that are not directly supervised by council leaders or representatives of the member churches. Links, however tenuous, with special interest groups such as the Interreligious Task Force on El Salvador and Central America have caused trouble when the groups became involved in controversies. ''Accountability and governance are being closely examined,'' said the Rev. E.O. Smith, dean of St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral in Buffalo, a member of the panel on the council's future. He said the panel was discussing which programs ''are the albatrosses'' that could be discontinued. The council's focus on social concerns may have cost it support among churchgoers who are worried more about the challenges to their own faith than about religious liberty in Albania, the subject of a resolution on the docket this week. Expanding Theological Work In response to criticism, the council has been trying to expand its theological and spiritual work. The Commission on Faith and Order, its main theological unit, has undertaken several ecumenical studies at the behest of the churches. The commission includes Roman Catholic priests and theologians, giving it the broader base that many in the churches want. The commission did a painstaking theological study on the membership application from the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, which was formed in 1968 to minister to homosexuals. Council membership for the 30,000-member denomination is problematic because, while its doctrinal statements are as orthodox as those of any denomination in the council, its views on homosexuality are unacceptable to most churches. The Commission on Faith and Order was asked to decide whether a church formed around homosexuality could be considered eligible for membership. Its study concluded that since the council had not developed a theology that would give a definitive answer, each church would have to make its own decision. Some denominations believe the council could admit the Metropolitan Community Churches without sanctioning its views on homosexuality since member churches disagree on other ethical issues such as abortion. But a majority of the denominations strongly argue against admission. Some say that there may be no theological reason for denying membership but that approval it would cause several denominations, including the Eastern Orthodox Churches, to quit the council. Final Vote in November Talks this week may reveal whether any compromise can be reached before a final vote is taken in November. The council, which has headqaurters in New York, has also been slow to adjust to major changes in American religion. When it was founded, it represented strong national denominations flush with postwar growth and optimism. It quickly became embroiled in politics and was buoyed by its early support of the civil rights movement. But today most national church bodies, faced with declining membership and internal problems, give less attention to the ecumenical organization. ''We use the N.C.C. in very few places,'' said the Rev. William Norgren, chief ecumenical officer for the Episcopal Church. ''What we want from it most is reliable information and research.'' Officials of the Episcopal Church, he said, are convinced the council needs to be ''much leaner.'' Despite the criticisms and uneasiness, most church officials say they need an organization like the council. They readily praise its accomplishments, including the Revised Standard Version of the Bible and a huge program of worldwide relief and development activities. Most do not want the council to back away from engagement with social issues. But, said the Rev. James M. Wall, editor of the independent weekly Christian Century and a supporter of the council, some selectivity is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TRANSPLANTATION OF FETAL CURES POINTS TOWARD DIABETES CELL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/arts/transplantation-of-fetal-cures-points-toward-diabetes-cell.html,"SCIENTISTS in California and Australia have eliminated diabetes in some laboratory animals by giving them pancreas glands transplanted from fetuses of the same species. The research represents one of several dramatically new modes of attack on human diabetes, a widespread disease that still, despite decades of research, can be neither prevented nor cured but only alleviated, and even with the best medical management continues to cause blindness, loss of limbs and premature death in some patients. If applied to humans, however, the new technique of transplanting the fetal pancreas might raise a highly emotional issue. The only source for such transplants would be aborted human fetuses. In the United States, a Federal commission studied the propriety of using human fetal tissues for medical research, in the mid-1970's and found it ethically acceptable. That determination was written into regulations of what is now the Department of Health and Human Services. But in Australia, the pancreas transplant research has evoked recent protests from antiabortion activists even though the first use of the technique in humans may still be several years away. Dr. Josiah Brown of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pioneer in the fetal transplant research, estimates that the method will be ready for its first trial in humans in about three years. He and other scientists involved insist that the use of tissues from an aborted fetus is an issue separate from the issue of abortion itself. That, too, was essentially the finding of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The issue was explored at length because Congress, in 1974, had ordered a moratorium on all research involving the living human fetus until the commission had studied the propriety of the research and had given an opinion. After the commission's report in 1975, the moratorium was lifted. There has been little public controversy since then. Furthermore, pancreatic transplants involve only fetal tissues, not the living fetus. At present there is a substantial body of fetal research in progress, most of it aimed at understanding development in the womb and finding ways of avoiding abnormalities. There has been relatively little work on transplantation of fetal tissues except those of the pancreas and thyroid. Diabetes is a complex disease in which the body either produces too little insulin or fails to make proper use of the supplies it does make. Most of the estimated 10 million Americans who suffer from the disease can be maintained in acceptably good day-to-day health by use of diet alone, but more than a million, including most of those who develop diabetes as children, must have regular injections of insulin. The injections maintain approximately the proper chemical balance in the patient's body, but they do not cure the disease or eliminate the risk of long-term complications including blindness, loss of limbs through blood vessel deterioration, heart and kidney disease and shortened lifespan. Failure to prevent the complications has spurred scientists to look for radically new treatments. Recent research has taken three principal tacks, all depending on the fact that the body's main source of insulin is the tiny islands of cells called islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Certain cells in these islets, called beta cells, produce the hormone and send it to the liver and other tissues throughout the body. One research approach has been to transplant the adult pancreas from a person who has just died. Another is to collect the insulinproducing cells from such a gland and transplant them alone. The third, used only in animal research so far, is that of transplanting the fetal pancreas. Each method has potential advantages, but also disadvantages, said Dr. Brown. All except the fetal pancreas transplants would suffer from a serious shortage of supply if widely used. Dr. Paul E. Lacy and colleagues of Washington University in St. Louis have pioneered research on the transplantation of islet cells alone, even succeeded in transplants between mice and rats, crossing the species barrier that ordinarily would have caused the recipient animal's immune defenses to destroy the foreign tissue. Dr. Lacey believes some of the same techniques will be applicable to humans soon. ''Within a year we will be close to trying,'' he said the other day. Dr. Lacey does not believe the word ''cure'' is appropriate for the treatments under development because, he says, this term implies understanding the cause of a disease well enough to thwart it altogether. The underlying process by which diabetes does its damage is still mysterious. He is hopeful that some form of transplantation may prevent the destructive complications of diabetes even before their origin is thoroughly understood. Preventing these complications is the main objective of the research. Dr. Brown, in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Lafferty of Australia's National University in Canberra, has developed a method for transplanting the fetal pancreas in animals in such a way that only the insulin-producing tissue survives. This is an important advantage of the method because digestive enzymes made by other tissues of a transplanted pancreas can have a destructive effect, Dr. Brown said. With the proper timing, the transplant survives as an organ devoted almost entirely to insulin production. In the rat, this surviving tissue grows ''enormously,'' Dr. Brown said, and eventually produces 20 to 25 percent as much insulin as a normal rat pancreas. If the transplant is placed so that the production goes first to the recipient's liver, where it is most needed, this is fully adequate for the body's insulin needs, he said. The results of such transplants in rats have been spectacular. ''It was fantastic, a dramatic change,'' Dr. Brown said. ''The diabetes just went away.'' The timing of such transplants is critical and delicate. They must be done at a stage of gestation in which the fetal insulin-producing tissues have developed, but the enzyme-producing cells have not yet begun to act. In the rat, this strategic point is at about 17 1/2 days of gestation out of the total of 21 to 22, Dr. Brown and his colleages have found. If the experimenters wait just another half day, the destructive enzymes appear and the transplant is too late. In the pig, the animal in which much current research is being done, the proper time is around the 55th day of a gestation period of about 114. In the human the optimum is around the 16th week of fetal development. This has been demonstrated by laboratory experiments that did not involve transplantation of the fetal human pancreas. The timing is significant in terms of future supply. About 9 percent of abortions are done at about that time, according to some estimates. As with other organs, the main unsolved problem with pancreas transplants is that of destruction of the transplanted tissues by the recipient's immune defenses. One key approach has been to look for ways of preparing the pancreas tissues so that they do not evoke an immune attack. This would free the patient from lifetime use of immunosuppressive drugs. Dr. Lacey and his colleagues in St. Louis have attacked immunity problems in four different ways: by growing islet cells a for a week at low temperature; by growing them in the presence of excessive oxygen; by treating the islet sample with antibodies before transplantation; or by treating the recipient animals in advance with antibodies to make them ''tolerant'' to the transplanted tissue. Much of this work builds on Dr. Lafferty's evidence that white blood cells in the pancreatic tissue are important in evoking the destructive response by the transplant recipient's body. The research team in St. Louis has also developed new, effective ways of collecting samples of islet cells free of the other pancreatic tissues. In one method, the scientists digest the pancreas' structural framework with an enzyme called collagenase to free the islet cells. The nonislet cell portion is captured by the tiny plastic barbs of a sheet of Velcro. ''It is lovely,'' said Dr. Lacey in describing the method. The islet cells make up only about 1 percent of the whole pancreas. When concentrated and separated from the rest of the gland, they can be transplanted as only about a thimbleful of tissue. In research on dogs, Dr. David Scharp at Washington University has developed automated procedures for collecting the islet cells. Even before these new developments, transplantation of the adult pancreas helped some patients, at least for a time. More than 190 human pancreas transplants have been done during the past two decades, according to the latest report of an international registry. At their last published tabulation, last year, 19 patients were alive and free of any need for insulin injections. Nine had been so for more than a year. But this time span is far too short for an assessment of the effects on the complications of diabetes. The registry report, in the journal Diabetes, published by the American Diabetes Association, said there have also been 76 attempts to transplant human islet cells in 71 patients. ''A variety of tissue sources, methods of preparation, sites of implantation and immunosuppressants have been used, but almost all attempts have failed,'' the report said. ''Four patients were said to have become insulin-independent for sustained periods after islet transplantation, but insufficient details are available in these cases for critical analysis.'' The new research in St. Louis, Los Angeles, Canberra and elsewhere suggests that a new era in such transplants may be dawning today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADMINISTRATION PRESSES COURT ON TEEN-AGE CONTRACEPTIVE RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/us/administration-presses-court-on-teen-age-contraceptive-rule.html,"The Reagan Administration asked the United States Court of Appeals today to uphold a new Federal rule that would require certain family planning clinics to notify parents when they prescribe contraceptives for minors. Another court proceeding today involved a Utah law that would require retailers to notify parents when they sell prescription or nonprescription contraceptives to minors. A Federal district judge issued a temporary restraining order to bar enforcement of that law, which attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood of Utah say infringes upon privacy rights protected by the Constitution. Judge David K. Winder, in Salt Lake City, said that there was ''sufficient justification'' for him to delay enforcement of the state law until he could hold a hearing on its merits later this year. She Says Authority Is Clear At the Court of Appeals hearing in Washington, Carolyn B. Kuhl, a Justice Department lawyer, told the court: ''It is absolutely clear that the Secretary of Health and Human Services had the authority to issue the regulations challenged in this case.'' Congress, she said, wanted to encourage ''family participation'' in adolescents' contraceptive decisions and ''the family cannot participate in an activity that it does not know is taking place.'' Federal district judges in Washington and New York have struck down the new rule, saying it would increase adolescent pregnancies by discouraging young women from seeking birth control services. The Government has appealed both decisions. The rule would apply to family planning clinics that receive Federal money. The Government says there are 5,000 such clinics. In 1981, they served 615,000 people under the age of 18. The hearing was held before a three-judge panel of the appeals court here. The judges were J. Skelly Wright, Harry T. Edwards and Robert H. Bork. Questions posed to Miss Kuhl by Judge Edwards suggested that he saw little merit in the Government's position. Judge Wright was noncommittal, and Judge Bork seemed to be searching for some legal rationale that might support the proposed rule. Judge Disputes Her Miss Kuhl declared: ''It's entirely legitimate for a parent to be involved in family planning decisions of an adolescent child.'' Judge Edwards, interrupting her, said, ''That's a moral question, an ethical question, not a statutory issue.'' President Reagan defended the parental notification rule when he spoke to a convention of evangelical Christians in Orlando, Fla., on March 8. Mr. Reagan said that ''the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy.'' Critics of the rule never ''mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex,'' the President said. He asked: ''Is all of Judeo-Christian tradition wrong? Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm?'' The lawsuits here were filed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, a nonprofit group representing clinics that receive Federal money. Edwards Faults Language In an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, Congress in 1981 said that clinics receiving Federal funds for contraceptive services should, ''to the extent practical,'' encourage family participation in their activities. If Congress had wanted to require parental notification, Judge Edwards said, it could have used more explicit language. John W. Nields Jr., a lawyer for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, said that Congress recognized the need for clinics to respect confidentiality when dispensing contraceptives under Title X of the Public Health Service Act. That title, enacted in 1970, authorized Federal support for family planning services, including prescription and nonprescription contraceptives. Tracing the history of the legislation, Mr. Nields said: ''There is nothing to suggest that Congress liked teen-age sex. But Congress liked abortion, spending billions of dollars in welfare funds and potentially ruined lives for our nation's teen-agers a lot less.'' Nancy L. Buc, a lawyer for the Planned Parenthood Federation, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed in its legal duty to weigh and evaluate the 120,000 comments filed on its proposed rule. The department, she said, cited its desire to protect the health of adolescents as a major reason for the rule. But, according to medical experts, she said, prescription contraceptives such as birth control pills, diaphragms and intrauterine devices present few health risks to women under the age of 18. He Signed 'With Reluctance' In Utah, the parental notification law was to have taken effect on Tuesday. When Gov. Scott M. Matheson, a Democrat, signed the legislation in March, he said he was doing so ''with great reluctance'' because of several constitutional questions and ''the clearly difficult enforcement problems.'' Nan Hunter, the civil liberties union lawyer who filed the lawsuit for Planned Parenthood of Utah, said that Judge Winder's ruling would keep ''a very harmful law'' from taking effect. Doug Balvin, an assistant attorney general of Utah, said the judge's order did not necessarily mean that the law would be permanently struck down. But he said, ''It's a setback.'' The Utah suit contends that the state law is ''enormously broad'' and adds, ''It requires persons ranging from a minor's relatives to grocery store clerks to physicians to hunt down both parents prior to any sale, gift or medical prescription of a contraceptive.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICHIGAN NUN QUITS ORDER TO KEEP WELFARE POST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/12/us/michigan-nun-quits-order-to-keep-welfare-post.html,"A Roman Catholic nun who was ordered by her church to resign as director of the Michigan Department of Social Services because of her support for state-financed abortions said today that she had given up her religious vows rather than face expulsion from her order. Agnes Mansour said she was told Monday by Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua of Brooklyn, a representative of Pope John Paul II, that the Vatican had rejected her request for a leave of absence from her religious order to direct the department and that she would face a church trial leading to her dismissal from the order, the Sisters of Mercy, if she did not resign. Miss Mansour said today that bending to her vow of obedience to the church would be ''irrational and blind.'' ''Of my four vows,'' she said, ''the vow of service to the poor, sick, uneducated and oppressed has always been the primary one for me, and the one that has given meaning to the other three vows, including obedience.'' A nun's three traditional vows are poverty, chastity and obedience; some orders take additional vows of special service. Order Gave Permission Miss Mansour, who is 52 years old, was appointed by Gov. James J. Blanchard to direct the Department of Social Services in late December, after she obtained permission from her mother house. The Sisters of Mercy, who operate a college Miss Mansour headed before the appointment, emphasize service to the poor. But Archbishop Edmund Szoka of Detroit, the area's principal Catholic authority, said he would object to her accepting the appointment unless she publicly repudiated the department's financing of abortions for poor women. ''We must oppose and disapprove of anything that fosters or permits the continuation of the evil of abortion,'' Archbishop Szoka said then, ''including Medicaid payments for abortion.'' When Miss Mansour, then Sister Mansour, said she was opposed to abortion but would not endorse denying it to poor women when it is available as a matter of law to all women, the Archbishop brought the issue before the Vatican. Archbishop Szoka and the diocese made no comment today on Miss Mansour's decision, which was greeted with sadness from some of her supporters here in Michigan, and with veiled anger by others. ''I feel very bad that she decided to give up her vows,'' said Msgr. Clement H. Kern, one of Miss Mansour's early supporters, who argued that her stated opposition to abortion ought to satisfy the church. ''She has a wonderful background, spirituallly as well as in administration,'' he said, ''and I wish she could have reconciled the difficulties she faced.'' Frances Kissling, executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice, a group that supports a woman's legal right to abortion, characterized Miss Mansour's resignation as an example of the ''intractability of Rome on the subjcet of women'' under John Paul II. ''It is part of the conservative side of John Paul on the issue of obedience of those in religous life,'' she said. ''The Pope thinks that in order to preserve the Church he has to exert obedience. It may have worked in Poland, it may have worked under a repressive and totalitarian regime, but it does not work in an open and pluralistic society like the United States of America.'' In 1977, Sister Elizabeth Candon was director of Vermont's Social Welfare Department. Her bishop raise objections similar to those directed against Miss Mansour, but no church action was taken against her. Miss Mansour criticized the church today for what she called its failure to ''dialogue'' with her and her order on the issue, and implied that Rome had hardened its views under John Paul II. ''I believe in a tradition of obedience more fully developed in the church in Vatican II,'' she said, referring to the liberalization of some church practices begun under Pope John XXIII. ''It is for me an obedience born out of mutual dialogue and openness to seek the truth,'' she went on. ''I do not feel that I should or could witness to an obedience which for me would be irrational or blind.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CBS-TV IS DROPPING ARCHIE BUNKER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/12/arts/cbs-tv-is-dropping-archie-bunker.html,"Archie Bunker, the noisy bigot who articulated the prejudices of a generation of Americans, is being dropped from prime-time television after this season. The cancellation of ''Archie Bunker's Place,'' the successor to the original Bunker program, ''All in the Family,'' was disclosed yesterday when CBS Television announced its evening lineup for next fall. In its two forms, the show ran 13 seasons on network prime time. ''All In The Family'' became ''Archie Bunker's Place,'' still starring Carroll O'Connor, when the three other principals left the show: Jean Stapleton, who played Edith Bunker, Archie's flighty but loyal wife; Sally Struthers, who played Gloria, their daughter, and Rob Reiner, who played her husband, Mike Stivic, whose liberal leanings earned him Archie Bunker's contemptuous characterization as a ''Polack pinko meathead.'' Such language was new to American television when it was heard on ''All in the Family'' in January 1971. The show, created by Norman Lear, was based on a BBC Television hit called ''Till Death Do Us Part.'' Mr. Lear offered his show, first called ''Those Were the Days,'' to ABC-TV in 1968 and again in 1969. ABC turned it down. In 1970, he took it to CBS-TV, where executives loved it and bought it but the chairman, William S. Paley, hated it. Mr. Paley reluctantly agreed to carry the controversial program, but only at 9:30 P.M. Tuesdays, when, if it failed, it would not destroy the rest of the CBS schedule for that night. Promotion was held to a minimum and, just before it was shown for the first time, on Jan. 21, 1971, an announcer told viewers: ''The program you are about to see is 'All In the Family.' It seeks to throw a humorous spotliight on our frailties, prejudices and concerns. By making them a source of laughter, we hope to show -in a mature fashion - just how absurd they are.'' By the seventh episode, the program had doubled its ratings, and by the next fall it was No. 1 in the ratings. Once established, ''All in the Family'' served as the vehicle through which television broke down an entire catalogue of broadcasting taboos. Among its themes over the years have been racism, sex, impotence, abortion, rape, homosexuality, menopause, alcoholism, manic-depressiveness, wifeswapping and venereal disease. ''The cancellation doesn't surprise me at all,'' Mr. O'Connor said yesterday. ''I was expecting this months ago. I feel like we're leaving on top. I knew some of the executives were not happy with the show, but that's nothing new. Some of them weren't happy when we went on the air.'' ''Archie Bunker's Place'' ended the current season 23d in the national ratings. Along with ''Archie Bunker's Place,'' CBS is dropping all but one of the six new programs it introduced at the start of the 1982-83 season. ''Newhart,'' a comedy starring Bob Newhart, is the only one scheduled to return next season. Departing will be: ''Square Pegs,'' ''Bring 'Em Back Alive,'' ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' ''Tucker's Witch'' and ''Filthy Rich,'' which had proved to be a hit during the slow season last summer. Also canceled were ''Private Benjamin,'' and ''Cagney and Lacey.'' Five new shows will be introduced, including ''After M*A*S*H,'' a spinoff from the popular ''M*A*S*H.'' Also announced for the fall were another doctor show, ''Cutter to Houston,'' with Jim Metzler and Shelley Hack; ''Scarecrow and Mrs. King,'' a story of international intrigue, with Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner; ''Navy,'' with Dennis Weaver, about a widower raising three daughters on a Navy post and ''Whiz Kids,'' an adventure-mystery show involving teen-age computer enthusiasts. CBS said two series now being tried out also would be retained: ''Goodnight Beantown'' and ''The Mississippi.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HEADLINERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/weekinreview/headliners-166519.html,"Serving One Master Mary Mansour still feels a close relationship to the Roman Catholic Church, but she will no longer be called sister. Miss Mansour, who was appointed director of the Michigan Department of Social Services while she was a member of the Sisters of Mercy, faced mounting criticism over her refusal to obey her bishop's order to resign the post, which involved her with state-funded abortions. At her request last week, the Vatican granted Miss Mansour ''immediate dispensation'' from her vows as a nun so that she could stay on in her post. She said she hoped that when the time came to leave her state job she might be allowed to resume her vows and her membership in the order. He's Seen It All As circumnavigators go, Philippe Jeantot goes fastest. Last week the French sailor finished a round-the-world race in little more than 159 days, cutting nearly 10 days off the previous record for circling the globe single-handed and nearly a month off the record for a monohulled craft. The 31-year-old professional diver brought the 56-foot cutter Credit Agricole, named for the French bank that sponsored him in the race, into Newport, R.I. about a day ahead of the second place finisher. His margin might have been greater, but he had waited offshore overnight to finish the race by daylight. Mr. Jeantot collected $25,000 for winning what was called the first organized race around the world. Tuned-In Fugitive Willow Lynne Cramlett still doesn't have custody of her son, but a Denver jury last week awarded her custody of $5.9 million from the coffers of Metro-Media Program Productions Inc. Miss Cramlett sued Metro-Media, producers of the Phil Donohue Show, after her exhusband, Wayne R. Anderson, appeared on a Donohue segment of the Today show to talk about his reasons for kidnapping his son in a custody dispute. After a Federal fugitive warrant was issued for Mr. Anderson, Miss Cramlett demanded that the Donohue producers tell her his whereabouts. When they refused, she went to court. The producers said they were ''extremely disappointed'' with the verdict and would appeal. Stealthy, Wealthy, Unwise Some job skills are legal only at work. And as a former Federal Bureau of Investigation expert in surreptitious entry, H. Edward Tickel should have known that. Mr. Tickel, who was found guilty of, among other things, dealing in diamonds stolen from a North Carolina wholesaler, was sentenced in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va. last week to eight years in prison. An F.B.I. agent for 14 years, he had previously been acquitted of breaking into the bureau's credit union office. Mr. Tickel said he was ''remorseful and sorry to cause all the problems'' and conceded making ''some bad judgments.'' He still faces a trial on charges involving misappropriation of bureau property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HONORING FATHERS AND MOTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/books/honoring-fathers-and-mothers.html,"THE WAR OVER THE FAMILY Capturing the Middle Ground. By Brigitte Berger and Peter L. Berger. 252 pp. New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday. $14.95. THE family has been a much argued subject, and Brigitte and Peter Berger, sociologists who teach at Wellesley College and Boston University, are not too far afield when they mention a war in their book's title. One or another view of abortion, for instance, can inspire extreme suspicion, fear, anger and bitterness - emotions rampant in a population at war. The Equal Rights Amendment was favored and opposed by groups who have scant respect for each other and have made clear their intense mutual dislike, mostly with words but sometimes with physical encounters. Discussion of topics such as the advisability and adequacy of day care or the prevention of teenage pregnancy (should parents be informed when their children receive contraceptive devices from an agency funded by the Government?) prompt such fierce polemics that the debate seems directed not at one or another issue but at the overall moral assumptions held by some and disputed by others. Not that the Bergers wish to abstain from this continuing series of truculent confrontations. This is an unashamedly preachy book - a series of essays, each brief and pungent, meant to assert some positions, refute others and carve out a particular point of view, no matter the disagreements sure to come from various quarters. The authors proclaim a strong skepticism about the influence of those social scientists who have lectured the rest of us on the nature and purpose of the American family. Setting aside so-called value-free social science (often a fantasy anyway), they strongly embrace and advocate the traditional family as the repository of important personal and social virtues. Again and again they urge the reader to rally round the nuclear family, which they regard as ''a precondition, rather than a consequence, of modernization.'' In this they openly write a different history from other contemporary scholars. It is really a chronology of consciousness as triumphant over condition - of the shaping influence, from one generation to another, exerted on society by those who live a certain kind of family life. Where others (and not only Marxists) would find social and economic forces - the decline of the yeomanry, the rise of urban capitalism - responsible for the emergence of the small and intensely private family that is frugal and ambitious, circumspect and child-centered, the Bergers stress the initiatives of certain 18th-century families: ''small producers working their own property - the class from which the bourgeoisie of the industrial revolution sprang.'' Those families cultivated privacy and encouraged a strenuous individualism, two hallmarks of 19th-century American small-town life. They regarded each child as a potential work of high art - to be fashioned and treasured as well as nourished, attended, loved. The work of Philippe Aries in ''Centuries of Childhood'' has helped the Bergers construct their historical picture of a family life in which the child was a sign of God's grace. That grace was not, they argue, a mere ideological footnote for burghers obsessed with the acquisition of money, property, power. Max Weber's early 20th-century ideas about the link between Protestantism and capitalism have prompted these two late 20thcentury sociologists to treat religion with considerable respect: ''The fate of the bourgeoisie, its ethic and its family form, was very intimately tied to the fate of religion.'' The Bergers express admiration for ''the Protestant version of Christianity.'' Without it, they say, our bourgeois world would not have emerged in all its political and economic significance: ''Only by accepting a higher form, located outside the individual, the family, and society as a whole, could there be a perceived unity between individual, family, and societal interests.'' The Bergers remind us that the Roman Catholic Church -of past centuries, at least - was too communal and mystical to be of much use as a sanctioning light for what they call a ''bourgeois-Protestant morality,'' so essential to the family life they like. If the Bergers accord religion the dubious merit of commanding ''functional'' persuasiveness, they scorn our contemporary secular knowledge as a sad, if not stupid and banal, effort to replace the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ with the dreary dicta of, say, sociology and psychology. On this score they are relentless, unyielding and on occasion brilliantly polemical. They turn on their own kind with full appreciation of the irony - experts denouncing experts. Meanwhile, of course, the Bergers offer still more authoritative statements to those millions of vulnerable souls who wait eagerly and humbly for the next words of wisdomhow to do this or that feat of ''parenting,'' how to go through yet another hurdle (called a ''stage'' or a ''period'' or a ''phase'') in a life whose mysteries, many believe, only important experts are qualified to reveal. It is no minor matter, this hold that so-called ''expertise'' has upon us. The Bergers echo Christopher Lasch in their assault on an aspect of exalted American professionalism - the ridiculous words, the intimidating phrases, the self-serving arrogance: ''The professionals, of course, have an interest in defining situations in such a way that their services appear necessary.'' But the Bergers are not content with such remarks. There are others, even more severe in tone, directed at a secular religion, really - those popular gurus for American husbands and wives, mothers and fathers. The themes of ''War Over the Family'' are connected to a vigorous defense of the continuing moral worth of some important segments of the population. The authors scorn the ''knowledge class'' and are skeptical of the ''liberation'' many have claimed (or wanted) to achieve. They speak of a ''decadence syndrome'' that has weakened the personal and family life of far too many men, women and children. Yet they claim this kind of hope for us: ''There are other classes (notably the lower middle and working classes) and large, unassimilated ethnic groups that are much less marked by this (decadence) syndrome and, in some instances, not touched at all by it.'' Such groups are ''the ones who take up the old symbolic bannners cast aside contemptuously by the decadent elite.'' And they continue provocatively: ''American society may well depend for its survival on the continuing influx of immigrants (legal or illegal) with a sturdy sense of family, work and ambition. If one is concerned for the future of America, one might willingly exchange the entire membership of the American Sociological Association (or, for that matter, the combined faculties of all the Ivy League universities) for the people who cross the Rio Grande in any given year.'' Well, many will cheer, maybe too readily, at such a tough populist assault on lots of privileged pomposity and certainly applaud the back of the hand given to the ''personal liberation industry,'' with its idiot expressions mindlessly mouthed, and to the ''professional empires of experts and advice-givers,'' all supported more and more, we are reminded, by public money. And yet: To array immigrants and working people against professors and their students and their students' parents (the well-to-do American intelligentsia, young and old) is perhaps to do a substantial injustice to both groups. This is the more suprising coming from two intelligent and thoughtful writers who aim in their book for a subtle examination of the character and prospects of the American family. THE Bergers hold on for dear life to so-called ''working class people,'' yet fail to mention their trials and tribulations - drinking, the rising use of drugs, child abuse and ''delinquency'' among youth. Unemployment is not given its due as a terrible agent of family deterioration in such families. Indeed, it is nothing but condescending to idealize working people, to simplify the complexity, the inconsistencies and the ambiguities of their personal and political lives, so that they become, in sum, a weapon to wield against those whose values we dislike. Moreover, the Bergers do not scorn elitists other than those who work in particular professions or universities. They ignore those who own advertising agencies and the corporations that use them and Hollywood studios and television networks, for instance. They do not mention the executives and copywriters and scriptwriters who work in such places and who surely push us all toward ''decadence.'' They make no provision for the possibility that in their family lives a good number of the ''elitists'' they ridicule might be the sensitive, upright, decent people that the Bergers applaud in this book. Such rhetorical postures undermine the authors' stated intention, a summons to a ''middle ground,'' and make less credible their valuable critique of a good deal that is wrongheaded in our contemporary culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/nyregion/one-woman-s-choice.html,"The writer of this article requested anonymity. A Fantasy I bought a cradle today. It's antique pine with curving sides and the patina of mothers' fingerprints along the edge. When nudged, it gently rocks as if in memory of many Nebraska babes who slept and cried in it. I almost didn't buy it for fear of offending mother nature with my presumption of the future. As I left the antiques show carrying this badge of maternity on my shoulder, people called after me, ''Good luck!'' and ''When are you due?'' and ''Enjoy using it!'' I smiled from deep inside me. While many women (like Marilyn Levinson, ''Tomorrow, a Job,'' Opinion Page) flirt with the idea of going to work, I long to be a homemaker. To them, working outside the home is a fantasy of excitement and dressing up in grown-up clothes. But I'd gladly give up the hurried commute, the humiliation of bosses, the aggravation of deadlines, the boredom between assignments and the subdivided paychecks. I'd play with my newborn child until it fell asleep, then cradle and sing to it. While the baby slept, I'd do another laundry, dust or write that letter to my niece. I'd cook nutritious meals from scratch and sew tiny garments. I'd teach the baby to read and to garden, and I'd cut articles on computers from the newspapers for my busy husband to read. I'd fix that wobbly chair and patch the bedroom ceiling in the corner where we had the leak last year. And if I craved fulfillment, I'd oil my rusty fingers with the greatest unctions of the 19th century, the piano sonatas of Beethoven, the ballades of Chopin. (If the baby doesn't wake up first.) A Conversation White male, 33, 5 feet 10, brown hair, bearded, divorced, neat and slim, never missed a day's work, grandmother died of old age, but eat your hearts out, girls, these genes are not for sale. This is the sign my friend wears around his neck when he cruises the party circuit looking for women to go out with. He's disgusted, he says, by women in their 30's who go on a date and spend the evening sizing him up for the future. ''Gene pool,'' he hears them whisper into their white wines. ''And what did you say you do for a living?'' they ask while dancing the hustle. ''What are your prospects for promotion?'' -they try to sound nonchalant. ''Ever been seriously ill? Diabetes? Drug addiction? Herpes?'' ''Welcome to the meat market,'' I parried. ''Remember, 'Blond hair, nice chest, father in the oil business'?'' He riposted with a grin that cut right through me. ''Actually, I rather enjoy it,'' he said. ''Serves 'em right. Ten years ago they all yelled, 'Career, fulfillment, abortion on demand!' when they should have been home having babies.'' ''But haven't men had it both ways all along? Family and career?'' I lunged in his direction but didn't reach my target. ''I only go to bed with women under 25 now,'' he said. ''Any older than that, I'm kept awake all night by the sound of their biological clocks ticking.'' Twice divorced, once from a woman who stayed home and had two children and now demands lifelong alimony and once from a career-oriented woman who went her own way, my friend may be especially angry, but his indignation is typical. These men think that if liberation has allowed us to choose untraditional paths, the choice should be irreversible. But our needs change. As we fulfill one goal in life, we go on to another. A person may be overjoyed to work in the mailroom at age 22, but that same individual would feel a failure if he were still there 20 years later. For most women, it is not a decision of what to be, but when. In 1968, I joined the struggle for liberation in the workplace. Between the divorce rate and the recession, I thank my sisters for the progress we have made. Had I become a mother at 20, I would have resented that child: there was a war that had to be stopped and skills to be tested in the marketplace. Then I married a man who confused freelancing with freeloading, forever searching for the ideal position. So I continued to work, looking toward job security. The marriage didn't last. Reality I'm 35 years old now. I've given up waiting for the fantasy. I'm single and pregnant through an arrangement with a friend. Over the years, the rationalizations have fallen away to reveal a dichotomy: to have a child or not, regardless of marital status. But there is a price to pay. It'll tear my heart out to go back to work after maternity leave. How do you tell a 6-month-old child that you've got to go away every day to bring home money for food and rent? But how do you tell yourself you never had the children you wanted because circumstances never seemed just right? Liberation does mean choice. Choosing to be dependent, if you wish, or choosing to do it all, if you have the courage and energy to give it a shot. Or choosing a new direction, if the old one isn't working out. Liberation also means compromising when the choices are not simple, knowing you'll manage if you want something badly enough. And, my bearded 5-foot-10 friend, I'll be a wiser mother now, for having seen something of the world, for no longer being awed by it or in such a hurry to conquer it. I'd love to have a husband to share this with and to support us while our children are young, but it hasn't worked out that way. I have to earn a living in order to nourish my body. And I have chosen to complicate my life with a child because I also have to nourish my soul. Besides, I can't wait to see the look on my bearded friend's face when he finds out I, too, have heeded the ticking of the clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/books/books-of-the-times-168349.html,"STATECRAFT AS SOULCRAFT. What Government Does. By George F. Will. 186 Pages. Simon & Schuster. $13.95. FOR a few passages in ''Statecraft as Soulcraft,'' George F. Will, the erudite conservative columnist, sounds like a closet liberal. He chides other conservatives, ''caught in the web of their careless antigovernment rhetoric,'' for their grudging attitude toward Washington's efforts to assist the less fortunate. He reminds them that Disraeli and Bismarck, conservatives both, pioneered the welfare state - run, to be sure, on conservative principles, with reliance on the private sector. Much as Mr. Will esteems the operations of free enterprise, he esteems the ideal of community more, and he laments the attenuation of America's sense of community into ''thin gruel.'' No fear, however, that Mr. Will has changed his spots. He remains a deep-dyed conservative, and his main strictures are directed at liberals who are quick to use the powers of the state to satisfy the hour's desires but not to enhance our moral condition, which he believes is gravely imperiled. For liberalism seems to him to have ''become a doctrine of 'liberation' often understood as wishfulness.'' He is impatient with those who champion the ''rights'' of pornographers or the ''right'' to abortion, yet deny that they are thereby imposing their own morality upon the nation. The three horsemen of the Will apocalypse are pornography, abortion and sexual permissiveness. In places, these essays, which began life as lectures at Harvard in 1981, sound like Will's Familiar and Less Familiar Quotations. Here may be found the quotable wisdom of everybody from Montaigne to Metternich, from Mill to Mencken, from Madison to Moynihan. And Mr. Will delivers some smart lines of his own: ''As has been recently demonstrated in the worlds of art and academics, if you redefine excellence recklessly enough, there will be no shortage of excellence.'' ''The transformation of the word 'elite' into an epithet is symptomatic that society no longer understands that the political question is always which elites shall rule, not whether elites shall rule.'' There is much of the preacher in Mr. Will: ''A young body matures without much social intervention; not so a young soul.'' Viewing Western society as the flowering of ideas whose seeds have been planted over many centuries, Mr. Will, ''a lapsed professor of political philosophy,'' blames Hobbes and Machiavelli for much of the contemporary obsession with self-interest, narrowly conceived. He places himself in a different line of thinkers, from Aristotle to his special hero Edmund Burke, who have appreciated the organic nature of a good society. He dislikes modern politics for its readiness to accommodate to human passions rather than to encourage human potential. In this nation preoccupied with the material, he wants ''a politics that nurtures the spiritual.'' That's what he means by ''soulcraft.'' Mr. Will's style of conservatism, though it can claim a long tradition, has not been much honored in our time, when conservatives have become mere guardians of privilege, identified with the haves against the have-nots. He disdains such a role. By his definition, ''Conservatism is about the cultivation and so conservation of certain values or it is nothing.'' One value high on his list is the gentling effect on men's ruder instincts of a benevolent government abetted by a free society's many mediating institutions. The task he sets for ''true conservatives'' in our liberal, bourgeois, democratic society ''is not to make society inhospitable to pluralism but to make pluralism safe for society.'' He takes his stand against radicals of every disposition who would destroy a society's arduously built foundations in behalf of some ideological program. That way, he warns, lies totalitarianism. He observes that ''many of the people who most avidly espouse theories explaining why our lives are out of control have in mind political arrangements that would enable them to control us.'' Some readers are likely to find Mr. Will's exhortations for moral uplift quaint, and possibly a touch unsettling; the history of official efforts to purify souls has been a bloody one. Liberals in particular may be hard put to share his enthusiasm for school prayer or his abhorrence of abortion. The refined sensibility that marks Mr. Will's writing is more affronted by Times Square smut shops than by cuts in social programs. One may hear in his call for a leadership that is able to inflict ''short-term pain for long-term gain'' the smugness of those who are pretty sure they will gain painlessly in both the short and the long term. Yet there is much for liberals to ponder here about the direction and limits of policies that they have embraced without due reflection or regard for their consequences. And these well-tempered essays remind us all, liberals and conservatives together, that there are other political divisions in the world today than those of left and right - and more important ones, notably the division between intellectual tolerance and all-or-nothing zealotry. On this issue, liberals should have no trouble joining George Will on the side of honest, informed, reasoned and civil discourse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURTING HISPANIC VOTERS NOW A REAGAN PRIORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/19/us/courting-hispanic-voters-now-a-reagan-priority.html,"Discouraged by its failure to attract black voters, the Republican Party is making an effort to reverse its slippage with another ethnic group that is viewed by party strategists as an awakening giant in American politics, the nation's 14.6 million Hispanic Americans. Hispanic Americans constitute the country's second largest and fastest growing minority, and, if present trends continue, could replace blacks as the largest minority by the year 2000, a projection that has major implications for both parties as they compete for the political energy this group is capable of releasing. Republican strategists have concluded that the Hispanic vote is not only essential to President Reagan's re-election chances in 1984, if he should run, but is also vital to the future of the party itself. The priority Republicans have assigned to the courtship of Hispanic people is reflected by the role the President is playing in the campaign to reach out to this traditionally Democratic segment. Mr. Reagan will travel to Miami on Friday to address an audience of Cuban-Americans, who, as a group, are the most conservative and most Republican of Hispanic Americans. This trip comes a week after Mr. Reagan pardoned Eugenio Martinez, one of the Cuban-Americans convicted in the Watergate break-in. 'Only the Beginning' Earlier this month the President was in San Antonio, Tex., to participate in that city's Cinco de Mayo festival, which celebrates an important defeat of the French by Mexican forces in 1862. Also in Texas, Ricardo Hinojosa, a 33-year-old lawyer, is to be sworn in on Saturday as a Federal district judge, the first Hispanic person put on the Federal bench in that state by a Republican President. ''This is only the beginning,'' said one Reagan aide. ''The President is going to be making a major effort to strengthen his position with Hispanic voters. We're talking about a real effort to reach them on the issues, not just a lot of public relations gimmicks that have the President wearing a sombrero, eating tamales and doing the tango.'' Republicans thought they scored a major breakthrough with this ethnic group in 1980 when Mr. Reagan won more than 30 percent of the Hispanic vote, the largest share ever captured by a Republican Presidential candidate. In recent months, however, party leaders have been jolted by surveys showing that both Mr. Reagan and his party are losing political ground among Hispanic voters. California, Texas and Florida A memorandum being circulated by the Republican National Committee says that the percentage of Hispanic Americans identifying themselves as Republican slipped six points last year alone and that Mr. Reagan's approval rating among Hispanic Americans is falling rapidly, primarily because of high unemployment and other economic issues. ''Republicans need to put an end to these trends now,'' the memorandum says. William Greener, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said the importance of the Hispanic vote in the 1984 Presidential election can be summed up in three words: California, Texas, Florida. Those three states account for one-third of the electoral vote needed to win the Presidency, he said, and each of the states has a large Hispanic population. According to the 1980 census, 59 percent of the nation's Spanishspeaking population are of Mexican heritage, 13.8 percent are Puerto Ricans, most of whom reside in New York, and 6.3 percent are Cubans, a majority of whom are concentrated in south Florida. The problem for both political parties is that Hispanic Americans are not a homogenous ethnic group. Cuban-Americans tend to be more anti-Communist and more conservative than most Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, who are more likely to list social and economic issues as major concerns. 75.5 Said To Vote Democratic Republican political strategists concede that expanding the party's Hispanic base will not be easy. Although Hispanic Americans long have had one of the lowest voter turnout rates of the major ethnic groups, those who do go to the polls vote overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates. A survey conducted last year by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, found that 75.5 percent of the Hispanic Americans polled said they usually voted Democratic, while only 8.5 percent said they tended to vote Republican. Despite this voting pattern, the survey concluded, ''the Democratic hold on Hispanics is far from firm'' because Hispanic people tend to be susceptible to appeals from conservatives regardless of party labels. ''The Republicans need not win a majority of the Hispanic vote in order to keep themselves competitive,'' the report said. ''However, the G.O.P. must insure that the Democrats do not win the Hispanic vote by a margin of 3 to 1. Given the ideological bent of the group, a conservative candidate who recognizes the link between culture and political attitudes should be able to do reasonably well among Hispanics.'' Republicans believe they have such a candidate in Mr. Reagan, and they are counting on the President making inroads with Hispanic voters in 1984 as the first step toward building a solid Republican base with this group. 'A Golden Opportunity' ''The President and the Republican Party have a golden opportunity to gain Hispanic support,'' said one White House official. ''From the standpoint of basic values, Reagan is closer to Hispanics than any of the Democratic candidates. We're talking the most important things in a person's life -the values of family, religion, education and neighborhood. If the Hispanic people are allowed to see and hear Reagan as Reagan, they will recognize this.'' This political assumption is fine as far as it goes. It is true that a majority of Hispanic people consider themselves to be moderate to conservative, that they tend to support the President's anti-Communist initiatives in Central America, and that they are close to his positions on such issues as crime, abortion and prayer in the schools. But even White House political strategists acknowledge that before such issues can work in Mr. Reagan's favor there must be a solid economic recovery. Robert Brischetto, research director for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project in San Antonio, said, ''It is true that Reagan made a cut into the Hispanic bloc in 1980, but if we look at recent polling results it is clear that Reagan's policies don't come out too well with Mexican-Americans. Unemployment, according to all our polls, is the major concern among Hispanics, and if Reagan is going to have any chance of regaining Hispanic support, the economy is going to have to turn around.'' 'Signs From the White House' Mr. Brischetto said the White House recently asked his organization to provide it with the results of some of its surveys of Hispanic political attitudes. ''We're getting signs from the White House that the President is going to move on some of the Hispanic issues such as bilingual education, stronger enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and immigration policies,'' he said. ''These are issues that Reagan can safely take pro-Hispanic positions on, and I think he's likely to do that.'' Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, said that the President's only ''residual strength'' with Hispanic people in his district is on the issues of military spending and foreign policy, especially Central America. ''I don't see any other issues the President can use to recover with Hispanics,'' said Mr. Richardson, who represents a district in which more than 37 percent of the voters are Hispanic American. The President's problems with Hispanic Americans are reflected in the results of a 1982 New York Times/ CBS News Election Day poll of voters in contested House districts. The survey found that 70 percent of the Hispanic Americans voted for Democratic candidates and 23 percent for Republicans. Among all voters in that sample, 55 percent cast ballots for Democrats and 42 percent for Republicans. According to the poll, 61 percent of the Hispanic voters blamed Mr. Reagan's policies for economic hard times, and only 29 percent cited Democratic Administrations. Among all voters, the percentages were 38 and 49, respectively. High Disapproval Rating Mr. Reagan's disapproval rating among this sample of Hispanic voters was 67 percent, 23 percent higher than among voters as a whole. Dr. Tirso Del Junco, a Los Angeles surgeon who heads the National Republican Hispanic Assembly, said that Hispanic Americans were only beginning to vote on the basis of issues. ''In the past they tended to vote Democratic because the Democrats had the political machines and the attractive candidates,'' said Dr. Junco. ''The politicians would go into their communities and talk about welfare and little else. That is changing. More and more Hispanics are becoming concerned with the kind of issues that are important to most Americans - jobs, taxes, education, crime and family values - and I think that is where our potential lies.'' He said a reasonable goal for the Republican Party was to attract 30 to 35 percent of the Hispanic vote. ''Hispanics,'' he added, ''need to be represented on both sides of the political aisle so they don't suffer the same fate as blacks, who are trapped in the Democratic Party.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sex Education In the Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/nyregion/l-sex-education-in-the-schools-172756.html,"The development of sex education in many Long Island schools (''Schools Vary in Sex Education,'' April 24) should help more and more teen-agers to live and love in more rewarding ways with fewer bad consequences. The Suffolk Abortion Rights Council notes with concern, however, that in some schools Birthright representatives have been invited to present their view of abortion without any abortion-rights speaker to set forth the pro-choice view. Students need a broad range of information. Before or after a ''right-to-life'' presentation they need to hear opposing views and refutations so that they can sort fact from fiction for themselves. Birthright speakers are trained, effective and tendentious; they have a clear aim. A school that lets them speak without also providing an opportunity for a strongly pro-choice speaker is denying the students' right to full knowledge as a basis for forming their own views. It is jeopardizing the well-being of those students who may at some point have to make hard decisions about abortion. Such decisions should be based on a realistic view of probable consequences, not on fear and guilt laid on by others. If religion and morality are introduced, we should remember that most religions support the right to choose in all or some circumstances, while some religions hold abortion to be a mortal sin. From the religious and moral point of view, therefore, there should either be no outside advocates on this issue or a proper balance of positions. The Suffolk Abortion Rights Council urges that school sexeducation planners be watchful on this score and scrupulous to assure equivalency. Our organization can assist with providing speakers. Our address is: Box 885, Setauket, New York 11733.

THE SIREN'S STORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/books/the-sirens-story.html,"LORELEI TWO My Life With Conrad Aiken. By Clarissa M. Lorenz. 231 pp. Athens, Ga.: The University of Georgia Press. $19.95.LORELEI TWO was the name Conrad Aiken gave the second of his three wives in his autobiographical memoir ''Ushant.'' The other wives were Lorelei One and Lorelei Three. What he began in ''Ushant'' as an obscure account of himself as a kind of Ulysses threatened by sirens and shipwreck, has become in this volume an explicit story of an actual disaster, that of his second marriage as told by Lorelei Two. One sees that the nickname was not as playful and teasing as it first appears. Clarissa Lorenz reveals to any who are in doubt how harrowing it is to live with a genius, especially if he is a dedicated poet. She has heard praise of perfect wives, such as Dostoyevsky's and Carl Sandburg's, who sublimated themselves to their mates. When she met Bernard Shaw and listened to his monologues, she marveled at Charlotte Shaw's silence and the inner turmoil she must suffer in the great man's shadow. Face to face with Thomas Hardy's widow, she wondered why so many literary men's wives have limp handshakes. ''Unfortunately,'' she says, ''artists have a domestic streak and long for family life. That's the hitch.'' Lorelei Two never mastered the difficult role of wife to Conrad Aiken. They met in 1926 when she interviewed him for The Boston Evening Transcript in what Aiken called ''the fatal interview,'' from which she walked away that foggy night telling herself, ''I'm in love.'' She didn't know he was married and the father of three young children, whom he would have to decide whether or not to abandon. Nor did she know of the tragedy in his childhood, and he didn't tell her. It had happened one night in Savannah - Aiken was 11 - when he heard his mother's half-stifled scream, his father counting to three and two loud shots. Alone he tiptoed into the dark room ''where the two bodies lay motionless, and apart, and, finding them dead, found himself possessed of them forever.'' To the reader as well as to Clarissa Lorenz, the question occurs, why, after a stormy three-year trial period described as ''courtship through a wringer,'' did she marry him? There was, after all, no likelihood of happiness. When she became pregnant, he forced her to have an abortion. In jealous rages similar to his father's, he accused her of promiscuity and wrote, ''I shall be driven to murder.'' Yet he divorced his first wife, and the marriage took place in 1930 in Rutherford, N.J., with Mr. and Mrs. William Carlos Williams as witnesses. At the marriage license window, Aiken explained to the clerk that he was an adulterer. ''Hell, aren't we all?'' the clerk said. The couple moved to England, where without consulting her Aiken leased a house in Sussex. Not only did his former wife (who had remarried) live in the county but they had occupied this very house with their children. Eventually he returned there with Lorelei Three. The place was damp and cold, deathwatch beetles ticked in the wood, yet Aiken insisted that nothing be changed. ''I intend to run this marriage. Is that clear?'' he asked her. ''Crystal clear,'' she said. Malcolm Lowry turned up from Cambridge University to spend his vacations with them as a paying guest; he was Aiken's protege and drinking companion, with whom she associated sprees and catastrophe, though Aiken reminded her that all good writers drank. By the second year of their marriage he was saying, ''I don't really need you any more,'' and declared her to be incompetent, slipshod, embarrassing, all the time withdrawing more and more into his poetry. Aiken proved to be a shy and austere man whom, unaccountably even to herself, she deeply loved. IN the turbulent summer of 1932, he feared he was going insane. ''My father's death should have freed me,'' he said, ''but it didn't. I've been dreaming again and again of killing myself. I shouldn't really be alive.'' On a night when the tensions were particularly bad, she escaped the house and went to the movies. Halfway through the picture she had a sudden premonition of danger and in panic ran all the way home to find that he had turned on the gas and was lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. In ''Ushant'' he narrates the attempted suicide differently. ''Lorelei Two having gone off for the evening to the cinema,'' he had sat down to read an article by Wyndham Lewis that he found excruciatingly funny, and with the gas rings and oven fizzing softly behind him, he had awaited the end, perfectly serene. The reason she appeared in the nick of time, he says, was that she had already seen the second feature. ''Why had I hung on so long?'' she asked when the marriage was finally over. There was the man who had fallen in love with her, and there was the poet who found marriage intolerable. ''I could never reconcile the tyrant with the poet who wrote 'Senlin' and 'Punch.' '' But did she remember Punch's forlorn outcry in the poem: ''Was there in all this wide world never / One woman I might love forever?'' She returned to America on Dec. 11, 1936, the day of Edward VIII's abdication for the woman he loved. More than 40 years later, after Aiken's death in 1973, she undertook to write this memoir from the wounding evidence in the diary she had kept of their life together, a diary so infuriating to him when he found and read it that she began using shorthand. She wrote the book, I think, not in spite but for clarification, for justice, even; she wrote it to admit her own share in their problems. His parting shot to her had been ''It's all your fault, and you know it.'' With these unhappy words echoing, the reader wonders why Clarissa Lorenz chose to keep such painful recollections alive - and why confessional writing so often deals exclusively with hurts given and received. One must also recall that Aiken, in a veiled fashion, elected to tell much of the story himself, though it happened, he says in ''Ushant,'' ''Far away, and long ago. And so many ships between, so many ships between.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN ATTACKS U.S. SCHOOL AID IN JERSEY SPEECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/reagan-attacks-us-school-aid-in-jersey-speech.html,"President Reagan declared today that parents and local governments should be given greater control over schools and that teachers should be paid and promoted ''on the basis of their merit and competence.'' In a commencement address at Seton Hall University, Mr. Reagan said ''most politicians'' had felt that ''more money'' was the solution to the nation's educational problems. ''Well, they tried that approach and failed,'' he said, adding that educational quality had gone down despite spending increases in the last 10 years. Mr. Reagan said an increased Federal financial role was appropriate in one area: tax credits to help parents pay for tuition in private schools. He also called for channeling school aid into a voucher system so parents could choose between public and private schools for their children. Both proposals are on the President's legislative agenda this year. Radio Address on Military In his weekly radio address, broadcast today, Mr. Reagan urged increased spending in another area, the modernization of strategic nuclear forces with the MX and a smaller missile. ''We must show the Soviets that we're determined to spend what it takes to deter war,'' he said. ''I know that the paradox of peace through a credible military posture may be difficult for some people to accept,'' he went on. ''Some even argue that if we really want to reduce nuclear weapons we should simply stop building them ourselves. That argument makes about as much sense as saying that the way to prevent fires is to close down the fire department.'' Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, giving a Democratic response, asserted that Mr. Reagan, despite his statements on cutting Government spending, ''has now turned into an indiscriminate spender, throwing billions at gold-plated weapons that we don't need and that may not even work.'' Receives Honorary Degree Mr. Reagan, wearing a blue academic gown, received an honorary law degree from Seton Hall, a Roman Catholic institution near Newark, at an outdoor ceremony here. Two thousand students and 3,000 guests, sitting in bleachers and folding chairs in a rain-soaked athletic field, greeted him warmly. A half dozen faculty members, wearing white arm bands, walked out as Mr. Reagan began speaking, and a few hecklers in the audience were quickly hushed up by their fellow graduates. But the President was obviously pleased with the overall reception and used the occasion to reminisce about his own days as a college student and as a graduate, hitchhiking around the Middle West looking for a job at a radio station in the Depression. White House officials regarded Mr. Reagan's trip here as a political signal that, contrary to some reports, he was not writing off the Northeast and industrial Middle West, particularly the middle class and working-class Catholic community. Mr. Reagan appeared here with Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan and Governor Kean, and flew to Washington after his speech to spend the rest of the weekend at Camp David, Md. Urges Optimism on Jobs In his speech, Mr. Reagan urged students to be optimistic about job prospects despite the uncertain economy. ''Don't get discouraged with the situation of the world,'' he said. ''Things are getting better. And believe it, we need you. We need your youth, we need your idealism, we need your strength out there in what we're trying to accomplish.'' His comments about tuition tax credits and a voucher system drew applause. However, although the honorary degree citation referred to Mr. Reagan's firm opposition to abortion, he did not mention that subject in his speech. This was unusual because he usually mentions abortion in addressing Roman Catholic audiences. Mr. Reagan's speech was similar to previous comments he has made in response to the recent report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The report called for upgrading teachers and teaching time, and for other steps that experts say would require more money. Mr. Reagan has dismissed that approach, at least on the Federal level. At his request, Congress has cut school aid in the last two years and he favors further cuts for the next fiscal year. Reagan Quotes Califano The commission report linked the decline in American education standards to changes in population patterns, the breakup of families and other factors. But Mr. Reagan again focused on what he calls Federal intrusion in schools. He quoted, Joseph A. Califano Jr., Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Carter whom he cited as ''a card-carrying liberal,'' in warning against the ''threat to academic freedom'' posed by an enlarged Federal role in education. ''Well I couldn't agree more,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''The road to better education for all our people simply cannot be paved with more and more recycled tax dollars, collected, redistributed and overregulated by Washington bureaucrats.'' The President's proposals for tuition tax credits and vouchers have been criticized by teachers' unions and Democrats as hurting public education. Mr. Reagan again called for the re-establishment of organized voluntary prayer in school, noting with a smile, ''I know that this idea is not too popular in some supposedly sophisticated circles.'' White House aides say Mr. Reagan will make more speeches and announcements on education. They say they fear the Democrats could make political gains by arguing that his school spending cuts threaten the next generation's ability to cope with modern problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLAND'S HARD LIFE FINDS MORE WOMEN CHOOSING ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/23/style/poland-s-hard-life-finds-more-women-choosing-abortion.html,"The stand of the Roman Catholic Church on abortion in this devoutly religious country, as elsewhere in the world, is quite clear: it is not permissible. But many estimates by Polish experts find that the abortion rate in Poland is now higher than the country's birthrate. They attribute that situation largely to increasing food shortages and the critical housing situation, a combination that forces some Poles to put economic reality before religion. But doctors here say there is another major reason for the rising abortion rate: abortion is used as a method of birth control. The few available means of chemical contraception here are ''horrible, repulsive and on top of that, uncertain,'' according to one gynecologist. There are three kinds of oral contraceptives here but they are hard to find and, one specialist said, ''They are good for mares, not people.'' There are a few foreign contraceptives for sale in the hard-currency stores, but most women either do not know about them or do not have the foreign currency needed to buy them. A Swedish device, for example, costs $7, which is more than one-third of the average monthly salary. The Polish Government says officially that 200,000 to 300,000 abortions are performed in the country each year. But Polish doctors, clergy and demographics experts point out that this is the same figure given by the Government 20 years ago and does not reflect the increasing economic hardships Poles face today. Instead, these experts say, the true abortion figure is much higher - from 800,000 to 1 million. At the same time, the Government says that 702,000 children were born in 1982 in this country of 36 million. In this largely Catholic country, where the church wields an almost unchallengeable influence over daily life, an increasing number of women are able to base their childbearing decisions not strictly on religion but on personal need. The reported abortion boom is a striking example of the nature of Catholicism in Poland. Religion, numerous sociologists have noted, is for many far more a matter of nationalistic symbolism and ritual than it is a strict adherence to church doctrine. ''I think God understands me and is really on my side,'' said one young Catholic, a writer, in explaining her decision to have an abortion. ''I felt it much more honorable to feel guilt for a while and avoid a lifelong disaster,'' she said. ''If we'd married, we would have had no apartment, and I would have had to quit my studies. I would hate him, and he would hate me, too.'' The writer sounded a common theme here. There are few young couples in Poland who live by themselves; most share already cramped quarters with parents or other relatives. Waiting lists for apartments are staggeringly long. In some cities, the wait can be 18 years or more. The church is keenly aware of this and also of the financial difficulty of providing for unplanned children. As a result, several church-backed groups that seek to persuade women not to have abortions offer them financial and emotional support. ''People say they have no money, no apartment of their own, don't want to give up their standard of living,'' said the Rev. Stanislaw Malkowski, a Warsaw priest who devotes most of his time to Gaudium Vitae, an anti-abortion group he helped to found. ''So I may say to them, I will help you.'' The help is in different forms, the priest said. As an example, he pointed to four boxes in his living room that contained clothing and foodstuffs sent from Iceland for women he had talked out of having abortions. A Mother Is Grateful Four generations of one family that receives such aid live in a one-room apartment on Kasprowicza Street. The baby is now six months old, and the mother says she is grateful to the priest for changing her mind. ''She was unwanted,'' the priest translated for the mother, ''but now she is the most beloved.'' Father Malkowski, reflecting the church position, is sympathetic to the economic pressures on people here. He advocates what he calls ''natural family planning'' rather than abortion or any use of contraceptives. Poland's abortion rate in fact is lower than those of other countries in the Eastern bloc. Hungary, for example, has a higher one, as does the Soviet Union. But many here say the Communists encourage abortion because, with so many women working, they want to reduce the number of three-year paid maternity leaves. Abortion here is quick and easy, performed free of charge at the state hospitals, with a three-day medical leave provided. Some say that with the party faithful on the watch in their work places, the pressure not to have children can be tremendous. ''When I was pregnant with my fourth child, they made my life hell,'' Miroslawa T. said of her fellow workers at a Warsaw factory. ''I heard them whisper: 'That one is pregnant again. The state will have to pay again.' But the worst was when my boss said, 'My dear, it cannot be so that others work for you all the time.' '' The State Offers Family Planning There is only one official organization offering family planning advice, and not all of its initiatives are successful. During its ''school for the engaged'' program recently, a lecture on contraception was attended by only a journalist and two elderly women who said they had come because their adult children were too busy. A psychologist recently surveyed 150 women here who were awaiting abortions. The results showed that more than 80 percent were married and that most already had children. Six of the women gave medical reasons for the operation, but more than half cited financial problems or not having their own homes. When Bozena M., a 24-year-old Catholic with one child, became pregnant again she decided to have an abortion. She and her husband, a truck driver with a monthly wage of about $120, live with her parents and her sister in a tiny Warsaw apartment. But her gynecologist notified another doctor, a volunteer with the Pro Familia society, which opposes abortion, and that doctor went to her home to persuade her otherwise. She finally agreed to have the child, on one condition: that the doctor use his influence to expedite her request for an apartment. Shortly afterward, the following conversation took place at the Pro Familia headquarters: ''I am glad I persuaded you,'' the doctor said. ''Not 100 percent,'' Bozena M. reminded him. ''It all depends on the meeting at the housing office. I will not expose my second child to such an uncertain life.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MATCH MADE BY COMPUTER IN ADOPTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/23/us/match-made-by-computer-in-adoptions.html,"Gilbert needed a mother. Beverlie Blackwell wanted a child. He has delayed motor development. She said she could love a child who was not perfect. A computer was fed the information and matched the two, and a social worker decided they were meant to be a family. And last month, Miss Blackwell and Gilbert became the first parent and child brought together by the National Adoption Exchange. ''Time is critical in the life of a child,'' said Marlene Piasecki, director of the Philadelphia-based organization. ''Knowing that this child was placed quickly with a mother who will care for him makes all the difference.'' Established in October 1982 with a $350,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Adoption Exchange is the first nationwide effort to expedite the adoption of the more than 50,000 difficult-to-place children by computerizing listings of both children and prospective parents. Although the definition varies by time and location, children who are difficult to place are often members of minority groups, are older, have physical or emotional handicaps or are in groups of siblings who want to remain together. A Way to Increase Volume ''We felt that, using up-to-date technology, we could increase the volume of listings we could handle and expand the pool from which to choose families for these children,'' said Carolyn Johnson, executive director of the Adoption Center of the Delaware Valley, which operates the exchange. The names of children are given to the exchange by state and private adoption agencies that have custody of them. Prospective parents who have been cleared by a social worker can register themselves with the exchange or go through an agency. In a second match approved recently, the exchange placed a 13-year-old girl from Ohio, named Tina, with Rick and Becky Fah of Silverton, Idaho. Tina is a healthy teen-ager, with a desire to be a cheerleader and a longing for a permanent family. Her caseworker at Montgomery County (Ohio) Children Services felt that Tina's age and the fact that she had been in foster care most of her life made her difficult to place. The agency registered her with the National Adoption Exchange and approved the Fahs as her adoptive parents. Mr. and Mrs. Fah, who have a 15-year-old son, realize that it will take time for Tina to feel secure in her new environment. 'Take It Step by Step' ''We told her that this was her home and she was stuck with us,'' Mrs. Fah said. ''She's had a tough go of it. We're all going to have to take it step by step.'' Mrs. Johnson, who has adopted three children, said the key to the exchange was volume. ''The idea is not to be afraid of large numbers,'' she said. ''The computer deals with the volume and cleans up the paper work to free people to work with people.'' According to adoption authorities, more people are expressing interest in adopting children with ''special needs.'' Part of the reason, they suggest, is that fewer healthy, white babies are available because of better birth control methods, more liberal abortion laws and society's greater acceptance of single parents. ''People are becoming aware that the healthy, white infant is scarce,'' said Nancy Troian, the caseworker for 1-year-old Gilbert at the Children's Home Society of Florida. ''We try to show them that there are other children out there who need them.'' After the formalities were completed, Miss Blackwell flew to Florida from her home in Pittsburgh and met the child, whom she has renamed Christopher Keith. She said that to ease her son's adjustment to his new home, she had bought a dark wood crib, like the one he had been using in his foster home. 'Don't Have Any Delusions' She has also looked into infant stimulation programs in her area, so her new son can continue physical therapy to correct the rigidity in his upper body. ''I don't have any delusions of grandeur that I'm his savior,'' said Miss Blackwell, who lives with her parents and younger brother and works for the Allegheny Department of Health. ''I'll do whatever I have to to help him grow into a healthy child.'' A few years ago Miss Blackwell would not have been considered a candidate to adopt an infant. She is 41, old by many adoption agency standards, and is single and black. In some agencies, Christopher would not have been considered a special needs case. Being black makes him harder to place, but he is a baby, which makes him more desirable, and his disabilities are minor. ''We feel it is up to the local agencies to define what is hard to place in their region and which children need to be listed nationally,'' Mrs. Piasecki said. ''We are in no way attempting to be the only adoption registry,'' she said. ''We tell adoption agencies to list children with their state exchanges in addition to us.'' 120 Children Registered Since mid-January, when its computer system was put into place, the National Adoption Exchange has received the registrations of about 210 families and 120 children from 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. More than 50 matches have been generated by the computer and forwarded to the home agencies, which are responsible for approving each adoption. The exchange hopes to handle 1,000 children and 2,500 families in its first year. It charges no fees now but plans to begin charging the agencies involved. ''At first people were apprehensive because they thought everything would be handled by computer,'' said Joyce Hart, an adoption coordinator at the exchange. She is one of three people who review the computerized matches, decide which should be sent on to the adoption agencies and follow up on those cases. ''We feed the information into the terminal and evaluate what it computes,'' Miss Hart said. ''The computer expedites the paper work, but we still handle the human needs.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VETERANS' LOBBIES RETAIN TAX STATUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/24/us/veterans-lobbies-retain-tax-status.html,"The Supreme Court today upheld the Federal Government's preferential tax treatment of organizations that lobby for veterans. The Court ruled unanimously that Congress did not violate the Constitution by giving veterans' groups a privilege that it did not give to other nonprofit, charitable organizations. Under the Internal Revenue Code, veterans' groups that engage in lobbying retain their eligibility to receive tax-deductible contributions, while all other nonprofit groups forfeit this tax benefit if they engage in ''substantial'' lobbying. The decision, written by Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals here. That court ruled last year that the preferential treatment of veterans' groups violated the constitutional right of other nonprofit groups to equal protection of the law. Ruling Gave Congress a Choice The appellate court's opinion gave Congress the choice of either extending the veterans' lobbying privilege to the other groups or making the veterans' groups subject to the same restrictions as the other organizations. The appellate court's opinion created an uproar among veterans' organizations, 35,000 of which have been granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that Congress should be free to express the nation's ''special gratitude'' to veterans by giving their lobby special privileges. There are 330,000 other nonprofit organizations that are eligible for tax-exempt status as long as they do not use tax-deductible contributions for lobbying. The veterans' lobbying privilege was challenged by Taxation With Representation, a Washington-based organization that was denied the tax-exempt status it sought from the Internal Revenue Service because it intended to lobby on tax issues. Nonprofit organizations generally regard the ability to receive tax-deductible contributions as vital to their survival. In its lawsuit, Taxation With Representation argued that the lobbying restriction violated both its First Amendment right to free speech and its Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. The Federal District Court here ruled for the Government on both counts. Then the Court of Appeals rejected the First Amendment challenge but ruled that the restriction did violate the equal protection guarantee. Both issues were before the Supreme Court today in Regan v. Taxation With Representation (No. 81-2338). Addressing the free speech question first, Justice Rehnquist said the fact that Taxation With Representation had a First Amendment right to lobby did not give it a corresponding right to have its free speech subsidized with Federal funds. ''Both tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system,'' Justice Rehnquist said. In refusing to grant tax-deductible status to nonveteran lobbying groups, he added, ''Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public monies.'' Justice Rehnquist continued: ''We have held in several contexts that a legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.'' Medicaid Abortion Ruling Cited One of the precedents he cited was the Supreme Court's 1980 ruling that Congress need not pay for abortions for poor women under the Medicaid program. On the equal protection question, Justice Rehnquist said Congress needed only to show a ''rational'' basis for giving veterans' groups a favored tax status. ''Our country has a longstanding policy of compensating veterans for their past contributions by providing them with numerous advantages,'' he said, referring in a footnote to veterans' employment preferences and educational benefits. He concluded, ''This policy has always been deemed to be legitimate.'' The 35,000 tax-exempt veterans' groups include the local posts of major national organizations, such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The Supreme Court also dealt with these matters today: Miranda Warnings The Justices agreed to decide whether a New York City police officer had violated the constitutional rights of a robbery suspect by asking him where he had thrown his gun without first giving him the so-called Miranda warnings. The officer had caught the fleeing suspect in a Queens supermarket and, noticing his empty shoulder holster, asked him where the gun was. ''Over there,'' the suspect said, indicating a carton where the officer found the gun. The trial judge, his action affirmed by the New York appellate courts, refused to allow either the statement or the gun itself to be introduced as evidence. District Attorney John J. Santucci of Queens filed the appeal, N.Y. v. Quarles (No. 82-1213), arguing that the Miranda rule was not violated and that, in any event, the gun itself should be permitted as evidence. Jurisdiction The Court ruled unanimously that Congress acted within its constitutional authority in enacting a 1976 law that permits foreign corporations to bring commercial lawsuits against foreign governments in United States courts. The decision, Verlinden v. Central Bank of Nigeria (No. 81-920), overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. That court barred a breach of contract suit by a Dutch corporation against the Government of Nigeria, ruling that the Federal courts could not constitutionally assume jurisdiction over lawsuits by foreign plaintiffs against foreign governments. In an opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Court held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 met constitutional standards in opening Federal courts to certain types of foreign suits. But the Court did not resolve the Dutch lawsuit, sending the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings. The Justice Department and several business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, had urged the Court to overturn the lower court decision. Forfeiture The Court ruled, 8 to 1, that the Customs Service did not violate a narcotics suspect's due process rights by seizing the $8,850 in undeclared currency she was carrying through the Los Angeles International Airport and holding the money for 18 months before filing a formal forfeiture proceeding. The opinion, by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the delay was so unreasonable as to be unconstitutional. The decision, U.S. v. $8,850 (No. 81-1062), did not provide a blanket rule for customs seizures, concluding instead that each delay had to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

REAGAN CIVIL RIGHTS POLICIES ARE DEFENDED AND CRITICIZED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/30/us/reagan-civil-rights-policies-are-defended-and-criticized.html,"President Reagan's top civil rights enforcement officer said today that racism was at the root of affirmative action programs, but a black leader charged that the Administration ''acts as if the white male is the minority.'' William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, defended the Administration's efforts to set a ''color blind'' course on civil rights, assuring that hiring and advancement programs preserve the rights of both blacks and whites. But Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., former president of the National Urban League, argued that affirmative action must be pursued to redress centuries of bias against blacks and women. ''The Reagan Administration acts as if the white male is the minority,'' said Mr. Hooks, who was interviewed along with Mr. Jordan and Mr. Reynolds on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' Court's School Bias Ruling Cited Mr. Reynolds also said that the Supreme Court ruling last week denying tax breaks to schools that practice racial bias was consistent with Mr. Reagan's view in its immediate result but said that its ramifications were ''fairly ominous.'' ''We think those schools should be denied tax-exempt status,'' he said. The concern, he said, is that under the ruling, the Internal Revenue Service, not Congress, ''will have the authority to make those public policy decisions'' about who gets tax breaks. ''The long-term ramifications of that, I think, are fairly ominous,'' he said, suggesting that the I.R.S. one day could deny exemptions to hospitals for their position on abortion, to single-sex high schools or even to churches that support a nuclear freeze. Mr. Hooks and Mr. Jordan took Mr. Reagan to task for actions across the board, including his nominations last week for the replacement of three of six members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The move will mean five of the commissioners will be Reagan appointees. Concern for Independence Mr. Jordan said two of Mr. Reagan's nominations to the commission last year, both of whom failed to win Senate confirmation, were ''an insult to black intelligence'' and also called the latest maneuvers ''the polarization or politicization of the Civil Rights Commission.'' The wholesale change gives the impression the commission ''is no longer an independent body,'' he said, and opens the door to charges ''the new appointees would be patsies for the Administration.'' Also, Mr. Hooks said affirmative action programs, opposed by the Administration as quotas, were ''necessary in a society that has openly discriminated against a portion of its community.'' Mr. Reynolds insisted that rather than ignoring the plight of blacks the Administration was seeking to defend all Americans and was ''vigorously enforcing the law.'' He said the Supreme Court had directed the Government ''to remove discrimination from this country root and branch.'' ''That means,'' he said, ''that we cannot tolerate a society where we are going to condemn discrimination on the one hand and condone discrimination on the other hand. ''To use race to get beyond racism make no more sense than to prescribe alcohol to get beyond alcoholism.'' Asked what was wrong with a ''color blind'' approach, Mr. Hooks responded, ''It's wrong because it's stupid,'' and he listed preferences given to other special groups, such as veterans, the handicapped and flood victims. ''The overriding feeling, the overriding impression in this society,'' said Mr. Jordan, who has called for Mr. Reynolds's resignation, is that ''this is not an Administration that is a guardian, or the protector, of the people.'' Mr. Reynolds replied, ''This is the Administration that has brought more criminal prosecutions against police brutality, against Ku Klux Klan activities, against racial violence, against involuntary servitude than any other Administration in the history of the civil rights division.'' He also cited his work in ''almost singlehandedly'' fighting off bids to dilute minority voting strength in Congressional reapportionment following the 1980 census. This was Mr. Hooks's first public appearance since the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., Margaret Bush Wilson, suspended him May 18. Mrs. Wilson reinstated him under pressure on Thursday and on Saturday a majority of board members voted to curb her powers and asked for her resignation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEXOLOGY STRUGGLING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AMID WIDE HOSTILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/31/science/sexology-struggling-to-establish-itself-amid-wide-hostility.html,"Sexologists are struggling to enhance the scientific credibility and public acceptance of their research at a time when sexual studies and sex education in this country are under increasing attack. This became clear last week when more than 1,000 sexologists convened here for the sixth World Congress of Sexology, billed as the largest gathering of sexologists ever held. Speakers and panel chairmen repeatedly lamented that their field is suffering from a conservative political backlash that often portrays sex research and education as little more than pornography and sex therapy as almost illicit. The organizers tried unsuccessfully to get official welcoming messages from the White House and the Mayor's office, ordinarily a routine courtesy, but neither political office would oblige. ''They said it was inappropriate,'' complained William A. Grantzig, president of the organizing committee. ''This is not porn city. Some of the talks are even boring.'' But at the conference itself, it was not always easy to separate the science from more questionable fare. While some sessions heard sober papers from such recognized scholars as Wardell B. Pomeroy, an associate of the late Alfred C. Kinsey; William H. Masters and Virginia Johnson-Masters, pioneer explorers of the physiology of sex; Mary Calderone, a much-honored expert on family planning and sex education; Helen Singer Kaplan, a psychiatrist and psychologist who treats sexual disorders; and John Money, an expert on gender identity from Johns Hopkins University, other sessions were devoted to X-rated films or the views of authors of best-selling books. A bevy of pornographic movie stars even showed up one night to mingle with the participants and promote their industry. In the exhibit hall, textbooks could be ordered alongside video cassettes of ''adult'' movies, and the Journal of Sex Research, a leading scholarly journal in the field, was being promoted next to a booth distributing ''swingers' magazines'' that carry pictures of nude people in blatant sexual poses, seeking partners for a variety of explicit purposes. ''It's a frustrating experience,'' said Erwin J. Haeberle, co-chairman of the scientific committee for the conference, who complains that sexologists are often forced to accept money from ''disreputable sources'' because the Government and private foundations are reluctant to finance much sexology research and most academic institutions shy away from the field. ''I'm not one who opposes taking the Devil's money to do the Lord's work,'' he added. The conference dealt with an array of topics that seemed only loosely related, ranging from theories of orgasm to prostitution in Peking from 1912 to 1950. The participants were even more varied. They included a wide range of doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, biologists, physiologists, humanists, sociologists, anthropologists, animal experts, educators, authors, social workers, marriage counselors, nurses and philosophers, or virtually anyone who studies or deals with sexuality on a professional basis. Dr. Haeberle, who is director of historical research at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, a tiny degreegranting school in San Francisco, acknowledged in an interview that sex research presents ''a confusing picture'' because it embraces ''a wide variety of people and methodologies'' pursuing a wide variety of subjects. ''It is not a science with one definite object and one method of studying it,'' he said. Some workers in the area are sound scientists, he said, while others make sensational claims on flimsy grounds. 'In Total Confusion' ''The field is in total confusion,'' he added. ''It's like the state criminology was in 80 years ago, when it was just getting started. But I would still call sexology a science, an interdisciplinary effort where the natural sciences and the humanities have to work together. And I'm a great believer that sexology, in spite of all the obstacles, will clarify itself and crystallize as a legitimate science.'' Sexology was defined by Dr. Haeberle, in an opening-day address, as ''the theoretical study of sex'' based on ''objective and systematic observations of love and reproduction.'' He distinguished it from ''erotology,'' the practical study of lovemaking as embodied, for example, in the Hindu love manuals or Alex Comfort's ''Joy of Sex.'' The field of sexology first took form in Germany some 75 years ago with publication of the first sexology journal in 1908, followed by the founding of the first society for sexology in 1913, Dr. Haeberle said. But the Nazis virtually obliterated the fledgling science by driving its pioneers, mostly German and Austrian Jews, into exile, burning their books, and disbanding their societies. Sexology has not yet fully recovered. After the war, American scholars took the lead and have tried increasingly to bring scientific rigor to the field. ''As we look back over the years,'' said Shirley Zussman, a New York City sex counselor and therapist, in a featured address, ''what has emerged most dramatically in the area of sexuality has been the scientific dimension.'' The pioneer was the late Alfred C. Kinsey, who performed interview surveys of sexual behavior in American males and females in the late 1940's and early 1950's, thus breaking the barriers against empirical sexual research in this country. Dr. Kinsey is still the bench mark by which many sexologists measure their work, and his surveys are being extended by modern scholars in the field. John Gagnon of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, for example, told the conference that his continuing analysis of data from a 1967 survey of college students found that the incidence and frequency of masturbation appears unrelated to other sexual conduct or to social and academic adjustment, despite popular beliefs to the contrary. Masters and Johnson Studies The next great trailblazers, according to Dr. Zussman, were William Masters and Virginia Johnson, who studied the physiology of human sexual response under laboratory conditions and devised new behavioral treatments for sexual problems; their latest treatment results were announced here last week. On the eve of the conference, Bernie Zilbergeld, a California psychologist, charged that claims of success in treatment by Masters and Johnson techniques were inflated because their criteria for success were set too low. But other leading therapists here said the treatment techniques seem to work in a variety of clinical settings and that the physiological work remains a landmark. ''Nobody is happy about Zilbergeld's cheap shots,'' said Helen Kaplan. New technologies are reshaping the field of sexology, pushing it inexorably from a largely psychological perspective toward more emphasis on physiology. Monitoring devices attached to the penis at night have become an important diagnostic tool in determining whether male erectile difficulties are organic or psychological. And devices that measure lubrication and blood flow in the vagina are important research tools for determining whether women are sexually aroused by various stimuli even when unaware of the arousal. Sexual Responses of Fetuses Ultrasound pictures of fetuses in the womb have produced dramatic new evidence of the beginnings of sexual arousal. Dr. Calderone said she had received three sonograms - pictures made inside the body by high-frequency sound waves - of fetal erections, indicating to her that sexual response is ''a birthright'' that functions during the entire life span. ''You can't say 'It's something that happens much later in life so we won't teach you about sex until you're 18,' '' she said. Pharmacology is also exerting an impact on sexology. Dr. Money has already used a drug to turn desire off in sex offenders, and Dr. Kaplan predicts that a drug to do the opposite, a highly effective chemical aphrodisiac, will come along any year now. Sexology has made some advances toward academic respectability. Several scholarly journals and organizations have been founded since the mid-1960's. And several universities, including New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, four institutions in Europe and another in Canada, conduct educational programs in sexology or human sexuality. ''This is not a fly-by-night operation showing pornographic movies to the students,'' says Bernard Goldstein, a professor of biology who headed the program at San Francisco State. ''High quality programs are available at the university level.'' But no major American university awards a doctorate in sexology, says Dr. Haeberle. The only doctoral awards in this country are granted by the Institute for Advanced Study in San Francisco, which has been refused accreditation by the Western Association of Colleges but has just received accreditation by the less prestigious National Association of Private, Nontraditional Schools and Colleges. Several speakers at the conference said sexology was on the upswing in the late 1960's and early 1970's, driven in part by the women's movement, the homosexual liberation movement, attention from news organizations, changing public attitudes, scientific advances, and court decisions easing restrictions on abortion and on ''obscene'' materials. But in the late 1970's and early 1980's, they said, development of the field has slowed because of budget cuts and a more conservative political climate. Most remained optimistic, however. Dr. Pomeroy assured his audience that the march toward greater freedom and openness in dealing with sexual matters was ''so inexorable'' that they would ultimately prevail, if not in two years, then surely in 20.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEW YORK, JERSEY AND CONNECTICUT LEGISLATORS FACE KEY ISSUES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/31/nyregion/new-york-jersey-and-connecticut-legislators-face-key-issues-201066.html,"Connecticut's General Assembly must adjourn by June 8, according to the State Constitution, and legislative leaders say they are determined to meet that goal - even if it takes all summer. The problem is that the legislature is in a close race with the calendar to round up enough votes by the official adjournment day to approve a state budget and a package of new and higher taxes to pay for it. No budget means no adjournment, according to Gov. William A. O'Neill. He has said that if the regular legislative session ends June 8 without a budget, he will call the lawmakers back for an immediate special session. ''The session will end,'' the Speaker of the House, Irving J. Stolberg, a New Haven Democrat, said Friday. ''Whether we will have a budget, I honestly do not know. We will try.'' Votes for Taxes Fall Short The Appropriations Committee has proposed a $3.6 billion spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1, which is $43.5 million more than the Governor requested in February. But the leaders of the Democratic majorities in the Senate and House have had trouble finding the votes to approve the taxes to balance the budget. With the Republican minorities vowing to oppose most tax increases, the Democratic leaders need Democratic votes - 19 in the Senate and 76 in the House - to pass a tax package. Some Democrats have held out for a state personal income tax. But faced with the Governor's almost daily pledges to veto an income tax, legislative sentiment is belatedly beginning to shift toward other tax increases. Senate Democrats are nearing final agreement on a $272 million tax package, which would include a nonbinding statewide referendum in November to see whether Connecticut voters want an income tax. House Leader Dislikes Senate Plan However, Mr. Stolberg has strong misgivings about the Senate proposal, which would impose a 3.5 percent sales tax on personal and professional services, including medical services; tax the interest income of people earning more than $50,000 a year; raise the corporation profits tax to 11.5 percent from 10 percent; increase the business services tax to 7.5 percent from 3.5 percent, and raise the tax on cigarettes by 5 cents a pack. Some legislators are already resigned to a special session, where, they said, the heat of summer, the vacation season and the July 1 start of a new fiscal year may be the elements that finally force a fiscal agreement. There is no air-conditioning in the cavernous House and Senate chambers. ''Have you ever been here in the summer?'' Representative Janet Polinsky, a Waterford Democrat and co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said with a grimace the other day. Any new tax increases would come on top of a smaller tax package passed in March and signed by the Governor. That measure raised the state excise tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon and imposed the state's 7.5 percent sales tax on meals costing less than $1 and on seed and fertilizer for non-farm use. With only seven working days left, the rush is on to try to resolve several major nonbudgetary issues, such as these: - Toll removal. Legislation actively sought by Fairfield County legislators to phase out the 35-cent tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike is awaiting action in the House. If approved, the measure would still have to go to the Senate. - Plant closings. The House has passed and sent to the Senate a measure backed by the Governor requiring companies to pay workers' health insurance benefits for up to 90 days after closing or relocating a plant out of state. - Drunken driving. Various measures advocated by many legislators to increase the penalities for drunken driving are pending in the House and also must be considered by the Senate. - Interstate banking. Both houses have approved and sent to the Governor legislation allowing Connecticut banks to merge with banks in the other New England states, but not with those in New York. Although the state's fiscal problems have dominated events since the General Assembly convened Jan. 5, some completed actions by the legislature have been significant. State Opposes Big Trucks Connecticut became the first state to enact a ban on double-trailer trucks in defiance of a recent Federal law permitting the larger trucks on the nation's major highways. The Federal Government filed suit Friday to overturn the law. The legislature also passed, and Mr. O'Neill signed, a measure limiting the cost that electricity consumers would pay for construction of the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant, which is to be completed in 1986. Lawmakers said Connecticut was the first state to try to legislate limits on the rising cost of nuclear power plant construction. Other hotly contested measures have fallen by the wayside during the long hours of debate. The Senate rejected an increase in the state's minimum drinking age to 21 from 19. The House killed a measure that would have allowed terminally ill patients to order the removal of life-support systems. The Senate defeated a bill that would have required parents to be notified in advance of a minor's abortion. The House killed a measure barring discrimination against homosexuals. Lawmakers Guided by O'Neill For Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat who was elected to a full, four-year term last November, the legislature has generally followed his lead on several key issues. So far at least, his adamant opposition to a state income tax has forced legislators to search for alternative tax increases. His legislation dealing with plant closings appears likely to prevail despite strong opposition from organized labor, which wanted companies moving out of state to be required to give advance notice to their workers. Up to now, the Governor has signed into law 243 bills sent to him by the legislature. He has yet to veto his first bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POLITICS; ASKEW, THE DARKEST HORSE, CALLS POLLS 'IRRELEVENT'",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/01/us/politics-askew-the-darkest-horse-calls-polls-irrelevent.html,"Supporters of Reubin Askew's Presidential candidacy say he is running ''against the grain.'' Detractors say he is running on empty. The former Florida Governor says reporters should quit worrying about where he is running in the polls. ''I'm not always last in the polls, sometimes I'm next to last,'' Mr. Askew recently told a group of reporters who were pressing him about his status as the darkest horse in the Democratic field. ''You'd always like to be a little better in them, but I don't worry about polls, because they have been notoriously irrelevant in terms of who's going to win,'' Mr. Askew said. ''The press has a propensity to spend a lot of time dwelling on them. If you ever went back and read some of your stories on what you were thinking prior to some of the others you might find that those prognostications weren't that accurate. But I don't find many of you going back and reading any.'' The note of anger is genuine. Increasingly, Mr. Askew is voicing the frustration shared privately by other second-tier candidates in the six-man Democratic field. They blame the press and the polltakers for skewing the campaign process by judging the candidates on their national name recognition. Rated a Top Governor The problem is especially acute for Reubin O'Donovan Askew, the only candidate in the field who is not a man of Washington. Although he served here as United States Trade Representative under President Carter, Mr. Askew's candidacy and his political identity are based on his governorship from 1971 to '78. Since few people in the nation know why Mr. Askew was chosen one of the 10 best governors of the century in a Harvard Univeristy study, he is confronted at every turn by doubts that voters will accept another unheralded Southerner. Yet, Democratic insiders have long touted Mr. Askew as the New South leader that Mr. Carter appeared to be. While the Georgian opposed busing, for example, Mr. Askew put his prestige on the line to defeat an antibusing amendment to the state constitution. In Florida, Mr. Askew's principled stands and teetotaling habits earned him the nickname ''Reubin the Good.'' The state's press cheered his battles against political corruption, and editorialists suggested in 1976 that Mr. Askew would make a better Presidential candidate then than Mr. Carter. But things reached a sour turn a few days ago when Mr. Askew snapped at a group of dubious Florida reporters. Later, he said: ''I try not to grow weary of it, but it's amusing when I think of how many of the same reporters kept asking me, badgering me almost, at every news conference from '74 to early '76: Why wouldn't I run for President? Now when I announce that I want to run for President, they say, 'What makes you think you can get elected President?' '' Only Democrat Against Abortion Mr. Askew's answer to that question rests on a triad of practical considerations - ''timing, energy, money management'' - and a fourth element embodied in his ''against-the-grain'' message. Although a liberal by Southern standards, he has placed himself well to the right of the Democratic field on some issues. He is the only Democrat opposing groups favoring choice on abortion. He is the strongest opponent of organized labor's call for protectionist legislation. He said his strong ties to the business community would allow him to end the ''adversarial relationship'' between business and labor by bringing the two together in a ''forged consensus.'' In sum, Mr. Askew, like Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, is running a candidacy intended to make former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and other liberals appear to be captives of the party's special interests. Of this approach favoring a generalized centrist appeal, Mr. Askew said, ''The key to it is the willingess to lose some votes by not trying to give everybody their full agenda in order to have credibility, particularly with business and labor, and not be so overly obligated to each when I assume the office that I'm not free to challenge both on behalf of my constituency.'' Hopes for 'Super Tuesday' The weak point in a strategy that defies the party activists is that they play a strong role in selecting the 3,924 convention delegates, 46 percent of whom will be chosen in caucuses or appointed under party rules. In 1980, only 29 percent were selected by these methods. Despite the lesser importance of primaries in 1984, Mr. Askew believes that the popular vote will put him into the running, and he expects a major breakthrough when Florida, Georgia and Alabama elect 287 delegates on March 13, the first ''super Tuesday'' of the campaign. ''I then unquestionably will be perceived as the candidate that I think I'm going to be,'' said Mr. Askew, ''and that's when we start talking about the New Yorks and the Californias.'' With the fatalism of a man of whom little is expected, Mr. Askew said he intended to rise or fall with this ''high risk'' strategy. ''That's the challenge to me,'' he concluded. ''My ambition is not to get elected President of the United States per se. My ambition is to get elected President of the United States in such a way where I can freely govern, and there's a difference.'' Since announcing on Feb. 23, Mr. Askew has been haunted by the suspicion that his true ambition is to be elected Vice President. He has responded with Sherman-like statements - ''I don't intend under any circumstances to accept it'' - that could prove awkward if the convention decided a 54-year-old Floridian born in Oklahoma would be a fine ticket-balancer. No Pollsters or Consultants To those who denigrate his chances, Mr. Askew cites his two Florida gubernatorial campaigns as the model for his national effort. There, too, he started as a lightly regarded dark horse who ran a frugal campaign and held back his money for a late media blitz. That is Mr. Askew's plan for 1984. His paid staff of 25 is the smallest in the field. He has hired no poll-taker or consultants. James Bacchus, a 34-year-old Miami lawyer, serves as press secretary, speech writer, issue coordinator, political thinker and traveling companion. Such economizing has enabled Mr. Askew to build a $425,000 cash surplus, but it has also given the campaign a bootstrap quality that borders on amateurism. At the Massachusetts state convention, for example, delegates poked fun at the Floridian's low vote-per-pig ratio after he threw a $5,000 barbecue and got only 12 votes out of 4,000 in the straw ballot. ''I think,'' Mr. Baccus said ruefully, ''that people misinterpreted that barbecue.'' Without professional management, Mr. Askew's campaign often does things that can be misinterpreted. Last week, for instance, he was in Manchester, N.H., to see the new signboards on city buses that underline his theme of using business-labor cooperation to create new jobs. The signs read: ''With your help, American can work again.'' But the message got a little blurred when Mr. Askew arrived to be photographed in a Renault Alliance, trailed by aides in a Toyota and a Volkswagen Rabbit. Despite some difficulties in adjusting to the national arena, Mr. Askew is, by instinct, a sound politician and he has undertaken one of the more subtle manuvers of the campaign in regard to Mr. Carter. While Mr. Mondale is distancing himself from the President he served, Mr. Askew seldom misses a chance to praise Mr. Carter. Voters, Mr. Askew observed, ''have appreciated the fact that I have not been defensive in pointing out some of the good things that President Carter did.'' Someone else who might appreciate it is Mr. Carter himself. With his remarks, Mr. Askew, like Senator John Glenn, has placed himself to benefit should Mr. Carter take offense at Mr. Mondale's coolness and decide to withdraw or modify his endorsement of the former Vice President.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/nyregion/new-jersey-journal.html,"TRENTON HIGH, Class of '67, is the setting for the movie ''Baby It's You,'' which was made by a Trenton graduate, Amy Robinson. The Paramount film, which recently opened in theaters in Princeton and Paramus, is a love story about Jill, a middle class girl who wants to become a serious actress, and Albert, a working-class boy who wants to become an ersatz Frank Sinatra. Miss Robinson was Trenton High '66 (Jill was '67), her father is a doctor (as is Jill's) and she went off to Sarah Lawrence College in pursuit of the arts (ditto Jill). But the filmmaker says that the resemblance ends there. (For the record, the director and screenplay writer, John Sayles, who lives in Hoboken, did not grow up in a working-class family - or even in the state). ''What happened,'' says Miss Robinson, who co-produced the film with Griffin Dunne of New York City, ''was that John and I talked about our high school experiences. Out of these, the actual plot and screenplay developed. ''We wanted to do a film about high school because that's the last time the (middle and lower) classes mix freely. When they get out into the real world, they don't. That was the political undertone here.'' Although it may have been the jumping-off point and fictionalized setting for the movie, Trenton High was not actually in the picture. ''Most of the people who were in the film live in New York City,'' explained Miss Robinson, who now lives there, too. ''We had to shoot at a commutable distance.'' Actual film locations were various cities in northern New Jersey: Hoboken, Jersey City and Newark. Cliffside Park High School served as the exterior of ''Trenton High.'' Scenes were shot during Easter vacation so as not to disrupt classes. However, local teen-agers did get into the act. In addition to several hundred used as extras, three North Bergen youngsters - Steven Reed, Stephen Donato and Susan Busset - had small parts in the prom scene. What was the ''real'' Trenton High School like for Miss Robinson back in the '60s? ''Terrific,'' she said. ''It was a great school, very good academically. And exciting. I had a great time.'' Louis Kousin of Cranford is a peaceful man who can be very aggressive about combating the threat of nuclear war. ''I walk in, cold, to institutions - churches, synagogues, community centers - and try to convince them to have a peace site,'' said the 73-year-old project coordinator for New Jersey SANE, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last month. A peace site, as defined by Mr. Kousin, is the other side of the coin from a war site (such as a missile base, Army camp or Navy depot). It is, he says, a permanent presence for education and action for peace - and it ties in with the nuclear-freeze movement. Sites are located ''where natural peaceful endeavors have been going on, places where you pray, play, work, study and live,'' Mr. Kousin explained. Space is set aside at each site for a library of peace materials. Twenty-six peace sites have been established in New Jersey since October 1981. They include 11 Y.W.C.A.'s, several churches, synagogues, Ethical Culture Societies, a parochial school, two state colleges and a retail business, all in northern and central parts of the state. The newest dedication ceremony for a peace site will be held at the Clay Cellar, a pottery shop in Montclair, on June 25. In addition to the 26 in-state sites, New Jersey SANE has organized three outside the state: at Ethical Culture Societies in Brooklyn and Baltimore and at a community center in Seattle. ''This makes a bridge of peace from the East to the West Coast,'' Mr. Kousin said. The Morris County Park Commission and Junior League of Morristown have been working hard to put 180 acres of farmland and buildings back into the 19th century. Fosterfields, a Morris Township estate, was built in 1854 by Joseph Warren Revere, a grandson of Paul Revere. After he died in 1880, the house and farm were acquired by Charles Foster, one of the earliest farmers in the state to own a herd of registered Jersey cattle. When his daughter, Caroline Rose Foster, died in 1979 (at the age of 102), she left the property to the Park Commission. ''What she wanted was for people to experience what a farm was like when she was a kid,'' said Joseph R. Hovance, director of the Park Commission's Outdoor Education Division, who heads the project. Fosterfields now has a working farmer, who has planted five acres of grain, using a team of four draft horses and his own collection of antique farm machinery. Eventually, the project hopes to include cows, pigs, sheep, goats and chickens. ''Pretty much the kinds of animals that Miss Foster had,'' said Mr. Hovance. Although the idea is to recreate a ''living historical farm'' (Fosterfields was designated New Jersey's first by the state's Agricultural Society), Mr. Hovance said that ''we may have to resort to modern-day technology'' to clear the pastures and reclaim the land. Meanwhile, inside the ''main house'' - it is called ''The Willows'' - members of the Junior League have been combing the rooms, cataloguing their contents. Robert P. Guter of Morristown, a historic-preservation consultant, traced the house's history and made recommendations about its restoration. Next, says Catherine M. Schulte of Mountain Lakes, the league's project chairman, ''We'll hire a decorative-arts expert to help us decide what era these rooms should assume when the house is opened as a museum. Three generations lived there.'' The Same Day Surgery Center, across the road from St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, is scheduled to open next month. It is reportedly the state's only free-standing unit so close to a hospital. This is one of its advantages, said Dr. Norman J. Zeig, chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at St. Barnabas and the center's director. All the center's physicians will have privileges at the hospital. ''In case of complications, patients can be admitted to the hospital across the road very quickly,'' he noted. Another big plus, Dr. Zeig said, is financial because ''it will eliminate the cost of an overnight stay in a hospital, which could save patients hundreds of dollars.'' What the center will do is treat patients who require elective, nonmajor surgical procedures. These include dilation and curettage, a gynecological operation commonly known as a D & C; diagnostic pelvic laparoscopy, internal diagnosis of a pelvic condition with a surgical viewing instrument; tubal ligation, a female sterilization procedure; abortion; vasectomy (male sterilization); arthroscopy, internal diagnosis of joint problems; herniorrhaphy, repair of a hernia; myringotomy, lancing of the ear drum, which is usually done on children, and some plastic surgery procedures, such as breast enlargement. ''Surgeons at the center,'' Dr. Zeig said, ''will try to separate out those procedures that can be done safely on a one-day basis. We're taking care of essentially healthy people who need elective surgery, who can avoid exposure to a hospital.''

'SOCIAL ISSUES' REHEATED TO WARM UP THE G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/weekinreview/social-issues-reheated-to-warm-up-the-gop.html,"Twice recently a Senate subcommittee scheduled sessions to draft a constitutional amendment that would permit organized prayer in public schools. Both meetings were canceled when the White House and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the panel, could not agree on a proposal. The divisions among supporters of legalized prayer persist, but another meeting of the Senate panel is planned for Thursday. In addition, Senate leaders have promised to hold a floor debate on the issue of legalized abortion this month, perhaps as early as this week. As these events indicate, the ''social issues'' are emerging again on Capitol Hill. For the first two years of the Reagan Presidency, conservatives unsuccessfully fought to push their agenda of moral causes through Congress. Their chances for success seem even smaller now. Nevertheless, the conservative cadres are determined to force Congress to confront these issues once again. With the 1984 elections only 17 months away the White House is happy to go along. From President Reagan's viewpoint, advancing the ''social issues'' is a way of wooing some key voter groups: ethnic Catholics in the North, evangelical Protestants in the South and Hispanic people in the Southwest. Representative Tony Coelho of California, who runs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, assessed the White House strategy this way: ''They're trying to reidentify with their 1980 voters and get them back into their column again.'' Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Connecticut Republican, added: ''Reagan obviously feels the religious issue is one of his strongest wickets. I expect to see his biggest push on that - the whole element of binding government and religion.'' As part of his drive to tap religious feelings for his political cause, the President has also endorsed a proposal to provide tax credits for parents who enroll their children in private schools. The measure has virtually no chance of becoming law; Mr. Reagan's position thus encourages the widely held belief that he seems more interested in scoring political points with the ''social issues'' than in actually passing legislation. Seldom has the President bent arms or cashed chits in pursuit of votes for these measures, and he is expected to keep his efforts on a rhetorical plane. A Republican aide in the Senate noted, ''The Administration doesn't like the President climbing on wagons as they're going over the cliff.'' After the 1980 elections, advocates of the ''social issues'' proclaimed that a conservative tide was rolling over the country. But their ability to pass legislation was thwarted for several reasons, including fragmentation in their own ranks. Compromise is the essence of successful law-making on Capitol Hill, but these issues engender such strong emotions that accommodation becomes virtually impossible. ''These are clearly not matters on which you can split the difference,'' said a Republican staff member. ''You've got people involved who believe in absolute legal or constitutional or moral rights.'' Moreover, many voters, and lawmakers, who felt comfortable espousing general moral principles turned distinctly uncomfortable when faced with proposals that would translate those principles into binding standards of behavior. ''Americans generally don't like intrusions into their private lives,'' noted Representative James M. Shannon, Democrat of Massachusetts, a Catholic who has been attacked by church officials in recent campaigns because of his pro-choice stand on abortion. ''There's no consensus when you run into the details.'' Passions Aren't Burning A third factor that lessened the fervor for ''social issues'' was the recession. ''I don't see a lot of burning passion on these issues,'' said Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip. ''The economy has just been all-encompassing.'' Still, these issues and the attendant controversies are likely to recur in a number of forms. On school prayer, Senator Hatch backs an amendment that would permit silent devotion and allow religious groups to use public school facilities for meetings. As a Mormon, the Senator is sensitive to the problems of religious minorities, and he does not want pupils to be embarrassed by public prayers. He also does not like the idea of a state-written prayer, and he believes that only an amendment sanctioning silent prayer has any chance for passage. But the Hatch compromise does not seem to please either side. The White House and its more ardent allies continue to favor an amendment that would permit public, organized prayer. To the American Civil Liberties Union, any sort of prayer amounts to an official sanction of religion and is thus unacceptable. In another attempt at compromise, Senator Hatch has sponsored a constitutional amendment that would simply overturn the Supreme Court decision of 1973 that legalized abortion, leaving further legislation to the states and the Federal Government. This proposal has also drawn fire from all camps. Many opponents of abortion hold out for a much tougher proposal that would ban the procedure outright and leave no room for local option. Advocates of a woman's right to choose abortion favor the status quo and reject any further restrictions. For the last several years, Congress has adopted a rider banning the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortion. Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who sponsored the original amendment, is now pushing another bill that would make the ban permanent. A similar battle is brewing over a proposal to ban the use of Federal health insurance for abortions. Meanwhile, advocates of the pro-choice position on abortion are looking for a new cause that can keep their members stirred up and their treasuries full. So they are planning a full-scale drive to repeal the Hyde amendment and restore Medicaid funding for abortions. For now, the least heated of the ''social issues'' is school busing. The Senate passed a bill last year that would limit a court's right to order busing as a remedy for segregation, and similar legislation could pop up again. But in private, the overwhelming desire on Capitol Hill is for busing restrictions, like the rest of the social issues, to simply disappear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G.O.P. STARTS TRAINING IN 'GENDER GAP' POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/us/gop-starts-training-in-gender-gap-politics.html,"The Republican Party opened its 1984 Presidential campaign for the votes of women here this weekend. It was the party's first organized attack on the so-called gender gap, the evidence in polling data that women are increasingly tending to vote for Democrats. It took the form of the first Republican Women's Leadership Forum, where 100 participants were told that their party could sink under women's votes for the other side. ''The gender gap is part of an enormous wave of demographic change sweeping the country that threatens to swamp the Republican Party,'' Edward J. Rollins, President Reagan's chief political adviser, told the meeting last night. ''It is clear that if the sexes continue to align on a partisan basis, the Republican Party will once again be locked into a minority position,'' he said at another point. Training for Local Leaders The gathering was organized by the Republican National Committee to begin training the party's women leaders in the region in the themes of next year's campaign, and in answers to the challenge of the demographic changes that Mr. Rollins spoke of. These changes include the growing number of working women, singleparent families, and widows dependent on Federal programs who often perceive the Democrats as more attuned to their lives and desires, Mr. Rollins said. According to the most recent New York Times/CBS Poll, taken in April, women tend to view the Reagan Administration much more critically than men in matters of the economy and foreign policy and in issues of war and peace. And while men split evenly on their assessments of the Administration's overall performance, women responded disapprovingly by 48 percent to 38 percent. Mr. Rollins said White House polling had found a difference of nine percentage points between women's and men's party preferences, and the sense of urgency at the meeting was real. Balance of the Future ''The political party that gets the women's vote will be the party of the majority in the future,'' Mr. Rollins said. From Friday night until noon today, Republican staff members from the White House and Congress displayed ''the ammunition we have available and how it will carry Republicans to victory in 1984,'' as Betty Heitman, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, put it in her keynote speech. The party has planned at least three more such regional conferences. Two themes emerged in the speeches and workshops. The first, an argument often made by the party in the past, was that the Republicans perform while the Democrats promise. ''The reason behind the gender gap is that this President and this Administration have a terrific story to tell, but I don't think we've told it,'' Mrs. Heitman said. Stress on Independence The other theme emerged from conversations with some of the participants, most of whom were middle-aged suburban women in small business and the professions who have become leaders in their local party organizations, and who argued that the Republican emphasis on self-reliance is in key with the values of the women's movement. ''In the Republican Party, when a woman runs for office she runs because she's the best candidate and because she wants to run, not because they want a token woman for that job and so they let her run, like the other party,'' said Hannelore Huisman, who lost a race for County Clerk last year in heavily Democratic Rock Island County, Ill. ''That, I think, is true liberation.'' Mrs. Huisman said she was a member of the National Organization for Women, which on several occasions this weekend was dismissed as a Democratic front. The conference speakers offered a glimpse of the major women's themes in the campaign for the 1984 Presidential candidate, who they expect will be Mr. Reagan. These themes include the benefits to working women in signs of economic recovery, the importance of the abatement of inflation to the poor, and the advantages to widows in the elimination of most estate tax charges. Mr. Reagan's appointments of women to top posts, three to Cabinetrank positions and one to the Supreme Court, were presented as more than any previous administration had made over a comparable period and received heavy attention. But issues that the Democrats can be expected to raise, such as abortion rights, day care and affirmative action, were not raised. Instead, economic issues held center stage. ''The only way that we can get working women out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party,'' Mr. Rollins said, ''is to demonstrate to them that the Republican Party policy on economic growth is what they need.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECRECY IN A DISMISSAL BY STANFORD FUELS ACADEMIC FREEDOM DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/07/us/secrecy-in-a-dismissal-by-stanford-fuels-academic-freedom-dispute.html,"Stanford University's expulsion of a graduate student, on the basis of a secret report by faculty members who investigated his anthropological work in China, has touched off a dispute about academic freedom. The student, Steven W. Mosher, was dismissed from Stanford's doctoral program by an 11-0 vote of the anthropology department last February, with no reported dissent. But the secrecy surrounding the decision and conflicting accounts of the charges against the student have raised questions over whether Stanford had bowed to pressure from Peking to retaliate against Mr. Mosher. Mr. Mosher, 34 years old, conducted research in a village near Canton in 1979 and 1980. He was one of the first American scholars allowed to work in China after normal relations between Peking and Washington were restored. Work Led to Chinese Ban He gathered a highly unusual collection of local police and government documents that the Chinese consider secret, and he later published an article in a Taiwanese magazine that described a campaign to force many women to undergo abortions as part of China's birth control program. The Chinese were angered by Mr. Mosher's activities, and soon after his departure, whether by coincidence or not, banned all further field research by American academics. In conversations with other American scholars, Chinese officials also began accusing Mr. Mosher of a long list of charges, including spying, smuggling and immoral conduct with a woman. Several of the scholars reported the charges to Stanford. Stanford then set up a three-member investigating committee that reported that Mr. Mosher had engaged in ''illegal and seriously unethical conduct'' in China. But the anthropology department has refused to release the 47-page committee report on which the vote to expel Mr. Mosher was based, contending that it ''contains information that may be injurious to innocent parties.'' In a statement this spring responding to critical letters and editorials, Donald Kennedy, president of Stanford, termed the dispute over Mr. Mosher ''one of those unfortunate cases in which we find two important social values in collision.'' He said the university would like to be able to release the information to answer questions about ''possible infringements on academic freedom or about the operation of political influence.'' ''But an equally strong set of values attaches to the need for privacy,'' he went on, saying that the information might be ''damaging'' to other people. A spokesman for the university said Mr. Kennedy had not read the investigating committee's report. Ex-Wife Said to Be a Source Although members of the anthropology department have offered differing accounts of the charges against Mr. Mosher, several professors said the critical evidence had been supplied by his former wife, Maggie So, a Chinese born in Hong Kong. In the spring of 1980, after a bitter quarrel over Mr. Mosher's demand for a divorce, Miss So went to the United States Consulate in Canton, where she accused him of bribing local officials to obtain documents, the anthropology professors said. She complained that Mr. Mosher's actions were endangering her relatives who still lived in the village, they said. In early 1982, after the couple were divorced, the professors said, she repeated her accusations to the Stanford investigating committee, calling collect from France. One professor said Miss So had also charged Mr. Mosher with financing his operation by smuggling Chinese antiques to Hong Kong, though other professors said this was untrue. Miss So's current whereabouts are unknown. 'Abolutely False,' He Says Mr. Mosher derides Miss So's information as ''absolutely false and unsubstantiated slander'' from a ''scorned woman who vowed to ruin me.'' In a telephone interview from Taiwan, where he now lives, Mr. Mosher said he had been dismissed because of Chinese anger over the abortion article and pressure from American China scholars eager to please Peking. Stanford has denied both charges. Clifford R. Barnett, the chairman of the anthropology department, insisted that the department had been fair and had, for example, excluded China specialists, who might have appeared to be subject to pressure from the Chinese Government, from the investigating committee and the departmental vote. Stanford Widely Criticized The university, however, has been widely criticized for its handling of the case. Editorials in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal questioned the need for secrecy and suggested that Mr. Mosher might have been expelled to mollify the Chinese. Arthur Wolf, a Stanford anthropology professor, said all department members had received critical letters from groups that oppose abortion. Several professors at such universities as Harvard, Brown and Yale, who asked not to be named to avoid cooler relations with colleagues at Stanford, have raised questions about how much authority a university should exercise over students' actions off campus. They pointed out that Harvard University, along with some other Ivy League schools, had adopted a policy of limiting disciplinary action to offenses connected with a student's academic record or behavior on campus. Irving Louis Horowitz, the editor of Society magazine and a professor of political science and sociology at Rutgers University, said there was a serious question whether Stanford could withhold a degree from a student without making public the charges against him. Quality of Work Termed Issue ''The issue is not whether Mosher's a nice man but the quality of his work,'' said Mr. Horowitz. ''I've read his manuscript,'' he added, referring to Mr. Mosher's proposed dissertation, ''and I'd be glad to have him as a graduate student.'' ''I think Stanford felt they had to deliver a head to the People's Republic,'' Mr. Horowitz charged. ''If Mosher had done the same things in the Soviet Union, he'd be a hero.'' He noted that many American academics disliked the Soviet Union but had a favorable attitude toward China. Thomas Grey, a professor at the Stanford law school and one of the three members of the investigating committee, disputed Mr. Horowitz's contention. ''We were aware from the beginning that the Sinological community had a bias in this, so we kept them out,'' Mr. Grey said. ''I certainly didn't have any ax to grind,'' he added, ''and it took a lot of time away from my work at the law school.'' As an indication of Stanford's sensitivity, Norman K. Wessels, dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, has appointed a panel of three scholars, including one from outside Stanford, to hear a threepage grievance Mr. Mosher has filed against the school. Mr. Wessels asked the panel to recommend how he should deal with the case and requested a report that could be published. Student Says He May Sue for Libel Mr. Mosher, who has the investigative committee's report on the charges against him, has not released it. He has said he might sue Stanford for libel and that releasing the report himself would undermine his case. Mr. Barnett, stressing that he had tried to insure a fair investigation, said the department had rejected a number of unsubstantiated accusations made by Peking and by fellow China scholars, including the charge that Mr. Mosher was a spy and that he illegally imported a van into China and gave it to village officials. Still, Mr. Barnett asserted that some of the Chinese charges, including one that Mr. Mosher traveled without authorization into Guizhou Province, which is closed to foreigners, indicated a pattern of questionable behavior. One Stanford professor said Miss So's evidence had been corroborated at least in part by Richard Williams, who was the United States Consul General in Canton when Mr. Mosher was in China. Mr. Williams, now deputy consul general in Hong Kong, said by telephone that it ''wouldn't be appropriate'' for him to comment on the case. To support his contention that Stanford bowed to pressure by China scholars, Mr. Mosher cited a letter from Kenneth Prewitt, president of the Social Sciences Research Council in New York, to Stanford after he talked with Chinese officials late in 1981. The exchange program between China and the United States ''could be harmed if the American scholarly community took no action on what the Chinese regarded as improper behavior by Mosher,'' Mr. Prewitt warned. Stanford itself has conducted an active exchange program with China. Abortion Campaign Described In a book, ''Broken Earth: The Rural Chinese,'' to be published in September, Mr. Mosher paints a portrait of apathy, corruption and poverty among China's peasants and village officials. He also describes, as he did in the article published in Taiwan, a campaign in his village in the spring of 1980 to force abortions on pregnant women who were not permitted to have children under Peking's strict birth control rules. At a family planning meeting he attended, he wrote, a local official told the pregnant women, ''None of you have any choice in this matter.'' ''The two of you who are eight or nine months pregnant will have a Caesarean,'' Mr. Mosher quotes the official as saying. ''The rest of you will have a shot that will cause you to abort.'' In a nearby village, Mr. Mosher asserted, a woman seven months pregnant who had no sons had an ordered abortion and was found to have been carrying twin boys. The woman's husband, Mr. Mosher wrote, went in a fury to the home of the official who had ordered the abortion. ''Seizing the man's two sons, aged 8 and 10,'' he wrote, ''he heaved them into the courtyard well and then leaped in himself. All three drowned.'' The magazine article, published in May 1981, brought accusations from Peking that its content, and its publication in Taiwan, was an attack on China. And the head of Mr. Mosher's dissertation committee at Stanford, the anthropologist G. William Skinner, wrote Mr. Mosher that he was ''appalled at your irresponsibility and insensitivity'' in not concealing the identity of the women facing abortions. Concealing subjects' identity is a canon of anthropological ethics. Chinese Had Been Complaining Chinese officials had already been complaining to American scholars about Mr. Mosher, and Stanford decided to set up the investigating committee. When it began its work in October 1981, however, it lacked proof. The committee head, Prof. Jane F. Collier, wrote to Zhao Fusan, a deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, appealing for evidence. ''Much of the information we have received on these charges,'' she said, ''has been indirect and secondhand, consisting of reports by American scholars of complaints made to them by Chinese officials.'' Mr. Zhao's response only reiterated the allegations that had been gossiped about, said Mr. Barnett, the anthropology department chairman. But in December 1981, Miss So began making her accusations to Stanford, according to several professors familiar with the investigative report. Mr. Mosher asserts that Miss So had little first-hand knowledge of the village, though she had cousins there, because she visited him infrequently. Instead, she was either finishing graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley or working out of Hong Kong for an import-export company. 'I Will Ruin You' ''Matters came to a head in March 1980,'' Mr. Mosher said. ''She came to the village and I said I wanted a divorce.'' ''She replied, 'You can't, I will ruin you,' '' Mr. Mosher said. About the confidential documents, Mr. Mosher insists he was given access to them legally after three Chinese officials from Peking visited the village shortly before his arrival in 1979 and ordered the local authorities to cooperate with him. The documents included land registers, household registers and class status registers, giving a social and economic profile of each peasant going back to the 1940's. Mr. Mosher also obtained crime reports prepared by the local secret police. Scholars say no American had ever gained access to such material. Mr. Mosher said he did give his Mazda van to the village and turn over to his wife's cousins a house he built. But his only other gifts, Mr. Mosher said, were dinner invitations to peasants who helped him. Gifts Held Improper Professor Barnett concedes that anthropologists routinely provide their research subjects with money or gifts in exchange for their information or time. But, without elaborating, he asserted that Mr. Mosher ''went way over the line'' with his gifts. Before he was expelled, Mr. Mosher had planned to give all his documents to the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford. An official of the politically conservative institution said he had already turned over some materials on education and a microfilm file of the local county newspaper, a valuable tool for scholars. Unfortunately, the film he took was of such poor quality that it is unusable, the official added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; HOLLINGS HACKS AWAY AT HIS RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/08/us/politics-hollings-hacks-away-at-his-rivals.html,"To have a chance in the Democratic Presidential race, Senator Ernest F. Hollings figures he must beat out Senator John Glenn for the moderate vote. Therefore, Senator Hollings seldom misses a chance to denigrate Senator Glenn's political experience or his ideas, particularly, his plan to finance an acid rain cleanup with a consumer tax on electricity. The problem with this plan, Senator Hollings observed, is that a lot of the acid rain that falls on New Hampshire, site of the first Presidential primary, is caused by industrial pollution in Senator Glenn's home state of Ohio. ''So here comes this joker saying, 'We're going to squirt this acid rain on you and make you pay for it,' '' said Senator Hollings. Then he unfurled his patrician drawl to full amplitude and wrapped it around the punch line. ''I've heard of no-fault,'' he said, ''but this is yo'-fault.'' The South Carolinian, who has served in the Senate since 1966, offered these remarks and more to dazed companions in an airport layover in the tiring flight from Washington to Des Moines. This man can talk, and while his rivals are boasting about the gentlemanly tone of the campaign, Senator Hollings has started hacking away at them, at the Democratic Party power blocs, at Presidents past and present and at entire categories of citizens he blames for a series of failed chief executives. 'Shoot All the Pollsters' ''I've just seen too many economists,'' he observed in a typical jeremiad. ''They waffle all around. You ought to shoot all the economists and elect a couple of historians. You know what I mean? Get a feel of whence you're coming and where you're headed as the President. That's our trouble. It's been ad hoc-ery. It's sort of 'the seven o'clock news' and 'what's the issue?' and 'where are the people?' and 'get the pollster.' Shoot all the pollsters!'' In the Senate, such torrents have earned the Senator a reputation for overstatement. His advisers seem uncertain how the public will react to them, but before that can be determined, Senator Hollings must overcome another problem. As Billy Keyserling, the campaign manager put it, ''Nobody knows who he is.'' Ernest Frederick Hollings, a silver-haired man with ramrod posture, is one of the more interesting men in the Democratic race. Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important. The happenstance of being born 61 years ago in Charleston, S.C., equipped him with a trademark accent that has more twists than a snake's spine. Birth in that citadel of Confederate nostalgia and segregationist politics also endowed Senator Hollings with a political biography equally full of switchbacks. In 1959, he was elected Governor of South Carolina as a defender of segregation, having promised to protect ''the Southern way of life'' against ''the dictation of a power-happy Federal Government.'' 'We'd Run Out of Courts' ''I knew it was wrong, but there wasn't anything you could do about it, coming along politically,'' Senator Hollings now says of his behavior in those days. He conducted what he calls ''a separate but equal kind of governorship.'' He opposed Ku Klux Klan violence, but at the same time he committed the state to a policy of using every available legal maneuver to defend segregation. ''We'd appeal all the courts, with the dimestores and the licenseto-parade and every other dern thing, and we were wrong,'' he now says, Finally, ''We'd run out of courts, and we had to integrate Clemson, and I said we had to decide whether to be a government of men or a government of laws.'' The peaceful integration of Clemson University and Senator Hollings's decision to support John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Presidential race marked his break with racial politics. Now, with some regret, he acknowledges that for much of the decade that he led his state's defense of segregation he had no private belief in the cause. His secret conversion, Senator Hollings said, came when he was helping represent South Carolina before the Supreme Court in a case that eventually figured in the 1954 school desegregation decision. ''I sat there with those arguments going on,'' Senator Hollings said, ''then on I sort of shook my head and knew that the game was over. That was back in December in '52.'' Perception on Fiscal Affairs Senator Hollings said this conflict between private belief and public performance caused him inner turmoil and led him to take strict law enforcement measures to prevent the kind of violence that occurred elsewhere in the South. ''I was tough,'' he said, ''particularly on whites. I wouldn't let them get out of hand.'' These days, Senator Hollings is tough on his own party. His campaign is based on the premise that the other Democratic candidates, by pandering to labor and other interest groups, have gotten a reputation for fiscal irresponsibility that will make it impossible for them to challenge President Reagan. Among voters, he said, ''The definite perception is, 'Ye gods, this fellow's got a $200 billion deficit, but if we let Tip O'Neill and Cranston and Mondale and Hart and that crowd get back in there, there'll be $400 billion deficits.'T '' In contrast, Senator Hollings said he would run on a ''Sun Belt philosophy'' that calls for a freeze on Federal spending and protectionist measures to give American industry time to catch up with foreign competitors. He said he would do as President what he did as a Southern governor, arrange a government-business partnership that produces the economic growth needed to finance social programs in education, health and nutrition. 'Liberal Litany of Abortion' ''We know what it is to pay the bill and yet provide and we've been through these practical struggles,'' he said in describing his differences with the other Democrats. ''So why should we have them come down with this liberal litany of abortion and gay rights. I respect everybody as a citizen regardless of their sex practices, but why should we be putting in caucuses for gays and all of that nonsense like that. That's not a problem for America when we're hungry and on bread lines out there.'' In offering himself as the Sun Belt champion, Senator Hollings professes to see no threat from the region's other candidate, former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida. ''My competition is Glenn,'' he said. ''If I had the name recognition of Mondale or Glenn, there would hardly be any race. I'd have the nomination.'' Absent that name recognition, Senator Hollings is pinning his hopes almost entirely on a strong showing in the first primary in New Hampshire followed by a breakthrough in several Southern states that vote a week later. He is mounting only a modest effort for the Iowa caucuses, saying it is too expensive and time-consuming for a dark horse to build a organization there. If Senator Hollings has the simplest campaign plan, he also has a style that is so relaxed as to seem almost covert. Last week, for example, he drew only 60 people in stops in Boone, Carroll and Fort Dodge, Iowa. In most towns, his staff had failed to notify the legislators and local officials that he was coming, and the task of introducing the Senator sometimes fell to party leaders already committed to Senator Glenn. A Joke From Mrs. Hollings At several campaign stops, the Senator's wife, Peatsy, sat in the car, reading a novel because she said the staff had not given her any buttons or brochures to pass out. Like the Senator, Mrs. Hollings is from Charleston. She was working in Mr. Hollings's office here when they married in 1971, about a year after his first wife got a Mexican divorce. The couple frequently campaign together, and Mrs. Hollings tells the best joke produced by the campaign to date. As she tells it, a hotel clerk in California rang the room early one morning and demanded to know whether a Senator Hollings was present. Holding the telephone so that the clerk would be sure to hear, she turned to her husband and said, ''Hey, honey, is your name Hollings?'' Win or lose, Mrs. Hollings said, she and her husband intend to keep a sense of humor. But sometimes that plan conflicts with her job of reminding the Senator that ''he does tend to overspeak a little bit.'' For example, there was the Iowa luncheon where the Senator, ignoring the fact that his wife was rolling her eyes and shaking her head, regaled a group of elderly women with a joke about birth control. After that, they seemed to understand that this Southerner was not like the straitlaced Baptist who won the state in 1976. That, too, is part of the message of a candidate who believes Dixie deserves another turn. ''I don't believe we had a good chance at bat with Jimmy Carter,'' Senator Hollings said. ''We didn't put our best foot forward with him.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONFEREES START TO DRAFT BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/us/conferees-start-to-draft-budget.html,"Senate and House conferees began trying to draft a compromise budget for the Federal Government today, and lawmakers from both parties stressed that if Congress failed to adopt a spending plan the economic recovery could be undermined. ''I think we're going to have chaos if we don't have a budget resolution,'' Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee, told the conferees at their first meeting this morning. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, added, ''I think we're going to have to find a way to meet in the middle. The alternative is fiscal anarchy.'' But heated exchanges between Republicans on the budget conference demonstrated how difficult it is going to be for the lawmakers to ''meet in the middle'' and draft a blueprint that will pass both houses of Congress and then function as an effective guideline for the many decisions on spending and revenue that lie ahead this year. Meanwhile, an unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives in the House defeated an appropriation bill covering the Treasury and Postal Service. The conservatives felt the $12 billion appropriation was about $1 billion larger than the Reagan Administration wanted, and the liberals were angered over an amendment adopted earlier that would bar the use of Federal health insurance to finance abortions. The bill was defeated by a vote of 259 to 149. 'You Can't Win' ''It's very simple,'' said Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee. ''All those pro-choice people voted against it. Then there were the people on our side who like to vote against spending. When you've got those teams together, you can't win.'' The Treasury measure was the fifth of the 13 appropriation bills to reach the House floor in recent days. Earlier in the day, the lawmakers approved a $32 billion appropriation bill for the Agriculture Department. The budget sets broad spending guidelines for the Government but the appropriation bills actually allocate the funds. President Reagan has vowed to veto any of the bills he does not like, and at least four are considered candidates for vetoes. The major cloud hanging over the budget conference is Mr. Reagan's unhappiness with both the House and Senate budgets. Mr. Reagan cannot veto the budget, but he has vowed to veto bills to carry out the budget that he does not like, and today Representative Ed Bethune, Republican of Arkansas, warned conferees that unless they approved a budget that could ''pass muster'' at the White House, their efforts ''will be irrelevant.'' Reagan's Veto Strategy ''The President has a veto prerogative and he intends to use it,'' Mr. Bethune asserted. Along with some other Republicans, Senator Domenici has been increasingly irritated at Mr. Reagan's threat to follow a veto strategy. In replying to Mr. Bethune, he said such a strategy ''may lead nowhere in getting things done.'' An aide to Mr. Domenici added later, ''Bethune believes that a veto strategy leads to a coherent way of running the Government and we don't.'' After the conference ended for the day, Mr. Bethune acknowledged that ''there is a distinct division'' fragmenting Republicans on budget policy. Speaking of Mr. Domenici, the Arkansas Republican said, ''I strongly disagree with what he had to say. I think this is an irrelevant procedure.'' The core of that division lies in the differing perspectives and priorities, advanced by Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill. Mr. Reagan and his allies have apparently decided that by vetoing legislation, Mr. Reagan can portray himself as a fighter for fiscal responsibility while blaming Congress for the problems of the economy. Most Congress members, on the other hand, come to believe in the legislative process, and generally try to make the compromises necessary to ''meet in the middle'' and ultimately pass a bill. Moreover, Republicans leaders like Mr. Domenici believe strongly that the party has a responsibility to run the Government, and not run against the Government, as they believe Mr. Reagan is doing. Three Key Areas of Conflict The tax issue is one of the three main areas of controversy facing the budget conference. The House-passed version mandates $30 billion in new revenues, while the Senate sets a $9 billion target. Mr. Reagan wants virtually no new revenues, but the conference is likely to settle on something like the Senate figure. The second major area is military spending, which the conference started to discuss this afternoon. The House resolution proposes an increase of about 4 percent real growth, above inflation, and the Senate is at about 6 percent. Mr. Reagan originally proposed 10 percent, and later said he would settle for 7.5 percent, but the likely compromise is about 5 percent. The third major disagreement is over domestic spending. The House proposes an increase of $33 billion, while the Senate has approved $12.6 billion. Mr. Reagan wants virtually no increase. This area could prove the most troublesome, since liberal Democrats want to leave room in the budget for new programs to aid victims of the recession. And if the budget conference trims domestic spending too deeply, the compromise could have trouble attracting enough Democrats to win approval in the House. That point was emphasized today when Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania, urged the conference ''to make sure that the holes made in the safety net over the last two years are repaired.'' By ''safety net,'' he was referring to domestic programs designed to protect the truly needy. But Senate Republicans have warned that their budget passed by only one vote, and that any significant increases in domestic spending above their figure could doom the compromise in the Senate. Senator Slade Gorton, the Washington Republican who authored the Senate budget, said the one-vote margin ''leaves us very, very little room to maneuver'' in terms of accepting House proposals. In overall terms, the House budget proposes outlays in the fiscal year 1984 of $863.3 billion, and a deficit of $174.5 billion. The Senate bill suggests $849.7 billion in spending and a deficit of $178.6 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIFFERING VIEWS ON SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/nyregion/l-differing-views-on-sex-education-217479.html,"The following is a response to Charlotte Lichterman's letter regarding sex education in the schools. I applaud loudly for the few schools that have the courage to present Birthright as an alternative to the pro-abortion viewpoint. Abortion is not merely a reliious or moral issue. It is a civilrights, a social-justice, issue and should be addressed as such. Our country has such great passion to protect the whales, the seals, and to prevent cruelty to animals. How incomprehensible then is our inhumane treatment to our most defenseless human unborn children. We would not subject our dogs or cats to such torture. Pro-lifers do care about all the unborn. However, contrary to popular belief, it is true they care about the mothers too. Prolifers realize that to make such a decision must require great anguish. In many cases, it is what the mother feels is her only solution. Birthright and many other pro-life groups want to reach out to women with distressed pregnancies to show them there is a lifeline waiting for them. There are people who care about ''her'' and who want to help her as well as her baby.

I would like to suggest that whenever the ''right-to-life'' perspective is advocated, one of the ministers from the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights be invited as well. This national organization is composed of 27 major mainstream religious institutions that agree that when to bear children is a matter of concern to the woman in question, her physician, sometimes her minister and never the state.

SUMMARY OF 1983 REGULAR SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/nyregion/summary-of-1983-regular-session.html,"Following are some of the major issues dealt with by the 1983 regular session of the General Assembly, which adjourned Wednesday: Finances The General Assembly adjourned its regular session without adopting a budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Governor O'Neill immediately called the legislature back into special session to try to enact a budget before the start of the new fiscal year. The Appropriations Committee did put together a $3.6 billion budget measure, but the Democratic majorities, particularly in the House of Representatives, could not muster enough votes to pass it, or the package of new and higher taxes that would balance it. The proposed budget is likely to form the starting point for future negotiations in the special session. It calls for spending about $45 million more than what the Governor proposed in February. The major increases would pay for a 3 percent increase in welfare benefits and higher state aid for education. Taxes The General Assembly passed what became known as a ''minipackage'' of tax increases, with the following elements to help erase part of the deficit in the current fiscal year: Increase the state tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon. Impose the sales tax on meals costing less than $1. Impose the sales tax on seed and fertilizer for nonfarm use. The Senate passed, but the House could not get the votes to approve, another package of $265 million in new and higher taxes for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The Senate's legislation would have done the following: Impose a 3.5 percent sales tax on personal and professional services. Tax interest income as part of a revised state tax on dividends. Increase the tax on corporation profits to 11.5 percent from 10 percent. Increase the business services tax to 7.5 percent from 3.5 percent. Increase the cigarette tax by 5 cents a pack.

'VENGEANCE VOTE' WORRIES WHITE HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/weekinreview/vengeance-vote-worries-white-house.html,"One of the President's men raised the specter last week that the G.O.P. is in danger of becoming known for the next generation as ''the party of the men'' - a minority party in an era when female voters are in the ascendance and are showing a statistical preference for Democrats that has become more pronounced during President Reagan's incumbency. Unfortunately, perhaps, for purposes of the warning presented by Edward J. Rollins, the White House political director, the message was delivered to Republican women who already know there are difficulties in trying to sell parts of the Reagan record to their sisters. Mr. Rollins's warning about an approaching ''turning point in American political history'' seemed better directed at Republican men, and the message might easily be compounded to question whether the G.O.P. is in danger of being further stereotyped as ''the party of the white men.'' Mr. Rollins, who is well attuned to the traditional voting blocs, only a few days before addressing the women had heard the sternest warning from a group of black Republicans that the Reagan record in office was nothing they could sell in the black community and that, in fact, it was stirring a likely ''vengeance vote'' in which blacks angered by the President's policies would turn out heavily for Democrats next year. ''We're not prepared to be apologists for that record as it stands today,'' a black Republican said afterward, citing a long list of complaints ranging from social budget cuts to changes in civil rights policies in the Justice Department and the alleged easing of foreign policy pressure toward South Africa's racism. Definitions of Decency In denying the thrust of the complaints, Mr. Rollins pleaded the basic decency of President Reagan. But he conceded that, unfair as he considered it, a ''vengeance vote'' was a possibility. ''There's no question the potential is out there,'' he said later in an interview. ''We've got to tell our story, to take the edge off, to tell the black community that our economic program helps all Americans.'' The disgruntlement expressed at the meeting was all the more noteworthy since it came from a marginal political quarter, Republican blacks, not noted for table thumping but rather for patient dwelling on the fringe of the party of Lincoln. Participants at the meeting described a moment when Prof. J. Clay Smith, a law professor from Howard University, felt obliged to interrupt as the President's personal decency was being emphasized. The professor said the point was not the President's decency, but rather ''the basic decency of American blacks, and how the policies invoked by the Administration somehow seem to bring this into question.'' Policies that focus on ''welfare cheats'' and the inconvenience suffered by white students in school busing cases seem designed more to spur a strong blue-collar vote among whites than to reassure black voters, the black Republicans complained in trying to explain why the President's rate of disapproval among blacks is running at 80 percent. The message from women seems no less threatening for Republicans. In a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, Mr. Reagan had the approval of 48 percent of men, but only 38 percent of women. Election results from last fall showed Republicans doing worse by 5 to 15 percentage points among women voters than among the men. Mr.Reagan's problem is measured in such issues as the economy. Republican pollsters talk of such ''gender gap'' implications as the Democrats' reaping a 30-point advantage in preference among single women. Mr.Rollins gets to the urgent heart of the numbers in noting: ''In 1984, more women than men will vote.'' The Administration's approach in dealing with the complaints of blacks and women is to emphasize general economic recovery as the overriding cure, and to hope that the improving measurements of recovery will be noted gratefully by voters in both categories, where the hardships of recession and unemployment have been disproportionately concentrated. There is some discreet agitation among White House officials who question whether this is enough of an electioneering message. In one symptom of discomfort, anonymous carping already can be heard from members of the President's predominantly male inner circle about the latest woman to join the Administration, Faith Ryan Whittlesey, director of public liaison. Mrs.Whittlesey seems an unlikely scapegoat for re-election anxiety about the ''gender gap'' since she only recently joined the Administration and she reflects the President's own view that the gap is exaggerated and economic recovery will cover a multitude of dissatisfactions. More interesting than the staff sniping are the views expressed by some among the quiet female cadre who work for the ranking staff members in the West Wing. Loyal Republicans, a number of these women fervently, privately object to any number of Administration positions on such issues as the equal rights amendment and the attempt to outlaw abortion. Lately, they have been attuned to a round of inconclusive Cabinet meetings on a package of relatively noncontroversial issues affecting women that the Administration has had under consideration for some time. The lingering proposals, relating to such topics as equity in pensions and insurance, left one White House woman muttering the other day about the slow rate that marks the retreat of ''slavery.'' ''It's uncomfortable for some of us here,'' another woman of the West Wing conceded. ''But he was elected,'' she said, referring to President Reagan. ''We weren't.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION BATTLE MOVING TO STATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/us/abortion-battle-moving-to-states.html,"After a decade of working to abolish abortion through Federal action, the anti-abortion movement is winning passage of restrictive measures on the state and local levels, both sides agree. In fact, the major organization lobbying for legalized abortions has concluded that the chief battleground on the issue is shifting. ''It appears that the pro-choice forces are winning the Federal fight,'' said Nanette Falkenberg, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, and as a result ''the anti-choice movement is taking their efforts to the state and local level where they will chip away at women's access to abortion services through a wide range of restrictive legislation.'' Judie Brown, president of the American Life Lobby, one of several anti-abortion groups active in Washington, disagreed sharply with the statement that advocates of choice were winning the Federal fight, but she agreed that the ''right-to-life'' movement was winning a number of battles at the state level. Push for Amendment Mrs. Falkenberg attributed the shift to the abortion opponents' failure in repeated attempts to obtain a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court decision of 1973 upholding the right to abortion. Anti-abortion forces have been divided over what kind of a measure to promote, and the amendment that has been tentatively scheduled for Senate action within a few days was sent to the floor by the Judiciary Committee without recommendation for passage. That measure was sponsored by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who has acknowledged that it stands little chance of approval. A spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who had advocated a stronger version, termed the Hatch legislation ''half-baked and ineffective.'' Mrs. Brown of the American Life Lobby said that, despite the failure of the proposed contitutional amendments, progress was being made in Congress in ''adding pro-life language'' to Federal statutes. She said she felt certain that this year Congress would pass a bill that would take issue with the Supreme Court, which would probably have no force in its own but could cause the Court to reconsider its 1973 decision. But she acknowledged that the anti-abortion movement was strongest in the states and said every effort was being made there to ''protect the unborn.'' New Drive for Funds In response, the abortion rights league has begun a fund-raising drive to increase its lobbying efforts in state capitals. ''The pervasiveness of this state threat,'' Mrs. Falkenberg said in a memorandum explaining the need for a shift in strategy, ''is illustrated by the fact that nearly every state legislature that met in 1983 had at least one restrictive measure introduced.'' The restrictions that are being enacted, including some local ordinances, could have a ''devastating'' cumulative effect, Mrs. Falkenberg said. State regulation of abortions would be further enhanced, she said, if the Supreme Court upholds any of the restrictions at issue in three cases that it is expected to decide this month. The Supreme Court has struck down several state restrictions since 1973, including blanket requirements of a parent's or husband's consent. Parental Consent Required Nevertheless, Mrs. Falkenberg said Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island had enacted laws requiring parental consent in some circumstances for teen-agers seeking abortions. Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah require that parents be notified. Eleven states require a waiting period before an abortion can be performed. They are Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maine, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Utah. And 15 states bar the use of any state Medicaid funds, just as Federal law bars use of Federal funds, for abortions. They are Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia. Medicaid is the joint Federal-state program that provides medical services to poor people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JUSTICE BLACKMUN TELLS NEW LAWYERS 'TAKE RISKS',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/13/nyregion/justice-blackmun-tells-new-lawyers-take-risks.html,"Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who has emerged in recent years as one of the most outspoken members of the United States Supreme Court, urged the graduating class of New York Law School yesterday to ''take the proper risks, the calculated risks, that innovation and progress require.'' Speaking at commencement ceremonies at Avery Fisher Hall, Justice Blackmun expressed his hopes for the young lawyers: that they concern themselves with ''the little person''; teach others, ''if not in the classroom, then by example''; dedicate themselves to public service and set their sights on something more lofty than making money. ''For those in the legal profession there comes a time when one must choose what he or she intends to make out of life,'' he said. ''In our profession, what we know today is the result of the effort and thought and experimentation, imagination, courage and disappointments of a long list of names.'' ''If I had really wanted to make money I would never have left my firm in Minneapolis, never have gone to Rochester and never gone on the bench,'' said Justice Blackmun, who served as resident counsel to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., before his appointment to the United States Court of Appeals in 1959. ''That's no place to grow rich and it's certainly no place to become very popular.'' Problems Finding Law Jobs For many in the audience, there was a certain irony in Justice Blackmun's comments about the pitfalls and opportunities of legal practice. Unlike their peers at more prominent institutions like Columbia and New York Universities, students at New York Law School have had increasing difficulty finding law-related jobs in recent years. A considerable number of graduates have been forced to take positions only peripherally connected with their hard-earned, expensive legal training. ''Placement is a serious problem,'' acknowledged James F. Simon, the school's acting dean. ''We have to convince the law firms that we have very highly qualified students. It's partly a marketing exercise on our part, but partly it's the economy itself. You can't find jobs when there are no jobs available.'' Despite the uncertain employment prospects, there was a festive, even boisterous tone to yesterday's proceedings, particularly for those who attended school at night while holding down full-time jobs. Flashbulbs popped, hands waved wildly and individual cheering sections almost drowned out ''Pomp and Circumstance.'' Justice Blackmun's visit marked another step in the New York Law School's long and difficult road back to its former eminence. Founded in 1894 by a group of dissident law professors at Columbia, the school was once the largest in the country. Its early faculty included Charles Evans Hughes, and John Marshall Harlan, class of 1924, both of whom went on to the United States Supreme Court. School's Decline Reversed In the 1930's and 1940's, however, New York Law School went into decline and even closed at one point. That pattern has been reversed in the past decade, and now more than 1,500 students attend its day and night divisions. The school is on Worth Street in lower Manahttan. The enthusiastic reception given Justice Blackmun - best known for writing the 1973 majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion - reflected the increasing attention and respect he has earned in legal academic circles since joining the High Court in 1970. Both before and after his speech, he received standing ovations. Dean Simon hailed him for his ''capacity for growth as a jurist'' and his ''open-mindness,'' and noted that, like many of those graduating, Justice Blackmun came from a family of limited means. ''His opinions,'' Dean Simon continued, ''reflect the man: loyal to his country and its institutions, caring and sensitive to the needs of its individual citizens.'' Getting Away From Washington On several occasions, principally in dissent, Justice Blackmun has urged his colleagues to emerge from the isolation of their Washington chambers and become, as he wrote in one opinion, ''part of the real world.'' ''One has to get away from Washington every once in a while,'' he said before his speech. ''I like law students, I like what I see in law schools these days, and it does me a lot of good. I come back refreshed and it makes me feel a little bit younger.'' The oldest and perhaps the most joyous graduate yesterday was Martin P. Levin, 64 years old. Mr. Levin, once head of the Association of American Publishers, will retire this year as head of the book publishing group of The Times Mirror Company to practice law, teach and serve as a liaison to the publishing industry in the Mayor's Office of Economic Development. ''Most people, when they get to retirement, look at it as a termination; they're going to play golf and go fishing,'' Mr. Levin said. ''To me, it's really a new beginning. Look around, you see these kids, and I feel just as young as they are and just as happy. Maybe happier.'' Justice Blackmun was one of four people who received honorary Doctor of Law degrees. The other recipients were: CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, ''in view of your brilliant mastery of the law, your tireless energy as a dynamic jurist and your beneficial influence upon the laws of the nation.'' ALBERT PARKER, senior partner, Parker Chapin Flattau & Klimpl, ''a direct man of monumental strength, wisdom, humanity and decency, in recognition of his uncompromising standards of excellence and inspired leadership.'' LOWELL P. WEICKER JR., Senator from Connecticut, ''in view of your unshakable and formidable commitment to a just and humane society and your dedication to the common interest.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'PRENATAL ADOPTION' IS THE OBJECTIVE OF NEW TECHNIQUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/prenatal-adoption-is-the-objective-of-new-technique.html,"THE art of laboratory fertilization of humans has progressed far in recent years, and now some medical scientists are trying to add yet another new dimension to the work through a technique that might broaden farther the range of infertility problems that can be overcome. The technique is known as ovum transfer, or ''adoptive pregnancy,'' because the ovum -the mature female egg cell - is supplied by a woman donor, not by the prospective mother herself, and is implanted in the prospective mother's womb after fertilization in the donor. If future success with ovum transfer matches the hopes of scientists in the field, it might make pregnancy possible for women who lack functional ovaries altogether. It could also be used for women unwilling to risk normal pregnancies with their own genetic contribution because of family history of such serious diseases as hemophilia, Tay-Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Their husbands' sperm cells could be used, but the donors' egg cells would be used as substitutes for their own. For the present, however, the objective of such prenatal adoptions is to offer a safe and effective alternative to present techniques and to avoid the surgery that such techniques require. Ovum transfer in the laboratory has produced successful pregnancies in species ranging from rats to baboons and chimpanzees and is fast becoming routine in cattle breeding. To date, only a group at the University of California at Los Angeles is known to have tried it on humans, though a related technique has been used at least once in Australia in an effort to achieve an adoptive pregnancy in a woman. The procedures involve the same ethical and legal concerns that have attended laboratory fertilizations and pregnancies produced by artificial insemination with donated sperm. Some people oppose any interference in natural reproduction processes. Others contend that, if such interference can overcome a problem of infertility or prevent tragic illness, it should be encouraged. The new efforts have evoked some controversy in Australia, but evidently not in the United States, where the program was preceded by extensive review and discussion by special panels at the university. The attempt in Australia produced a pregnancy that ended in spontaneous abortion after a short time. In the United States three attempts have been made, the first of which failed to produce a pregnancy, the scientists said in a brief report in the British medical journal The Lancet. As for the two more recent attempts in California, Dr. John E. Buster, leader of the medical research team there, said it was still too early to tell whether a pregnancy had been established or not. Dr. Stephen P. Boyers, who helped design the University of California project and was a member of the research team until last year, said the first such success would appear to be only a matter of time. Similar methods have been used in research with about 14 different animal species since 1890, he said. Indeed, ovum transfer has become a major tool of commercial cattle breeding in this country within the last few years. Dr. Boyers estimated that as many as 60,000 cows had been born from such adoptive pregnancies in the United States, with no detectable increase in the frequency of birth defects. The conventional technique of laboratory fertilization for humans was developed by Dr. Robert Edwards and Dr. Patrick Steptoe in England. The first such ''test-tube baby'' was born in 1978, and the method has since been used successfully throughout the world. In the conventional technique, mature egg cells are removed from the prospective mother by surgery and fertilized in laboratory glassware with the husband's sperm. A fertilized egg is then returned to the woman's reproductive tract after growth ''in vitro'' (literally ''in glass'') for several days. The technique is called in vitro fertilization, and a great deal of evidence has accumulated that it is effective, safe and produces healthy babies. But in vitro fertilization, unlike ovum transfer, requires surgery under general anesthesia. An incision is made near the woman's umbilicus for removal of the mature egg cell. The women to whom it offers the last hope of pregnancy have often repeatedly undergone surgery in efforts to repair the blocked Fallopian tubes that had prevented normal pregnancy. Such women would need yet another operation for every effort at in vitro fertilization, Dr. Boyers noted, and multiple attempts must often be made to achieve pregnancy. Many patients are willing to accept this necessity. Others are not. In the Australian case of ovum transfer, reported earlier this year by Dr. John Leeton and colleagues at Monash University in Melbourne, a woman who had failed to become pregnant in many attempts through artificial insemination was given a laboratory-fertilized donor egg cell from another woman and became pregnant, according to a report from that group. The woman aborted spontaneously after 10 weeks. Method Used on Coast The method developed in California is substantially different. The prospective mother is first matched as to blood type and physical characteristics with potential donors. Donors, patient and the patient's husband are all screened both medically and psychologically to satisfy the medical team that they understand the experimental treatment and are suitable for it. The actual attempt is made when a donor and patient are found to be synchronized in ovulatory cycle. At a time determined by hormone measurements the donor is impregnated through artificial insemination, using sperm from the prospective mother's husband. The fertilized egg is then removed by lavage, a washing of the uterine cavity with a harmless fluid. In the case described in The Lancet the artificial insemination was done March 15. Five days later, the donor's egg cell, now fertilized, was washed gently out of the donor's reproductive tract. By then, the egg cell had grown to an early embryo of 14 cells, which was recovered, photographed for the scientific record, then deposited by catheter in the patient. ''This is, to our knowledge, the first report of deliberate in vivo fertilization, successful nonsurgical recovery of a deliberately fertilized ovum, and attempted transfer of that fertilized ovum to an infertile woman,'' the report in the medical journal said. The authors were Dr. Buster; Dr. Boyers, who is now in private practice; Maria Bustillo, Ian Thorneycroft, James A. Simon and John R. Marshall, all of the University of California group; and Richard G. Seed and John A. Louw of Fertility and Genetic Research Inc., a company that has supported the research with a $400,000 grant and developed equipment used in the procedure. ''We see nonsurgical ovum donor transfer as an alternative to in vitro fertilization when an infertile couple is willing to accept a donated ovum,'' the report in The Lancet said. The scientists said the technique could be performed in the doctor's office and, moreover, could be repeated until pregnancy was achieved. Possible Problem for Donor Ovum transfer entails one unusual potential problem: A donor might become pregnant accidentally if lavage fails to remove a fertilized egg. Prospective donors are informed of this possibility, which is considered unlikely, and are offered the opportunity of abortion within days of the unsuccessful lavage. Dr. Georgeanna S. Jones, a pioneer in use of in vitro fertilization at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, said the California group was well qualified for such research. The aspect she found most worth considering was the future possibility of offering a semi-adoptive pregnancy to a woman for whom in vitro fertilization would be impossible because of ovarian failure or for whom the risk of hereditary disease precluded normal pregnancy. For women capable of ovulating, she said most would probably prefer to have their own egg cells used. Last week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in San Antonio, she said clinical research on laboratory fertilization providing new hope for therapy of hitherto untreatable infertility is ''enormously important.'' Dr. Luigi Mastroianni Jr., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, said the technique used in California would probably be acceptable to some women, but that many would probably insist on becoming pregnant with their own egg cells, fertilized by their husbands' sperm. The National Center for Health Statistics recently published a survey on fertility problems among Americans indicating that one of every 10 American couples can be classified as infertile. The survey data do not indicate how many of these could have children with the aid of the in vitro fertilization technique or the new method pioneered in California. The report by the Federal agency said that there were about 4.3 million women of childbearing age who appeared to be infertile for one or another reason, and that at least two million of them wanted children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM COURT'S OPINION AND DISSENT ON ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/excerpts-from-court-s-opinion-and-dissent-on-abortion-case.html,"Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's principal abortion decision today, declaring unconstitutional an ordinance in Akron, Ohio, that limited access to abortion. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote the opinion and Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the dissent. From the Opinion By Justice Powell These cases come to us a decade after we held in Roe v. Wade that the right of privacy, grounded in the concept of personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, encompasses a woman's right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. Legislative responses to the Court's decision have required us on several occasions, and again today, to define the limits of a state's authority to regulate the performance of abortions. And arguments continue to be made, in these cases as well, that we erred in interpreting the Constitution. Nonetheless, the doctrine of stare decisis, while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question, is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law. We respect it today, and reaffirm Roe v. Wade. Today, however, the dissenting opinion rejects the basic premise of Roe and its progeny. The dissent stops short of arguing flatly that Roe should be overruled. Rather, it adopts reasoning that, for all practical purposes, would accomplish precisely that result. The dissent states that ''even assuming that there is a fundamental right to terminate pregnancy in some situations,'' the state's compelling interests in maternal health and potential human life ''are present throughout pregnancy.'' The existence of these compelling interests turns out to be largely unnecessary, however, for the dissent does not think that even one of the numerous abortion regulations at issue imposes a sufficient burden on the ''limited'' fundamental right to require heightened scrutiny. I In February 1978 the City Council of Arkon enacted Ordinance No. 160-1978, entitled ''Regulations of Abortions.'' The ordinance sets forth 17 provisions that regulate the performance of abortions, five of which are at issue in this case: (i) Section 1870.03 requires that all abortions performed after the first trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital. (ii) Section 1870.05 sets forth requirements for notification of and consent by parents before abortions may be performed on unmarried minors. (iii) Section 1870.06 requires that the attending physician make certain specified statements to the patient ''to insure that the consent for an abortion is truly informed consent.'' (iv) Section 1870.07 requires a 24-hour waiting period between the time the woman signs a consent form and the time the abortion is performed. (v) Section 1870.16 requires that fetal remains be ''disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner.'' A violation of any section of the ordinance is punishable as a criminal misdeameanor. II In Roe v. Wade the Court held that the ''right of privacy, ... founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.'' Although the Constitution does not specifically identify this right, the history of this Court's constitutional adjudication leaves no doubt that ''the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution.'' Central among these protected liberties is an individual's ''freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life.'' The decision in Roe was based firmly on this long-recognized and essential element of personal liberty. At the same time, the Court in Roe acknowledged that the woman's fundamental right ''is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in abortion.'' But restrictive state regulation of the right to choose abortion, as with other fundamental rights subject to searching judicial examination, must be supported by a compelling state interest. From approximately the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, the state ''may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.'' The state's discretion to regulate on this basis does not, however, permit it to adopt abortion regulations that depart from accepted medical practice. If a state requires licensing or undertakes to regulate the performance of abortions during this period, the health standards adopted must be ''legimately related to the objective the state seeks to accomplish.'' III Section 1870.03 of the Akron ordinance requires that any abortion performed ''upon a pregnant woman subsequent to the end of the first trimester of her pregnancy'' must be ''performed in a hospital.'' We now hold that Sec. 1870.03 is unconstitutional. There can be no doubt that Sec. 1870.03's second-trimester hospitalization requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. A primary burden created by the requirement is additional cost to the woman. The Court of Appeals noted that there was testimony that a second-trimester abortion costs more than twice as much in a hospital as in a clinic. (in-hospital abortion costs $850-$900, whereas a dilatation-and-evacuation (D. and E.) abortion performed in a clinic costs $350-$400). Moreover, the court indicated that second-trimester abortions were rarely performed in Akron hospitals. Thus, a second-trimester hospitalization requirement may force women to travel to find available facilities, resulting in both financial expense and additional health risk. Akron does not contend that Sec. 1870-03 imposes only an insignificant burden on women's access to abortion, but rather defends it as a reasonable health regulation. This position had strong support at the time of Roe v. Wade, as hospitalization for second-trimester abortions was recommended by the American Public Health Association (A.P.H.A.), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (A.C.O.G.). Since then, however, the safety of second-trimester abortions has incresed dramatically. The principal reason is that the D. and E. procedure is now widely and successfully used for second-trimester abortions. The Court of Appeals found that there was ''an abundance of evidence that D. and E. is the safest method of performing post-first trimester abortions today.'' Change in Group's View For our purposes, an even more significant factor is that experience indicates that D. and E. may be performed safely on an outpatient basis in appropriate nonhospital facilities. The evidence is strong enough to have convinced the A.P.H.A. to abandon its prior recommendation of hospitalization for all second-trimester abortions. Similarly, the A.C.O.G. no longer suggests that all secondtrimester abortions be performed in hospital. It recommends that abortions performed in a physician's office or outpatient clinic be limited to 14 weeks of pregnancy, but it indicates that abortions may be performned safely in ''a hospital-based or in a free-standing ambulatory surgical facility, or in an out-patient clinic meeting the criteria required for a free-standing surgical facility,'' until 18 weeks of pregnancy. These developments, and the professional commentary supporting them, constitute impressive evidence that - at least during the early weeks of the second trimester - D. and E. abortions may be performed as safely in an outpatient clinic as in a full-service hospital. We conclude, therefore, that ''present medical knowledge,'' convincingly undercuts Akron's justification for requiring that all second-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital. By preventing the performance of D. and E. abortions in an appropriate nonhospital setting, Akron has imposed a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure. IV We turn next to Sec. 1870.05(B), the provision prohibiting a physician from performing an abortion on a minor pregnant woman under the age of 15 unless he obtains ''the informed written consent of one of her parents or her legal guardian'' or unless the minor obtains ''an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the obortion be performed or induced.'' The relevant legal standards are not in dispute. The Court has held that ''the state may not impose a blanket provision ... requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor.'' In Bellotti v. Baird (1979), a majority of the Court indicated that a state's interest in protecting immature minors will sustain a requirement of a consent substitute, either parental or judicial. The Bellotti II plurality cautioned, however, that the state must provide an alternative procedure whereby a pregnant minor may demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests. Under these decisions, it is clear that Akron may not make a blanket determination that all minors under the age of 15 are too immature to make this decision or that an abortion never may be in the minor's best interests without parental approval. proceedings, but that statute neither mentions minors' abortions nor suggests that the Ohio Juvenile Court has authority to inquire into a minor's maturity or emancipation. In these circumstances, we do not think that the Akron ordinance, as applied in Ohio juvenile proceedings, is reasonably susceptible of being construed to create an ''opportunity for case-by-case evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors.'' We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment that Sec. 1870.05(B) is unconstitutional. V The Akron ordinance provides that no abortion shall be performed except ''with the informed written consent of the pregnant woman ... given freely and without coercion.'' Sec. 1870.06(A). The decision to have an abortion has ''implications far broader than those associated with most other kinds of medical treatment,'' and thus the state legitimately may seek to insure that it has been made ''in the light of all attendant circumstances - psychological and emotional as well as physical - that might be relevant to the well-being of the patient.'' This does not mean, however, that a state has unreviewable authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an abortion. It remains primarily the responsibility of the physician to insure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient, depending on her particular circumstances. Danforth's recognition of the state's interest in insuring that this information be given will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth. Viewing the city's regulations in this light, we believe that Sec. 1870.06(B) attempts to extend the state's interest in insuring ''informed consent'' beyond permissible limits. First, it is fair to say that much of the information required is designed not to inform the woman's consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether. Subsection (3) requires the physician to inform his patient that ''the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception,'' a requirement inconsistent with the Court's holding in Roe v. Wade that a state may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions. Moreover, much of the detailed description of ''the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the particular unborn child'' required by subsection (3) would involve at best speculation by the physician. And subsection (5), that begins with the dubious statement that ''abortion is a major surgical procedure'' and proceeds to describe numerous possible physical and psychological complications of abortion, is a ''parade of horribles'' intended to suggest that abortion is a particularly dangerous procedure. An additional, and equally decisive, objection to Sec. 1870.06(B) is its intrusion upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician. In Danforth the Court wanred against placing the physician in just such an ''undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket.'' VI The Akron ordinance prohibits a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant woman signs a consent form. Sec. 1870.07. We find that Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period. There is no evidence suggesting that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely. Nor are we convinced that the state's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.'' In accordance with the ethical standards of the profession, a physician will advise the patient to defer the abortion when he thinks this will be beneficial to her. But if a woman, after appropriate counseling, is prepared to give her written informed consent and proceed with the abortion, a state may not demand that she delay the effectuation of that decision. From the Dissent By Justice O'Connor, Joined by Justice White and Justice Rehnquist It is apparent from the Court's opinion that neither sound constitutional theory nor our need to decide cases based on the application of neutral principles can accommodate an analytical framework that varies according to the ''stages'' of pregnancy, where those stages, and their concomitant standards of review, differ according to the level of medical technology available when a particular challenge to state regulation occurs. Our recent cases indicate that a regulation imposed on ''a lawful abortion 'is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion.' '' In my view, this ''unduly burdensome'' standard should be applied to the challenged regulations throughout the entire pregnancy without reference to the particular ''stage'' of pregnancy involved. If the particular regulation does not ''unduly burden'' the fundamental right, then our evaluation of that regulation is limited to our determination that the regulation rationally relates to legitimate state purpose. Irrespective of what we may believe is wise or prudent policy in this difficult area, ''the Constitution does not constitute us as 'Platonic Guardians' nor does it vest in this Court the authority to strike down laws because they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy, 'wisdom,' or 'common sense.' '' The trimester or ''three-stage'' approach adopted by the Court in Roe and, in a modified form, employed by the Court to analyze the state regulations in these cases, cannot be supported as a legitimate or useful framework for accommodating the women's right and the state's interests. The decision of the Court today graphically illustrates why the trimester approach is a completely unworkable method of accommodating the conflicting personal rights and compelling state interests that are involved in the abortion context. As the Court indicates today, the state's compelling interest in maternal health changes as medical technology changes, and any health regulation must not ''depart from accepted medical practice.'' In applying this standard, the Court holds that ''the safety of second-trimester abortions has increased dramatically'' since 1973, when Roe was decided. Lines Have Been 'Blurred' It is not difficult to see that despite the Court's purported adherence to the trimester approach adopted in Roe, the lines drawn in that decision have now been ''blurred'' because of what the Court accepts as technological advancement in the safety of abortion procedure. The state must continuously and conscientiously study contemporary medical and scientific literature in order to determine whether the effect of a particular regulation is to ''depart from accepted medical practice'' insofar as particular procedures and particular periods within the trimester are concerned. Assuming that legislative bodies are able to engage in this exacting task, it is difficult to believe that our Constitution requires that they do it as a prelude to protecting the health of their citizens. It is even more difficult to believe that this court, without the resources available to those bodies entrusted with making legislative choices, believes itself competent to make these inquiries and to revise these standards every time the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (A.C.O.G.) or similar group revises its views about what is and what is not appropriate medical procedure in this area. Indeed, the A.C.O.G. standards on which the Court relies were changed in 1982 after trial in the present cases. Before A.C.O.G. changed its standards in 1982, it recommended that all midtrimester abortions be performed in a hospital. As today's decision indicates, medical technology is changing, and this change will necessitate our continued functioning as the nation's ''ex officio medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.'' Just as improvements in medical technology inevitably will move forward the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health, different technological improvements will move backward the point of viability at which the state may proscribe abortions except when necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother. Scientific Gains Noted In 1973, viability before 28 weeks was considered unusual. However, recent studies have demonstrated increasingly earlier fetal viability. It is certainly reasonable to believe that fetal viability in the first trimester of pregnancy may be possible in the not too distant future. The Roe framework, then, is clearly on a collision course with itself. As the medical risks of various abortion procedures decrease, the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health is moved further forward to actual childbirth. As medical science becomes better able to provide for the separate existence of the fetus, the point of viability is moved further back toward conception. Moreover, it is clear that the trimester approach violates the fundamental aspiration of judicial decision-making through the application of neutral principles ''sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout the community and continuity over significant periods of time ....'' The state interest in potential human life is extant throughout pregnancy. In Roe, the Court held that although the State had an important and legitimate interest in protecting potential life, that interest could not become compelling until the point at which the fetus was viable. The difficulty with this analysis is clear: potential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward. At any stage in pregnancy, there is the potential for human life. The choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward. Accordingly, I believe that the state's interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy. We must always be mindful that ''the Constitution does not compel a state to fine-tune its statutes so as to encourage or facilitate abortions. To the contrary, state action 'encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances' is 'rationally related to the legitimate government objective of protecting potential life.' '' The hospitalization requirement does not imose an undue burden, and it is not necessary to apply an exacting standard of review. Further, the regulation has a ''rational relation'' to a valid state objective of insuring the health and welfare of its citizens. The state's compelling interests in maternal physical and mental health and protection of fetal life clearly justify the waiting period. As we acknowledged in Danforth, the decision to abort is ''a stressful one,'' and the waiting period reasonably relates to the state's interest in insuring that a woman does not make this serious decision in undue haste. The decision also has grave consequences for the fetus, whose life the state has a compelling interest to protect and preserve. ''No other (medical) procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.'' The waiting period is surely a small cost to impose to insure that the woman's decision is well-considered in light of its certain and irreparable consequences on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Congressional testimony, Mr. Shultz said Washington remained concerned about Moscow's military buildup, its ''unconstructive involvement'' in unstable areas of the world and its ''unrelenting effort'' to impose its philosophy on its allies. But he said the Administration sought ''to engage the Soviet leaders in a constructive dialogue.'' (Page A1, Column 6.)

"COURT REAFFIRMS RIGHT TO ABORTION AND BARS VARIETY OF LOCAL CURBS; Excerpts from Akron case, page B10.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/court-reaffirms-right-abortion-bars-variety-local-curbs-excerpts-akron-case-page.html,"The Supreme Court today forcefully reaffirmed the constitutional right to obtain an abortion and struck down an array of local legislative restrictions on access to abortions. In the most sweeping of three decisions, the Court declared unconstitutional an Akron, Ohio, ordinance that placed a number of obstacles in the path of access to abortion. The provisions struck down by the 6-to-3 ruling included a 24-hour waiting period, a requirement that all abortions after the first three months of pregnancy be performed in hospitals and a highly detailed ''informed consent'' provision that required a doctor to tell a woman seeking an abortion that the fetus ''is a human life from the moment of conception'' and that abortion can have dire physical and emotional consequences. ''It is fair to say,'' Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote for the Court, ''that much of the information required is designed not to inform the woman's consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether,'' a motive that he said was forbidden by the Court's earlier abortion rulings. The decisions had considerable practical and symbolic importance. Twenty-one states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, limit second-trimester abortions to hospitals. Those restrictions are now invalid. The rulings were hailed as major victories by all the principal organizations advocating free choice on abortion. A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision on the Akron law as ''an enormous victory for women's rights,'' but a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee said the Court had ''defended the interests not of women but of the assembly-line abortion industry.'' (Page B11.) Dissent by Justice O'Connor The Akron City Council enacted the ordinance in 1978 and intended it to be a national model for regulating abortions. The Reagan Administration argued before the Supreme Court in support of the ordinance, urging the Justices to adopt a ''deferential standard'' in reviewing legislators' decisions to restrict access to abortion. The majority opinion in the Akron case was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens. Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Con- Excerpts from Akron case, page B10. By LINDA GREENHOUSE Special to the New York Times nor wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Associate Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist. Justice O'Connor said the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the fetus's health through the entire pregnancy. The decision was the first indication of Justice O'Connor's views on abortion since she joined the Court in October 1981, and her position came as something of a surprise. She had supported free choice on abortion in her early years in Arizona politics, a position she had never completely disavowed, and President Reagan was criticized by antiabortion groups for naming to the Supreme Court someone who was not an implacable opponent of abortion. 10 Years Since Roe v. Wade The decisions came 10 years and several months after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by the Constitution included the right to decide to have an abortion. While the question of whether to overrule Roe v. Wade was technically not before the Court, the Reagan Administration's participation as well as the continuing debate in Congress over whether to amend the Constitution to restrict abortion created a charged atmosphere, insuring that the decisions would have an impact beyond the confines of the specific questions the cases presented. In his opinion, Justice Powell obliquely acknowledged the atmosphere surrounding the cases and went out of his way to emphasize that the Court intended to stand by the 1973 decision and had no plans to overrule it. Since Roe v. Wade, he said, ''The Court repeatedly and consistently has accepted and applied the basic principle that a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.'' ''Arguments continue to be made,'' he said, ''that we erred in interpreting the Constitution. Nonetheless, the doctrine of stare decisis, while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question, is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law. We respect it today, and reaffirm Roe v. Wade.'' Stare decisis is a judicial doctrine under which courts consider themselves bound by precedent. Janet Benshoof, director of the reproductive freedom project of the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the constitutional challenge to the Akron ordinance, said the decision was ''the most far-reaching victory on reproductive rights since Roe v. Wade.'' That view was echoed by leaders of the National Abortion Rights Action League, Planned Parenthood and other groups. Not All Curbs Struck Down The Court did not strike down every abortion restriction presented by today's cases. A second decision involved a Missouri law regulating abortion. While invalidating Missouri's second-trimester hospitalization requirement by the same 6-to-3 vote, the Court voted, 5 to 4, to uphold three other sections of that law. These require a pathologist's analysis of tissue removed in clinic abortions; a second physician's assistance at third-trimester abortions, which are typically serious medical emergencies, to protect the interests of a possibly viable fetus, and parental or judicial consent before an abortion may be performed on a teen-age girl who is not considered ''emancipated'' or mature enough to make her own decision. The parental consent ruling appeared essentially to restate a 1979 Supreme Court decision on a similar requirement in Massachusetts. While upholding the Missouri approach, which strictly limits the right of the judge to withhold consent, the Court today struck down the parental consent portion of the Akron ordinance, finding that it did not adequately protect the right of mature minors to make their own decisions. Justice Powell also wrote the Missouri decision. Only Chief Justice Burger signed his opinion on the three disputed sections, but Justices O'Connor, Rehnquist and White agreed with the result in a separate opinion. Doctor's Conviction Affirmed In the third decision today, the Court affirmed the criminal conviction of a Virginia obstetrician for performing a secondtrimester abortion in a clinic that was not licensed for that purpose. In an 8-to-1 decision by Justice Powell, the Court rejected the doctor's challenge to Virginia's hospitalization requirement, concluding that Virginia, unlike Akron and Missouri, properly permitted second-trimester abortions in adequately equipped clinics. Central to the decision striking down the Akron and Missouri hospitalization requirements were data presented to the Court by medical groups, principally the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The data showed that new techniques had made secondtrimester abortions much safer than they were in 1973, when the Court suggested in Roe v. Wade that states could limit abortions to hospitals after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The college changed its own guidelines last year to endorse outpatient abortions up to the 18th week of pregnancy. Justice Powell said he found this evidence ''impressive'' and concluded that the hospital requirement, which typically doubles the cost of the procedure, ''imposed a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible and safe abortion procedure.'' Woman's Health Is Key The opinion, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health (No. 81-746), reaffirmed the holding of Roe v. Wade that the state's only legitimate purpose for regulating abortion in the second trimester was to protect the pregnant woman's health. It was this approach to which Justice O'Connor objected in her dissenting opinion. The state's interest in protecting the fetus, which Roe v. Wade held to be appropriate only after the fetus is viable, ''exists throughout the pregnancy,'' she said, adding: ''Potential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward.'' Justice Powell responded in a footnote to his majority opinion, writing that ''the dissenting opinion rejects the basic premise of Roe.'' ''The effect of the dissent's views would be to drive the performance of many abortions back underground,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRESBYTERIANS SUPPORT PRELATES' ARMS LETTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/presbyterians-support-prelates-arms-letter.html,"The highest policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has voted to send each of its 13,000 congregations a copy of the United States Roman Catholic bishops' pastoral letter on nuclear war. The church's General Assembly, which ended its annual meeting in Atlanta yesterday, urged members to consider the letter ''of great historical, theological and educational significance.'' In the action, described by officials of the conference as a virtual endorsement of the views expressed in the bishops' letter, the Presbyterian convention noted that it was not in agreement with the letter's comments opposing abortion. The nearly 1,000 delegates from congregations of the 3.2-millionmember church also endorsed the idea of an American-Soviet freeze on nuclear weapons and asked for a ''delay'' in the deployment of any new nuclear weapons. The resolution on the bishops' letter and the nuclear freeze received overwhelming approval from the delegates in a standing vote. On Tuesday the convention adopted a resolution that said abortion could be considered a ''responsible choice within a Christian ethical framework.'' However, the resolution said Presbyterians might have varied opinions on abortion and asked the church to work to minimize abortion. The statement, which parallels views expressed at other assemblies by North American Presbyterians, was approved by a vote of 800 to 100 as the newly formed Presbyterian denomination conducted its first business sessions after merging the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. with the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. The statement on abortion said the operation could be a responsible choice ''when serious genetic problems arise or when the resources are not adequate to care for a child appropriately.'' In other action, the church said it would emphasize evangelism as a ''necessary, urgent and major priority.'' Membership in Presbyterian churches has been declining, although the loss has slowed in recent years. The Rev. Robert Meneilly of Prairie Village, Kan., called for goals of a million more active Presbyterians in the next five years. A special presbytery, or regional unit of the church, will be formed for Koreans in Hawaii and southern California under convention action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION HAILS RULING AS WOMEN'S RIGHTS VICTORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/civil-liberties-union-hails-ruling-as-women-s-rights-victory.html,"Lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union who specialize in cases involving free choice on abortion yesterday hailed the Supreme Court ruling on the Akron, Ohio, law and said they expected it to lead to nullification of laws limiting women's choice in many other states. ''This is an enormous victory for women's rights,'' said Suzanne Lynn, one of the organization's lawyers who prepared arguments for the Court in behalf of three abortion clinics that opposed the Akron law. Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee in Washington, the leading anti-abortion organization, agreed that the Akron case was the most significant of the rulings and that it would likely lead to the nullification of state laws that delay or restrict access to abortions. But in contrast to the civil liberties group, Mr. Johnson said, ''We think the Court defended the interests not of women, but of the assembly-line abortion industry.'' Hatch Argues for Debate Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is sponsoring a constitutional amendment to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, said the decisions were ''a tremendous disappointment to the right to life movement.'' He said the rulings underscored the importance of Senate debate on his proposed amendment. ''I don't have a lot of confidence that the Senate with its present makeup will pass this constitutional amendment,'' he said, ''but I think it is important to have it debated.'' In Akron, Ray Kapper, president of the City Council, which enacted the law in 1978, said he believed the Supreme Court was ''not in tune with what's going on in life.'' But he said he thought the city would accept what it regarded as a defeat and not try to enact another antiabortion ordinance. On the matter of parental consent for minors' abortions, required under the ordinance, Mr. Kapper said, ''I still maintain that in this state, a girl 11 to 15 years old is not mature enough to make decisions on matters such as this.'' Halt to Legislation Seen Miss Lynn, who said the civil liberties union operated the only unit devoted exclusively to nationwide litigation on abortion rights, said she believed the Court's rulings would ''put a virtual stop'' to the passage of state and city laws restricting women's access to abortions. But she said she expected opponents of abortion to renew their drive for a constitutional amendment to outlaw the procedure. Mr. Johnson said his organization was ''certainly going to pursue a constitutional amendment.'' ''But,'' he added, ''we also hope the President will take note of the extremism of the Supreme Court and will keep it in mind when there are future openings on the court.'' Lawyers at the civil liberties union characterized the decisions as a defeat for the Reagan Administration. But Solicitor General Rex E. Lee, who argued the case for the Administration, said the result was neither ''a major victory,'' nor ''a major defeat'' for either side in the national debate. ''If you look at it from the standpoint of individual issues,'' Mr. Lee said, ''we won some and we lost some.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary; FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/nyregion/news-summary-friday-june-17-1983.html,"International The Pope went home and allied himself at once with the victims of the martial law restrictions imposed in Poland 18 months ago. John Paul II confronted the nation's political troubles with unusually tough, direct references, both in his arrival at Warsaw's airport and a homily in St. John's Cathedral, which rang with applause. (Page A1, Column 6.) The Pope's return to Poland is considered the most personal of his 18 foreign journeys. Polish priests at the Vatican said John Paul II had an acute sense of personal responsibility for the joyous and tragic events that have swept Poland since his first visit there as Pope in 1979. (A9:1-4.) Yuri V. Andropov secured his power as the Soviet leader by adding the post of head of state to his position as general secretary of the Communist Party. The new post is largely titular, but when combined with the party leadership it assumes symbolic importance. In seven months, Mr. Andropov has assumed the three posts previously held by Leonid I. Brezhnev. But the frail Mr. Andropov walked with an uneasy gait at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet. (A1:3-5.) National A withholding tax on interest and dividends would be repealed under legislation approved in the Senate by a vote of 86 to 4. The 1982 tax law requires financial institutions to withhold 10 percent of payments to most customers beginning July 1. The new legislation includes provisions intended to require fuller reporting of unearned income and three unrelated provisions intended to discourage a veto by President Reagan. (A1:2.) Senators would get a pay increase of 15 percent and continue to earn unlimited income from speeches and articles until next January, under a bill approved in the Senate by a 49-to-47 vote. The Senators' annual salaries would increase to $69,800, the same amount now received by members of the House. (A1:1-2.) Payments to Japanese-Americans who were forced from their West Coast homes and held in detention camps in World War II were recommended by a Federal study commission. The panel, established by Congress in 1980, recommended that the Government pay $20,000 to each of the 60,000 survivors and other forms of compensation totaling $1.5 billion as ''an act of national apology'' for a ''grave injustice.'' (A1:2-4.) The President and a student debated the arms race indirectly. In a private 20-minute meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Reagan emphasized the lessons of the past, while the student, 17-year-old Ariela Gross from Princeton, N.J., expressed concern about the fragility of the future. (A10:1-2.) The President deplored the rulings by the Supreme Court Wednesday reaffirming the constitutional right to abortion. Mr. Reagan, in a statement issued at the White House, called on Congress to enact legislation to overrule the court. (A16:3-4.) Launching crews began the countdown for the second mission of the space shuttle Challenger, which will be carrying two communications satellites, a score of scientific experiments, a colony of carpenter ants and the first American woman to be lofted into space. Liftoff for the planned six-day mission is scheduled for Saturday morning. (A28:1-4.) Fear of the disease known as AIDS among homosexuals and about homosexuals has spread around the nation in the last several months faster than the disease itself.

The Court Draws the Line,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/opinion/the-court-draws-the-line.html,"In forthright terms, the Supreme Court has now turned back a sneak attack on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that declared a woman's right to decide whether to give birth to an unwanted child. Rather than challenge that basic right directly, anti-abortion forces asked only that the Court approve a few rules, like: - Forcing women to have second-trimester operations in hospitals, where the costs average twice as high as in competently run clinics. - Forcing all teen-agers, regardless of maturity or family circumstances, to seek parental consent for abortions. - Forcing all women to wait an extra 24 hours after requesting an abortion, whatever the added cost or hardship. - Forcing doctors, under threat of criminal prosecution, to tell each patient that the fetus ''is a human life from the moment of conception'' and that the operation is ''a major surgical procedure'' fraught with danger. The city of Akron and the State of Missouri defended these ''housekeeping'' rules, and three Justices voted to uphold them. But Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the majority, recognized that approving them could imperil the abortion right itself. Justice Powell's realism was more than a match for the icy indifference of Justice Sandra O'Connor's dissent. She saw nothing wrong with requiring hospitalization for even the earliest abortions. But that, Justice Powell replied, would ''drive the performance of many abortions back underground free of effective regulation and often without the attendance of a physician.'' A 24-hour ''cooling-off'' period may seem reasonable but the majority realized, as Justice O'Connor would not, its devastating effect on poor women who can't afford the time or the travel to return for the operation. And forcing doctors to utter state-composed theories of when human life begins would demean their profession and accomplish indirectly what the state may not do directly: talk the woman out of exercising her right in the guise of encouraging ''informed consent.'' The dissent's sharpest argument was against the Court's sanction for accepted medical practice and improved technical skills that now make it unreasonable to outlaw clinical abortions in the middle three months of pregnancy. The majority merely recognized reality. Justices O'Connor, Rehnquist and White lamented the Court's attempt to draw such lines for privacy and personal liberty, contending that the same legislatures that draw up these oppressive regulations are in the best position to decide how to regulate abortion. The majority, fortunately, understand that drawing the lines they did is basic to the Court's - and the law's - self-respect: thus far, and no farther, will it give ground on fundamental rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN URGES CONGRESS TO NULLIFY SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION RULINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/us/reagan-urges-congress-to-nullify-supreme-court-s-abortion-rulings.html,"President Reagan, in an unusual comment on a Supreme Court decision, expressed ''profound disappointment'' today at the Court's reaffirmation of the constitutional right to abortion. In a statement issued at the White House, the President called on Congress to ''make its voice heard'' and pass legislation to overrule the Court, which on Wednesday struck down several legislative restrictions on access to abortions. ''Our society is confronted with a great moral issue, the taking of the life of an unborn child,'' Mr. Reagan declared in the printed statement. ''Accordingly, I join millions of Americans expressing profound disappointment at the decisions announced by the Supreme Court in striking down several efforts by states and localities to control the circumstances under which abortion may be performed.'' The President's view was echoed by such Roman Catholic leaders as Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York, who said that ''one of our most basic institutions'' had dealt a ''lethal blow'' to human values. Denouncing the ''manipulation by so many mothers to destroy unborn life,'' the Cardinal issued an appeal for a constitutional amendment to overrule the Court. Battle in Senate Expected Organizations supporting the Court's decisions said that while the ruling limited the possibilities for legislative restrictions on abortion, the controversy was far from over. The next skirmish is expected to occur later this month when the Senate debates an antiabortion proposal. The measure, a constitutional amendment, reads in its entirety: ''A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution.'' Several other proposals to restrict abortions are pending in Congress. While the President issued the strong statement today, White House officials said there was no plan on the Administration's part to try to resolve the differences among anti-abortion groups over the varying proposals. The President mentioned the issue only briefly when he spoke at a fund-raising event tonight for Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has championed anti-abortion proposals. In speaking at the Sheraton Washington the President referred to the Senator's yearning for ''two blessed days.'' These, he said, are ''the day when we welcome the Lord back into the classroom, and the day when we protect the life of the unborn.'' Termed a Legislative Question ''The issue of abortion must be resolved by democratic process,'' Mr. Reagan declared in his White House statement. He favorably cited the dissent from the 6-to-3 ruling by his appointee, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in which she contended that the legislature is the appropriate forum for regulation of abortion. In issuing the President's statement, a White House official responded to questions by saying that ''of course'' the Administration intended to enforce the law as defined by the Court, while also seeking its reversal. ''Once again,'' the President said, ''I call on the Congress to make its voice heard against abortion on demand and to restore legal protections for the unborn whether by statute or constitutional amendment.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STATES ARE CHANGING THE ABORTION RULES VOIDED BY TOP COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/18/nyregion/states-are-changing-the-abortion-rules-voided-by-top-court.html,"The State Health Departments of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut reported yesterday they were preparing to revise their regulations to comply with the United States Supreme Court's decision allowing abortions after the first three months of pregnancy to be performed in clinics. The court's decision on Tuesday invalidated health regulations in the three states, along with similar regulations in 18 others, that required that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy - or from the 12th to the 20th week of pregnancy - be performed in hospitals. Hospital abortions in the final trimester of pregnancy, or after 20 weeks, are rarely performed, and then only when the life of the mother is threatened. At least one abortion clinic, the Eastern Women's Center at 14 East 60th Street in Manhattan, said it would begin to offer secondtrimester abortions immediately. However, other clinics are not expected to perform them until their staffs have been retrained. 'Make Abortions Much Safer' According to Alfred E. Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York, the court's ruling will ''make abortions much safer and less expensive'' by allowing first-trimester abortion techniques used in clinics to be used in second-trimester procedures. Mr. Moran said the prevailing procedure in hospitals was to induce delivery of the aborted fetus by injecting a saline solution. He said clinical experience showed that abortions employing dilatation and evacuation techniques were more appropriate in most cases. Mr. Moran also said the court's ruling eliminates regulations that require first- and second-trimester abortions to be performed in different health facilities. Dr. Thomas Kerenyi, medical director of the Eastern Women's Center, said, ''Improved medical techniques, associated with low risk factors, allow physicians to safely terminate most late pregnancies by dilatation and evacuation.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HIGH COURT CLEARS UP ANY DOUBTS ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/weekinreview/high-court-clears-up-any-doubts-on-abortion.html,"A key part of the antiabortion movement's strategy during the past few years has been to ''send the Supreme Court a message.'' According to this scenario, continual efforts to amend the Constitution and to strip the Court of its jurisdiction to decide abortion cases would keep the pressure on Justices who have grown increasingly weary and conservative, eventually persuading them to reconsider their 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Last week, the movement got the reconsideration it sought. It was the Supreme Court, however, that sent a message. The 6-to-3 decision did more than strike down a potpourri of local restrictions on access to abortion. The Justices could have declared the Akron, Ohio abortion regulations unconstitutional while still leaving in doubt the strength of their commitment to the decade-old principles of Roe v. Wade, which established that the fundamental constitutional right to privacy includes the right to have an abortion. Instead, the Court reached beyond the Akron case, using the decision as a vehicle to make a very deliberate, very forceful point. We meant it, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote for the majority, when in 1973 we said ''a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.'' We did not decide Roe v. Wade casually, it was not an aberration, and we do not apologize for it. We have reaffirmed it ''repeatedly and consistently.'' In a ''society governed by the rule of law,'' we stand by our precedents. Once stated, the result seems obvious; in a dozen abortion rulings since 1973, as the political climate grew ever more fervid, the Court had not turned away from the principles of Roe v. Wade. The decision was a legal embarrassment for the Reagan Administration. The Federal Government had not participated in the lower courts in either the Akron case or a companion case from Missouri, neither of which implicated any Federal program or other legal interest. Nonetheless, Solicitor General Rex E. Lee filed a brief urging the Justices to use these appeals to create a new rule that judges should abandon strict constitutional scrutiny in reviewing abortion cases and should instead ''accord heavy deference'' to the preferences of legislators. The alternative, Mr. Lee warned the Justices during the argument last November, is ''having these cases come back year after year after year, with the list of applicable Federal constitutional rules becoming longer and longer and longer.'' The Court declined the invitation, with even Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor indicating in a footnote to her dissenting opinion that the Administration had overstated its case. As it turned out, the majority might have hit on the best weapon against the specter of endless litigation raised by the Solicitor General - a reaffirmation forceful enough to persuade people that further efforts to change the rules will be futile. Indeed, the legacy of last week's ruling may be to defuse abortion as a political issue. That was not its immediate result, of course. Antiabortion spokesmen vowed to keep up the fight. Congressional supporters of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion said they would bring it to the floor this week. President Reagan expressed his ''profound disappointment'' at the decision, calling on Congress to ''make its voice heard against abortion on demand.'' A Mainstream Principle Nonetheless, in ways that may take time to manifest themselves fully, the decision changed the framework of the abortion debate. It subtly shifted the burden of battle. Until last week, the burden was on pro-choice advocates who were fighting to preserve the status quo. There was always the argument that the Supreme Court in 1973 had not fully understood the implications of what it was doing, that Roe v. Wade would wash away like a sand castle under the relentless waves of hostile opinion. Last week, when six men, whose average age is 73 and who have a decade of reflection behind them, reaffirmed their initial stand, the constitutional right to abortion became the status quo as it had not been before. The Court indeed proved ''conservative,'' but in the dictionary's literal definition of ''preservative; disposed to maintain existing institutions.'' With the decision, the right to abortion - exercised last year by 1.2 million American women - entered the mainstream, and the burden shifted to the other side to show why it should not remain there. Another effect was to illuminate the views of the newest Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor. For the first time in nearly two full terms on the Court, Justice O'Connor, who remained ambiguous on the subject during her confirmation hearings, was forced to declare herself on the abortion question. She vindicated President Reagan, who endured heavy right-wing criticism two years ago for naming to the Court someone without strong antiabortion credentials. The President last week singled out for special praise Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion. Her dissent, filled with references to fetal life and potential life, said the Court should reject the theoretical basis of Roe v. Wade and relax its standard of review in abortion cases. She was joined by Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist, the two Justices who dissented in Roe v. Wade and who have remained unreconciled to that decision. Justice O'Connor's arrival on the Court increases the antiabortion core to three. In theory, President Reagan could be lucky enough to increase it to five. But he runs the risk that a Supreme Court nominee conservative enough to meet his other criteria might turn out to be a conservative who, like Justice Powell or Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, believes that adherence to precedent ''demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOUR NEW GOVERNORS STRIVE TO MASTER THE POLITICS OF DECLINE; LINCOLN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/weekinreview/four-new-governors-strive-to-master-the-politics-of-decline-lincoln.html,"THE last four years have been hard on governors, whether liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican. With rare exceptions their work has been circumscribed by rising deficits and decreasing services and by an electorate that is snappish about any suggestion of new taxes. Voters in economically depressed farm and industrial states of the Middle West have been throwing out incumbents and trying something new. There are some in Nebraska who believe this conservative but populist state may have gone too far last November in turning out the stolid Republican Charles Thone, who fit the traditional mold for Corn Belt political leaders, and taking on an unconventional Vietnam veteran making his first run at state-wide politics by expressing some unconventional ideas. The traditionalists have had six months to push Gov. Bob Kerry about. At times, observers here say, he seems a little dazed. But there are signs he is settling into the only kind of leadership role that seems to work in the current climate. First, he has bowed to the notion that Democratic governors in Nebraska have to adopt a conservative stance. He has pushed through some marginal tax increases to help offset the persistent deficit dominating politics. ''I believe we should view this fiscal situation,'' he said, ''not so much as an overwhelming or overriding preoccupation, but a golden opportunity to streamline and strengthen state government.'' That is the usual approach of governors facing sizable deficits and strong resistance to new taxes. But having taken that position, he has gone on to lead people into new ways of thinking. Public opinion polls have shown that governors, whatever their powers from state to state, are the most visible public officials. Some state leaders, such as former Gov. Bob Ray of Iowa and Gov. William Winter of Mississippi have used this visibility to turn hard times into increased support for their programs, usually by convincing the public that they were personally concerned about unemployment and were using whatever innovations were available to improve the economy. But some, such as Al Quie of Minnesota, failed to master the politics of decline. Mr. Kerry seems to be seeking desperately to avoid that fate. His election last year was a major upset. An active demonstrator against the war in Vietnam who later prospered as a restaurant owner, he was able to move campaign debate off abortion, the death penalty and the state's right-to-work law and on to the economy, attacking the Governor for insisting there was little he could do about unemployment and farm foreclosures. ''The Governor can't bring down interest rates,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''but I can make people mad about them.'' Stirring public reaction may have been Mr. Kerry's major achievement in his first six months in office. His life style has increased his visibility. A film crew has been shooting a movie in Lincoln, to be called ''Terms of Endearment.'' It stars Jack Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger. If that were not enough to attract attention, Mr. Kerry had a weekend date with Miss Winger, who won acclaim for her role in ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' He turns back suggestions of being another Jerry Brown of California by saying, ''I'm a fiscally conservative businessman.'' One recent evening after a day of tussling with Nebraska's conservative unicameral Legislature, Mr. Kerry settled behind his desk and talked about innovations he was undertaking that would require wide public support: reform of the education system, a venture capital program for attracting new industries and reordering of job training and health care services. At the heart of his plans are continuing efforts to educate his constituents on the need for government action. ''A businessman came to me to complain about taxes,'' he said. ''I said, 'Look, you are in the top income bracket. If you were smart you must have taken advantage of every tax shelter there is. The trouble is everyone wants the government benefits cut for others but not for themselves.'

TOPICS; FRIVOLOUS ACTIVITIES; Supreme Waste of Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/opinion/topics-frivolous-activities-supreme-waste-of-time.html,"The Supreme Court, which complains it's so overworked that it needs a new court to lighten the load, has decided to give itself still more work. The justices will now vote on which pleadings are frivolous and award damages to the other side. The decision creates a whole new body of jurisprudence and a new market for lawyers. Last week alone, the Court voted 5 to 3 for damages in one case, 7 to 2 against in another case and 6 to 3 against in two more. All this over filings that justices used to glance at for two seconds and discard. So far only litigious individuals are vulnerable, but governments may not long be immune. And what about the Justice Department? Is Rex Lee, the Solicitor General, to go scot free after filing a brief about abortion that got no votes even on a divided Court? And how about the Supreme Court itself? Shouldn't someone pay when, after searching for a loophole in the exclusionary rule, it concluded ''with apologies to all'' that it had picked the wrong case?

AROUND THE NATION; Civil Liberties Leader Assails Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/20/us/around-the-nation-civil-liberties-leader-assails-administration.html,"Violating the Bill of Rights appears to be ''the primary goal'' of the Reagan Administration, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Ira Glasser, said today. ''We continue to face major threats across a broad range of civil liberties issues,'' Mr. Glasser told more than 300 delegates at the opening of the organization's biennial conference. He said that in the first two years of the Administration, the A.C.L.U. won almost every ''major issue'' involving civil liberties before Congress and in state and local legislative bodies -school prayer, a woman's right to an abortion and proposals to limit Federal court jurisdiction over liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. ''Still, for all of those victories, by the end of 1982 there were still some dark clouds ahead,'' he said. ''Although we had won all those victories in Congress, each one of them had been eroded by executive action from the Administration itself.'' As examples, Mr. Glasser cited reductions in funds for the Legal Services Corporation, which provides lawyers for poor people; support of the abortion restrictions that were struck down last week by the Supreme Court, and attempts to limit political activity by publicly financed organizations. A White House spokesman, Sheila Dixon, said the White House had no comment on Mr. Glasser's remarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUSTICES UPHOLD 'CANINE SNIFF' OF LUGGAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/us/justices-uphold-canine-sniff-of-luggage.html,"The Supreme Court ruled today that the police may expose a traveler's luggage to a narcotics-detecting dog without violating the Constitution, but the luggage may be held for only a brief period. A ''canine sniff,'' the Court said in an opinion by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, is by itself not a ''search'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure. But the Court said the removal of the luggage from its owner is an ''investigatory detention'' subject to constitutional limitations. The Justices agreed unanimously that Federal narcotics agents violated a traveler's constitutional rights when they held his suitcase at Kennedy International Airport for 90 minutes. Three of the Justices said, however, that it was unnecessary for the Court to address the question of the canine sniff. 2d Circuit Ruling Affirmed The decision affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. That court ruled in 1981 that the detention of the luggage violated the Constitution because the Federal agents did not have ''probable cause'' to believe that it contained narcotics. The Justice Department appealed, seeking an endorsement by the Supreme Court of an investigatory practice that has created considerable confusion in Federal courts around the country. The decision was a disappointment to the department. While the Court agreed that probable cause was not required in order to detain the luggage, the limits that the Justices put on the procedure left its usefulness in doubt. Wider Application Possible The fact that the case involved a narcotics-sniffing dog was incidental to the Court's ruling. The Court analyzed the case in terms that would apply equally to the temporary detention of luggage for other purposes. The holding today applies only to domestic police investigations and not to Customs searches. The Supreme Court has long held that the Fourth Amendment places no limits on searches by Customs agents at the border. The defendant in the case, Raymond J. Place, was intercepted after a flight from Miami to La Guardia Airport. Because there are no trained dogs at La Guardia, the Federal agents had to take the luggage to Kennedy. A dog there responded to one of the bags, which proved to contain cocaine. In Effect a Seizure The Federal agents took Mr. Place's luggage from him after he refused to allow them to search it. In Fourth Amendment terms, the luggage was ''seized.'' Justice O'Connor said that this ''seizure'' should be analyzed exactly as the Court has analyzed temporary detentions of people. The Court ruled in 1968, in a landmark decision called Terry v. Ohio, that police officers who ''reasonably suspect'' illegal activity can briefly detain a person on less than probable cause. The Court has never defined precisely how brief such encounters, known as ''Terry stops,'' must be, but it is clear that they are measured in minutes and not hours. The Justice Department had argued that while a prolonged detention of a person would violate the Constitution, a similar detention of property can be reasonable. The Court disagreed. A seizure of luggage is likely to disrupt a traveler's plans and ''can effectively restrain the person,'' Justice O'Connor said, adding: ''The limitations applicable to investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible scope of an investigative detention of the person's luggage.'' Making of Rule Declined The Court said it would refrain from putting ''a rigid time limitation'' on a ''Terry stop,'' concluding only that 90 minutes was unreasonable in this case. The ''canine sniff'' itself, Justice O'Connor said, ''is much less intrusive than a typical search'' and requires no previous suspicion of wrongdoing. It was that portion of the opinion, U.S. v. Place, No. 81-1617, that drew protests from Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, and Harry A. Blackmun. They said that because the Court agreed that the ''seizure'' was unconstitutional, there was no need to discuss the validity of the ''sniff'' that followed. Other action at the Court today included the following: Police Search The Court ruled unanimously that the police do not need a warrant to search the personal effects of someone who has been arrested and brought to the station house. The decision, by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, overturned a ruling by an Illinois court that the police were not entitled to search a shoulder bag brought to the station house by a man they had arrested for disturbing the peace. The bag contained drugs. An ''inventory search'' of the property of a person under lawful arrest ''is an entirely reasonable administrative procedure,'' the Chief Justice said. (Ill. v. Lafayette, No. 81-1859). Standing to Sue As a delayed second chapter to its ruling last month on tax exemptions for discriminatory private schools, the Court agreed to decide who has ''standing'' - the right to bring a lawsuit - to challenge the Internal Revenue Service's administration of the law. The case (Regan v. Wright, No. 81-970) is in one respect the other side of the coin of the ruling last month that the I.R.S. is barred from granting the exemptions. While Bob Jones University sued the I.R.S. for refusing to grant a tax exemption, the new case began as a lawsuit by black parents who charged that the service granted exemptions to private schools that were, in fact, discriminating. The United States Court of Appeals here permitted the suit to proceed. The Government is arguing that private citizens do not have standing to challenge the treatment of a third party's tax status. Libel Suit The Court refused to hear an appeal by Kimerli Jayne Pring, a former Miss Wyoming, who sued Penthouse magazine for libel and won a $12.5 million judgment that was overturned by a Federal appeals court. She sued over a story about a fictional Miss Wyoming that she said was identifiably based on her own life. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the story would have been recognized as fiction by ''even the most careless reader.'' In their Supreme Court appeal (Pring v. Penthouse, No. 82-1621), her lawyers argued that publishers should not be able to escape liability by including a fictional passage in an article that could otherwise be taken for a factual account. Abortion Limits The Court refused to hear an appeal by the City of Virginia, Minn., from a ruling that it could not prohibit staff physicians from performing abortions at the city's public hospital. The hospital is the only one in the small community, and the United States Court of Appeals ruled that, while the city was not required to subsidize abortions for poor women, it could not forbid the use of its facilities altogether. Associate Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist voted to hear the appeal (Virginia v. Nyberg, No. 81-1782). The Court also refused to hear an appeal by a group of students at the University of California who sued to stop the university from using compulsory student health fees to provide abortions to students. The students argued that the policy violated their rights to the free exercise of their religion. The California state courts dismissed the suit. (Erzinger v.

The proposal, supported by a 15-to-1 vote, would replace the current general warning with a specific one saying, ''Warning: Cigarette Smoking Causes Cancer, Emphysema And Heart Disease; May Complicate Pregnancy And Is Addictive.'' Although the bill has no provision for the warning to accompany cigarette advertising, Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, is expected to offer an amendment requiring the warning in advertising when the measure is considered by the full Senate. The committee's strong endorsement, especially by its more conservative members, and signs of the tobacco industry's willingness to compromise indicate that some legislative changes involving the cigarette warning label may pass the Senate this year. The House is also considering ways to strengthen warnings to cigarette smokers. Representative Henry A. Waxman, the sponsor of the House version of bill, said today he was ''very pleased'' that the Senate panel had endorsed a strong label. But the California Democrat said he still preferred his bill's requirement that cigarette packages and advertising carry one of a series of specific health warnings, which would be rotated every few months. Each warning would focus on a single cigarette-related problem, including birth defects, spontaneous abortions and death from heart disease, cancer and emphysema. The Senate committee dropped similar provisions for rotational warnings from its bill today in an effort to gain support for the single, strongly worded warning. The Senate legislation was introduced by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. A health warning has been on cigarette packages and advertising since 1966. In 1970, Congress strengthened the warning, which said cigarette smoking ''May be Hazardous to Your Health,'' to the current one stating, ''Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.'' The proposed legislation calls for no change in the size of the warning label, which is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The current warning consists of four lines that have a total depth of about half an inch. Regulators expect the type size and dimensions of the new warning to be roughly the same as the existing one, if the proposal is approved by Congress. The Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group, issued a statement saying that it was ''severely disappointed with the bill'' and that ''the existing warning is quite adequate and is serving its intended purpose.'' Although it opposes the bill, the institute has recently shown interest in negotiating a compromise. On Tuesday the institute said it would agree to a warning slightly stronger than the current one on the condition that the panel delete sections of the bill that incriminate cigarette smoking as a principal cause of cancer and other diseases. Panel Rejects Industry Offer But the committee rejected the industry's offer today and approved the stronger warning as an amendment to the bill, which states, ''Cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of illness and premature death in the United States.'' This statement and other medical references in the bill closely follow findings in reports issued by the Surgeon General of the United States. The institute maintains that while there is a ''statistical association'' between smoking and disease, there is no proof that cigarettes are a direct cause of disease. The industry is concerned that if the Senate panel's proposed language is incorporated in law it might increase the industry's exposure to lawsuits involving product liability, according to Senator John P. East, Republican of North Carolina. Mr. East cast the sole vote against the Senate proposal today. He said the legislation was ''punitive and overregulatory'' and that the warning ''goes well beyond what the scientific findings can bear.'' Senator Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana, indicated that he had reservations about the bill by voting ''present.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRIDGING CONSTITUENCIES ON A TIGHTROPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/weekinreview/bridging-constituencies-on-a-tightrope.html,"As a former local official, Alfonse M. D'Amato knows that one way to please the politicians back home is to bring them to Washington. So last week the Senator led a delegation of New York State Republican county chairmen around town for a day of briefings on the Hill and at the White House. This sort of politicking three and a half years before he must face the voters is hardly considered typical senatorial behavior. But Mr. D'Amato, who ran on the Republican and Conservative lines and won with only 45.1 percent of the vote in a three-way race in 1980, is determined not to follow the path of Senator James Buckley, which led directly out of office. Mr Buckley, running as a Conservative, also won a three-way race in 1970, then remained true to the conservatives on fiscal and social issues and was easily defeated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976. Mr. D'Amato, in contrast, is attempting to satisfy the needs of New York City and the state's other urban areas and at the same time keep from alienating his ideological base, which included the Right-to-Life Party line in 1980, a designation he has said he will seek again. So far, he has managed to stay on his tightrope. Indeed, it has led him a long way from Hempstead Town, L.I., where he formerly was Presiding Supervisor. On fiscal items of local importance, Mr. D'Amato has usually sided with New York State against the White House. Last year, he voted to override President Reagan's veto of the supplemental spending bill, which contained $30 million of education funds for minority and poor students. He was one of four Republicans to favor $1 billion in school funds contained in an amendment put forth by Senator Robert T. Stafford, Republican of Vermont. He has also fought for housing subsidies and been a tenacious promoter of operating assistance for mass transit, winning praise from state and local officials. He thinks all this will accrue to his benefit in a statewide survey pollster Arthur Finkelstein is conducting to test the Senator's popularity. Preliminary soundings, Mr. D'Amato said, show a 67 percent approval rating. The conservatives are not unhappy, either. ''He hasn't forgotten us,'' says Serphan Maltese, executive director of the New York State Conservative Party, who is on Mr. D'Amato's judicial screening panel and who was invited to Washington along with the G.O.P. chairmen. ''Al is big on mass transit, but we're not necessarily opposed to it. He has voted right on the social issues of abortion, busing and law enforcement.'' During a cocktail party for his visitors, Mr. D'Amato took pains to note his indebtness to the conservatives. ''I'd love to have the freedom to vote like Senator Weicker,'' he said of the maverick Connecticut Republican with whom he has become quite friendly. ''But they'd kill me on the right.'' Another element in the D'Amato strategy is the conscientious courting of the Jewish constituency, from which he received minimal support in 1980. Immediately after his election, he sought advice from Mayor Koch and Richard Ravitch, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, on how to win over the Jewish community. His schedule these days includes speaking dates before at least half a dozen Jewish groups a month. His efforts thus far have resulted in some of the biggest contributors to his 1986 campaign. Unlike his predecessor, Jacob K. Javits, Mr. D'Amato lacks the platform of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he has used his seat on the Senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee to take the Administration to task for continuing aid to Syria. And from his seat on the United States commission that oversees adherence to the Helsinki human rights accords he has voiced concern about the rights of Soviet Jews. Last month, in an interview in The Long Island Jewish World, Mr. D'Amato accused Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger of ''fanning the flames of bigotry and hatred'' and taking out his ''personal displeasure against Israel'' by questioning Israeli troop behavior in Lebanon. ''I think he's been very good and very helpful,'' said Howard Squadron, president of the American Jewish Congress. ''He has made it his business to let the Jewish community know that even though they did not support him in the last election he wants to be helpful.'' Another element of the traditional New York State coalition, the black community, ignored Mr. D'Amato three years ago. Last month, the Senator attempted to build bridges by meeting with black leaders in Harlem. A member of the select committee on small business, he has promised to help small firms there obtain Federal contracts designated for minority businessmen. As a result of all this, Mr. D'Amato is viewed as something of a wildcard by the White House, and the Senator has not been notably successful in winning patronage. He told President Reagan's chief of staff, James A. Baker, that he would vote against the nomination of Kenneth L. Adelman as Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency unless the White House approved Mr. D'Amato's choice for Administrator of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, James Emery, former minority leader of the New York State Assembly. Mr. D'Amato eventually voted for Mr. Adelman and, as it turned out, Mr. Emery will probably get the Seaway job, but only because the White House's candidate failed an F.B.I. background check. The Senator is risking another danger as well. The pollster, Mr. Finkelstein, told the New York Republicans last week that the last time around Mr. D'Amato had the benefit of not having a record. ''He was successful in some measure,'' Mr. Finkelstein said, ''because he could be who he needed to be.'' Left unsaid was whether Mr. D'Amato will be equally successful trying to be all things to all people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION RULE TO BE CHANGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/nyregion/abortion-rule-to-be-changed.html,"ARECENT Supreme Court decision that struck down a number of state restrictions on access to abortion made Connecticut's regulation calling for hospitalization for all abortions to be performed after the first three months of pregnancy ''immediately unconstitutional and unenforceable,'' according to Elliot F. Gerson, Deputy State Attorney General. However, the regulation, as contained in the state's Public Health Code, will not be adjusted until the Court's opinion is ''thoroughly analyzed and digested,'' said Richard Lynch, a lawyer in charge of the health unit of the Attorney General's office. He said that any redrafting of the regulation would involve the Department of Health Services, which would then forward the regulation to the legislature's Regulations Review Committee. The matter would likely not require full General Assembly action, he said, because it is not a state statute. As of the middle of last week, Mr. Lynch's office had not yet received a copy of the Court's opinion. ''I just can't say anything until I've seen it,'' he said. In the most sweeping of three separate decisions, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional an Akron, Ohio, ordinance that limited access to abortion by setting forth several provisions. In declaring the Akron ordinance unconstitutional, the Court reaffirmed its decision, made 10 years ago in Roe v. Wade, that the fundamental constitutional right to privacy includes the right to have an abortion. The Court's 1973 decision provided that a state may regulate where the procedure should be done. Connecticut is one of 21 states that limits second-trimester abortions to hospitals. Its regulation states that all induced abortions after the first trimester should be done in a licensed hospital with a department of obstetrics and gynecology and a department of anesthesiology. Dr. Estelle Siker of the Health Department's Community Health Division said that she is ''waiting for instructions from the Attorney General's office before we do anything about this.'' Until then, she said, ''if a clinic calls us and asks us what to do about a secondtrimester patient, I'd have to refer them to the Attorney General.'' Abortion clinics in Connecticut are also waiting for clarification. ''We don't consider the decision to be in effect here yet,'' said Marie Maiden of Century Medical Center in Norwalk. ''There are too many important things to consider.'' One of them, she said, is how late into the second trimester the procedure will be done at the clinic. ''We need to talk to our physicians,'' she said. ''I see us as doing the procedure until about 15 weeks.'' Summit Women's Center, which operates state-licensed clinics in Bridgeport and West Hartford, is also waiting. ''There are a lot of considerations to be made,'' said Tamara Digman, director of community education for the centers. ''We don't want to jump the gun.'' She said the centers will have to design a ''medical protocol'' for second-trimester abortions. The Court, in its opinion written by Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., said the second-trimester hospitalization requirement placed a ''significant obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.'' The procedure is more costly in the hospital, and the fact that some women must travel to find an available hospital may pose a health risk, according to the Court's opinion. The safety of second-trimester abortions ''has increased dramatically since 1973,'' wrote Justice Powell. In 1981, 16,565 abortions were performed in Connecticut, in physicians' offices, clinics and hospitals. Of those, 3 percent were done in the second trimester, according to Health Department statistics. State Senator Regina R. Smith, Democrat of Northford who has, in the past, introduced legislation that had involved protective measures for abortion clinics in Connecticut, said she was ''surprised and dismayed'' by the Supreme Court ruling. ''Personally,'' she said, ''I feel this is unfortunate. A woman could be six-months pregnant and be undergoing an abortion away from a hospital. I suppose we could do something about this in the legislature, but it would probably be fruitless.'' Pro-Choice and Right to Life groups in Connecticut also reacted to the Supreme Court decision. ''We see it as a clear victory for Pro-Choice. We're very pleased,'' said Dereka Smith, the acting coordinator of the Connecticut National Abortion Rights Action League. Pat Wise, president of the Connecticut Right to Life Corporation, said the decision has ''convinced us even more that we must pass an amendment that would restore the legal personhood of the unborn child.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F.D.R.'S COALITION AWAITS A SPARK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/opinion/fdr-s-coalition-awaits-a-spark.html,"Old New Dealers never die; they just fade away trying to answer the question, ''What ever became of the Roosevelt coalition of the 1930's and 1940's?'' For me, the answer is not difficult: The coalition is alive and restless, awaiting a spark to ignite it. Oh, sure, the Roosevelt coalition has lost some of its least congenial components (big city machines now defunct or debilitated and the states of the old Confederacy), and it may be creaky at the joints for want of exercise. But the motivating and adhesive force of the Roosevelt coalition - the desire and need for affirmative government - is as vital today as it was 50 years ago. At the heart of the coalition were liberals, labor, blacks, other minorities including Jews, the unemployed, welfare recipients and other poor and near poor. The concrete that held it together was dedication to affirmative government directed toward the goal of a more livable and equitable society. That concrete still exists and the groups that comprise the coalition are far stronger today than when Franklin --------------------------------------------------------------------- Joseph L. Rauh Jr. is a civil rights lawyer active in Democratic Party affairs since the New Deal. Delano Roosevelt forged the alliance. Today, 20 million workers belong to labor unions (about one-fifth of the workforce), compared to barely two million (6 percent of the work force) when Mr. Roosevelt took office. Blacks account for a larger number and percentage of voters and Hispanics have become a new, vibrant force in many areas of the country - both due in no small measure to the Voting Rights Acts. So many women have joined the affirmative government coalition that the gender gap may yet prove determinative in 1984. And any list of potentials for the coalition has to include newly politically conscious groups like senior citizens, handicapped, gays, small farmers and conservationists. But even a cockeyed optimist on the liberal side has to concede that there are tensions and divisions between various groups in the coalition. Blacks and Hispanics have historic differences. Many Jews differ from others in the coalition on affirmative action. Labor's hard line on military and foreign affairs, protectionism and growth at the expense of the environment clashes with the predominant liberal view on these issues. Abortion and gay rights are divisive within and between groups. But the ties that bind the coalition together are far greater than any of these tensions and divisions. All groups in the coalition agree on one thing: Government can work for the people from the bottom up, not just from the top down. They long for a society where everybody who wants to work can have a job; where the health of each person is properly cared for; where each child has an opportunity for a decent education and no child goes to bed hungry; where every family has at least minimum shelter; and where every vestige of discrimination on grounds of race, creed, color, sex, sexual preference, national origin, age or handicap is eliminated. These goals combine the special interest of each component group with the general interest of all. Sadly, no one has yet sought to arouse the coalition from the cynicism and apathy that set in with Vietnam and Watergate. Jimmy Carter ran against Washington in both 1976 and 1980 and summed up his belief on this score in his 1978 State of the Union Message when he proclaimed that ''Government cannot solve our problems ... Government cannot eliminate poverty, or provide a bountiful economy, or reduce inflation, or save our cities, or cure illiteracy, or provide energy.'' Ronald Reagan's 1980 antigovernment campaign outdid even Mr. Carter's, culminating in an inaugural one-liner about government being part of the problem, notable principally because he was head of the Government that he called the problem. One would have thought that front-runner Walter Mondale's record as a Senator made him the perfect candidate to spark the affirmative government coalition. But it is not going to be ignited by anyone who is perceived as the candidate of one group in the coalition, and Mr. Mondale's acceptance of labor's protectionist position and its military and foreign hard line (as evidenced, for example, by his criticism of the ''no first strike'' advocates) at least gave that appearance. Nor is the coalition going to be ignited by almost-front-runner John Glenn, whose self-described centrist position has a muted antigovernment tone. The coalition can only be aroused by one who makes each group believe his or her stand for affirmative government is in the interest of all and that he or she is the captive of none. F.D.R. exuded the sincerity, optimism and courage to instill the coalition with the intensity of dedication necessary for electoral success. The coalition is out there waiting for the person with the courage to buck today's conservative conventional wisdom and give the coalition the leadership for which it yearns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS IN SUMMARY; Tuning Up the Smoking Hazards,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-tuning-up-the-smoking-hazards.html,"The warning on cigarette packages and advertisements that ''Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health'' was presumably a factor in reducing the ranks of adult smokers from 41.7 percent of the population in 1965 to 32.6 percent in 1980. That's not good enough for Congress, where both houses are moving to require warnings that present smoking's dangers in gruesome detail. Last week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee endorsed a version that leaves little to the imagination. The Senate bill would have ''Smoking Causes Cancer, Emphysema And Heart Disease; May Complicate Pregnancy And Is Addictive'' printed on cigarette packages. Prospects for its passage were deemed good. The leading House measure would require packages and advertising to rotate several health warnings, each focusing on a cigarette-related danger, including birth defects, spontaneous abortions and cancer. The tobacco industry agrees there is a statistical association between smoking and disease, but denies it causes disease. Industry representatives argue that laws incorporating cause-and-effect language would weaken the position of cigarette manufacturers in product liability suits. Last week, they told the Senate committee they would not fight slightly stronger warnings if such statements were deleted from the bill; they weren't. (Some observers believe tough warnings would put the health burden on smokers and lessen industry liability.) Pointing to the decline in cigarette smoking, the Tobacco Institute, a trade group, says the existing warning is ''serving its intended purpose.'' The Federal Office on Smoking and Health, however, has reported that smoking has gained popularity among groups most susceptible to its dangers - 12.7 percent of teen-age girls smoked in 1979, as against 8.4 percent in 1968.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRIME AND THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/books/crime-and-the-court.html,"MIRANDA Crime, Law and Politics. By Liva Baker. 463 pp. New York: Atheneum. $22.95. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM A Blueprint. Edited by Patrick B. McGuigan and Randall R.Rader with Claudia A. Keiper. 273 pp. Chicago: Free Congress Research and Education Foundation/ Regnery/Gateway. Cloth, $21.95. Paper, $14. IF you listen to some conservative politicians, it's easy to solve America's crime problem. Just abolish the insanity defense, restore capital punishment, eliminate the exclusionary rule (which prohibits the use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials) and stop coddling criminals. Then, like magic, we will all be able to unlock our doors, regain our streets for relaxed evening strolls and stop worrying about rape, robbery and murder. Nonsense, some liberals say. Crime is a function of poverty, unemployment and the failure of government to provide adequate educational opportunities, housing and welfare. You're both wrong, the criminologists interject. The rate of violent crime has little to do with legal rules or economic factors. It is a function of complex phenomena, such as the average age of the population - the higher the number of men aged 15 to 30, the greater the rate of violent crime. The only conclusion everyone agrees on is that violent crime has become a divisive political issue. Emotionally laden code words - ''law and order,'' ''crime in the streets,'' ''handcuffing the police,'' ''epidemic of violence'' and ''police brutality'' - have replaced rational discussion about what steps might realistically be taken to reduce violent crime without savaging the Bill of Rights. Perhaps the single word that arouses the strongest emotions in the political controversy over crime is ''Miranda.'' To viewers of television, Miranda refers to the ''rights'' that police are obliged to recite to an arrested suspect before they question him. To most law enforcement officials, Miranda is the symbol of the Supreme Court's shackling of the police and coddling of criminals. To some liberals, Miranda marks ''the highest achievement of civil libertarianism as translated into constitutional terms by the U.S. Supreme Court.'' And to a small number of people in Phoenix, Miranda represents the real-life drama of a rape and several robberies committed by a 23-year-old Mexican-American named Ernest Miranda. In ''Miranda: Crime, Law and Politics,'' Liva Baker, the author of ''Felix Frankfurter: A Biography,'' explores every aspect of the Supreme Court's 1966 decision in Miranda v. Arizona: the criminal, the crime, the trial, the ruling, the symbol, the controversy, the practical effects, the politics and the prospects. It is an ambitious undertaking, employing one important case as a vehicle for explaining the American legal system and exploring all sides of a complex and continuing debate about the politics of criminal justice. In some respects, it is modeled after Anthony Lewis's enormously successful ''Gideon's Trumpet,'' which used a case involving an indigent defendant's right to have an attorney appointed at trial to explain the dynamics of the Supreme Court. Because Ernest Miranda's case - involving the right to appointed counsel in the police station - was so much more controversial than Clarence Gideon's, Mrs. Baker must inevitably explore complex issues (such as the effects of controversial Court decisions on elections) that Mr. Lewis was able to avoid. The result is that Mrs. Baker has produced a rough-cut though valuable stone, whereas Mr. Lewis was able to turn out a pure jewel. Comparisons aside, ''Miranda'' does its job admirably, if sometimes a bit tediously. Ernest Miranda's story, which is told in detail, is not the stuff of great literature or even exciting television crime drama. By the age of 14, he was already a felon. A string of larcenies escalated into burglaries and then robberies. By 15 he had attempted rape and was diagnosed as having sexual problems. A short stint in the military ended with an undesirable discharge for being a peeping Tom. More crimes were followed by a prison term. After his release, he avoided legal trouble for a couple of years, until one night in March 1963, when he abducted and raped an 18-year-old woman returning home from her job at a movie theater. The victim was able to identify the car, and Miranda was arrested 10 days later. The Phoenix police took him to the station house and interrogated him. Within a short time, he confessed not only to the rape under investigation but also to another attempted rape and a robbery. What exactly induced the prisonwise defendant to incriminate himself will never be known, be cause the only people in the interrogation room were two policemen and Miranda., who was killed in a barroom fight in 1976. Not surprisingly, Miranda claimed the police promised him leniency if he talked and threatened reprisals if he remained silent. The police, on the other hand, denied any promises or threats. This all too typical crime and interrogation eventually led to Miranda v. Arizona. Mrs. Baker is at her best in setting the legal and political stage for Chief Justice Earl Warren's decision in that case. She provides a short history of the Supreme Court and discusses its role in prior confession cases and the political factors that created the sharp division among the Justices. MRS. BAKER proves what most astute Court watchers have always suspected - that great legal decisions often are highly political in nature. For all of Justice Hugo Black's rhetoric about just following the words of the Constitution, the Justices are aware that nearly every significant word in that document is subject to multiple interpretations. Constitutional policy making, not literal interpretation, is what most Supreme Court decisions are all about. The Miranda case was an extreme example of such policy making. Indeed, Chief Justice Warren's majority opinion barely alluded to the facts of the case. Warren first described the general problem faced by indigent suspects in police interrogation rooms and then established a series of general rules for all such cases - including the famous Miranda warnings. In approaching the problem in this manner, the Court acted much as a legislature might. After establishing the rules, the Court hastily returned to its judicial function and - almost as an afterthought - applied them to the facts of the particular case before it. The outcry was immediate and sustained. It has still not abated. Constitutional amendments have been introduced to abrogate Miranda. Judges and judicial nominees have promised to overrule it. Presidential candidates have campaigned against it. Mrs. Baker chronicles the continuing debate over the decision and what it has come to symbolize. She persuasively demonstrates that the high crime rate in this country is not a function of Supreme Court decisions but rather of complex factors (such as demography and economics), most of which are beyond the ken of the courts. She is wrong, however, when she concludes that it is ''no longer fashionable'' to advance the argument that violent crime ''is due to the Warren Court's 'coddling' of criminals.'' That view may no longer be fashionable among intellectuals, but it is still popular among many politicians - at least if their campaign rhetoric is to be credited. NOR is the Supreme Court theory of violent crime limited to extremists and ideologues. It is very much in vogue within the current Administration. Lest there be any doubt about where several influential members of it stand, the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation has performed an important function by compiling a book summarizing the criminal-justice views of such Administration luminaries as Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese 3d, Attorney General William French Smith and F.B.I. Director William H. Webster, as well as an assortment of Republican senators, conservative academics and lawyers. ''Criminal Justice Reform: A Blueprint'' contains chapters on the exclusionary rule, the insanity defense, gun control, drugs, pornography, capital punishment and, of course, the criminal-coddling courts. A common theme runs through the book: Permissive court decisions like Miranda are largely responsible for our epidemic of violent crime. The ''blueprint'' for reducing violent crime therefore is to focus attention on changing these court decisions through legislative abrogation and the appointment of tougher judges. Among the proposals are - as one might expect - modification of the exclusionary rule and the insanity defense, limitations on the use of the Freedom of Information Act and of writs of habeas corpus, and the restoration of capital punishment. But the reality of crime is not subject to quick-fix solutions. The total percentage of criminal defendants who would be affected by all these changes together would be less than 1 percent. A recent study by the Comptroller General of the United States established that less than one-half of 1 percent of all cases are affected by the exclusionary rule, about one-tenth of 1 percent involve the insanity defense, far less than one-tenth of 1 percent are capital cases, and only a very tiny number of defendants are freed by invoking writs of habeas corpus or the Freedom of Information Act. Why, then, do intelligent writers focus so much of their attention on questionable reforms that, if enacted, would not make a dent in our violent crime problem? Because, as Mrs. Baker demonstrates, courts are an easy target for our collective fear of crime and our anger over society's seeming inability to control it. This blueprint for crime control is more an ideological expression of faith in conservatism than a serious discussion of how to reduce crime. Nowhere, for example, is there a consideration of the effects of our current approach to crimes involving heroin (attempting to make it scarce, thus raising its price and requiring addicts to rob more to satisfy their habits). Instead, there is a plea for more vigorous ''prosecution of victimless crimes'' and less vigorous enforcement of gun control laws. Among the book's other assertions: * ''Conceivable (though probably not achievable) government activities ..., like improving education and housing, may actually contribute to the propensity for crime in many individuals.'' * ''It is true that if one wanted to get at the 'root cause' of crime by economic means, he could start by repealing the minimum wage laws for people under the age of 25, so that they could obtain and keep that first job to put some cash in their pockets.'' * ''The theory of evolution up from the apes in the jungle runs contrary to the experience of devolution back to the jungle as more and more people become animalistic predators on their fellow humans.'' * To ''restore the teaching of sound morality to our youth'' and thereby reduce crime, ''encourage religiously-oriented private schools; introduce 'Ethics' or 'Character Training' into the public schools; create positive role-models in our textbooks and television dramas.'' * ''Capital punishment possesses certain merciful aspects. It may be merciful, first, in that it may relieve a depraved criminal of the horror of being what he is. It may be merciful, second, in that it can help to protect the less guilty from the more guilty. And ... capital punishment may mercifully protect the guiltless from the more extreme forms of violence.'' After reading about the evils of secular education, minimum wage laws, evolution and the earthly realm of existence, I fully expected to be lectured on how birth control and abortion cause armed robbery and rape. But that is dangerous ground for conservative ideologues, because one of the few undisputed facts about violent crime is that it decreases as the percentage of young males in the population decreases. Thus one major reason for the increase in crime during the 1960's and 70's was that the post-World War II baby boom produced a great many males who were in their late teens and early 20's during those years. Now that the proportion of young males has begun to decrease, we have begun to experience a welcome reduction in the rate of violent crime. Doubtless the Reagan Administration will claim the credit. In reality, however, it belongs more to the birth-control clinics of Margaret Sanger than to the rhetoric of the law-and-order forces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIX YEARS FOR THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/six-years-for-the-president.html,"The idea was debated in the Constitutional Conventiion. Andrew Jackson revived it 40 years later. Most 19th-century Presidents favored it, and in 1913 Woodrow Wilson had to intervene personally to stop Congress from approving it. The idea of electing the President of the United States for only one term of six years won't die. Now an impressive new National Committee for a Single Six-Year Presidential Term has brought it out again and is pushing the necessary constitutional amendment with what may be better-than-usual prospects for success. The latest single-term movement is being led by a formidable, bipartisan array of well-known public servants. In the words of former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, a liberal Democrat, they ''cover the spectrum from Vance to Simon.'' And that's quite a spectrum, since he was referring to William E. Simon, the conservative Republican who served Presidents Nixon and Ford as Secretary of the Treasury. In Congress, a similar range of supporters has emerged, from Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan - black, liberal and Democratic - to Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina -white, conservative and Republican. Mr. Thurmond is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which must approve proposed constitutional amendments before they go to the Senate floor. Such varied proponents of change, many of them members of the new national committee headed by Mr. Vance, Mr. Simon, Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower and Griffin B. Bell, the Attorney General in the Carter Administration, also have the enthusiastic backing of former President Carter himself. He suggested in a recent telephone interview - as one example of his reasoning - that negotiations for the release of American hostages in Iran might have been ''concluded earlier'' in 1980 except that it was an election year. Now another election year is approaching. Some political observers think President Reagan's tough stance against raising taxes, despite huge prospective budget deficits, is an example of re-election pressures already at work upon him - the kind that the single-term amendment would be partially designed to prevent. Mr. Reagan has been noncommittal on the single-term issue, although some backers of the idea say he favors it in private; his support and lobbying could be a major factor in Congressional approval. The front-running Democratic challenger, former Vice President Walter Mondale, has strongly opposed the proposal as ''a lessening of the fundamental accountability that must be built into our political system."" But there's little chance that whoever is elected in 1984 would be affected; precedent suggests that a President in office when a change in tenure was ratified would be exempt from its limitations. Mr. Vance, now a Manhattan lawyer, predicted in an interview that the proposed constitutional amendment would be debated in the current Congress and draw wide bipartisan support. He and other members of the new committee, he said, had found in speaking appearances around the country ''a great deal of resonance and interest ... a feeling that, yes, something does have to be done.'' Co-chairman Simon is not so optimistic. Interviewed in his Morristown, N.J., consultant's office, he expressed devout support for the idea but added: ''I don't think it's going to happen. I just don't see the steam behind it yet.'' Knowledgeable Congressional sources tend to agree with Mr. Simon. They say the stronger immediate push will be for one or more of the ''big three'' proposed constitutional amendments - the revived equalrights amendment, one to prohibit abortion and one to permit prayer in the public schools. But single-term supporters are confident that they can get a vote, perhaps by next year after hearings this year. As a matter of hard fact, however, the Gallup Poll, which has taken surveys on this issue since l936, has never found more than 34 percent of the public in favor of the single six-year term. That figure was registered in l981, although in December 1980, the Harris Poll found 43 percent supporting the idea. Why has this perrenial reform proposal, as old as the Republic and at least as hearty, refused to go away? Probably because it reflects a view that's just as persistent - the American conviction that unseemly ''politics'' somehow stands too often in the way of ''good government'' by pure-souled ''statesmen'' dedicated only to ''the public interest.'' Andrew Jackson was not generally considered in his day such a paragon of nonpolitical government, but he nevertheless gave Congress in 1830 a resounding statement of this attitude. He recommended a single term ''in order that (the President) may ... be placed beyond the reach of any improper influences ... and that the securities for this independence may be rendered as strong as the nature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit.'' But the single-term idea has never prevailed because of an equally strong belief of similar persistence that such ''good government'' is elitist in concept and unrealistic in practice, while grubby politics reconciles the necessarily conflicting interests of a democracy and makes the wheels of government turn, even if slowly. More than a century and a quarter after Old Hickory's appeal for purity, former President Harry S. Truman bluntly stated this opposite point of view: ''A politician is a man who understands government, and it takes a politician to run a government.'' And later, to a Congressional hearing on the single-term issue: ''You do not have to be very smart to know that an officeholder who is not eligible for re-election loses a lot of influence. So, what have you done? You have taken a man and put him in the hardest job in the world, and sent him out to fight our battles in a life-and-death struggle - and you have sent him out to fight with one hand tied behind his back, because everyone knows he cannot run for reelection.'' Actually, for all the long history of discussion and debate on the single six-year term, the proposal has never been submitted by Congress for approval by three-fourths of the states; not even the resistance to Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms pushed it that far. Instead, before Congress limited Presidents to two terms with the 22d Amendment in l947, the Senate defeated by 82 to 1 a single six-year term proposal by Senator W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel of Texas. Approval was more nearly achieved in the lame-duck session of the 62d Congress. Woodrow Wilson had been elected in 1912 on a Democratic platform calling for a single six-year term. His Republican opponent, President William H. Taft, had promised to approve legislation for an amendment and a survey by The New York World found a big Congressional majority that favored the reform. On Feb. 13, 1913, the Senate approved the constitutional amendment, 48 to 23, one vote more than the necessary two-thirds. But Presidentelect Wilson, no doubt with an early eye on his own prospects for a second term, already had written A. Mitchell Palmer, a leading member of Congress, to object. The proposed amendment died quietly when the 62d Congress went out of office on March 3. Mr. Wilson, a political scientist by profession and one of the keenest intellects to occupy the White House, made to Representative Palmer what still is a strong argument against the single six-year Presidency. A four-year term, he wrote, was ''too long for a President who is not the true spokesman of the people, who is imposed upon and does not lead. It is too short a term for a President who is doing or attempting a great work of reform. ...'' Changing to six years, he argued, ''would increase the likelihood of its being too long, without any assurance that it would, in happy cases, be long enough.'' PROPONENTS OF THE SIX-year Presidency give a variety of reasons for renewing the fight -the vast growth of the Federal Government, for example, and the complex role the nation now must play in world affairs. In only four years, a President can hardly master his difficult job, they point out, yet no President since Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950's has been elected to and served two full terms. They say that every President, at least since John F. Kennedy, has been to some degree a failure -Lyndon B. Johnson driven from office by oppposition to the war in Vietnam, Richard M. Nixon forced to resign by the prospect of impeachment, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter unable to win re-election, Ronald Reagan by no means sure of doing so. Save for Mr. Johnson in the mid-1960's and Mr. Reagan in l981, none had the willing cooperation of Congress. Particularly in foreign affairs, the lack of continuity brought on by frequent changes at the top has baffled and irritated foreign governments and made American policy too often ineffective, misunderstood - or even nonexistent. Presidents themselves, Cyrus Vance believes, have been failing to face issues, or dealing with them ''in ways that may look politically attractive'' but are only superficial. Moreover, many complex issues - he cites a strategic-arms negotiation -may require more than the four years allowed to recent one-term Presidents. ''The business of being President,'' he says, ''is so complicated'' that adding re-election concerns makes it ''more than any human being can take.'' Timothy W. Stanley, president of the International Economic Policy Association, has been persuaded by his experience as a former Government official that, as now organized, ''our society and our politics don't seem to be equipped to make choices involving tradeoffs between the short term and the long term ... .'' Particularly in foreign economic policy, he believes, ''any set of policies requires more continuity and less uncertainty'' than recent Presidencies have provided. Herbert Brownell Jr., President Eisenhower's Attorney General and a member of the single-term committee, put his finger on what may be an unspoken motive of some former Government servants actively pushing the single six-year term: ''I think there has been nothing more discouraging over the years to these volunteers who are essential to our welfare than to see that their carefully laid plans on foreign policy or domestic policy or whatever are subordinated so soon and so fast to overriding political considerations.'' ''Overriding political considerations'' are at the heart of the matter. The basic theory of most who seek to restrict Presidents to one lengthened term is that the necessity or desire to seek reelection causes political ''considerations'' - winning and keeping the support of interest groups, for example - to dominate all others in a President's first term. A single six-year term, it is held, would remove this political pressure and give a President two more years than he or she can now be sure of to carry out difficult, longterm plans. Mr. Simon, a classic ''good government'' advocate who says ruefully that ''the next battle I win with a President's political advisers will be the first one,'' argues that the present term is not really four years: ''It's a year and a half.'' The argument that running for re-election takes too much of a President's time may be the strongest for the single six-year term. Mr. Vance made the point in more detail: ''Every President needs eight or nine months to learn his job. Then he has about one and a half years to feel comfortable in a job he knows. Then he's running again for 12 to 18 months.'' And, of course, there's a mid-term Congressional election that no President can afford to ignore. As for the opposing argument made so strongly by Harry Truman - that a President who cannot be re-elected becomes an instant lame duck (his coattails, Clark Clifford, the astute Democratic political adviser, once observed, would be ''permanently in mothballs'') - single-term proponents have a ready answer. If that's a sound argument, they say, the two-term limitation of the 22d Amendment already has turned second-term Presidents into lame ducks. But they also question whether it is a sound argument. Second-term Presidents were inhibited by tradition - until F.D.R. - from running again; since Harry Truman, two-term Presidents have been constitutionally barred from running again. Yet, they say, the skies haven't fallen. President Carter, in fact, believes that being eligible for reelection actually damaged his credibility. No matter what he did in the White House, he said in l979, it was ''colored through the news media and in the minds of the American people by 'Is this a campaign ploy or is it genuinely done in the best interest of our country without any sort of personal advantage involved?' '' General Eisenhower is the only President to have served two full terms since the 22d Amendment took effect, and thus to have suffered whatever lame-duck effect it may cause. Milton Eisenhower recalls that his brother felt no lame-duck limitations in his second term. ''He was even more effective as President in his second term than in his first,'' Dr. Eisenhower said in a telephone interview. ''He faced the complete control of Congress by the Democrats, but he had no real trouble getting his programs through. He only had two vetoes overriden in eight years as President; that's a pretty good relationship with Congress.'' But not everyone agrees that President Eisenhower's second term was successful. Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona, writing on the term-limitation issue, judged that Ike was ''politically emasculated following re-election and could not control his own Cabinet, much less the Congress.'' Lyndon Johnson was, by definition, a lame duck for nearly 10 months after he announced on March 31, 1968, that he would not seek reelection. George Reedy - who served Mr. Johnson in several capacities - wrote of the period in his respected study ''The Twilight of the Presidency'': ''The erosion of his power became apparent within weeks ... . The last 10 months of his Administration were marked by frustration on every issue, with the sole exception of the convening of the Paris conference to discuss ways and means of ending the Vietnam War.'' Even at Paris, nothing happened until a new President was elected. MOST PROPONENTS DO not claim the single six-year term would be a cure-all for whatever ails the Presidency and the country; but they argue, as Mr. Simon does, that it would be ''a major step in the right direction.'' For one thing, he thinks, it would help bring into the Government ''people who have the courage to go in and get things done and get out of there.'' President Carter, citing the ''blatantly'' different policies of his successor on human rights, nuclear arms control and nuclear proliferation, agrees that the reform would provide ''much greater stability.'' And a six-year term with no year taken out for a reelection campaign, he told me, would allow an incoming President to ''plan for a more coherent term'' and give him more time to get things done after his learning period. Mr. Vance insists that the single six-year term would provide ''more stability for a period within which predictability would be possible,'' thus mollifying what he said was a major concern of foreign officials with whom he has talked - a lack of predictability in Washington. Proponents also claim that more able Presidential candidates would be lured into the field if they could count on a longer term without the distractions of a re-election campaign, particularly since none would have to run against a politically powerful incumbent. Mr. Carter had a somewhat different reason for urging the removal of incumbents from Presidential races. Near the end of a first term, he said, when a President opens a re-election campaign, there is a ''driving pressure'' on his likely challengers to ''dispute or contradict the President on the issues'' for strictly political reasons. This is ''a very distressing thing,'' Mr. Carter said, because on the issues in question the President may well be acting in the national interest. Then, if such a challenger is elected, the same national interest will force him to ''reverse himself'' - as President Kennedy did when he found in l961 that there was no ''missile gap,'' and as President Reagan has had to do on strategic arms negotiations. A President's credibility and political support can suffer as a result. This ''driving pressure'' on challengers to criticize the incumbent's policies might be lessened, Mr. Carter thinks, if an incumbent could not be a candidate to succeed him or herself. He recalled how President Ford, seeking renomination by the Republican Party in 1976, had to ''back off'' from strategic arms agreements reached with the Soviet Union at the Vladivostok summit and from seeking ratification of the Panama Canal treaties when both projects came came under fire from his challenger, Ronald Reagan. Former Treasury Secretary Simon offers a graphic example of how reelection pressures worked on Mr. Ford: ''When we prepared the 1976 State of the Union Message ... I wanted to add a few pages on the two very controversial issues of tax and welfare reform. After a long debate with the Economic Policy Board I put the pages in, and when we discussed the State of the Union Message with the President he said, 'Boy, I agree with this 100 percent. We're going to do it.' The political advisers' heads snapped around, and he added: 'Next year.' Of course, 'next year' - January l977 -never came for us.'' Mr. Carter was not immune to such pressures. He withdrew SALT II from Senate consideration early in 1980, but Mr. Vance thinks ''it would have been different'' in a nonelection year. ''It's inevitable,'' he says, that a President will ''draw back or not take political risks'' when facing re-election, and the consequences can be serious. In the case of SALT II, Mr. Reagan took office and declared the treaty ''fatally flawed'' and ''dead.'' Mr. Carter said in the telephone interview that he was able to get such controversial measures as the Alaska Lands Act and the ''superfund'' for cleaning up toxic waste sites through Congress only after he had been defeated in the 1980 election, and then only because the Republicans didn't want Mr. Reagan to have to face these difficult issues the next year. ''I think every public servant is concerned with his re-election,'' former President Johnson told Walter Cronkite in a television interview in l972, ''and has to think of that from the day he takes the oath until the time his term expires. And I think that we're all inclined to put off the hard ones and postpone them sometimes because we think, 'Well, we'll have another term ... .' And if a fellow knew from the beginning that he had a definite limitation and the bell's going to ring at a certain time, he might be able to tackle some of the problems he's inclined to postpone.'' Mr. Carter went in the other direction when he decided to force through the unpopular Panama Canal treaties during what he thought would be his first term. Mr. Carter termed the treaties ''the most difficult political problem I ever had in my life, including running for President as an unknown in l976.'' Clark Clifford suggested that so thorny an issue should be reserved for a second term, when there would be no problem of re-election. Mr. Vance, who was Secretary of State when the decision to seek the treaties was made, feels strongly that Mr. Carter had no alternative because there might otherwise have been a popular uprising in Panama with ''serious consequences in this hemisphere and far broader consequences elsewhere in the third world.'' He concedes that deferring such a battle to a second term was ''probably right politically'' but believes the issue had to be addressed ''when Carter's power was greatest.'' Probably there would be no such treaties today if Mr. Carter had waited for the expected second term; Ronald Reagan, the treaties' strongest opponent, was elected. The former President counts the treaty battle among the major reasons Mr. Reagan defeated him in l980 and points out that it also helped ruin the Republican Presidential bid of Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., who incautiously supported the treaties. Only seven of 16 senators who voted for them and then had to face the voters in l978 were re-elected. PRESIDENTS WILSON AND TRU-man, as quoted above, laid out two of the major arguments against the single six-year term -that such an amendment might shorten the tenure of a good President and lengthen that of a poor one; and that a President who cannot be re-elected will be a weakened President - a lame duck from the start. These are not views restricted to liberal Democrats. Lyn Nofziger, for example, Ronald Reagan's hardball political adviser, once commented that ''the threat of running again and being re-elected is about the only party discipline we have in this country.'' And among the Founding Fathers, it was Alexander Hamilton - not exactly a mushy liberal - who most strongly made another point against the single-term Presidency. A President's eligibility for reelection was essential, Hamilton argued in ''The Federalist,'' essay 72, ''to enable the people, when they see reason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in his station, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues ... .'' When they see reason to approve of his conduct. And when they don't, the remedy is obvious, as Harry Truman said: ''If he is not a good President, and you do not want to keep him, you do not have to re-elect him.'' Presidents, Hamilton and Truman were saying in their different ways, should be accountable to the people and the only way to hold them accountable is to subject them to the test of reelection. If a President must leave office at the end of six years, moreover, he might have to step out in the middle of a war or some other serious national crisis. (Under the 22d Amendment, this would also be true of a second-term President, if we ever have another.) And it is by no means clear to everyone who has studied the problem that re-election pressures lead only to crass political decisions, without regard to national interest. Representative Udall, a Presidential candidate himself in l976, has pointed out that while the approach of the l972 elections led Richard Nixon into the Watergate scandals, Mr. Nixon also ''brought American troops home from Vietnam, slapped on wage and price controls, went to China, and moved toward detente with the Russians - in each case reversing prior positions. In short, his greatest achievements grew out of the pressure of an approaching election.'' In 1968, for another example, Lyndon B. Johnson refused to seek reelection rather than change his Vietnam policy or risk defeat on that issue. Whatever may be thought of that policy, Mr. Johnson's withdrawal certainly did not reflect a desire for re-election above all. If President Reagan decides to seek re-election, he might be led to make a compromise agreement with the Russians on limiting intermediate-range missiles in Europe. Some might debate whether such an agreement would be in the public interest; but without election pressures, a hard-liner like Mr. Reagan might not even consider a compromise. And anyway, most of those who have opposed recurrent proposals for the single six-year term strongly disagree with the basic ''good government'' reasoning of its advocates - that the President should be relieved, as far as possible, of political considerations and freed to act as a statesman in the national interest. Those who make this argument, said the late James C. Hagerty, President Eisenhower's press secretary and political adviser, in his Congressional testimony, are ''confusing and downgrading the essential political aspect of the Presidency ... using the word 'politics' in a crude and demeaning manner, instead of referring to it in its true meaning - the art of government, accomplishment for the public good through reasonable compromise without surrender of principle or integrity.'' George Reedy argued in ''The Twilight of the Presidency'' that single-term proposals are ''based on the belief that a President's authority is somehow separable from his political leadership. ... The reality is quite different. A President whose political leadership is unchallenged can do just about anything that he wishes. A President whose political leadership has suffered from erosion is virtually helpless.'' Separating him from the pressures of the public, Mr. Reedy wrote, would only ''tend to make him an ineffectual voice issuing orders and decrees ... .'' Clark Clifford once said that he found ''the notion that a President should be above politics inconsistent with our system of government, just as I find the prospect of a Presidential dictator to be inconceivable under the same system. ... Politics, in the final analysis, is an essential part of democracy. A President above politics is a President remote from the processes of government and removed from the thoughts and aspirations of his people.'' Beyond these points against the single six-year term, I would raise several other arguments and questions: Shouldn't the people have the right to re-elect a President of whom they approve? And doesn't the 22d Amendment merely limit this right rather than abolish it, as the single six-year term would do? A President would not himself be on the ballot in any of the biennial elections during his six years in office. Wouldn't this diminish his sense of accountability as well as the public's ability to influence him? One-third of the Senate would have to run in Presidential election years; two-thirds never would have to do so. What effect would this have on a President's political support? Given a President's extraordinary powers as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, isn't it risky to entrust him with such powers for six full years with no remedy for abuse save the difficult impeachment process? Even if a six-year term would be an improvement on four, is it necessary to insist that an incumbent can't be re-elected? France, with its seven-year term, has no such limitation. Mexico does, but it's not apparent that its six-year term provides a more stable government than the United States' system. Most supporters of the six-year proposal also favor term limitations on members of Congress - 12 years for members of each house. They're too smart to push for that while the Presidential proposal is pending, but isn't this distant threat likely to deter Congress from acting, lest it invite efforts for its own restriction next? The National Committee for a Single Six-Year Presidential Term is looking into such problems. The committee works in close cooperation with the Foundation for the Study of Presidential and Congressional Terms, and the two groups share a Washington office. The former columnist Charles L. Bartlett acts as a consultant to the committee; the staff organizes speaking engagements and debates for committee members. ''We have a practical organization now,'' according to Herbert Brownell. ''The things that have to be done in the way of arousing public opinion and debate are going to be done. The talking to Congressmen, senators and state legislatures which has to be done is going to be done.'' But, as Cyrus Vance acknowledges, the Founding Fathers ''set up a wise, slow way'' to change the Constitution, requiring the approval of two-thirds of each house of Congress and of three-fourths of the states. As backers of the original equal-rights amendment and District of Columbia statehood have recently learned, that makes it almost impossible to amend the Constitution without overwhelming public support. Perhaps the single six-year term, if finally instituted, would prove so effective a reform that the Presidency would at last be more nearly dominated by measures than by men, by abstract judgment of the public interest rather than by the clash and reconciliation of interests. And perhaps that would be a good thing. Political history, however, encourages neither proposition. But even if the current drive fails, this ancient issue is unlikely to go away. The human animal is too persistent in its search for a system or a mechanism that will somehow overcome its own vagaries and fallibilities. And Americans, particularly, are too strong in their belief that somehow, someday, they will - or at least should - be able to purge their Government of politics. We want to be rescued from ourselves. ''Maybe,'' said Bill Simon the day the National Committee for a Single Six-Year Presidential Term was announced, ''we'll get some statesmen instead of the standard brand of politician who is just seeking one thing, his own re-election.'' Or maybe, as Harry Truman said, ''A statesman is a politician who's been dead 10 or 15 years.'' A lot of people think Mr. Truman himself proves the point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SOFTENING SOME IMAGES, IF NOT POLICIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/weekinreview/softening-some-images-if-not-policies.html,"Margaret M. Heckler, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, probably could not change the Reagan Administration's stance on issues of concern to her department even if she wanted to. But to some extent she has changed the tone of the department, and that is no mean feat. Mrs. Heckler constantly emphasizes her desire to be ''fair, compassionate and humane'' to the millions of people who receive assistance from the department. Thus, she announced a new policy this month to make the Social Security disability program more humane. But many analysts detected a paradox in what she was saying. On the one hand, she insisted that no one had been unjustly cut from the rolls because all had gotten ''a fair hearing through the appeals process'' and that no one had to be reinstated. On the other hand, she acknowledged that there had been some ''sad results,'' some ''hardships and heartbreaks'' for individuals, and she said there would be major changes. That seemed to capture Mrs. Heckler's dual role: She defends the President and his record with an exuberance that suggests, as one Senator said, that she wants to nominate Mr. Reagan for a second term. At the same time, the former Republican Representative from Wellesley, Mass., whose voting record placed her well to the left of Mr. Reagan, is trying to burnish the President's reputation for fairness and compassion. Mr. Reagan's reputation on that score has been tarnished by two years of budget cuts in social welfare programs. In a speech earlier in the month to the United States Conference of Mayors, Mrs. Heckler again sounded the theme of compassion - this time, for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the mysterious ailment that has killed more than 600 Americans by destroying their resistance to infection and disease. In expressing concern for homosexual men, thoe main victims of the disease, Mrs. Heckler showed empathy for a minority group rarely noticed by Federal officials of either political party. But Mrs. Heckler has opposed Congressional efforts to appropriate more money for research on the disease, insisting the need could be met by transferring funds from other health programs. As usual, she was bound to espouse the position taken by the Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Mrs. Heckler, to take another example, held out the hope last April of a new Government program to provide health insurance for the unemployed, who frequently lose medical coverage soon after they have lost their jobs. Three weeks later David A. Stockman, the budget director, delivered sober news: The Administration would support changes in the tax code and a few other steps to encourage health insurance for the unemployed, but only if they cost the Federal Government nothing. Dr. Anthony Robbins, president of the American Public Health Association, an organization of 50,000 health professionals, said there had been some ''very superficial improvements'' under Mrs. Heckler. ''She came in at a time when the Administration wanted to turn around its image,'' he said, adding: ''She wants the department to look better so Reagan can get re-elected.'' Mrs. Heckler was not well-known for her interest in health issues when she came to the department, and she did not appear to have any particular agenda or priorities. Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said, ''I just haven't seen any evidence of her personal involvement in health care issues.'' Mrs. Heckler was sworn in March 9, but made her first visit to the National Institutes of Health, the Government's world-famous biomedical research complex in Bethesda, Md., only this month, for a briefing on AIDS. Mrs. Heckler has also pursued appeals of court decisions that invalidated a new rule requiring parental notice whenever minors receive prescription contraceptives from a clinic supported by the Federal Government. As co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, Mrs. Heckler had urged the Reagan Administration to abandon the rule. But now she defends it, saying, ''My own prior views were personal views.'' On another issue of concern to women, Mrs. Heckler shares the President's strong opposition to abortion. But she had no comment on the recent ruling by the Supreme Court that struck down a variety of local laws restricting access to abortions. However, to assess Secretary m Heckler's first 100 days in terms of her work on specific health and welfare programs is to miss a big part of her role. She is the third woman appointed by Mr. Reagan to a Cabinet-level position, she is a canny politician and she has been trying to get the President to speak out on issues of importance to women, such as pension rights and day care. Mrs. Heckler has brought a note of humility to the department, a willingness to acknowledge mistakes, that stands in marked contrast to the more combative tone of other officials such as the new Under Secretary, John A. Svahn. As Commissioner of Social Security, Mr. Svahn supervised the effort to purge ineligible people from the disability rolls. Mrs. Heckler is not halting that effort, but, with her keen political instincts, is trying to soften the effects by making the review process more equitable. Chris Koyanagi of the National Mental Health Association, a private nonprofit group, said it was ''a cruel hoax'' to pretend that the announced changes would protect people already on the disability rolls or seeking benefits. When she was sworn in, Mrs. Heckler told President Reagan that she would ''symbolize the commitment and caring'' he felt for people in need. The question now is whether she will be more than a symbol, whether she will translate that commitment into action. Answers may come later this year as the department revises regulations for hospices, nursing homes and facilities serving the mentally retarded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CANADIAN JUDGE WEIGHS KEY DIOXIN CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/us/canadian-judge-weighs-key-dioxin-case.html,"A lawyer for the plaintiffs, in his final argument, called the trial a World Series of scientific dispute, saying he felt he was in the batter's box in the ninth inning of the seventh game with the bases loaded. ''No matter what happens as a result of this hearing, the record will stand for all time,'' Richard Murtha declared. The issue is whether the court should grant a request by 15 people and stop the planned spraying by a pulp and paper company of socalled phenoxy herbicides containing dioxin. The 15 plaintiffs live near forests where the company plans to spray. Testimony in the case in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Sydney, on Cape Breton Island, was recently completed after more than a month, and a ruling is expected by the end of June. Central Questions Raised Indeed, the case has struck at some of the central questions of this chemical age: At a time of accelerating scientific knowledge and heightened public concern, what is environmental danger and how is it defined? What degree of risk is acceptable, particularly when that risk must be balanced against other societal needs and values? Have some people overreacted and become too frightened of dioxin, as some in the United States have recently suggested? And what of the question of the legal system's competence to judge evidence on the frontiers of science, carrying health implications perhaps as far as a half-century in the future? Because of the exceedingly technical nature of these questions, Judge Merlin D. Nunn ruled against a jury trial. But, as he points out, he too is a layman in such sophisticated scientific issues. So who should decide? The plaintiffs, a group of farmers, fishermen and Indian chiefs from Cape Breton, a craggy island northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, presented scientific data they say suggests that any quantity of dioxin, no matter how small, is unsafe and that as little as one molecule coming in contact with one human cell may cause cancer, birth defects and other maladies. And the plaintiffs' position presumes that any doubt must be resolved in favor of safety. Banned in U.S. but Not Canada The defendants, Nova Scotia Forest Industries, a subsidiary of Stora Kopparbergs of Sweden, counter that the herbicide, called 2,4,5-T, is totally safe in the quantities intended for use. This phenoxy herbicide, which, in a stronger concentration, was used in Vietnam as a defoliant known as Agent Orange, has been banned in the United States for forestry and most other uses but is heavily subsidized by the Canadian Government for forestry applications. It is said to be needed to protect new softwood seedlings from overgrowth by hardwoods. ''The law does not exist to protect plaintiffs from unfounded fear,'' Harvey Morrison, a company lawyer, said. Defense witnesses conceded the extreme toxicity of dioxin, although they questioned its ability to cause cancer and other long-term effects. Dr. Frank Dost, a toxicologist from Oregon State University, said the worse form of dioxin, TCDD, was ''exquisitely toxic.'' But the defense witnesses repeatedly testified that in the herbicides proposed, the amount of TCDD was too small to have any impact on human health. Essentially, they argued that many useful chemicals are risky and that the quantity is what matters. They say the quantity to be sprayed on Nova Scotia would be thousands of times below the danger level. Canada Supports Spraying Such substances as aspirin and caffein, for instance, can be more toxic than phenoxies in sufficient quantities, they said. ''I would not be concerned about an increase in birth defects,'' said F. Clark Fraser, a medical geneticist who works for the Canadian Government, which supports the spraying plans. Dr. Kenneth Crump, a biostatistician from Louisiana, argued that 1,000 people eating phenoxy-contaminated berries generation after generation would expect one cancer every 7 million years. Dr. Richard Wilson, chairman of the physics department of Harvard University, testified, ''It is really hard to assess a risk this low.'' The plaintiffs' lawyers strongly attacked these probabilities, causing Dr. Crump to admit that in one instance he was off by a factor of 10,000 in one of his calculations. They also delighted in Dr. Wilson's mention of a specific license plate number he had seen in the parking lot to illustrate the extremely small probability of ever seeing a particular number. It turned out to be the judge's. Science Data Still Evolving But even the plaintiffs' attorneys said the defense case had a logical tightness theirs lacked, partly, they said, because science in this area is still evolving. Underlying the entire discussion was the fact that phenoxy herbicides have been used and people have been exposed to them in various places and various degrees for 40 years all over the world. Repeatedly, Judge Nunn asked for concrete evidence of deaths or severe health problems resulting from phenoxy exposure. ''If this stuff is so horrendous, you'd have the evidence,'' the judge said. The plaintiffs denied that there is no solid evidence against dioxin, and they called 12 expert witnesses to present their case. 'In a Ball Park by Itself' For days, their witnesses hammered away on the basic theme that even a very little can be too much. Dr. David S. Wulfman, a chemistry professor from the University of Missouri, testified that compared with other cancer-causing substances ''dioxin is in a ball park by itself'' and that a ''no-effect level'' has not been demonstrated. Dr. John D. Constable, a Harvard University surgeon, said that ''at the molecular level'' phenoxy herbicides are enough to cause reproductive changes. Dr. William McNulty of the Oregon State Primate Research Center said his experiments with monkeys showed single doses of dioxin in the smallest of concentrations caused spontaneous abortions. As part of the dosage argument, several witnesses for the plaintiffs contended that dioxin exposure is cumulative in the same manner as radiation; even if one exposure does not cause health problems, it might when combined with later exposures. In part, this possibility was used to try to controvert an uncontested defense assertion that much larger amounts of dioxin than those to be sprayed on Cape Breton have not caused such known dioxin reactions as chloracne, a stinging skin disease that normally vanishes after a few weeks. Witnesses also suggested that it is wrong to think of any one carcinogen in isolation. Rather, known cancer-causing substances interact with unknown ones in endlessly complicated ways that are exceedingly difficult to prove. ''Rats don't also smoke,'' Dr. Mikael Eriksson, a Swedish cancer expert, told the court. Epidemiology Discussed From a scientific viewpoint, one of the more interesting aspects of the trial was a discussion of epidemiology, the science of tracing the causes of disease in human populations. One type of epidemiological study is to find people with the disease and then look backward to find common factors they might have experienced. The plaintiffs presented a Swedish study showing a correlation between phenoxy exposure and the incidence of a rare form of tissue cancer. ''This connection is widely accepted by the real authorities in this field,'' Dr. Eriksson said, under sharp attack from the defense attorneys. Another type of epidemiological study is to examine people who were exposed to a common event and then compare their health with others who were not. Dr. Constable of Harvard testified about a study of 40,000 Vietnamese that, he said, showed that wives of soldiers exposed to Agent Orange experienced more miscarriages and birth defects. He said dioxin appeared to be the first human toxic substance that, when given to a man, may increase his wife's ''reproductive misadventures.'' Statistics are obviously an integral part of epidemiology. Accordingly, the plaintiffs presented a statistician, Dr. Theodor D. Sterling of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, partly to argue that no single epidemiological study should be looked at alone. For instance, the study of miscarriages experienced by Oregon women after 2,4,5-T spraying that led to the United States ban is convincing when combined with other evidence, despite many criticisms of that specific study, he said. Like Card-Game Statistics Dr. Sterling agreed with the statement by Judge Nunn that epidemiology is ''not unlike the statistics of a card game - you may never get that perfect hand.'' The statistician also criticized a study by a Dow Chemical scientist indicating that there is a level of dioxin exposure below which laboratory rats were not affected. He did not question an assertion that in five rats, livers and thalamuses, where dioxin collects, had not much enlarged. But he argued that five rats were too few to test low levels of exposure. Clearly, though, his prescription might be difficult to carry out. ''If you are going to use a very low dose, ideally you might want 10 million animals,'' he said. The trial's outcome could hinge on the simple issue of trespass: The judge could take a novel position that people should not have to put up with minuscule amounts of uninvited molecules on their property, anymore than noxious odors. This would entail the judge's accepting the disputed argument by the plaintiffs that the chemicals have a good chance of being dispersed, however careful the applicators. ''I'm not an expert, but I know that water flows downhill and wind blows in all directions,'' said Charles Mullendore, a plaintiff who is a clergyman and part-time farmer. Regulatory System Cited But if Judge Nunn orders a injunction on the basis of concern over the safety of phenoxy herbicides, he would be taking a large step the defense lawyers believe he does not have to take. They say the letter of the law is enough: that 2,4,5-T has been specifically approved by Canadian regulators, who have not allowed some herbicides approved by the United States Government. To rule against them would be ''tantamount to overthrowing the regulatory system,'' George Cooper, one of the lawyers, said. There are a number of courses the judge could take other than a straight yes-or-no decision. Among other things, he could approve spraying of some sites and not others; approve the use of some herbicides but not 2,4,5-T, or grant an injunction only for a limited period of time. He could also reject spraying of all sites on the basis of the two Indian plaintiffs' definition of their native rights. In any case, the Judge Nunn's decision is not going to be easy. ''Can I possibly absorb all this stuff?'' he asked at the trial. ''I have a great problem with a great deal of the evidence.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SENATE TRADITION, MONDAY ABSENTEES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/senate-tradition-monday-absentees.html,"It was, Senator Orrin G. Hatch was saying this afternoon, one of the most important moments of this session of Congress, the first time that the merits of a Constitutional amendment on abortion had been debated in the Senate. But on this Monday, one of the hottest days of the sultry Washington summer so far, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, was at an economic development conference in Great Falls. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, was at a fund-raiser in Chicago. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, was on the Presidential campaign trail, wooing voters in the state of Washington. And Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota, was in Minneapolis, taping a television show and appearing on a radio call-in program. All together, according to a telephone check, 19 of the 100 Senators were either outside Washington or did not go to their offices today. It was, members of the Senate said, a rather typical Monday on Capitol Hill. ''It's not unusual,'' said Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. ''On Mondays we very seldom have roll-call votes and, as a consequence, many are out campaigning or attending to personal matters. I'm not prepared to say that's wrong.'' Criticism by Goldwater Historically, Senators have carefully guarded the traditions and folkways of Congress, not the least of which has been the custom of confining the major portion of the Senate's legislative work to the middle of the week. As a result, the ''Tuesday-Thursday'' week has become something of an institution. Senators frequently arrive in Washington late Monday or even Tuesday morning, and often depart after the completion of business on Thursday. Last week, however, Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, took to the floor to criticize the way the Senate has come to operate. ''The Senate is now run, really, on a Tuesday to Thursday evening basis, with the weekends given over to those people who feel that they must be raising money for a campaign still over a year away or who feel that they must be home every weekend in order to keep their fences mended,'' said Mr. Goldwater, one of the Senate's most respected veterans. ''Now, I do not happen to think either excuse is valid.'' Senator Goldwater himself was not in Washington today; he left to attend the funeral in Lockport, N.Y., of former Representative William E. Miller, his running mate in his unsuccessful 1964 campaign for the White House. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was ill and remained in New York. But the 19 others who found duties elsewhere knew late last week that they were, as a high Senate official put it, ''safe'' to remain outside Washington today. At Work in Wilmington Their party leaders told them that the debate on abortion was scheduled for today but added that the roll-call vote on the amendment was not scheduled until Tuesday. Thus Senator Alan Cranston of California, a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, was free to conduct sessions with senior citizens and environmentalists in Boston and to schedule a fund-raiser in the evening. And Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, could remain in his mountain cabin in Virginia. At the same time, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware worked out of his Wilmington office. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, delivered a speech in Hershey before the Pennsylvania Association of Boroughs, then visited a retraining program for steel workers. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, planned an appearance before the convention of the New Jersey Building and Trade Construction Council in Atlantic City and then the taping of a cable television program. And Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, was returning from Greece, where he delivered the commencement address at the American College there. Senator Walter D. Huddleston, Democrat of Kentucky, had one of the most active schedules. He was paid for a speech he made at the meeting of the North Carolina Coal Institute in Myrtle Beach, S.C., then flew to New York City, where he had scheduled a fund-raiser for his re-election campaign. ''A lot of the members don't feel pressure to stay here around the clock,'' said an aide to the Senate leadership. ''When you get down to Thursday you find that all these people have airline tickets out of here at 6. You can't do anything. They're ready to leave.'' Contact With Constituents Most members of the Senate believe legislators' work should not be confined to Washington. They contend, moreover, that they benefit substantially by speaking with their constituents and with local leaders. For example, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, gave a breakfast speech before the Rockland County Association and toured a detention center of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Brooklyn. Last week, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, urged that Senators curtail the time they spend in Washington. He suggested they spend more days in their home states and return to the ''citizen-legislator'' ideal envisoned by the Founding Fathers. A number of legislators believe, however, that these attendance problems underline the need for an overhaul of the way the Senate conducts its affairs. ''It's troubling that we do not attend to business here,'' said Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. ''We have responsibilities, and many of us live far from here, but many people rationalize not being here. We'd serve ourselves much better if we had rules that set out attendance patterns. This is not an efficient body.'' Senator Goldwater, critical of what he described as the body's ''bankers' hours,'' said Senators should begin work promptly on Monday morning, remain at it until Friday evening and work Saturdays if necessary. ''The last time I tallied it up, we had been in session 155 days and 50 of them had been spent at work,'' he said. ''I can tell you as a former businessman my business would not have lasted 155 days if I tried to work in that manner.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE OPENS DEBATE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/senate-opens-debate-on-abortion.html,"The Senate opened a highly unusual floor debate today over whether to amend the Constitution so that Congress and the states could ban abortions. While the sponsor of the measure involved, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, conceded he did not have the votes to win, he insisted, ''This is not an exercise in futility.'' ''This is the first step,'' said the Utah Republican. ''The women's suffrage issue took 93 years to resolve. We've only been at this 10 years,'' he added, alluding to the Supreme Court ruling that women are entitled to privacy to decide whether to have an abortion. The Senate has debated, and rejected, a number of proposed statutory restrictions on abortion, but has never before attempted a flat reversal of the Supreme Court through constitutional action. Two weeks ago the Court bolstered that decision by invalidating a number of state and local limits on abortion, leaving foes with little recourse outside a constitutional amendment. President Reagan assailed the latest ruling and called upon Congress ''to make its voice heard against abortion on demand whether by statute or constitutional amendment.'' Packwood Opposes Amendment But Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, said the Court's rulings should stand forever. ''The woman's right to make childbearing decisions is her right to bodily integrity,'' said Senator Packwood, who is leading the opposition to the amendment. ''Without that freedom there cannot be any equality for women.'' ''Those who are seeking to overturn the Supreme Court,'' he added, ''don't like the morality of that decision. It offends their personal or religious or other deeply held views. And they want to impose their morality on others who do not share their deeply held views.'' The amendment, which says, ''A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution,'' would require ratification by 38 states if cleared by Congress. It would not outlaw abortion, nor would it restore old laws struck down by the 1973 decision of the Court. But it would empower both the states and Congress to pass new bans or restrictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CELLS AND SOULS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/opinion/cells-and-souls.html,"While genetic engineering in humans seems close enough to justify public concern, we must not be swept away by fear of exaggerated dangers. Unfortunately, a broad spectrum of clergymen recently demanded a total ban on attempts at one kind of genetic engineering, germline intervention -that is, insertion of genes into a cell that will become an embryo. It was argued that a distinction cannot be drawn between medical and eugenic uses and that we should not try to eliminate defective genes because we have no right to tamper with evolution. In contrast to the apocalyptic tone of this discussion, a Presidential commission has realistically analyzed many conceivable dangers. Its excellent report, issued in December, strongly supported the goal of somatic gene therapy - that is, insertion of genes into body cells but not into germ cells (sperm or eggs). But the commission also expressed deep concern about changes perpetuated in future generations, because such intervention would open up the awesome prospect of directing future evolution of the species. The commission did not call for a ban but its position may have encouraged such a call. It is important to examine this evolutionary argument carefully and to identify the real issues. Let us consider parents who both carry a recessive gene for sickle cell disease along with the corresponding normal gene. A child who inherits the defective gene from each parent will have the disease, but a child with a single defective copy will not. Three methods for preventing or curing the disease are conceivable: identifying the double defect in an embryo by prenatal diagnosis, thereby giving the parents the option of abortion and another pregnancy (prenatal selection); replacing the defective gene in somatic cells after birth; or replacing it in the embryo. It is easy to see that all three approaches would influence evolution. Prenatal selection would encourage parents to produce carriers, while somatic correction would produce people with a healthy body but a double defect in their germ cells: Both would increase the frequency of the sickle cell gene in the next generation. Germline correction, in contrast, would decrease the frequency. If there were no other considerations, what sensible person would not prefer germline intervention, provided it is limited to therapy? But there are other considerations. First, the real longterm danger is that genetic engineering might be used not only for therapy but also to ''improve'' our blueprint people, according to somebody's plan. But somatic cells might also be manipulated for this purpose. And while the range of conceivable effects is broader for germline intervention, the important line to draw is that between medical and eugenic uses, rather than between somatic and germline cells. Fortunately, we are unlikely to face eugenic uses in this century, because the traits one might be tempted to manipulate, such as memory, intelligence or motor skills, are so complex, and involve so many genes, that the prospects for their meaningful control are very distant. While the evolutionary and the blueprinting arguments thus prove to be weak, there are other, overwhelming reasons not to proceed with germline intervention. First, where a corrective gene enters a chromosome it may interrupt some other important gene, producing a new hereditary defect. Moreover, while somatic therapy, in a person already sick, warrants a substantial risk, the manipulation of a cell that is destined to become an infant would require very stringent standards of reliability, far beyond what is in sight today. Finally, for a few diseases, so far, we already have a safe and simpler alternative method for reaching the same goal of preventing defective births: prenatal diagnosis and selection. For all these reasons, the motivation for altering the genes in an embryo is very slight. If we do not need a ban on germline intervention, do we need a permanent commission to monitor human genetic engineering, as Congress is considering? Probably not. A commission with such a narrow assignment might have to invent things to do. Its existence would likely arouse false fears, for there are always people eager to stir up anxiety, and genetics is a favorite target. Scary scenarios about manipulating our inner nature - our cells or souls - have wide appeal, and the resulting pressures could interfere with beneficial medical research. We should surely continue philosophic discussion of human applications on the excellent base provided by the Presidential commission. But since we are dealing with potential treatment of individuals, and not with possible large-scale or irreversible effects, we can afford to postpone legislation until a concrete problem comes into view.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prayer Amendment Endorsed,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/prayer-amendment-endorsed.html,"The Reagan Administration today formally endorsed a constitutional amendment restoring voluntary prayer to the classroom. Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults was among the witnesses, many from religious organizations, before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee is considering two proposals on school prayer. One, by the Administration, would overrule the Supreme Court and provide for voluntary prayer in the schools. The second, supported by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, and others, would allow silent prayer and meditation and guarantee students the right to meet for Bible study or prayer at school in non-class hours. ''To settle for a period of silent meditation is not really enough,'' Mr. Schmults said. Senator Hatfield said his ''equal access'' proposal would extend to high schools the right the Supreme Court provided two years ago for students to meet for religious purposes on university campuses. He said, however, that Federal courts in Texas and New York had ruled otherwise. He said schools set forums ''by which students may voluntarily associate to establish a camera club, music club or an athletic club or a philosophy club - to discuss Karl Marx or Hegel - but once they cross that boundary and begin to study Isaiah or Jesus Christ, then that becomes illegal.'' Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, opposed the amendment, saying the nation was founded on the concept of separation of church and state. He also said, ''With 13 million Americans unemployed, that the main issues in the Senate today have to do with abortion and prayer in the school is a rather sad commentary.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary; WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/nyregion/news-summary-wednesday-june-29-1983.html,"International Some U.S. sanctions would be lifted if Polish authorities permitted a revival of free trade unions, President Reagan said. Earlier, Administration officials said Poland had been informed that once the authorities took ''meaningful steps'' to liberalize conditions the United States would begin lifting the sanctions imposed when martial law took effect in Poland in December 1981. (Page A1, Column 5.) Palestinian rebel forces opposed to Yasir Arafat attacked his loyalists in what appeared to be the start of an attempt to take control of all Palestinian forces in Lebanon. The Palestinian press service, which is loyal to Mr. Arafat, said the rebels had killed 15 loyalists and wounded 20. (A1:4-6.) An offensive by Nicaraguan rebels involving 5,000 men now based in Honduras is set for next month, according to an insurgent leader. In an interview, he also said his organization meets regularly with United States intelligence agents and operates in consultation with the Honduran authorities. (A8:3-6.) National Increasing optimism on the economy was expressed by President Reagan as he declared it was ''beginning to sparkle.'' At a news conference at the White House, Mr. Reagan announced his Administration was revising upward its projection for economic growth in the fourth quarter of 1983 over the same quarter last year to 5.5 percent from the 4.7 percent increase it previously projected. (A1:6.) Ronald Reagan's campaign aides had repeated, secret access to strategy material prepared for President Carter, including debating tactics and other 1980 campaign plans, according to sheafs of information made public by the White House. Mr. Reagan told a news conference that he ''never saw anything of the kind'' in the Presidential campaign. (A1:4.) Anti-abortionists were rebuffed as the Senate rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have paved the way for state laws to curb abortions. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 50 to 49, 18 votes short of the two-thirds ratio required. (A1:1.) A prison sentence was invalidated by the Supreme Court on the ground that it violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In the landmark decision, the Justices, by a vote of 5 to 4, ruled that a sentence of life in prison without the posssibility of parole was excessive for the crime. The sentnce was imposed by a South Dakota judge on a man who had passed a bad check for $100 and had committed six previous nonviolent crimes. (A1:1-2.) The historic Supreme Court decision that struck down the so-called legislative veto last Thursday has jeopardized entire laws, not just their veto provisions, according to Stanley Brand, counsel to the House. In an interview, he said the imperiled laws included the War Powers Resolution and the budget process. (A19:1-2.) The debate about acid rain is being fueled by two fundamental changes. Scientists and public health officials increasingly regard the falling acids and the toxic metals associated with them as not only a threat to fish and forests but also to humans. As a result, there are many signs in Washington that the issue is no longer whether the Government should act, but rather precisely what it should do. (A1:2-4.) The B-1 bomber was bolstered by the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an unexpected shift, the panel restored $888.7 million in funds for the bomber, which had been opposed in subcommittee. The committee acted after Reagan Administration officials testified that a reduced inflation rate had freed additional money for weapons programs. (A10:1-2.) Acceptance of homosexuals is widely interpreted from a document accepted by the United Church of Christ. The document affirms the view that the homosexuality of a candidate for ordination should not be ground for refusing to admit that person to the church's ministry. (A10:4-6.) Metropolitan A section of a bridge collapsed on the Connecticut Turnpike at Greenwich, hurling four vehicles into the Mianus River, killing three people and injuring three. Residents of homes near the bridge said that pieces of steel and concrete had been falling from it for years. In recent days, they said, they felt not only the customary vibrations from the busy bridge but also unusual shrill noises. (A1:2-3.) A vow to ''rebuild New York'' was made by Governor Cuomo after the State Assembly approved, 138 to 4, a proposed $1.25 billion bond issue for revitalization of highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit. The bill was passed in the final minutes of the Legislature's 206th session. The Senate, which had recessed, is to take up the bond issue at a brief session on July 12 so it can be submitted to the voters on Nov. 8. (B1:6.) Ten airport employees were arrested on charges of accepting bribes from taxi drivers in return for preferential treatment at the busy taxi stands at Kennedy International Airport. The 10 arrested were six taxi dispatchers and four security guards. (B3:5-6.)

FOES OF ABORTION BEATEN IN SENATE ON AMENDMENT BID,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/us/foes-of-abortion-beaten-in-senate-on-amendment-bid.html,"The Senate today rejected a constitutional amendment that would have set the stage for laws to curb abortions. The vote on the 10-word amendment, stating simply, ''A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution,'' was 50 to 49, 18 short of the two-thirds majority required. Both houses of Congress must approve a constitutional amendment before it can be submitted to the states. For it to be added to the Constitution, three-quarters of the states must also approve it. Today's vote, the first in Congress on a constitutional amendment designed to restrict abortions, came after two days of occasionally emotional Senate debate. This latest phase of the Congressional struggle to construct a constitutional framework for the banning of abortions was led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.. Anti-Abortion Bill Expected Senator Hatch, speaking to reporters just after the vote, said the 49 votes his amendment attracted sent ''a message to the country that this is an issue that has to be resolved.'' Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who led the opposition to the constitutional amendment, said, ''This is the end of any serious effort to overturn the fundamental decision that a woman has a right to make a choice for herself.'' The defeat of the amendment set the stage for an effort by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, representing another point of view among abortion opponents, to offer another measure to curb abortions. Mr. Helms's measure was expected to be offered as either a bill or an amendment to a bill, and as such it would require a simple majority for passage. But as a law it would be subject to challenge in the courts. Abortion Rights Upheld Less than two weeks ago the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion, first defined by the court a decade ago in its Rowe v. Wade decision. The proposed constitutional amendment, referred to as the ''Human Life Federalism Amendment,'' would not, by itself, have curbed abortions. However, it would have permitted the states, and perhaps Congress itself, to pass legislation circumscribing the conditions under which an abortion could be obtained or banning the procedure. ''Although some may observe, correctly, that basic issues of individual rights are not subject to referendum in a free society, this, of course, begs the question, which is precisely what those rights are and what their relative priorities are,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''It is the resolution of these precise questions that is unlikely to occur in the absence of a constitutional amendment of the sort of the Human Life Federalism Amendment.'' The defeat of Mr. Hatch's proposed constitutional amendment does not remove the issue from the Capitol Hill agenda. Senator Helms is expected to offer his measure later in this session of Congress, and other abortion-related proposals are likely. Symbolic Goal Is Denied Mr. Helms, describing the proposed constitutional amendment as ''at best a Pyrrhic victory for the unborn,'' voted ''present'' and thus denied Mr. Hatch the symbolic goal of 50 votes. He and some antiabortion groups regarded the amendment as a tactical error and were critical of it because it did not provide for an outright banning of abortion. Judie Brown, president of the American Life Lobby, said many opponents of abortion ''wasted precious time'' on the amendment. ''We demand that they reassess their goals, listen to the grassroots people of this nation and support legislation which can be passed and will do something to stop this dreadful slaughter.'' Judy Goldsmith, president of the National Organization of Women, said the vote ''indicates that neither by constitutional amendment nor by statute can an unrepresentative minority force Government intrusion into the lives of individuals.'' This week's abortion debate was conducted on political, legal and emotional levels, with many members of the Senate framing the question in strict moral terms. Wide-Ranging Debate ''Abortion is a form of violence,'' Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, argued. ''It is condoned by a society that has become callous and indifferent to the ultimate value of human life. It is undergirded by a whole moral climate that elevates selfish personal convenience to a supreme status in human decision-making.'' Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, likened the proposed amendment to the 18th Amendment, which brought on the Prohibition Era earlier in this century and which, he said, was an ''attempt to impose the moral convictions of one segment of our society upon the rest.'' Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said he felt ''uneasy, as a man, determining for women whether they will have the right to a legal abortion since it is a decision I will never be asked to make.'' Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, one of two women in the Senate, said abortion ''is seldom, if ever, the right moral choice, but it should nevertheless be a choice.''

TIME TO VOTE: THE SOUND AND THE FURY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/us/time-to-vote-the-sound-and-the-fury.html,"Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a liberal Democrat from Queens, astounded his colleagues recently when he voted in favor of funds for the MX missile. The vote registered as a green light next to Mr. Ackerman's name on a huge tote board in the galleries, on which he is listed first among the 435 House members, and immediately the freshman lawmaker's friends converged upon him. They demanded an explanation. ''I was in my office and looked up and the bells were ringing and I had seven minutes to get to the floor and vote,'' Mr. Ackerman recalled. ''I ran over there, put my card in the slot and hit the wrong button.'' After his colleagues called attention to his mistake, he went to the well of the House and changed his vote. Mr. Ackerman was not the first House member to hit the wrong button. And if the chaos that surrounds most votes in the chamber continues, as seems likely since no significant changes in the procedure are being contemplated, he almost certainly will not be the last. House votes are mini-reunions, lasting 15 minutes, the time alloted for all members to get to the chamber and cast their votes. Hundreds of representatives arrive on the floor at once, disgorged from packed elevators. They mill around, renewing acquaintances, seeking informaton on the issue at hand, lobbying one another, exchanging gossip, making plans for racketball games in the House gymnasium. The Lights Are Dimmed Voting is electronic. Members put plastic cards in slots behind desks on the House floor, then press buttons to register a ''yea'' or ''nay'' vote. The lights are dimmed so that members can see their votes and those of their colleagues on the electronic tote board in the gallery. Although a member's vote on a key issue can affect re-election prospects, and although most members feel deeply about some principles, some do not make up their mind until the last possible moment, after the debate has concluded and just before the 15-minute voting period has expired. By that time, they have had the benefit not only of the debate, but also of knowing how most of their colleagues voted. Until she was defeated for re-election last year, Margaret M. Heckler, who is now Secretary of Health and Human Services, was noted for casting late votes on the House floor. Mrs. Heckler frequently took her cue from another Massachusetts Republican, Silvio O. Conte, who himself occasionally voted late and then changed his vote, in a playful effort to confuse his colleague. ''Essentially, she is not a shoot-from-the-hip person,'' said Roger Woodworth, who was Mrs. Heckler's press secretary on Capitol Hill and now serves as her special assistant and speech writer. ''She comes from a heavily Democratic district. She had to weigh an enormous number of factors. Often she did look up to see how everyone else voted. It was partly curiosity. If she was not a master of an issue, she would obviously look for the delegation's views.'' Paying Political Debts Senators also play games. The Senate Democrats, resentful at being assailed by Republicans for supporting a debt limit extension when Jimmy Carter was President, all voted against a debt limit extension sought by President Reagan. Then they changed their votes after a majority of Republicans, including the most conservative in the chamber, had gritted their teeth and voted for the new debt limit themselves. On some votes, members of both chambers are genuinely uncertain about what to do until the final moment. This morning, for example, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, counted only 47 Senate votes in support of his constitutional amendment that would allow Congress or the states to ban abortion. He picked up two supporters when the voting actually occurred. Similarly, Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, who lead the fight against the amendment, counted only 46 votes this morning, but picked up four additional votes in the course of the day. ''Occasionally you have a difficult issue, and people agonize over it,'' said Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. ''Then there are members who are always undecided. Some want to wait and see how others are going to go. Some want things for their district, and some are bent out of shape because something was handled badly by the Administration.'' ''The sheer volume of votes is so great that there's no way you can weigh each and every issue,'' he added. ''If Barber Conable tells you something on taxes, you can be sure it's solid.'' Mr. Conable, an upstate New York Republican who is the ranking minority member on the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''We have to shift gears seven times a day, and have not thought deeply about every issue.'' Thus, members look to experts for guidance. ''In every area of public policy you have people whose judgment you respect,'' Mr. Conable said. ''If you can't understand why they voted as they did, you go over and talk to them.'' Looking to the Experts ''On education, I look to John Erlenborn,'' Mr. Conable continued. ''On banking, Bill Stanton. On military appropriations, Jack Edwards. You ask, 'How come you voted for this turkey?' A lot of times you're surprised. A bill has been changed in conference.'' In every important vote, supporters and opponents of a measure station themselves just inside the doors of both the House and Senate, to seek to persuade those who can be persuaded. ''There are relatively few who are truly undecided on a major vote,'' said Representative Tom Loeffler of Texas, chief deputy Republican whip. ''They are the targets on close votes. We have them talk to the leaders, people with expertise, White House experts, agency experts.'' Exploiting a member's indecision are lobbyists who station themselves outside the House and Senate chambers and signal members with a thumb up or a thumb down. This also serves as a cue for members, who note who is doing the touting, and then decide whether they generally agree with the lobbyist. One pitfall, however, is appearing inconsistent in voting. As a precaution, a copy of previous roll-calls on similar issues is posted in the cloakrooms, so that members can see how they voted on the issue the last time around. ''You cast 1,000 votes in the Congress, and there's no way to know all you have to know,'' Mr. Cheney said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A TRIUMPH FOR THE 'ABORTION PURVEYORS',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/opinion/l-a-triumph-for-the-abortion-purveyors-007206.html,"To the Editor: The Supreme Court Justices have again ruled that the individual's constitutional right to privacy takes precedence over the right to life of her unborn (news story June 16). ocal or state officials may no longer legislate any regulations that are not justified for the woman seeking an abortion. The Court has again defended the interests not only of abortion-minded women but also of the $700-million-a-year abortion industry. President Reagan wrote recently that ''the American people will reject abortion and infanticide but not until the issue is clearly framed and presented.'' As obstetricians and gynecologists who have witnessed the miracle of birth thousands upon thousands of times and have seen these tiny human beings at all stages of their development, we know what President Reagan is talking about. It should be the duty of concerned obstetricians and health-care personnel to help educate the public as to what abortion really is. The courts have become increasingly more persistent in their attempts to modify the language and pass off abortion as another method of birth control, thereby expunging its age-old stigma. They are succeeding in their efforts. The United States now leads the world in the number of teen-age abortions - over 500,000 yearly. There are now more than 150,000 second-trimester abortions - the most grisly of all, the ones that some hardened abortionists refuse to do because the killing is so real and unmistakable. Abortion opponents, however, do not give up. More and more Americans are recognizing the abortion operation for what it really is: homicidal surgery on the most helpless of all human beings, the unborn. Something providential will happen to stop the killing. Education and enlightenment could do it. Laws protecting the rights of the unborn will follow. MATTHEW J.

Choice Is the Only Just Remedy,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/opinion/choice-is-the-only-just-remedy.html,"''This is not an exercise in futility,'' Senator Orrin Hatch said Monday after the latest effort to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision making abortion legal. ''The women's suffrage issue took 93 years to resolve. We've only been at this 10 years.'' Senator Hatch's choice of comparison was curious in the extreme. That it took 93 years for American women to win the right to vote is, of course, shameful. But so, too, is the 10-year effort to take away their right to decide for themselves whether to bear an unwanted child. The Senator's most recent contribution to the battle was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed Congress and the states to ban abortions. After it was beaten in the Senate Tuesday, Senator Hatch said its 49 ayes sent ''a message to the country that this is an issue that has to be resolved.'' On the contrary. The bill fell 18 votes short of the needed two-thirds majority, which shows it already has been. There is not, and perhaps never will be, an end to the abortion debate. Some people will always find it morally indefensible, others not. But those who oppose it need never choose to have abortions. Those who support the option should not be denied abortions because of the others' beliefs. In a perfect world, one in which there were no victims of contraceptive failure, ignorance or innocence, no woman would have to exercise it. Failing perfection, choice is the only just remedy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE NATION; ABortion Foes Overreach in The Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/weekinreview/the-nation-abortion-foes-overreach-in-the-senate.html,"In nearly a decade of Congressional debate, those who oppose Federal laws limiting a woman's right to abortion have been aided in no small way by squabbling among those who favor limitations. Such was the case again last week in the Senate, where a restrictive constitutional amendment lost 50 to 49, 18 votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority. Paul Brown, director of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee, said that his allies in the anti-abortion cause had unwisely applied pressure on Senators Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and Thomas F. Eagleton, a Democrat from Missouri, the sponsors of the 10-word amendment. The proposal stated that ''A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution.'' ''By pushing this futile amendment to the floor of the Senate,'' Mr. Brown said, ''the National Right to Life Committee and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have accomplished what the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America have not been able to do,'' he said. ''They have handed the pro-life movement the greatest single legislative setback in its 10-year history and have driven a mammoth wedge into the movement itself.'' Senator Jesse Helms, a Republican from North Carolina and a proponent of restrictions, said that the vote had been a blunder because support for passage clearly hadn't been there from the start.

Required Reading; Abortion and Responsibility,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/us/required-reading-abortion-and-responsibility.html,"Remarks of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, in Senate debate on the defeated constitutional amendment to allow Congress and the states to ban abortions, June 28, 1983: I was presiding yesterday when the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Eagleton) gave, I thought, a very thoughtful analysis of the constitutional history of this very troubling issue. I am not a lawyer so I am not able to speak to the legal aspects of this issue, but I am addressing my colleagues today as a colleague and as a mother. The national debate over abortion began long before I entered the Senate in 1979. Knowing this to be an issue about which feelings on both sides run deep, and believing it important that my position not be misunderstood, I stated my views on this issue at the outset of my campaign for the Senate. As I said then and have repeated many times since, I believe that abortion is seldom, if ever, the right moral choice, but it should nevertheless be a choice. I understand and respect the opinions of those who disagree with me. Nonetheless, I remain firm in my conviction that this issue is not one which is appropriately addressed in any legislative forum. The tragedy of abortion is one which should be dealt with in the home and church, not in Congress. In my view, one of the primary responsibilities of parenthood is instilling in one's children a sense of moral values. This is not the responsibility of Government, an institution which is clearly unsuited for such a function. Success or failure rests with the family, which is the single most important influence on the formation of the principles followed by an individual throughout his or her lifetime. If the family fails, it is folly to suggest that governmental fiat will make a measurable difference. An ordered society rests upon the concept of individual responsibility. As the Government itself assumes greater responsibility, its citizens are moved further from acknowledging responsibility for their own actions. I am one who believes that Government has already gone too far in intervening in areas better left to personal decision-making. This type of Government interference will serve only to further restrict personal choice and to invite the flouting of our laws. There are many times during which we as individuals must acknowledge responsibility for our actions, be they right or wrong. There are times when we need to think through the choices ourselves and arrive at independent decisions based not on outside mandates, but upon the values we hold from our own upbringing and our sense of moral rightness. Making a decision about abortion ranks in these categories. Many suggest that those who support choice are somehow endorsing abortion as a preferred option. This is ridiculous. Abortion is a tragedy which no one is actively promoting. There is no constitutional decision that makes abortion mandatory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ROLE OF 'BARNACLES' IN FOREIGN AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/us/the-role-of-barnacles-in-foreign-aid.html,"Congress doesn't want the Palestine Liberation Organization ''or any other guerrilla type organization that has engaged in acts of terrorism'' to receive foreign aid funds. Nor does Congress want to grant funds to Communist nations or to Afghanistan, Argentina, Chile, Angola or Turkey except in special circumstances. Nor does it want foreign aid to be used for family planning, abortions, gifts to officials of foreign governments or nations that are more than six months in arrears on repaying loans to the United States. These are among more than 100 restrictions, called ''barnacles'' attached to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and amendments to it. It is the current law governing the disbursement of foreign aid. The restrictions, which have accelerated in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate, are defended by Congressional supporters as the only way Congress can assert its influence over foreign policy. ''These things come about, in part, because of frustration with the executive branch,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana. ''It's a result of the activist stance of the Congress on foreign policy questions. Years ago there were few barnacles, because Congress was very passive, very compliant with the executive branch.'' Opponents argue, however, that the restrictions tie the hands of the President, who has the primary responsibility for formulating foreign policy. ''Everybody's a Secretary of State around here,'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. ''It's an exercise in power. You get a kick out of meddling in foreign policy. It's an aphrodisiac.'' Restrictions on El Salvador Most Congressional experts do not believe that these restrictions were affected by the recent Supreme Court decision invalidating the legislative veto. This is because they are part of the legislation signed by the President and do not enable Congress to halt Presidential actions after the fact. The most recent barnacles involved restrictions on military aid to El Salvador, which were adopted by both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Both panels recommended that the military sales be conditioned upon the President's certification of improvements in the areas of human rights and criminal justice, as well as upon efforts by the Salvadoran Government to enter into negotiations with opposition forces in an effort to achieve a political solution. ''It's a troubling thing,'' said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who wrote the El Salvadoran restrictions adopted by the Foreign Relations Committee. ''It seems to me that both the House and Senate are looking at these restrictions as ways of keeping our hand in shaping foreign policy.'' ''There's a real danger that we can get so involved in dotting the i's and crossing the t's that it's a little like the Lilliputians tying up Gulliver,'' she added. ''If Congress was involved earlier and more deeply, we might not have to resort to the restrictions.'' Presidents, quite naturally, resent Congressional restrictions. ''I don't think there's any secret of how anyone in the Administration feels about it,'' said L. Craig Johnstone, director of the State Department's Office of Central American Affairs. ''It isn't that we don't agree with what the conditions are, but they end up being unrealistic.'' Leverage Sometimes Welcomed ''The general trend is not healthy for the conduct of foreign policy,'' he continued. ''It decentralizes the decision-making process and makes it difficult for the President to to represent the country in the conduct of foreign affairs.'' But Presidents occasionally find that the restrictions give them welcome leverage in negotiating with other nations. The Administration itself proposed last March that foreign aid to Greece be conditioned upon a Presidential certification that the United States had achieved ''a satisfactory agreement with Greece in the current negotiations with respect to access to and use of military facilities in that country by U.S. forces.'' This restriction, adopted by Congress, was proposed in a letter from Powell A. Moore, Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations. Some restrictions are cosmetic. When Congress previously asked President Reagan to certify that the Salvadoran Government had made progress in human rights, for example, Mr. Reagan complied, although many in Congress and in the Administration doubted the accuracy of the certification. ''In the El Salvador situation, we were asking the President to certify the uncertifiable,'' Mr. Hamilton said, ''knowing that the President would do so. It distorted the whole debate.'' The barnacles have a way of remaining on the law books long after their usefulness has ended. In 1981, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tried to get rid of redundant, outdated restrictions, such as a Turkish arms embargo that had been suspended. But the symbolism of these restrictions proved potent, and the lawmakers were ''unwilling to take on the controversial ones,'' according to Larry Nowels, an analyst in foreign affairs at the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. Role of Congress Is Key The proliferation of such restrictions nonetheless causes considerable concern on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Senator John Tower, Republican of Texas, said: ''We may well be in a situation today which is analogous to that of the late 1930's, when America's inability to play a more active role in world affairs helped permit the Axis to realize its objectives without serious challenge. During this period, Congress tied the President's hands, with disastrous consequences.'' At the core of the debate is the question of the role of Congress in foreign affairs. Mr. Tower argues that 535 members of Congress, with different philosophies, regional interests and objectives, cannot forge a unified foreign policy that reflects the interests of the United States as a whole. Nor can they negotiate with foreign powers, meet the requirement for diplomatic confidentiality nor respond decisively to swift changes on the international scene. But others argue that the Constitution grants Congress certain powers that bespeak considerable involvement in foreign affairs. These include the right to declare war, raise an army and advise and consent to appointments. In addition, of course, Congress has the power of the purse. Consultation Recommended In their view, ''the barnacles are a legitimate and necessary exercise of our Constitutional responsibility,'' in the words of Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn. ''We learned in Vietnam that the President is not necessarily the fount of all wisdom. Congress has no monopoly on wisdom either. Prospects are enhanced when both Congress and the President play a role.'' Mr. Hamilton said that instead of the barnacles, ''the best thing would be consultation between the President and the Congress, but the executive branch usually has other things on its mind. The only way to get their attention is a restriction.'' Jerel A. Rosati, a professor of government at the University of South Carolina who previously studied the issue at the Congressional Research Service, concludes that despite widespread misgivings, the involvement of Congress will deepen. ''The days of constant Presidential supremacy in most areas of foreign policy appear to have come to an end,'' he said. ''Congressional involvement and influence will continue unless a global calamity occurs which creates a chronic and constant state of national emergency for the U.S.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FETAL RESEARCH: NEW FIELD OFFERS PROMISE AMID PROBLEMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/science/fetal-research-new-field-offers-promise-amid-problems.html,"MEDICAL scientists are confronting a new and potentially explosive issue: the treatment of human illness, particularly diseases of the brain and central nervous system, by transplanting tissue from aborted human embryos. Scientists whose research is likely to make such treatment possible in the future discussed the matter at a recent meeting in Brookline, Mass. They invited a theologian, a lawyer and a philosopher to join in the discussion. All three attested to the extreme importance of the issue and its potential for dividing the nation even while offering hope for treating some serious diseases that have defied all medical efforts in the past. The use of embryonic tissues might be able to correct such tragic conditions as paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury, as well as some currently untreatable disorders of the brain. Although no one knows how distant this prospect may be, research described at the meeting indicated that some applications are not necessarily reserved for the far future. The question of using human embryos or their tissues in medical procedures has arisen repeatedly in recent months. A frozen fertilized human egg cell was used this year to produce a pregnancy in a woman in Australia, where the attempt drew protests from antiabortion activists. (The pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion.) In the United States and elsewhere, animal experiments are being conducted with the long-range goal of perfecting a treatment for human diabetes by transplanting human insulin-producing cells taken from embryos. But the newly foreseeable possibility of transplanting human embryonic brain tissues adds an important dimension. Such transplants would probably have the largest application of all if they prove practical and effective in years to come. At the three-day meeting in Brookline last week, specialists in brain research discussed the possibility of using embryonic tissue transplants to accomplish such currently impossible goals as treating paraplegics whose spinal cords have been damaged and correcting the brain defects and degeneration of brain cells that accompany Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea and other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system. The treatments are not yet possible, but recent progress in animal research suggests that some applications might be realized within several years. Dr. Vernon Mark, a neurosurgeon at the Harvard Medical School and Boston City Hospital, said the moment medical scientists convinced themselves that the time had arrived to try any such clinical application, there would be a deluge of patients seeking repair of what are now irreparable losses of nerve and brain functions. ''We are not suggesting that this kind of clinical work will be applied tomorrow, or next year or three years from now or even within this decade,'' Dr. Mark said. ''We hope that it will. We can't predict when the crucial experimental data will be in.'' But he said it was by no means premature to discuss the social and ethical issues inherent in the research. ''I think that it is important to realize,'' he said, ''that in any kind of scientific meeting that emphasizes inquiry where so much is unknown, that the doubts, the caveats, the reservations are an important part of the development of the scientific process. None of us would be here if we did not have a fundamental optimism that the kinds of things we have talked about during the last three days will come to fruition.'' He and Dr. Thomas D. Sabin, a colleague at Boston City Hospital and Boston University, were the principal organizers of the conference, which was sponsored by the American Paralysis Association. Dr. Sabin emphasized that no attempts had yet been made to use human embryonic tissues for treating human brain problems and that no one could be certain how long it would be before they were possible. But he and others said research was progressing rapidly and that the effort had expanded greatly in recent months, with more and more research teams entering that field. Experiments Are Described One of the scientific highlights of the meeting was the description by Dr. Albert J. Aguayo, of Montreal General Hospital, of animal experiments in which nerves of the central nervous system, such as those of the spinal cord, were induced to grow along transplanted bridges of peripheral nerve fibers. This successful elongation of central nervous system fibers has only recently been achieved. Dr. Aguayo said there was evidence that natural electrical nerve impulses were being transmitted along these nerve fibers, but no evidence at all of restored function in the control of limbs paralyzed by damage to the spinal cord. One still unsolved problem is that when such a nerve cell extension re-enters the spinal cord or brain tissue, it seems to stop growing after only a few millimeters. Dr. Aguayo said many important questions remained to be answered before anything similar was tried in a human. Dr. William J. Freed of St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, and Dr. Carl W. Cotman of the University of California at Irvine separately reported success in transplanting brain tissue into animals, resulting in the production of nerve-signal transmission substances in regions of the brain where such production had been experimentally eliminated. In some cases the transplants have succeeded despite major genetic differences between the donor and recipient. Dr. Freed's studies involved transplants of brain cells that produce dopamine, the substance that appears to be missing or not properly used in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. In two cases, including one this year, surgeons in Sweden have tried a somewhat similar strategy in patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease. In each case, dopamine-producing cells were taken from the patient's own adrenal glands and transplanted into his brain. Scientists at the meeting in Brookline said reports from the Swedish team indicated that neither patient benefited from the attempt. Dr. Mark, Dr. Sabin and their colleagues recently tried an even more direct approach in one patient. They administered dopamine directly into a natural cavity called a ventricle in the brain of a Parkinson's disease patient. The disease was in an advanced state, the scientists said at the meeting, and the patient was no longer responding to the standard drugs. The medical team started with very small amounts of dopamine and increased them gradually to doses far greater than would ever appear in a normal brain. The researchers said they were surprised at the patient's physical tolerance of the heavy doses, but the therapeutic effects were disappointing. There was some diminution in the patient's abnormal muscle movements, but these modest improvements were accompanied by great mental confusion and other severe psychological effects. The circumstances strongly suggested that the excess of dopamine in the part of the patient's brain exposed to it was responsible for the adverse mental effects, the scientists reported. They said the result also suggested that tissue transplants to achieve an improved dopamine supply might be premature until more was known about the effects of administering the substance directly into the brain. Another implication may be the need for greater precision in delivering the dopamine to the regions of the brain where it would be most needed. Since the major focus of the meeting was on transplanting brain tissues as a potential treatment for human patients, the three main speakers at the session on ethical problems addressed primarily the problem of using tissues from aborted fetuses. The Rev. Paul Murphy, a Jesuit priest who is a retired professor of theology at Boston College, said such use could be morally defensible under some circumstances; for example, if the embryonic tissue came from a spontaneous abortion. On the other hand, he said, the future demand for such tissues could lead to ''a crass commerce in aborted fetuses.'' There could be abuses that would ''make the most dazzling triumph not worth having,'' he said. William A. Carnahan of the Washington law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & McRae said a serious problem arose from the fact that there was no moral consensus in the United States on abortion. It is a subject on which reasonable people disagree vigorously, he said. As a result, people who feel strongly on each side of the issue will use legal decisions as weapons in their fight to promote their own moral views, he said. Prof. Robert C. Neville, dean of humanities and fine arts at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said the prospects for important progress in using transplanted embryonic tissues put at odds two of the finest aspects of humanity: the urge to do good for others, on the one hand, and the deep concern for the independence and integrity of the individual, on the other. Among other imperatives for the future, he said, society should never allow conception and pregnancy to occur simply for the purpose of producing embryos for transplants. Yet just such a temptation may arise in the future, he said. Later, in a discussion period, Dr. William Regelson of the Medical College of Virginia said the whole issue of using aborted fetuses for tissue transplants might be rendered obsolete by the continuing stream of improvements in contraceptives and related birth control methods. In the future, there may simply not be enough fetal tissues available for the possible uses discussed at the meeting, he said. Dr. Regelson said there was a need for a strong research drive to develop improved methods of tissue culture so that cells and tissues could be grown directly in the laboratory for many uses. He also called for research aimed at making animal tissues compatible with the human body so that tissues from other species might someday be used for repairs of human organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE BUREAUCRACY; INFLUENCE OF SUB-CABINET CONSERVATIVES IS MIXED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/06/us/the-bureaucracy-influence-of-sub-cabinet-conservatives-is-mixed.html,"In a recent speech, President Reagan said, ''For the first time in half a century, we've developed a whole new cadre of young conservatives in Government.'' He was referring to the host of conservative Republicans who have been appointed to sub-Cabinet jobs in his Administration. The appointees, it now seems clear, have had mixed success. Some have boldly articulated conservative concerns and altered the direction of Government policy. Some have proclaimed the conservative point of view but failed to effect any significant change either because Congress balked, because the bureaucracy proved intransigent or because Federal courts stood in the way. ''The most important thing,'' said Susan Phillips, director of intergovernmental services at the Department of Education, ''is that we are getting second-line experience. Conservatives didn't have that experience before. We are learning how the bureaucracy runs. We now know how the Government goes about the process of giving away tax dollars. If we ever have an opportunity to be in those top-level, front-line positions, we'll know what to do.'' Miss Phillips is the sister of Howard Phillips, who is chairman of the Conservative Caucus, a lobbying and fund-raising group. She was recruited by Charles L. Heatherly, a Deputy Under Secretary of Education, who edited ''Mandate for Leadership,'' the Heritage Foundation's 1,093-page blueprint for change under a conservative President that was published just before Mr. Reagan took office. Tendency To Be Outspoken It is difficult to overestimate the importance of sub-Cabinet appointees. They define the character of an Administration, they control the levers of power and they tend to be more outspoken and zealous than the sober, cautious people Presidents normally select for Cabinet jobs. One of the more effective apostles of neoconservative views within the Reagan Administration is Michael J. Horowitz, counsel to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, whose scorn for liberal orthodoxy is sharpened by the knowledge that he used to subscribe to it. As a civil rights worker in the South, Mr. Horowitz staunchly defends President Reagan's record on civil rights, including his effort to replace three members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The Reagan nominees, he said, were ''far more distinguished'' than those they would replace. Mr. Horowitz likes to assail what he calls the ''conventional wisdom,'' enjoys a good debate and seems to have an instinctive attraction to controversy. He was the point man for the President's drive to abolish the Legal Services Corporation. He was, in his own words, ''blowtorched from the left, right and center'' when he tried to restrict ''political advocacy'' by organizations receiving Federal grants and contracts. And he showed remarkable prescience when he warned the President last year that ''we are being savaged by the fairness issue,'' referring to criticism about the impact of Mr. Reagan's budget cuts on the poor. More Difficulty at H.S.S. In his effort to bolster the intellectual underpinnings of the President's civil rights policy, Mr. Horowitz has had the assistance of two other conservatives: Michael M. Uhlmann, a White House adviser who follows legal issues, and Bruce E. Fein, who, as a Justice Department official, helped devise the legal strategy defending tax exemptions for private schools that practice racial discrimination. The Supreme Court rejected those arguments, but Mr. Fein has been given broader responsibilities in a new job, as general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission. Conservatives have had more difficulty changing the course of the Department of Health and Human Services, where the career civil servants are basically supporters of the programs Mr. Reagan wanted to cut. Conservatives had hoped that Marjory E. Mecklenburg, former director of a national anti-abortion group, would curtail Federal grants to family planning clincs and aggressively investigate reports of hospitals withholding care from infants born with severe defects. But Gary L. Curran, a spokesman for the American Life Lobby, said Mrs. Mecklenburg had generally been unable to make major changes as director of adolescent pregnancy programs. She and several other Reagan appointees at the department had solid conservative credentials, he said, but ''they got eaten alive by the technically more competent people who were buried in the Civil Service.'' Friends in the 'Religious Right' Robert Billings, a graduate of Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., served as president of the National Christian Action Coalition, a lobbying group for private schools, and as executive director of Moral Majority before joining the Department of Education in 1981. He now supervises the department's 10 regional offices. ''Like Barry Goldwater,'' he said, ''I hope I am Mr. Conservative at the Department of Education.'' He described the ''religious right'' as ''my constituents and my friends.'' But at the department, he said, he could not cite any concrete personal accomplishment that advanced the conservative cause. He boasted of reducing the size of his staff but said sheepishly, ''I am not high enough up the ladder to have had a lot of influence.'' William J. Bennett, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has tried to shift the emphasis of that agency's work away from shallow, contemporary studies back toward more rigorous, traditional types of scholarship. He deplores the fact that at many colleges ''course after course caters to contemporary fascinations,'' designed to foster the ''personal development'' of the student. Mr. Bennett has charted a straightforward conservative course for the agency and he receives high marks from many conservatives. By comparison, at a sister agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, headed by Francis S.M. Hodsoll, the changes have been marginal, by most accounts. Mr. Hodsoll has tightened up the administration of arts programs, but has not fundamentally altered the agency's philosophy or mission or its standards for awarding grants. He and other conservatives brought into the agency, including Ruth Berenson, a former art critic for The National Review, have been persuaded by the ''arts establishment'' that the case for Federal subsidies is somewhat stronger than they had initially thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All-Male Begin Cabinet Is Joined by a Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/06/world/all-male-begin-cabinet-is-joined-by-a-woman.html,"Sara Doron, a member of the Liberal Party, was inducted tonight as Minister Without Portfolio. She is the first woman to become a minister in Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Government. Her confirmation had been blocked for many months by religious hard-liners who objected to her views and by rivalries in the Liberal Party. The religious hard-liners were opposed to her votes in Parliament against restrictions on abortions and to her stand against legislation designed to invalidate conversions to Judaism made under the direction of non-Orthodox rabbis. Twenty-four hours before Mr. Begin presented the nomination to Parliament, the igorously Orthodox Agudat Israel Party made public a letter from the Prime Minister in which he pledged to do all in his power to assure a parliamentary majority for the religious position on conversions. The party's representatives followed the coalition line tonight and voted for Mrs. Doron. Opposition lawmakers accused the Liberals of having made a deal to drop their opposition to religious legislation in consideration for the party's votes for Mrs. Doron. The new minister said there had been no deal. Mrs. Doron, as Minister Without Portfolio, will take a seat that had been owed to the Liberals since last September when Yitzhak Berman resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the Government's failure to appoint a commission to investigate the Beirut massacre. A commission was later appointed. Another Liberal seat in the Cabinet became vacant after the death last month of Deputy Prime Minister Simcha Erlich.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/07/garden/hers.html,"THE headline in The New York Times of May 31 read ''Long Lives Seen as Threat to Nation's Budget'' and the story said that two economists had calculated that ''if all the people who died prematurely in 1978 from cancer, heart disease and violence (including accidents) had been able to reach their full life expectancy, the Federal Government would have suffered a net loss of $15 billion.'' These statistics (from the Federal Office of Management and Budget) came hard on the heels of a Reagan Administration proposal to shift the burden of support for the elderly from Government-funded programs to the elderly themselves and their children. As with the ''squeal rule'' designed to deal with teen-age sex, the impact of the President's notion is guaranteed to wreak havoc on the American family. It also bespeaks a dangerous naivete about how American families function (or fail to) in 1983. Families are dispersed, ties slacken; families are smaller so fewer people share in the cost of supporting the elderly. More women have joined the work force so fewer look after the aged at home. Neither official pronouncement is designed to make an older person feel exactly wanted. Should we be so gauche as to survive the geriatric assaults on our health, then the Federal Government would judge us un-American. If this is indeed a covert declaration of war on the elderly, I say let's strike back. We're 24 million strong, but to make a dent on official Washington we've got to change our public image. The gun, tobacco, oil, bank - you name it -lobbies don't have to worry about their images; they move through Capitol corridors with confidence and wads of century notes. The old have nothing going for them but their vast numbers. Let's face it: we're our own worst enemies. We've made self-pity our trademark; our favorite prop is the tin cup. We've got to wipe that apprehensive look off our faces, stop complaining about the steep steps on buses, stop describing our triple bypasses to anyone who will listen, stop gushing gratitude when someone gets up to give us a seat. We must sit straight , stand tall and put a gleam in our eyes. Why not think of ourselves as aging bodies with Jane Fondas screaming to get out? Granted, to come by this formidable image will take effort; we'll have to nourish and exercise our bodies, souls and brains, and the earlier we start in life the better. There was a time, long ago, when the old were revered for their wisdom. As wisdom's credit grew smaller and smaller, the old began, with predictable obstinacy, to live longer and longer. The acute irony here is that the self-same science that made wisdom obsolete added decades to man's life. And now we learn that with every added year of old age we are hammering yet another coffin nail in the American economy. Uncle Sam's digit is pointed at us, the senior citizens, and he's saying: ''I want not only the young, but you, the old, to die for their country.'' The debate over the elderly poses medical and philosophical questions of global dimensions. The medical aspects are simpler for they deal with the fairly well-known properties of the aging human body; the philosophical ones start waves that pound at every nook and cranny of human existence. Some doctors in geriatric medicine concentrate simply on curing the diseases of the old, with little concern for its cost or the patient's general well-being; others extend their attention to include the quality of home care, nursing homes, hospices, leisure, diet and exercise, long-term care in hospitals and the appropriateness of ''heroic interventions'' in elderly patients. I talked recently to several geriatric specialists in Boston and Houston. All were eager to talk about their specialties, but when I asked them to consider the larger implications of geriatric medicine they had less to say. Dr. Baruch Brody, a doctor of philosophy and director of the Center for Ethics, Medicine and Public Issues at Houston's Baylor School of Medicine, came closest to answering my queries. ''We must rethink the last year of life because it accounts for 30 percent of all Medicare costs,'' he said. ''I realize there may be abuses, but we will invariably go down that road. We must ask ourselves: Are we using too much high-tech medicine on the elderly? In Europe generally, kidney dialysis is out of the question for the elderly; in Britain bypass surgery is not used just to relieve pain. We will have to begin to ask: What are we buying? Is it appropriate? And just in time the hospice movement is pointing the way to better treatment for the terminally ill.'' Dr. Brody also favored earlier retirement to make room for the young. ''Young scholars without jobs would like to lynch Claude Pepper!'' he said with some heat. To compensate for the longer postjob years Dr. Brody would educate people to think beyond their jobs into the rewarding uses of leisure. ''We are too job-oriented in this country. There are so many other things to be and do.'' Unresolved questions remain, for instance: If you believe that nature (some would call it God) has a plan, does the plan also encompass the planet's going bonkers and threatening to blow itself to bits? Does nature truly intend man to self-destruct? It provided him with the resources, both natural and intellectual, to achieve the nuclear age, but the package failed to include a solution for the disposal of its wastes. Meanwhile, the life force refuses to bow to the death wish. Man - and woman - are hell-bent to put ever more people on the planet. Wars and pestilence no longer control the earth's population. Yet we annually give birth to millions of redundancies as the gap between what people are able to do and what needs doing inexorably widens. Our search for that elusive Quality of Life continues to stagger under the weight of sheer Quantity. We know how to control the number of those coming into the world. Will we learn how to control those on the way out and how to make distinctions between the personal claims of compassion, duty and guilt, and the larger, more intractable demands of society?. Doctors have been using euphemisms like ''triage' ' and ''gate-keeping decisions,'' and of course euthanasia has been around for a long time. Having been given the right to choose contraception and abortion, will we in the next century be given the right to choose death? As a family, mine has been through the lingering deaths of several aged relatives and viewed them all with a certain skepticism. It was not only the wasted resources involved but the more nagging question of the ethics and logic of prolonged dying. No question about it: the aged are going to be a burning issue for the foreseeable future. We ask only that we be made party to the discussions that affect our very lives. Reagan may jocosely include himself among the elderly, but his proposal sounds perilously like a bid to American breadwinners to slip their aged relatives a Mickey Finn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TEACHERS' MEETING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/07/us/reporter-s-notebook-teachers-meeting.html,"The ghost of Ronald Reagan seemed to fill the vast Civic Center here for the five days of the National Education Association's convention. Though the President was 3,000 miles away in California, he was the bete noire around whom this meeting, which ended today, often seemed to be revolving. Mr. Reagan, a strong critic of the association, was repeatedly castigated and ridiculed. There was even a move to defeat an item simply because it included the President's name, which someone said ''should never be mentioned in an N.E.A. document.'' The Maine delegation took advantage of the rancor to raise some money to defray its convention costs. Mr. Reagan's espousal of merit pay for teachers has particularly rankled the association, and the Maine representatives sold hundreds of buttons reading: ''Try Merit Pay in the White House.'' ''It's a hot item,'' Paula M. Gaudet, a second grade teacher in Winthrop, Me., said. ''We sold a good one last year, too. But too many delegates didn't get the joke; maybe they're too young. That one said, 'Jane Wyman Was Right.' '' One of the complications facing the association's convention planners has been the organization's ban on meeting in any state that did not ratify the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, which expired last year for want of ratification from enough states. Such convention cities as Chicago, Atlanta and Miami Beach were off limits, making it difficult to find places to accommodate 8,000 delegates and thousands of family members. This week, however, the association quietly voted to remove the ban, concluding that its ''continuation would do little to promote the chances of the new E.R.A. in the Congress and in state legislatures and could prove organizationally burdensome to N.E.A.'' Did the association, widely known as an advocate of liberal causes, back down from its principles? ''No,'' said Robert E. Harman, the group's communications director. ''The issue is moot and states can't do anything about it anymore.'' The association's meeting, with its campaigns for office, banners, funny hats and lengthy floor debates, is like a national political convention. Adding to this resemblance is the proliferation of caucuses. Each of the 50 states has a caucus. There are other kinds as well, caucuses that cross state lines for teachers who are women or military veterans, for example, advocates of peace and opponents of abortion. There are caucuses for American Indian, Hispanic, Asian, Jewish and Irish teachers. One of the newest is the Slavic Caucus. ''At first people laughed,'' said Robert F. Oravetz of Shippensburg, Pa., who organized the group and is its president. But now, said Mr. Oravetz, whose grandparents were born in what became Czechoslovakia, the caucus is taken seriously and has grown to 177 members. The caucus won approval for a resolution backing Solidarity, the banned independent union in Poland. One of the caucus meetings this week was at the Warsaw Cafe, where members dined on borscht, Transylvania casserole and palachinki, a kind of crepe. Mr. Oravetz was elated the other day over the newest member. ''We just got our first Albanian,'' he said. A gathering this large seems conducive to the promulgation of weighty pronouncements, and scattered through the agenda were business items deploring the threat of nuclear war, calling for an improved system of health care and denouncing apartheid in South Africa. Though sympathetic to these goals, some delegates tried to get the delegates to give priority to debating purely educational issues. They were concerned that, as has happened in the past, items at the tail end of the agenda, including some dealing with compelling educational issues, would remain undiscussed for another year. ''Consideration of collective bargaining issues for teachers should have precedence over whether we support World Children's Day, for example,'' said Betty Kraemer, a sixth grade teacher in Berkeley Township, N.J. ''When all of our professional issues have been addressed, then, and only then, should we start solving the world's problems.'' The move was defeated, and the association continued solving some of the global ills. Among those who came to the convention to talk with the teachers about the condition of education were several of the contenders for the Democratic nomination for President, . Priscilla McGuire, a high school history teacher in Colebrook, N.H., expects to get a double dose of these speeches when the candidates descend on her state for the first Presidential primary. She is starting to wonder, though, when some politican is going to do something about what she considers the greatest single problem in education: salaries. ''We continually hear the rhetoric and I'm waiting for one of them to put his money where is mouth is,'' said Miss McGuire, who at the age of 36 has been teaching 14 years and has an annual salary of $13,600. ''That's the problem with education in this country.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STANFORD'S ADVISERS REAFFIRM DISMISSAL FOR ANTHROPOLOGIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/08/us/stanford-s-advisers-reaffirm-dismissal-for-anthropologist.html,"A special panel of professors has found that Stanford University was justified in dismissing a graduate student last winter because of his conduct while working in China, the school said yesterday. The three-member panel said that the behavior of the student, Steven W. Mosher, showed ''a pattern of dealings that involved deliberate disregard for the law'' of China and a ''manipulative approach toward the people with whom he was living and working'' in a Chinese village. The panel also accused Mr. Mosher of a ''serious lack of candor in his dealings with his supervising professors.'' This behavior was incompatible with being an anthropologist, the professors concluded. But the panel left unresolved the question of what the exact charges and evidence were about Mr. Mosher's activities in China. Evidence Remains Sealed The panel contended that a secret 47-page report on the Mosher case by an investigating committee of the Stanford anthropology department, which contains the charges and evidence, ''should remain confidential.'' Disclosure would be ''inadvisable for ethical considerations relating to the welfare of other persons,'' the panel said, without specifying who the others involved were. The panel was set up by Dean Norman K. Wessels of Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences in May to review a grievance Mr. Mosher had filed against the school for his explusion from its Ph.D. program. It consisted of two professors emeritus from Stanford, Gordon Wright, a historian, and Ernest Hilgard, a psychologist, and Ward Goodenough, a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. The Mosher case has touched off a dispute about academic freedom and raised questions whether Stanford bowed to pressure from Peking and some American China scholars to retaliate against Mr. Mosher. Mr. Mosher, 34 years old, did his field work in a village near Canton in 1979 and 1980 and gained access to an unusual collection of local government documents that the Chinese regarded as confidential. The Chinese were angered by his activities and made charges including smuggling and bribery. Mr. Mosher also published an article in Taiwan about the issues of forced abortion and infanticide in rural China, and many American scholars tied this action to the official Chinese decision to cut off American field work. Mr. Mosher now lives in Taiwan and could not be reached by telephone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POWER OF WOMEN'S VOTE CITED AT CONVENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/us/power-of-women-s-vote-cited-at-convention.html,"The 2,000 women attending the National Women's Political Caucus convention here were told in opening ceremonies today that women could elect the President in 1984. ''You have the power to determine who will fill elected positions from the courthouse to the White House,'' said Gov. Mark White of Texas, a Democrat, who acknowledged that he was elected in 1982 because of women's support. ''Your power cannot be denied.'' A few minutes later, Bella S. Abzug, the former Democratic Congresswoman from Manhattan, received a standing ovation when she told the audience, ''Women will decide who the next President of the United States will be.'' 1984 Elections the Theme The Governor and Mrs. Abzug were among several speakers who addressed the delegates at the Arneson River Theater on the banks of the San Antonio River. They set a theme of the four-day national convention: how women can use their voting tendency to their political advantage in the 1984 elections. Polling data show that women vote for Democrats more than men do. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, for example, 57 percent of men and 39 percent of women said they approved of Mr. Reagan's handling of the Presidency. Five of the six major declared candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination will speak Sunday. They are former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senators John Glenn of Ohio, Gary Hart of Colorado, Alan Cranston of California and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida declined to attend the convention. Kathy Wilson of Alexandria, Va., the 31-year-old head of the caucus, said the organization would make no Presidential endorsement this weekend. ''But if President Reagan doesn't change his policies towards women,'' she added in an interview, ''we may make an endorsement in 1984.'' The bipartisan organization has never endorsed a Presidential candidate. Reagan Is Denounced Mrs. Wilson said the Reagan Administration had employed a ''superficial, Band-Aid approach to women's issues.'' She criticized the President's anti-abortion stand, his opposition to the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and what she called his refusal to address the economic needs of women. In a statement distributed at the convention, caucus leaders charged that Mr. Reagan's ''programs and policies have systematically eroded or eliminated the gains of over two decades.'' Because of his awareness of ''potentially devastating'' opposition from women, the statement says: ''President Reagan has tried to portray himself in recent months as a man committed to fairness and equality for American women. But the President's deeds belie his words.'' Republican for the Defense One Reagan supporter at the convention is Betty Heitman of Louisiana, the co-chairman of the Republican National Committee. She acknowledged that some Republican women were disenchanted with Mr. Reagan because of his opposition to the equal rights amendment and abortion. ''But I think he has a good record on equal rights for women,'' she added. ''He just doesn't do a good job of publicizing it.'' Mrs. Heitman cited as examples ''the virtual elimination'' of the estate tax laws, which used to force many widows to sell their homes, farms or businesses; changes in the Federal Individual Retirement Account Savings Act, which she said made it easier for women to retire, an increase in child-care tax credits for working mothers and new programs for female owners of small businesses. The caucus, founded in 1971, is dedicated to getting women into political office. Its 77,000 members make it the country's second largest feminist political organization, behind the National Organization for Women, which has 200,000 members. According to the caucus's statistics, there are now 992 women in state legislatures, up from 362 when the caucus was formed. Women also hold 24 seats in Congress, as against 15 in 1971, and are mayors in 76 cities with populations over 30,000, up from seven in 1971.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HELMS AND ANTI-HELMS CAMPAIGNS GOING STRONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/us/helms-and-anti-helms-campaigns-going-strong.html,"It was a cross between a prayer breakfast and a political rally. ''Jesse Helms is a national treasure,'' the Rev. Jerry Falwell told a group of 250 ministers and lay leaders. They responded with a chorus of ''Praise the Lord'' and ''Amen.'' ''Jesse Helms is the most important man in Washington, besides the President, in the cause of leading this nation back to moral sanity,'' Mr. Falwell continued. ''Can you imagine if we had 100 Jesse Helmses in the U.S. Senate? My, my.'' The audience responded with hosannas when the Senator said, ''I'm not doing a thing in the world in the Senate that you would not do if you were there.'' He cited his opposition to abortion and his support of school prayer and ''profamily, promoral'' legislation, a strong national defense and military aid to El Salvador. Ministers as Registrars The breakfast was the next-to-last stop in a two-day voter registration drive in which Senator Helms, 61 years old, joined Mr. Falwell, the leader of Moral Majority, at stops in Asheville, Charlotte, Wilmington and Raleigh. The objective was to use the churches as voter registration centers and enlist the ministers and lay leaders as registrars. ''We plan, minimum, to enroll 200,000 new voters in the state by next year,'' Mr. Falwell told the audience. ''And we're talking about the kind of people who make a difference.'' A similar drive has been initiated by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who is leading a nationwide effort and is himself considering seeking a Presidential nomination. In North Carolina, he said, he will use the black pulpits in an effort to register 200,000 voters, with the express purpose of turning Mr. Helms out of office. Senator Helms's probable opponent for the Senate next year, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., 45 years old, is a moderate Democrat who, like Mr. Falwell, hopes to make Jesse Helms the central issue in the campaign. 'They've Been Embarrassed' ''People feel deeply about the kind of representation we've had in Washington,'' Mr. Hunt said in an interview. ''They've been embarrassed.'' A poll published last week by The Charlotte Observer showed Mr. Hunt leading Mr. Helms by 50 percent to 31 percent, with 6 percent favoring other candidates. The poll found the Governor's support ''deep and wide,'' with solid support among all voter groups. The campaign pits the most prominent politician the state has produced since Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. against a popular but cautious Governor. ''The Governor is as difficult to categorize as North Carolina,'' said Gary Pearce, his press secretary. ''It's a morally conservative state, but in terms of health care and education, it's a progressive state.'' Strong Showing by Democrats Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 1, and last year they ousted two Republican members of the United States House of Representatives. Democrats say the state's two conservative Republican Senators, Mr. Helms and John East, are political aberrations. The campaign has already become a national one. Conservatives around the country have contributed to Mr. Helms's re-election bid, which Mr. Hunt estimates will cost $14 million, a figure Mr. Helms disputes. Liberals and moderates from other states have assisted Mr. Hunt, thereby providing grist for the Helms for Senate Committee. The committee has sponsored advertisements quoting the Governor as saying that out-of-state campaign contributions create ''obligations you ought not to have'' and showing photographs of Mr. Jackson, Julian Bond, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Sol Linowitz and several labor leaders who support Mr. Hunt. Accusations of Racism Some Democrats charge the advertisements are racist, in the word of David Price, a professor of political science at Duke University who is expected to be elected Saturday as chairman and executive director of the state Democratic Party. But Thomas F. Ellis, a Raleigh lawyer who is Mr. Helms's chief political aide, said, ''The greatest example of racism is Jesse Jackson, when he says we've got to register 200,000 blacks to put Helms out of a job.'' The Governor has won acclaim for bringing industry into the state, where the 8.4 percent unemployment rate is below the national average. He has also stressed education, improved the state university system and created a North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, modeled after the Bronx High School of Science. The Governor describes himself as a fiscal conservative. He opposes abortion but believes a woman should be able to make her own decision. He says, ''Children should be able to pray in school as they do in homes, not with politicians making up the prayers.'' Mr. Helms told the breakfast rally, ''We have it in our hands to turn this country around. I've often been accused of trying to turn the clock back, and that is correct. I'd like to turn the clock back to where the Constitution meant something.'' Both candidates say they have not fully made up their minds to run. But each could have his party's nomination for the asking, and their aides believe the die is cast. Mr. Ellis said that unless the political climate changed mightily in the next several months Mr. Helms would definitely run. Though Mr. Hunt has said he is hesitating for lack of funds, Mr. Pearce said, ''It clearly looks like the money will be there, and he'll run.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROPOSAL FACES SHOWDOWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/nyregion/initiative-and-referendum-proposal-faces-showdown.html,"NO ONE blurts them out immediately, but the words ""Proposition 13"" inevitably creep into almost every discussion of a proposal to grant powers of initiative and referendum to New Jersey voters. Proposition 13, which clamped a ceiling on California property taxes and limited reassessments, symbolizes the possibility that New Jersey citizens, if so empowered, would tamper with the state's tax structure and other fiscal policies. A proposal to amend the State Constitution to provide for citizen initiative and referendum has been passed in the Senate, but faces a shaky future in th Assembly. It must be approved by the lower house by the first week in August if it is to appear on the November ballot. Under the Senate-approved measure, bills and constiutional amendments could be initiated by direct petition from a requisite number of voters and placed on the ballot in the form of referendums. Petitioners, however, must first seek a legislative vote on their proposal. If the Legislature does not act within six months, the question would then be placed on the ballot in the ensuing general election. Initiative and referendum laws already exist in more than half the states in the nation. It was the proces sof initiative and referendum that enabled California voters to pass Proposition 13 in 1978, with the result that municipalities were faced with the loss of more than half their revenue. Although tomorrow is expected to be the last day of the present legislative session, Samuel V. Perelli, chairman of United Taxpayers of New Jersey, and Joanne Oser, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of Common Cause, have asked Governor Kean to call a special session to force the measure to a vote. Governor Kean was the sponsor of an initiative and referendum bill of his own in 1977, when he was a n Assemblyman. Senator John H. Dorsey, Repulbican of Boonton Township, who was also an Assemblyman at the time, was co-sponsor. Mr. Dorsey maintained his interest in the matter after his election to the Senate, and is sponsor of the current Senate bill. Richard A. Zimmer, Republican of Flemington, is the sponsor of a parallel bill in the Assembly. The proposals are described by the legislators as bills, although technically they are resolutions asking that a proposed amendment to the State Constitution be placed before the voters. Mr. Perelli said he began his campaign for initiative and referendum when his organization, United Taxpayers, failed in its efforts to prevent a state income tax. ""We collected one million signatures and presented them to the Legislature, but our efforts made absolutely no difference,"" he said. ""I asked myself how it was possible to collect a million signatures and have them count for nothing."" Mr. Perelli says he fears that initiative and referendum will fall by the wayside also as the result of efforts by the Assembly Speaker, Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of Sayreville. Mr. Karcher has introduced his own version of the Dorsey bill, but with changes that Mr. Perelli feels render it ineffective. Mr. Karcher's proposal would exclude from the process of initiative and referendum ""laws regarding elections, legislative and Congressional redistricting and apportionment, appropriation of money, raising of revenue and limitations on government expenditures."" The Karcher bill also would make it harder to gather signatures on any petition for referendum and would require that the proposal be thrown out if the courts find anyt part of it unconstitutional. Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Zimmer immediately denounced the Karcher measure. Mr. Karcher said that he supported the ""concept"" of initiative and referendum, but that he wanted to spare the state some of the programs that its proponents favor. ""The whole thrust of this matter so far is repeal of the state income tax, repeal of the sales tax and repeal of the 20th century,"" he said. Mr. Karcher added that initiative and referendum also could be used to limit the amount of money available for garbage collection, libraries or salaries for teachers, police officers and firefighters. And he said that it could bar the use of public funds for mass transit or divert the use of casino gambling proceeds from projects for the elderly to other special interests. Mr. Dorsey has his own ideas about how initiative and referendum could be used in New Jersey. ""Sure, we could have our own version of Proposition 13,"" he said, ""but we could also use the measure to eliminate some departments in state government. For instance, some of us have been dissatisfied with ways in which the Public Advocate's office has been functioning."" ""Another issue,"" Mr. Dorsey said, ""is the bottle bill, which has been introduced every year since 1973 but has never been released from committee in either house."" That measure, which would require a deposit on all glass bottles to help reduce litter, has been opposed by glass manufacturers. Mr. Zimmer said that Congressional redistricting was also a possible subject for citizen referendum. ""The Legislature has done a terrible job of gerrymandering the Congressional districts, and it was a conflict of interest for the Legislature to have attempted it,"" he said. ""This was a job for an independent panel exclusive of active politicians."" One of the strongest opponents of initiative and referendum is the New Jersey Education Association, which fears that a reduction in taxes could play havoc with the public schools. ""There could be movements to take money out of teachers' salaries or pensions or to end systems of tenure and permanent certification,"" said Robert P. Brokerick, a spokesman for the association. ""The schools could be decimated by any number of measures dealing with the rollback of taxes."" Michele HOfman, legislative analyst for the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, which also opposes initiative and referendum, said that her organization feared referendums on hazardous wastes, utility rates and business taxes. ""These matters are better left to the legislative process,"" she said. The New Jersey League of Women Voters has come out in support of initiative and referendum, even though it believes its own interests could be jeopardized by the process. Gloria J. Jones of Sparta, the league president, said initiative and referendum could allow an anti-abortion law to be brought up for citizen vote. The league is in favor of the right to choose abortions. ""Democracy is a dangerous business,"" Mrs. Jones said. ""We want the country to be ruled by the wishes of the majority."" Frank W. Haines, executive director of the New Jersey Taxpayers Association, which represents the state's larger coporations on taxes and limitations on spending,"" he said. Robert Geary, spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a 12,000 - member lobbying organization that opposes initiative and referendum, said that the first initiative would most likely be a freeze on utility rates or automobile insurance. 'We think there are better ways to bring down rates than a referendum,"" he said. Mr. Perelli agrees that the high cost of automobile insurance is ""a raging issue."" He said that voters might also wish to eliminate motorvehicle inspections. Mrs. Oser said that Common Cause favored initiative and referendum because ""New Jersey is ripe for reform."" She said that other subjects that might come up for votes were the creation of citizen utility boards and nuclear freeze and Sunday blue laws. The New Jersey Federation of Senior Citizens also has come out in favor of initiative and referendum. Other groups opposed to the measure include the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., the New Jersey Builders Assocation, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Communication Workers of America, which represents state employees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPAIN SEEKS VOICE IN CHURCH SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/world/spain-seeks-voice-in-church-schools.html,"The Spanish Government, venturing into a head-on conflict with the Roman Catholic Church, is working on legislation to change the operations and character of thousands of parochial schools. The new law would change the system for state subsidies to the schools, regulate standards for student admission and hiring of teachers and give parents and students a powerful voice in administrative decisions. The law poses potentially far-reaching effects, since a third of all Spanish pupils attend religious schools. Most are run along traditional lines, with strict discipline, total control vested in the administration, a heavy emphasis on Catholic doctrine and few modern subjects. The conservative, church-oriented press calls the furor over the law ''the scholastic war.'' The bill, titled the Law of the Right to Education, has been approved in draft form by the Cabinet and will come up in Parliament in the fall. The Battle Lines Are Drawn Since the Socialists have a commanding majority, passage is certain. Already the battle lines are drawn, with the Government on one side and the conservative Popular Alliance Party and various Catholic groups such as the Association of Catholic Parents and Teachers on the other. The struggle, most observers believe, will be even more bitter than the battle over the Government's bill to remove criminal penalties in cases of therapeutic abortions. The Government says it is out to modernize and make rational the educational system, which is split between public and private schools, to ''bring it into the 20th century.'' ''In a modern society, tolerant and pluralistic, schools can no longer be what they were 30 years ago,'' said Jose Maria Maravall, Minister of Education and Science. The opponents of the law make much of what they call ''the right to choose a Catholic-inspired education'' and attack the law as unwarranted state interference. Foes See a Sinister Motive The hidden motive, these groups suggest, is to secularize education or to starve out the religious schools so that the ability of parents to select a religious or secular education for their children will be subverted. ''They are copying the line of Eurocommunism,'' said Maria Jose Fernandez, vice president of the Spanish Federation of Religious Instruction. ''In no other country with a system of state subsidies are such conditions imposed on the schools administration.'' This assertion is disputed by Government officials, who point out that state subsidies without control have long been unique to Spain. They say that the new law simply sets down minimum standards and regulations for private schools that want to continue receiving money from the state. In a sense, the issue is a byproduct of the years of neglect for social services under the nearly 40 years of Franco dictatorship. With a woefully inadequate number of public schools, the church was given major rights and responsibilities in the field of education for both practical and ideological reasons. The church's influence, even at university level, gave it considerable power in shaping Spanish society. State Schools Are Overcrowded Today, with universal and compulsory education up until the age of 14, the public system cannot handle all the pupils so the private system is a necessity, not a luxury. About 1.6 million pupils attend private schools, a higher proportion than in any other country in Europe except the Netherlands and Belgium. About 60 percent of the 3,600 private schools are run by the church. Although the Government provides direct subsidies it has had until now virtually no control over how the money is spent or what kind of instruction is given. The state subsidies to private schools, which began in 1970, were initially small but grew rapidly in the last decade. In 1982 they amounted to more than $750 million. Under the present system, the private school receives its grant by entering into a four-year or five-year contract with the state, which simply hands over the money to the sponsoring institution, in most cases a church. The system is open to abuse since many churches hire teachers on nine-month contracts and are free to use the remainder of the statesupplied salary money for other purposes. Salaries Directly to Teachers The new law would have the state pay salaries directly to the teachers and other subsidies directly to the schools' administrations. Even more importantly, the funds would be distributed on the basis of whether the private school is really needed - if it is in an area already covered by a public school it runs the risk of having its state subsidy reduced or eliminated altogether. ''The money will keep on flowing, but on a more rational basis,'' Mr. Maravall said in an interview. ''We shall know where it goes. The windows will finally be open.'' ''The state cannot cover the whole level of compulsory education in Spain, so we expect it will have to be a mixture of public and private systems for some time. What we want is to integrate the two networks.'' Another aspect under dispute is that the law would mandate setting up a school council with representatives of the administration, the teachers, the parents and the students. It would be empowered to name the director, select teachers and oversee the budget, although students would not take part in staffing decisions. A New Concept for Spanish The idea of participation by parents and students in running religious schools is so new it constitutes something of a revolution. Finally, religious practices of schools receiving state money would be voluntary. This would mean, for example, that a student could choose not to take part in school prayers. After consultations between Government officials and the church hierarchy, certain features of the religious schools were left untouched. One is their right to retain a charter stating the basic religious precepts behind the instruction. For this reason, Government officials say that while they expect the church to oppose the bill, they do not believe it will engage in all-out confrontation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Summary; SUNDAY, JULY 10, 1983",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/nyregion/news-summary-sunday-july-10-1983.html,"International Whether the United States goes along with a compromise effort led by European neutrals to conclude the East-West conference in Madrid could depend on a meeting in Washington tomorrow. The Reagan Administration has summoned its chief negotiator, Max M. Kampelman, from Madrid to attend the meeting with senior officials. (Page 1, Column 6.) The Japanese educational system is ''shaping a whole population'' to a standard inconceivable in the United States, according to a research associate of Stanford University who has recently completed a study of Japanese high schools. But the quality of universities is far below that in the United States. (1:3.) National Tightening of fair housing laws will be sought by President Reagan, whose civil rights policies have been under fire recently. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Reagan said that he would send proposals to Congress that would put ''real teeth'' in the laws to carry out a pledge made in his State of the Union speech last January. (1:4.) President Reagan was urged not to seek re-election by the chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus, a Republican. The opening session of the caucus's convention in San Antonio was marked by strong, bipartisan criticism of the President. Kathy Wilson, the chairman, said she was reflecting the feelings of most other Republican women in the organization in denouncing Mr. Reagan as ''a dangerous man'' in regard to women's rights. (1:6.) A power struggle has been set off between moderates and conservatives within the Reagan Administration by the controversy over the use of Carter documents in the 1980 Reagan campaign. It could affect the ideological character of a Reagan re-election campaign and a possible second Reagan term by making it more conservative, according to Republicans in and close to the Government. (1:5.) Richard V. Allen said he was aware that the 1980 Reagan campaign had President Carter's debate briefing book and thought it was ethically wrong, but could not recall urging that it be returned. (15:1.) New limits on the powers of Congress and the executive branch have been set by the Supreme Court term that concluded last week. In one case, the Court, by a vote of 7 to 2, abruptly ended Congress's 50-year-old experiment with the legislative veto. The Court gave the White House a setback by strongly reaffirming the constitutional right to an abortion, and in another decision made clear that deregulation requires the same legal justification as regulation. (1:2.) An anti-abortion lobby reaffirmed its determination to seek a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal, despite recent legislative and judicial setbacks. At a meeting in Orlando, Fla., members of the National Right to Life Committee took an optimistic view and planned strategies for furthering their cause. (16:1.) Metropolitan The battle over interstate 95 between New York and Connecticut heated up. At noon, New York authorities began permitting truck traffic, which had been diverted through the Westchester village of Port Chester after the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in Greenwich, Conn., to enter Connecticut on Route 95. But as the trucks approached the first toll plaza in Connecticut, the Connecticut state police forced them to turn back and use the detour through Port Chester. (1:1.) An antirobbery program will be expanded by the New York City Police Department from six precincts to 14, including the two that cover much of the midtown area, police officials announced. The operation, known as the Robbery Identification Program, began in December 1981. The expansion will start in August and 42 additional investigators will be assigned to the detective division.

PRESIDENT IS ASSAILED BY WOMEN'S LEADER; 2D TERM OPPOSED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/president-is-assailed-by-women-s-leader-2d-term-opposed.html,"The chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus today called on President Reagan not to run for reelection. Kathy Wilson, a Republican who heads the caucus, said she was reflecting the feelings of most other Republican women in the 73,000-member organization in denouncing Mr. Reagan as ''a dangerous man'' in regard to women's rights. Mrs. Wilson's harshly worded attack on the President underscored the strong, pervasive anti-Reagan mood among the 800 delegates to the convention, which held its first full session today. Speakers of both parties have repeatedly cited the public opinion polls that show Mr. Reagan has far less support among women than among men. A consensus seems to be emerging among the 200 Republican women here that this sex difference is just as wide within their party as it is in the general population. That perception is supported by a number of polls, including The New York Times/CBS News Poll of June 20-26. It shows a 24-point gap between Republican men and women on the question of whether Mr. Reagan deserves to be re-elected. Eighty-six percent of the Republican men said Mr. Reagan deserved a second term, while 62 percent of the women held that opinion. At this meeting, which ends Sunday, virtually no women, except for Betty Heitman, a co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, are publicly defending Mr. Reagan. Friday, in a discussion session on 1984 Presidential politics, most of the Republican women joined in a long, fierce standing ovation after Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat of Connecticut, said, ''Ronald Reagan is hopeless as far as we women are concerned.'' Mrs. Wilson is running unopposed for a second two-year term as chairman of the caucus, which was founded in 1971 as the main political arm of the women's movement. She said in her speech that Mr. Reagan could ''bridge this gender gap and win the respect of American women'' by reversing his opposition to an equal rights amendment to the Constitution and abortion and by endorsing legislation to guarantee economic equity for women. ''But short of all that,'' she said, ''there is one thing President Reagan can do to help women and clean up his name with us. And that's what I ask him to do today. Mr. President, one term is enough. For the sake of American women - Republicans, Democrats and independents - please step down.'' Another Republican, Patricia P. Bailey, a Federal Trade Commissioner, also said that conscience compelled her to make a speech condemning Mr. Reagan's ''benign bewilderment in respose to the women's revolution.'' Mrs. Bailey, who was passed over by the White House for the chairmanship of the commission, said Mr. Reagan had created the division between the sexes and thereby handed the Democrats a huge, unearned political advantage. Other Republican leaders here have taken a more moderate line on Mr. Reagan. The include Mary Louise Smith of Iowa, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Representative Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island and Representative Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. They are warning women of the dangers of his policies without denouncing him personally. Fears Party Switching Mrs. Smith, one of her party's most influential women, said Republicans were at a crossroads. She warned that unless the lag among women in the Republican Party was corrected, it could lead to a ''concentration of women in one party.'' She added, ''I don't want to see all women as Democrats.'' Most Republicans here agree that the erosion of Mr. Reagan's support among women began at the 1980 Republican National Convention, when his supporters overturned 40 years of party tradition by removing endorsement of the equal rights amendment from the party's platform. Since then, Mrs. Snowe observed, Mr. Reagan's economic policies and his heavy military spending have further eroded the diminished support that Mr. Reagan had among women in the 1980 Presidential vote. ''It wasn't overwhelming support, but it was adequate,'' she said. ''Now he's lost even that standing.'' Mrs. Snowe and Mrs. Schneider said they were among a group of Republican women who were meeting with Michael K. Deaver, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, to try to find ways to appeal to women, who make up 53 percent of the voting population. They said there was no hope that Mr. Reagan would change his opposition to abortion and the equal rights amendment. So, as a compromise step, they are urging the White House to sponsor major legislation on such issues as pension equity for women. Mrs. Snowe said that as a result of the meetings, Reagan aides ''have gotten out of the denial phase and acknowledged that we do have a problem with women.'' 'A General Negative Feeling' But John Deardourff, a Republican campaign consultant, who spoke here, expressed doubt that Mr. Reagan could improve his standing with women with legislative proposals. ''The problem for Reagan,'' he said, ''is that the negative attitude among women has gone beyond specifics. It's no longer related to any specific issue. It's just a general negative feeling.'' For example, he observed, Mr. Reagan's attempt to cut Social Security benefits early in the first year of his term alienated elderly, conservative Republican women who were his natural allies. ''Almost every way you turn, you've got Ronald Reagan guilty of some failure to understand how women live their lives,'' he said. ''His stereotypes about women are just out of date.'' The Times/CBS News Poll bears out Mr. Deardourff's observation that the Social Security debate in the spring of 1981 was a turning point for Mr. Reagan. At that time, there was only a 9 percent gap between Republican women and men in assessing Mr. Reagan's performance in office. Last month, the gap was 21 percent, with 89 percent of Republican men approving and 68 percent of Republican women approving of his handling of the Presidency. On a number of key issues, according to the June poll, the sex difference of about 20 points has become a standard between Republican men and women. Differences Over Economy On Mr. Reagan's handling of the economy, 89 percent of Republican men approve and 66 percent of the women approve, for a gap of 23 percent. On the question of whether Mr. Reagan has done enough about inflation, 81 percent of the Republican men said he had, as against 61 percent of the women. Many Republican leaders contend that young, working women are most likely to dislike Mr. Reagan. Others have argued that those concerned with feminist issues fall into that group. However, the poll indicated, instead, that the Republican women critical of Mr. Reagan were most concerned about the economy and unemployment, and that they were older, poorer and more likely to come from the party's Middle Western stronghold than Reagan enthusiasts. They were also more likely to be single. Although Mr. Reagan still retains majority support among Republican women on most issues, the erosion of their support could tip a close election. The Republican ''gender gap,'' Mrs. Smith concluded, ''is real, measurable and unacceptable.'' Other Republicans here note that Mr. Reagan has never been popular among the Republican feminists in this organization. But the polls suggest that their distrust of Mr. Reagan is spreading among nonactivist Republican women. In any case, leaders of the women's political caucus are worried that anger at Mr. Reagan is a threat to the partisan balance of the organization. About 35 percent of the caucus's members are Republicans. Mrs. Wilson said the group's leadership was discouraging Republican members who want to switch parties as a means of protest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION FOES END MEETING OPTIMISTIC DESPITE SETBACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/abortion-foes-end-meeting-optimistic-despite-setbacks.html,"Local and national leaders of the National Right to Life Committee gathered here this week to celebrate what they consider major victories against abortion and to plan ways to take the sting out of recent defeats. Last month the group's 10-year campaign to make abortion illegal was dealt legislative and judicial setbacks, but the organization's leaders and members said the developments strengthened rather than weakened their resolve. The Supreme Court, in a 6-to-3 ruling on June 15, strongly reaffirmed its 1973 decree that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, and it struck down a number of local ordinances and state laws enacted since then to restrict abortions. And on June 28 the Senate rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the states and Congress to establish conditions under which an abortion could be obtained. Committee Backed Amendment The amendment was supported by the National Right to Life Committee, which claims some 2,000 chapters nationwide and several million members and supporters. ''It's a question now of 'is the glass half empty or half full,' '' said Jean Doyle, a 52-year-old Floridian who became president of the organization at the convention that ended here today. The number of senators voting for such a constitutional amendment has reached 49, nearly doubling in the decade since the movement began, she said. Viewing the High Court's recent action, she said abortion foes had increased the ranks of their supporters on the bench by one since the 7-to-2 ruling in 1973 upholding the right to abortion. The additional vote against the majority opinion was cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose appointment by President Reagan two years ago was opposed by the group on the ground that her position on abortion was less than favorable to its cause. ''O'Connor is maybe a very pleasant surprise,'' said Mrs. Doyle. ''How can we be mad at her?'' Reflecting on the organization's fight against Mrs. O'Connor at the time of her nomination, Mrs. Doyle said, ''Her track record at home was bad. We were scared to death.'' Debate Over Tactics ''Our optimism has been tempered by the realization that we've got a bigger task ahead than we thought,'' said David Ball, a former college professor who is a veteran of the anti-abortion movement and co-author of several books on abortion. Like many others, Mr. Ball suggested that the setbacks were forcing a reassessment of the group's expectations and tactics. Mrs. Doyle, whose organization came under fire from some smaller anti-abortion groups for pushing for a vote on the proposed constitutional amendment this summer, said it would be several years before such an effort was made again in Congress. Mrs. Doyle said that adoption of a constitutional amendment permitting restrictions on abortions ''is a long way off, 30 to 40 years,'' adding, ''This isn't an issue for sprinters.'' She said with a chuckle that in her early days in the movement she thought an amendment could be quickly passed. For the time being, Mrs. Doyle and other members said, the group will continue to press Congress for measures that would have the effect of curbing abortions. Many leaders also said they would work to re-elect President Reagan in the hope that he would appoint additional conservative Justices to the Supreme Court. Membership Drive Planned On the local level, the group will focus on expanding its membership and campaigning for candidates who embrace their views. Felicia Goeken, the Illinois director of the National Right to Life Committee, contrasted her organization's efforts with those of supporters of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment for women, who she said failed to win ratification because they did not get enough support in the states. ''We don't want to make the same mistake as the E.R.A. folks,'' she said. ''They zapped their amendment through Congress, but they couldn't on the state level because they weren't organized.'' Mrs. Goeken, 56, of Alton, Ill., a mother of seven who has been actively seeking to ban abortions since 1969, said the association would focus on organizing in the states. ''Regardless of what we do in Washington, the amendment will have to be ratified by the states,'' she said. Helms Is an Exception The recent Senate vote, Mrs. Goeken said, gave members a count of their supporters. Those who did not vote for the amendment, she said, are now considered by the group to be supporters of abortion and thus a target of its campaign efforts next year. The one exception, she said, is Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who faces a tough re-election battle next year. Although Senator Helms did not vote on the proposed amendment, saying that it was too weak and the timing was wrong, Mrs. Goeken said most members respected his position. The 1,200 or so participants at the three-day convention could see previews of an expected new direction in campaigning against abortion. Well-polished commercials with messages urging people to pull together on the abortion issue are intended to supplant the firebrand assertions that abortion is nothing less than murder of an unborn child. Alternatives Are Stressed More emphasis will be placed on establishing alternatives to abortion, such as counseling centers and temporary homes for young women who are pondering abortion and feel they have no refuge. A daylong session on politicking also suggested a tempering of tones in the pursuit of the organization's goals. Also, in a departure from the group's historical focus on the issue of abortion, more discussions emerged this year among members over their concern for euthanasia, the so-called mercy killing of severely ill children and adults. ''It's one small step from the mother getting rid of her inconvenient, unborn child to a daughter getting rid of her inconvenient, aging mother,'' said Jeanne Head, a nurse from Manhattan, echoing the views of others. The organization took no formal action in that area and again declined to discuss the use of contraceptives, death by nuclear war or capital punishment, with members noting the wide divergence of opinion on these issues within the 50-member board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NAION; 2 Brothers Sentenced In Abduction of Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/around-the-naion-2-brothers-sentenced-in-abduction-of-doctor.html,"Two brothers have been sentenced to prison for their parts in the abduction of a gynecologist and his wife to protest the doctor's involvement in an abortion clinic. Federal District Judge William L. Beatty sentenced Matthew Moore, 20 years old, to concurrent eight-year sentences on Friday. Mr. Moore was convicted on charges stemming from the kidnapping of Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife, Rosalie Jean Zevallos, from their Edwardsville home on Aug. 12, 1982. Judge Beatty sentenced Wayne Moore, 18, to an indeterminate jail term.

"MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY; Equalize Pension Pay, Court Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-equalize-pension-pay-court-rules.html,"The Supreme Court was in its usual race to finish up last week. When the dust settled, the Justices had issued 10 decisions for a total of 43 in the final two-and-a-half weeks of its 1982-83 session - almost one-third of their full caseload. Several major decisions were held over to next term, which begins Oct.3, including a ruling on whether the use of home video recorders violates Federal copyright law. The deferred judgment surprised many, since the Court heard arguments in January; presumably, a majority had not coalesced. Several clear majorities emerged this term - for women's right to have an abortion, against tax exemptions for racially discriminatory schools and against the legislative veto. It ended with a number of close calls. Among them: * A 5-to-4 decision that employer-sponsored retirement plans cannot give men and women unequal benefits. Nearly all annuities pay lower monthly benefits to women on the theory that as a group, women live longer than men and, over their lifetimes, collect an equal amount. But Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall said, ''Even a true generalization about a class cannot justify class-based treatment'' under Federal civil rights law, which bars sex discrimination in employment. Four Justices joined him. A different 5-to-4 majority said the decision applied only to contributions and benefits made after Aug.1, since righting past inequities might cost too much. The ruling, on a suit brought by Nathalie Norris, a supervisor in Arizona State's Department of Economic Security, the Job Service division, applies to millions of public employees and employees of nonprofit institutions. (Congress is considering banning sex distinctions in all insurance plans.) It does not necessarily mean more money for women, but equal benefits for all. * The Court used the case of a convicted murderer, Thomas A. Barefoot, to determine ''standards for granting or denying'' any prisoner a stay of execution while an appeal is pending. Voting 5 to 4 that a Federal appeals court properly refused Mr. Barefoot a stay, the Court issued guidelines that could expedite Federal appeals for prisoners who have exhausted the state appellate process. Federal appellate courts must ''decide the merits of an appeal'' and grant a stay if they need more time, the Court said. But with ''appropriate notice'' they can hear arguments for a stay and arguments on the appeal in one sitting. That's what happened in Mr. Barefoot's case, though the appeals court did not formally note this. To say there was no full hearing, wrote Associate Justice Byron R. White, would be ''an unwarranted exaltation of form over substance.'' As to that substance, the Court regrouped and, dividing 6 to 3, rejected Mr. Barefoot's challenge to the prosecution's use of psychiatric testimony that he would endanger society if not executed. The American Psychiatric Association has condemned such testimony; doctors agree it is impossible to predict dangerousness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FORCEFUL TERM OF SUPREME COURT PUT REINS ON CONGRESS AND REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/forceful-term-of-supreme-court-put-reins-on-congress-and-reagan.html,"Both Congress and the executive branch must adjust to life within new limits as a result of the Supreme Court term that concluded this week. The Justices spoke forcefully and in a more united voice than they have in some years, with many of the most important cases decided by comfortable margins instead of by the fragile 5-to-4 majorities of the last few terms. By a 7-to-2 vote, the Court abruptly ended Congress's 50-year-old experiment with its veto over some executive actions. Using that device, which was incorporated into 200 Federal laws, Congress could unilaterally stop White House or executive agency decisions from taking effect. New Leverage Being Sought The Court's decision that the legislative veto violated the constitutionally required separation of powers left Congress scrambling to find a new way to retain its leverage over foreign policy and the regulatory process. The Court's term also delivered some unwelcome messages to the White House. The Court strongly reaffirmed, by a vote of 6 to 3, the constitutional right to an abortion. And it ruled unanimously that the Reagan Administration's revoking of a requirement for airbags or automatic seat belts in new cars was ''arbitrary and capricious.'' That decision made clear for the first time that deregulation requires the same legal justification as regulation and that regulatory policies of the past may not be erased by simple administrative fiat. In addition, the Court's 8-to-1 ruling that Bob Jones University and other discriminatory private schools may not receive Federal tax exemptions repudiated a White House policy reversal that had sparked one of the major civil rights debates of recent years. The 1982-83 term, which began last Oct. 4, ended Wednesday, tying a record for length set in 1976. It was a busy term, with 152 full opinions as against 143 last year and 123 the year before. And as usual, the term had a frantic close. Nearly a third of all the decisions of the entire nine-month term were issued in the final three weeks. But the flood of new cases arriving at the Court, which prompted many complaints and pleas for relief from the Justices, appeared to have crested. It received 4,201 petitions for review, a 5 percent decline from the previous term and a decided break from years of steady growth in the Court's docket. The opinions were generally free of the bickering and personal animosity between Justices that was notable in last year's opinions. Another change was the relatively high profile of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who last year wrote few important opinions but this year assigned himself several of the major cases, including the legislative veto and the Bob Jones tax exemption case. A Pattern Continues Thirty-nine percent of the term's decisions were unanimous, while 21 percent were decided by 5-to-4 votes. In the closely contested cases, last year's voting patterns persisted, with Chief Justice Burger and Justices William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor usually forming one voting bloc, typically joined by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. or Justice Byron R. White. The opposing, more liberal bloc, was composed of Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens, and Harry A. Blackmun. These patterns were not immutable. On criminal law issues, for example, Justice Blackmun frequently voted with the Burger-Rehnquist group. There were 62 decisions in which Justices Rehnquist and Brennan took opposite sides. Justice Rehnquist was joined by Justice O'Connor in 50 of those cases; by Justice Powell in 45; by Justice White in 40; and by Justice Blackmun in 16, eight of those criminal cases. Each Justice wrote from 15 to 20 opinions for the Court. Justice Stevens wrote the most dissenting opinions, 20, while Chief Justice Burger wrote the least, four. Justice Marshall voted in dissent the greatest number of times, 48; Chief Justice Burger dissented the least, 12 times. These are the highlights of the Court's term. Individual Rights In Bob Jones v. U.S., the Court ruled that racially discriminatory private schools are not eligible for Federal tax-exempt status. The Court gave notice that it was not backing down from its 10-year-old decision that the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion. It struck down a variety of state and local obstacles to access to abortion, including laws requiring abortions in the second three months of pregnancy to be performed in hospitals (Akron v. Akron Center). In Arizona v. Norris, the Court ruled, 5 to 4, that the Federal law against sex discrimination in employment prohibits employer-sponsored retirement plans that give men and women unequal benefits. The ruling was not retroactive. The Court restricted the ability of individuals to seek Federal court injunctions against the repeat of government conduct they believe to be unconstitutional. In Los Angeles v. Lyons, the Court ruled 5 to 4 that a man who was nearly choked to death by the Los Angeles police could not sue for an injunction because there was no proof the police would choke him again. Separation of Powers The legislative veto was declared unconstitutional in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha; on the last day of the term, the Court also struck down vetoes of rules issued by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Federal-State Relations The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that Congress acted within its constitutional authority when it prohibited state and local governments from discriminating against their employees on the basis of age. The case, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wyoming, effectively overruled a 1976 decision, National League of Cities v. Usery, and ended the notion that the 10th Amendment to the Constitution shelters state governments from Federal regulation. Upholding California's moratorium on nuclear power plants, the Court ruled unanimously that states may ban nuclear plants for economic reasons, although not for safety reasons. (Pacific Gas & Electric v. Energy Resources). Regulatory Actions The Court ruled in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v. State Farm that the Reagan Administration improperly revoked a requirement that new cars be equipped with airbags or automatic seat belts. Rejecting the Securities and Exchange Commission's views on insider trading in the stock market, the Court limited the liability of those who make use of nonpublic information they receive from corporate insiders. (Dirks v. S.E.C.) The Court upheld the Federal Government's preferential tax treatment of organizations that lobby on behalf of veterans (Regan v. Taxation With Representation). The Court declared unconstitutional a Federal law making it a crime to send unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives through the mail. (Bolger v. Youngs Drug). The Court upheld Federal regulations designed to force utility companies to cooperate in the development of alternative, competing sources of energy. (American Paper Inst. v. American Electric Power). The Court ruled that generic drugs cannot be sold without approval of the Food and Drug Administration, even if their active ingredients duplicate those found in drugs already approved by the agency. Religion The Court ruled that states may permit tax deductions for educational expenses even if parochial schools reap nearly all the benefit. The 5-to-4 decision in Mueller v. Allen was the first time the Court endorsed a form of tuition aid for parochial schools, but the majority's insistence that the benefit be at least nominally available to public school parents as well cast doubt on the Reagan Administration's plan for tuition tax credits for private school tuition. The Court ruled in Marsh v. Chambers that the Constitution permits a legislature to pay a chaplain to open each day's session with a prayer. In Larkin v. Grendel's Den, the Court declared unconstitutional a Massachusetts law giving churches a veto power over the issuing of nearby liquor licenses. Election Law The Court struck down New Jersey's Congressional district lines on the ground that even miniscule unjustified variations from absolute numerical equality violate the principle of one man, one vote. The 5-to-4 ruling, Karcher v. Daggett, cast doubt on a number of other states' Congressional districts. The Court ruled in Anderson v. Celebrezze that states may not require independent candidates for President to meet substantially more onerous requirements than major party candidates in order to quality for the ballot. Criminal Law The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a life sentence, without possibility of parole, for a man who committed a string of petty, nonviolent crimes constituted cruel an unusual punishment (Solem v. Helm). In the major death penalty ruling of the term, the Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold the use of expedited procedures by Federal Courts of Appeals reviewing habeas corpus petitions from death row inmates (Barefoot v. Estelle). In U.S. v. Sells Engineering, the Court limited the ability of Federal prosecutors to share grand jury information with other Government lawyers and agencies. Ruling that a state cannot give a police officer the discretion to arrest a person for failing to identify himself to the officer's satisfaction, the Court struck down California's vagrancy law. (Kolender v. Lawson). In Bearden v. Georgia, the Court ruled that a state cannot send a convicted defendant to jail just because he is too poor to pay a fine. The Court ruled that the exposure of luggage to a narcoticssniffing dog is not a ''search'' and requires no previous suspicion of wrongdoing. However, U.S. v. Place held, the luggage may be detained for only a brief period. The Court ruled that Customs officials may make random inspections of ships on inland waterways without any suspicion that a crime is being committed (U.S. v. Villamonte-Marquez). For the second time, the Court was unable definitively to resolve the constitutional implications of the ''drug courier profile'' used by narcotics agents to pick out likely suspects at airports. In a fractured 5-to-4 ruling in Florida v. Royer, the Court ruled that even if the agent was justified in intercepting the passenger, that initial suspicion does not justify a more prolonged interrogation. Business and Taxes The Court ruled unanimously that the three-year-old Federal windfall profits tax on decontrolled crude oil is constitutional (U.S. v. Ptasynski). In Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board, the Court ruled that states may include the worldwide income of American-based multinational corporations in calculating state tax liability. The Court ruled that states may not subject newspaper and magazine publishers to a tax not generally applicable to other businesses. The decision, Minneapolis Star v. Minnesota, struck down, on First Amendment free press grounds, a state tax on the value of paper and ink. Without opinion, the Court summarily upheld the broad outlines of the antitrust settlement under which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company agreed to divest itself of the companies that provide most of the nation's local telephone service. The vote was 6 to 3. The Court's refusal, on Dec. 24, to extend the deadline it had previously given Congress for restructuring that nation's bankruptcy courts meant that bankruptcy cases would continue to be handled indefinitely under ''interim'' Federal court rules that parties to come cases have challenged as unconstitutional. Unfinished Business The Court did not resolve three of the most challenging issues on its calendar, but promised to tackle them all again in the term that begins October 3. Most surprising was the Court's last-day announcement that it wanted additional arguments on whether the use of home video recorders to make tapes of copyrighted television broadcasts is a violation of Federal copyright law. After promising to decide whether to modify the rule that bars the use of illegally obtained evidence in trials, the Court publicly apologized for not resolving the question in Illinois v. Gates. But the Justices then agreed to hear three separate cases on the same point in the next term. The Court heard arguments on whether judges may supercede ordinary last-hired, first-fired seniority rules to protect the jobs of recently hired black employees. It then dismissed the case, Boston Firefighters v. Boston N.A.A.C.P., as probably moot. Three weeks later, the Court accepted, for argument next term, a case involving the Memphis Fire Department that raises the same question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS LINE UP ON FEMINIST ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/11/us/democrats-line-up-on-feminist-issues.html,"At the convention of the National Women's Political Caucus today, four Democratic Presidential candidates said that, if elected, they would use political deals and trade-offs to put pressure on states that refuse to ratify the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution. While two of the candidates, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, implied that they would use Federal funds to bargain for support of the amendment, the other two, Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Senator Alan Cranston of California, made that promise explicit, saying they would withhold money for Federal programs and projects from states whose legislatures opposed the amendment. Bidding War for Support A fifth candidate, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, said he would call an ''equal rights amendment summit conference'' at the White House to plan a strategy for passing the amendment, which would ban discrimination based on sex. A deadline for the proposed amendment expired last year without ratification by three-fourths of the states, but it has been reintroduced in Congress. The candidates' pledges on the amendment illustrated the bidding war that developed here as the Democrats vied to see who could most energetically embrace the agenda of the 73,000-member feminist organization. In general, the Democrats were warmly received, although Senator Hart managed to offend these representatives of one of his party's most powerful constituencies by violating the ground rules for the speeches. Several leaders of the group said later that the enthusiasm with which the Democrats endorsed the caucus's key positions made it likely that the group would alter its policy and endorse a Presidential candidate. Kathy Wilson, re-elected today as chairman of the organization, said an endorsement would not split the group because President Reagan is so unpopular with Republican women, who make up 35 percent of the membership. ''We want our party back, and we make a distinction between Ronald Reagan and the rest of the Republican Party,'' said Mrs. Wilson, a Republican herself who on Saturday called for Mr. Reagan not to seek a second term. A Distancing From Reagan Saturday's session of the convention was devoted mainly to such denunciations of Mr. Reagan by both Democratic and Republican women. They said he was responsible for the reported fact in polls of public opinion that fewer women than men support the President, creating the so-called gender gap. Today's session, on the convention's final day, was devoted mainly to Democratic candidates' efforts to project themselves as Mr. Reagan's opposite when it comes to passing the constitutional amendment, defending the right of women to have abortions, and placing issues of health, social justice and education ahead of the Reagan Administration's military buildup. Mr. Mondale ridiculed Mr. Reagan's assertion that he has been unfairly victimized by a ''perception problem'' that makes him appear unfair to women. ''He does have a perception problem,'' Mr. Mondale said in a warmly received speech. ''He can't see you at all, and you see right through him.'' A few minutes later, Mr. Cranston said that the President ''thinks 'gender gap' was an episode of 'Death Valley Days,' '' the television western for which Mr. Reagan was host in the 1960's. The Senator went on to suggest that money for bridge building might be withheld from states that refused to ratify the equal rights amendment. Senator Hart also endorsed bargaining with Federal funds to force recalcitrant Congressional leaders and state legislatures to support the constitutional amendment. ''I'm talking about specific Federal projects,'' the Coloradan said, ''that would be used to bring around people who are on the fence on that or whose support is lukewarm.'' Senator Hollings said he would use the arm-twisting style of Lyndon B. Johnson to ''swap around'' and pass the amendment. Mr. Mondale described a similar approach in promising to do ''whatever is necessary'' to pass the amendment. ''As President of the United States,'' he declared, ''I'll say, 'Now wait a minute, you want something and I want something. I'll help you if it's an honorable objective if you'll promise to go back to your state and deliver on the ratification of the equal rights amendment.' '' Among the announced Democratic candidates, only former Governor Reubin Askew of Florida declined an invitation to attend. His opposition to abortion in some circumstances made him unpopular here. In his absence, all the Democrats seemed to pass muster on litmustest issues that also included the nuclear arms freeze, equal pay, and willingess to consider a female Vice Presidential nominee. But aside from the poltical issues, the male candidates went through a psychological testing going on here. Ann F. Lewis, political director of the Democratic National Committee, said the overriding interest in defeating Mr. Reagan had made this group's members less concerned with tripping the candidates on fine points of feminist politics and sexist semantics. 'Thinking Man's Candidate' Mr. Glenn flirted with trouble when he spoke of ''man and wife,'' rather than using the preferred language of ''husband and wife.'' Mr. Hollings got a forgiving laugh when he apologized for a brochure that called him ''the thinking man's candidate.'' It was left to Mr. Hart to stumble into trouble. He provoked open anger and a public chastising when he ignored the time limit on speeches and spoke sharply to the moderator, State Senator Harriett Woods of Missouri, when she tried to cut him off. Senator Hart, looking grim, later apologized. Mrs. Wilson observed that the Senator exhibited an ''attitude of disregard'' toward women, but she predicted that he would escape permanent political damage. Mr. Mondale, who opened his speech by declaring, ''I am a feminist,'' got the most vigorous applause. But Mr. Hollings, Mr. Cranston and Mr. Glenn all won nods of approval.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"VIDEO TERMINALS HARMLESS TO EYE, STUDY ASSERTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/science/video-terminals-harmless-to-eye-study-asserts.html,"There is no valid scientific evidence that video display terminals - those television-like devices used by increasing millions of office workers - permanently damage vision, a panel of experts assembled by the National Research Council reported today. Nor do they increase the risk of cataracts, according to the panel. Although 40 percent to 80 percent of the terminal operators questioned in various surveys have complained of eyestrain or other visual problems, the panel concluded, there is little evidence that their symptoms differ appreciably from those of workers engaged in other close visual tasks and no evidence that the effects are lasting. Panel members said they considered the problems associated with video display terminals a matter of ''annoyance to workers'' and a threat to productivity rather than a public health issue. The study was requested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a Federal agency that has been studying complaints and potential health hazards associated with the terminals, known as V.D.T.'s. The findings, coming after a two-year review costing about $180,000, were made by a 12-member panel convened by the research council, the operating arm of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, the nation's most prestigous scientific bodies. The panel said that worker complaints might stem partly from poorly designed terminals and partly from poorly lighted, poorly designed workplaces and from boring, repetitive, low-paying jobs. It said terminals were often placed in offices where the lighting and furniture were designed for paperwork on horizontal surfaces rather than video work on a vertical plane. ''Our general conclusion is that eye discomfort, blurred vision and other visual disturbances, muscular aches and stress reported among V.D.T. workers are probably not due to anything inherent in V.D.T. technology,'' the panel's chairman, Edward Rinalducci, professor of psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told a news conference. ''However, we found that workers do face significant problems because of the way V.D.T. technology has been used in the workplace.'' More than seven million Americans - clerical workers, air traffic controllers, computer programmers, airline reservation clerks, lawyers, scientists, typesetters, writers and editors, among others - used terminals at work in 1980 and the number has been rapidly increasing. Many individuals are also buying terminals for use at home. The panel suggested that home users might have different attitudes than workers who are often forced to use terminals without advance consultation. The panel acknowledged that many terminals were poorly designed for worker comfort because they are inexpensive adaptations of components originally designed for casual television viewing at a distance, rather than for intense work at close range. Another member of the panel, Harry L. Snyder, professor of industrial engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, estimated that 60 percent of the terminals sold today do not meet reasonable criteria for comfort, and that the number five years ago was far higher. But the report found ''little likelihood that V.D.T. use involves serious health or safety hazards.'' The group's report appeared to uphold worker complaints of physical discomfort but belie fears expressed by many workers and labor leaders that the machines may be causing serious visual harm. Workers have complained of eyestrain; blurred vision; hot, tired, stinging, itching, or watery eyes; headaches and, in a handful of cases, cataracts or other ocular diseases that interfere permanently with vision. Some workers have also charged that radiation emitted by terminals may cause miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, and birth defects. The panel, whose expertise lay in vision rather than human reproduction, did not address this issue directly. But it mentioned in passing that the only two studies thus far completed of reproductive problems among terminal operators concluded that terminals were unlikely to be a causal factor. It also noted that the radiation emitted by terminals was far below that believed to cause birth defects in humans. The panel said that virtually every study yet made of the radiation emitted by terminals had found that it fell ''well below accepted occupational and environmental health and safety standard limits.'' The panel said workers were exposed to less radiation from terminals than they were from fluorescent lights, sunshine and other common sources. The panel suggested that most of the problems reported in working on display terminals could probably be eliminated by applying existing knowledge of the best way to design terminals, arrange office lighting and furniture, and organize work. It opposed mandatory standards as ''premature'' when the technology is changing so rapidly. One panelist, Lawrence W. Stark, professor of physiological optics at the Berkeley campus of the University of California, dissented from the tone but not the substance of the report. He did not dispute any of the detailed findings in his written dissent, but complained that ''Our panel report does not condemn the poor quality and legibility of current V.D.T.'s.'' A spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the report did not satisfy union concerns because, though narrow in scope, it could be construed as saying there are no problems with terminals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AN OLD WAR AGAINST THE NEW CHEMICAL WEAPONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/13/us/an-old-war-against-the-new-chemical-weapons.html,"Like Pavlov's dog, members of Congress tend to start salivating when a plate of Federal money is placed in front of them. Bringing home the bacon from Washington is a time-honored way of pleasing constituents and reinforcing re-election prospects. So when Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, says he does not want $130.6 million earmarked for his state, the story ranks in the man-bites-dog category. The money that so offends Senator Pryor would be used to manufacture an advanced form of chemical weaponry at a Federal installation in Pine Bluff. Later this week he will offer an amendment to delete the funds from the military authorization bill now before the Senate. The Chamber of Commerce in Pine Bluff, just 80 miles from the Senator's home town of Camden, vigorously supports the program as a source of jobs and revenue. And Senator Pryor, who faces re-election next year, admitted: ''I think some of them down there might think I'm crazy.'' But the Senator has opposed the production of chemical weapons, for both moral and military reasons, since he served as Governor of Arkansas a decade ago. And he will pursue his crusade, he says, even though his colleagues are tired of hearing from him. Issue Goes Back to '69 ''It's a very emotional issue,'' he said today. ''People don't like to talk about it, because it's very unpleasant. But it's like abortion - people hope it won't come up, but it will never quite go away.'' The issue of chemical weapons, or nerve gas, dates from 1969, when President Nixon agreed to halt production of new devices and to try to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union banning such weapons entirely. Those negotiations have never been successful, and are no longer being conducted on a two-way basis, but the production moratorium has remained in force for 14 years. President Ford tried and failed to get approval for a new production program in the mid-1970's, and the Reagan Administration has been pushing for an end to the moratorium since it took office. In 1981, Congress did approve $21 million for the construction of a factory in Pine Bluff, but the actual production funds have never been authorized and the plant stands empty today. When the issue came up in the House last month, the Administration lobbied furiously for the funds. But a broad coalition that crossed both party and ideological lines voted 256 to 161 in favor of an amendment deleting all production money. The curious nature of the opposition was exemplified by the chief sponsors of the amendment: Representative Clement J. Zablocki, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, and Representative Ed Bethune, a conservative Republican from Arkansas and a former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Bomb Known as 'Big Eye' The Administration request includes funds for two kinds of weapons, artillery shells and an aerial bomb known as Big Eye. Both would be ''binary'' weapons, containing two chemicals instead of one. Each chemical is inert by itself; the weapon becomes lethal only when the chemicals are mixed after launching, as the projectile approaches its target. Old-fashioned ''unitary'' weapons contain active chemicals while in storage, and Administration strategists argue that the new weapons would be much safer. In addition, the Administration maintains that a new generation of chemical weapons is needed to counter advances in the Soviet arsenal and modernize existing American stockpiles. In a letter to Congress in the House debate, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, commander of American troops in Europe, said: ''The perspective from Europe is clear-cut. The Soviets already possess an overwhelming superiority in chemical warfare capabilities. Worse yet, the dated ammunition in our current stockpile will provide only a nominal deterrent until later in this decade when it becomes largely unusable.'' Without the new weapons requested by the Administration, General Rogers added, the United States would not be able to deter a Russian attack or force Moscow to negotiate an agreement to eliminate all chemical devices. Senator Pryor believes that these arguments do not make sense. The military has plenty of nerve gas in its arsenal now to deter the Russians, he says, and building more weapons would be ''almost like bringing a wheelbarrow of sand to the Sahara.'' Sending 'Signals' to Russia Like many critics of the MX missile, he also derides the notion that the United States can elicit arms reduction agreements with Moscow by increasing arms production. ''I think,'' Senator Pryor said in a sarcastic tone, ''that this Administration is consumed with the idea of communicating with the Russians by sending 'signals.' These people love to send signals to the Russians, and I think that's absurd.'' Senator Pryor sees another parallel with the MX debate: the argument that at a time of limited budgets, the miltary can use its money in better ways, such as training. ''We're going to the exotic and forgetting the conventional,'' he said. Moreover, the Senator notes, new chemical weapons would have to be stored in Europe, and America's European allies have consistently refused to deploy any new devices or even train their soldiers to use them. But the core of Senator Pryor's belief, and the reason he is willing to displease the businessmen of Pine Bluff, is rooted in moral feelings. At least one aging Titan missile based in Arkansas has already exploded, and Senator Pryor fears for the safety of his state should it become the center of the nerve gas industry. Moreover, in his view, nerve gas is an inherently immoral weapon. ''Nerve gas doesn't kill soldiers, it kills civilians,'' he said. Senator Pryor admits that he is tired of the issue, but as long as the Administration asks for money, he will oppose it. ''This issue is like chewing gum you step on in the street,'' he said. ''It sticks to your shoe and you can never quite get away from it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/14/us/briefing-033246.html,"Memorial to Eisenhower F ootball nostalgia may wobble through the air like a long pass today at the announcement of the formation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower World Affairs Institute. The institute itself will have little to do with football, although it was a game well played at West Point by Eisenhower the cadet. The institute's founders say it will be a nonprofit operation to function as a ''permanent living national memorial'' to the President. Expected to appear at the announcement ceremony today are Mr. Eisenhower's son, John, and granddaughter, Susan. Also expected to attend are members of the institute's organizing committee, including Eugene T. Rossides, a Washington lawyer and former Treasury Department official who once earned considerable notoriety in Army circles. Mr. Rossides was the Columbia University quarterback who faded back deep, on Oct. 24, 1947, and threw the touchdown pass to Bill Swiacki that defeated West Point, 21-20, ending Army's 32-game winning streak. Pets as Friends R epresentative Mario Biaggi, the Bronx-Westchester Democrat, had been getting what his office described as ''anguished calls'' from older residents of federally subsidized housing. The callers were said to fear eviction because they owned dogs and other pets. So Mr. Biaggi took the floor of the House in debate on a major housing bill and said: ''For many elderly and disabled people, a dog or whatever pet can be their only friend, their only source of companionship, their only protection against criminals or their only link to the outside world.'' He proposed an amendment to prevent eviction or discrimination in renting of pet owners in federally funded housing. It passed by voice vote and now goes to the Senate. The Best Man? W hen President Reagan named Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court in 1981, the appointment was regarded suspiciously by organizations opposed to abortion. But when the Court, by a 6 to 3 vote, strongly reaffirmed on June 15 the constitutional right to abortion, Justice O'Connor wrote a sharp dissent. So now she and the President have become champions to some antiabortion groups. The Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life says in its current newsletter that ''up to now, perhaps the only serious antiabort opposition to Reagan resulted from his 1981 appointment of 'pro-abortion' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. But Mr. Reagan insisted that he had not broken his promise to appoint anti-abort judges, and Justice O'Connor has now confirmed that fact by writing the strongly worded dissent.'' The newsletter also printed a photograph of Justice O'Connor over the caption ''Best Man on the Court?'' Quills and Comments B efore the word processor, before the Magic Marker, before the flicked Bic, before the Mont Blanc torpedo-like fountain pen, even before the steel-nibbed ink-splotcher, was the goose quill. And before most of today's pen-users were literate, there was Lewis Glaser, the purveyor of goose quill pens to the United States Supreme Court. Since 1950, Mr. Glaser has been carving the pens in his workshop at Charlottesville, Va., and selling dozens of them annually to the Court, which gives them, as souvenirs, to lawyers appearing before it for the first time. With one assistant, Mr. Glaser, who is 85 years old, carves the tips of the pens by hand, from feathers imported from Czechoslovakia. They produce 50,000 a year, and sell them to the public for $25 a pair. Mr. Glaser also gives pens to most Presidents. Mr. Glaser, who was born in Chicago, said he told President Reagan recently that he was the only President born in Illinois. ''I've heard about that,'' Mr. Glaser quoted Mr. Reagan, a native of Tampico, as saying. ''He was prompt, cordial and very impressive,'' Mr. Glaser went on to say. ''He looks like a President.'' Not all Presidents give Mr. Glaser that impression. He liked Ike, who gave him a penknife with the initials D.D.E. that he still uses to carve the quill points. But there was no pen for Jimmy Carter. ''He didn't look and act like a President,'' Mr. Glaser explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Lutheran Group Favors Restriction on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/14/us/around-the-nation-lutheran-group-favors-restriction-on-abortions.html,"North America's second-largest Lutheran body today approved an abortion resolution that would permit the procedure only if it was necessary to save the woman's life. All but a few of the 1,130 delegates attending the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's convention approved the resolution. Delegates meeting at the Cervantes Convention Center voted in favor of the measure by standing. ''Abortion is not a moral option except as a tragically unavoidable by-product of medical procedures necessary to prevent the death of another human being, that is, the mother,'' the resolution reads. The synod, which has 6,100 congregations and 2.7 million members, declared its support four years ago for a constitutional amendment to make most abortions illegal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/15/us/briefing-035731.html,"Honduran's Complaint T he Reagan Administration's decision to train Salvadoran soldiers at a new military base in Honduras has sent an adjoining property owner into Federal District Court in the capital, trying to block the Secretaries of State and Defense from proceeding with the project. According to a lawsuit filed Thursday by Temistocles Ramirez de Arellano, the training base has deprived him of more than half of his 14,000-acre cattle ranch near Puerto Castilla on the Caribbean coast, on which he also maintains meatpacking and shrimp-packing operations and a fishing fleet. Mr. Ramirez concedes that he gave conditional permission to use 2,000 acres of his $13 million property for the base, but no more. The complaint maintains that the State and Defense Departments are building a camp that includes a 1,000-man tent, ammunition storage facilities and a firing range, and have installed more than 100 soldiers of the United States Army Special Forces. The camp was situated in Honduras rather than in El Salvador because the United States has already reached the limit of 55 military advisers in that country under an agreement between President Reagan and Congress. In addition to loss of property and reduction of water supply, the suit says, employees of the Ramirez enterprises have been ''intimidated and frightened by the military activity.'' A spokesman for the State Department said there would be no comment on the case while it was pending. The Defense Department did not respond to requests for comment. Another Packwood Foray S enator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is not in favor with the Reagan White House, will be off this weekend on another of what aides calls his forays. He is going to Iowa, but that is not to be construed as evidence of Packwoodian interest in the 1984 Iowa caucuses, the earliest delegate selection event of next year's Presidential competition. (His two previous forays took him to New England, where New Hampshire and Massachusetts hold two of the earliest 1984 Presidential primaries. The Senator's busy Iowa schedule includes meetings with women's groups, Jewish groups and the Polk County (Des Moines) Republican Central Committee. If this is not exploratory national campaigning, what is it? Etta Fielek, the Senator's press secretary, replied: ''In the large sense, it's party-building. In the personal sense, it's keeping in touch with people who identify with him.'' Senator Packwood has provoked the White House by leading floor debates against attempts to restrict the right to abortion and by criticizing the current Republican national leadership as uninterested in recruiting women, young people, blue-collar workers, blacks and other groups. Key Reagan aides tacitly supported a successful attempt to depose him as chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee late last year. At the meeting of the National Women's Political Caucus a week ago, Mr. Packwood was introduced as ''women's No. 1 ally in the United States Senate,'' but the six contenders for the 1984 Democratic nomination got the lion's share of the publicity, demonstrating once again that running for President attracts more attention than partybuilding. An Ideological Sweep I n a city that thrives on political conflict, the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute are natural rivals. Of the two otherwise roughly similar private research groups, Brookings has provided a storm cellar for liberal economists and writers, mostly Democrats, when Republicans take over the White House, while the Enterprise Institute, flourishing under the Reagan Administration, now provides comparable employment for otherwise unoccupied conservatives, mostly Republicans. Wednesday evening, the Brookings softball team, with its lefty lineup, defeated a mostly right-handed aggregation from the institute, 14 to 9. Joseph A. Pechman, the Brookings director of economic studies who started in the outfield, concluded: ''Clearly, the political tides are shifting.'' The institute maintained that the real score was only 13 to 9, disallowing a run in which Mr. Pechman rudely knocked the ball from the hands of a conservative catcher at home plate. Brookings built up an advantage of 11 to 0 in the first two innings, when both teams had their scholars and fellows in the lineup; the institute rallied but fell short. The victory was particularly sweet for Brookings, because its team had already edged out the Heritage Foundation, another conservative stronghold, 10 to 9, a month ago, for a clean ideological sweep of the 1983 season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENTS SENT TO SENATE FLOOR BY PANEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/15/us/2-school-prayer-amendments-sent-to-senate-floor-by-panel.html,"The Senate Judiciary Committee today sent to the Senate floor two proposed constitutional amendments that would sanction different forms of organized prayer in public schools. One amendment, backed by President Reagan and many fundamentalist religious groups, would permit audible prayer in the classroom. A second amendment, written by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, would allow only silent prayer or meditation. The Supreme Court has held that organized prayer in elementary or secondary schools violates the First Amendment. The committee vote was 14 to 3, but several lawmakers stressed that they did not support either measure and were merely voting to give the full Senate the right to debate the issue. An aide to the Senate leadership said that the issue would probably come to the floor in the fall but that no commitments have been made to bring it up. The chance of any school prayer amendment passing the Senate is considered very small, because liberals are prepared to stage a filibuster. If an amendment received the two-thirds vote necessary to pass the Senate, Democratic leaders say they are prepared to keep it buried in the House. Ratification by the States After receiving a two-thirds majority in each chamber, a proposed amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. Administration aides concede that President Reagan is trying to please conservative groups. ''Of the social issues, it's probably the most popular in the polls,'' a White House aide said. ''There's a big coalition out there, a lot of activists.'' An assistant to the Senate leadership added that ''the religious right is making a big deal of it'' and that President Reagan wanted to mend his fences with this group in time for the 1984 election. Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, noted that the issue puts many lawmakers ''in a very difficult position.'' They do not want to tamper with the Constitution, he said, but they do not want to appear to be against prayer and religion. But Mr. Mathias who voted against sending the amendments to the floor, said he expected many religious groups to oppose the amendment. 'Breach in the Wall' ''Any intrusion into freedom of conscience is a step in the wrong direction,'' Senator Mathias said. ''It's a breach in the wall of protection erected in the Bill of Rights.'' Conservatives have not been able to agree on a proposal, and as in the recent Senate debate over abortion, the fragmentation has damaged their effectiveness. ''This is a victory for us,'' said David E. Landau, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. ''It surrounds the issue in confusion.'' As originally formulated, the amendment backed by Mr. Reagan said nothing in the Constitution ''shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other institutions.'' It also said no person could be required to participate in prayer. Many legislators have been concerned that this wording could sanction some sort of official government prayer. As a result, a sentence was added today that would bar the Federal Government or any state from composing an official prayer. But critics say it would still allow teachers or officials to read or compose a prayer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 CONGRESSMEN FACE CONSTITUENTS' JUDGEMENT ON REPORTS OF SEX WITH PAGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/16/us/2-congressmen-face-constituents-judgement-on-reports-of-sex-with-pages.html,"In three successful campaigns for Congress, Representative Daniel B. Crane has portrayed himself as a solid, churchgoing, family man, a conservative Republican who set himself apart from what he described as the fast-living ''Washington set.'' He returned here today to spend the weekend with his wife and six children and found his largely rural constituency stunned by his admission that he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female Congressional page three years ago. ''Even his opponents are in shock,'' said Jerry Wright, a labor leader in Danville, the farm equipment manufacturing city of 38,000 where Mr. Crane practiced as a dentist before he was elected to Congress in 1978. ''Will he resign?'' asked John Hirschfeld, one of the 20 Republican County chairman in Mr. Crane's 19th Congressional District. ''I think the answer is no.'' ''Will he run again?'' Mr. Hirschfeld continued. ''I don't know.'' Potential Replacements Mr. Hirschfeld said that only a day after the House ethics committee recommended an official reprimand for Mr. Crane, he was getting calls from Republicans eager to replace Mr. Crane. ''Prior to this,'' Mr. Hirschfield said, ''I don't think there was any serious opposition in the primary. I'm not going to suggest that Dan Crane could not win. But I think the county chairmen are going to want him to tell them how he can win.'' The Congressman was met at the airport in Danville by his wife, Judy, who has appeared in campaign photographs with their children and appealed to voters with handwritten letters describing life in the Crane household and saying that it was important to re-elect her husband. Neither the Congressman nor his wife would speak to reporters. As he left Washington, Mr. Crane, who is 47 years old and a former Army officer who served in Vietnam, said, ''I know nothing. I'm not talking.'' He had issued a statement acknowledging that he ''made a mistake,'' but added that ''in no way did I violate my oath of office.'' A month ago, Mr. Crane told Republican leaders he would run for a fourth term. After the ethics committee's report was made public Thursday he refused to say whether he would run for re-election. 'A Complete Admission' William Mencarow, an aide to Mr. Crane, said he did not know if the Congressman intended to resign. ''I think it's important that the Congressman has made a complete admission,'' Mr. Mencarow said in Danville. ''No law has been violated and it's really a matter between consenting adults on something that happened three years ago. It doesn't have anything to do with his re-election.'' United Press International quoted the young woman who was involved with Mr. Crane, whose name has not been made public, as saying that the affair ''was my decision just as much as it was his.'' ''Here's a guy who campaigned as a staunch family man,'' said Phil King, a resident of Urbana. ''I'm somewhat aghast.'' No Prediction of Defeat A Republican colleague, Representative Timothy Johnson of Urbana said, ''I don't think we should assume this will defeat him.'' Mr. Johnson added, ''I'm not ready to consign him to the political garbage bag.'' In addition to disclosing Mr. Crane's affair, the ethics committee said that Representative Gerry E. Studds of Massachusetts had had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male page 10 years ago and that James C. Howarth, who supervises pages for the Democratic majority, had had sexual relations with a 17-year-old page and given her preferential treatment. Joseph A. Califano Jr., the special counsel to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, said in response to a question that the Congressmen had not violated any laws because the age of consent for sexual relations is 16 in both the District of Columbia and Virginia. In his last campaign, Mr. Crane was against abortion, supported prayer in public schools and backed a strong military. He is the ranking Republican on the House Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee that is investigating how Ronald Reagan's aides obtained debate briefing papers from President Carter's campaign in 1980. He is the brother of Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980. In his formal statement, Mr. Crane said he was ''sorry'' and that ''I only hope my wife and children will forgive me.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ILL-CONCEIVED OFFERS TO PUSH THE E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/opinion/l-ill-conceived-offers-to-push-the-era-037293.html,"To the Editor: The implicit or explicit promise of four candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination to ''use political deals and trade-offs to put pressure on states that refuse to ratify the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution'' (news story July 11) is simply appalling. he necessity for state ratification in the amendment process is a critical element in a procedure designed to insure that constitutional change reflect the broadest possible consensus, and not merely the will of the Federal Government. It follows, therefore, that the intention of the proposed Democratic Presidential candidates if elected to use political and economic pressure and sanctions against the states to achieve ratification of the E.R.A. is a blatant violation of the intention behind the amendment process. Indeed, were President Reagan to use such tactics to encourage passage of a constitutional amendment limiting abortion, most of the women at the National Women's Political Caucus would certainly and properly object. In short, while one can understand a candidate's desire to speak to the expressed and deserving needs of a major interest group, one cannot approve of the corruption of the constitutional amendment process to achieve this end.

UP FROM INDIVIDUALISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/books/up-from-individualism.html,"STATECRAFT AS SOULCRAFT What Government Does. By George F. Will. 186 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $13.95. IF Ronald Reagan is the leading practitioner of American conservatism, George Will is its high priest. A political commentator with a reflective bent, Mr. Will stands out among columnists as the most elegant voice of contemporary conservative political philosophy. But Mr. Reagan does not practice what Mr. Will preaches. In ''Statecraft as Soulcraft,'' his first book-length work, Mr. Will laments the lack of genuine conservatives in American politics and shows how the best conservative thought is lost even on the most conservative President in decades. ''I will do many things for my country,'' writes Mr. Will, ''but I will not pretend that the careers of, say, Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt involve serious philosophical differences.'' Conservatives like Mr. Reagan attack ''big government,'' but Mr. Will is more concerned with the reluctance of modern government to cultivate the moral character of its citizens. He faults conservatives for agreeing with liberals that the ''inner life'' of citizens - our ''sentiments, manners and moral opinions'' -is none of the government's business. Mr. Will insists that ''statecraft is soulcraft.'' Government cannot be neutral on major moral issues and shouldn't try. ''Just as all education is moral education because learning conditions conduct, much legislation is moral legislation because it conditions the action and the thought of the nation in broad and important spheres of life.'' Of course, liberals and conservatives display their opposition to soulcraft in different ways. Liberals often oppose attempts to ban abortion or censor pornography nd is the author of ''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice.''or regulate adult sexual behavior on the grounds that it is wrong to ''legislate morality.'' And many conservatives oppose social programs on the grounds that they constitute an ''interference'' in the ''free market.'' Mr. Will points out that those who argue in this way share a common confusion. They overlook the fact that to take a political stand is always to affirm some moral view. There is no stand that imposes no value judgments at all. Permissive obscenity statutes do not keep morality out of the law; they represent a moral judgment that allowing pornography is better than banning it. Laissez-faire economic policies do not keep politics out of the economy; they are themselves a kind of politics. ''A 'free market' economic system,'' Mr. Will writes, ''is a public product, a creation of government.'' It encourages some values and discourages others. In his view, the denial of soulcraft has made for an impoverished political agenda, with troubling consequences for American life.Where government fails to nurture a sense of public spirit and selfrestraint, material pursuits prevail, the dignity of politics fades and social cohesion dissolves. Vulnerable to ''internal decay and external challenge,'' we need to ''come up from individualism'' and strengthen the sense of community that modern society erodes. Mr. Will does not offer a detailed solution to the predicament he describes. His purpose is less to promote particular programs than to change the character and tone of the debate. His political vision here might best be described as communitarian conservatism. He favors a welfare state that embodies an ethic of common provision, a military draft that expresses a deepened citizenship, a market economy restrained by considerations of the public good and restrictions on abortion, pornography and sexual permissiveness in hopes of elevating society's moral sensibilities. Like all communitarian ethics, Mr. Will's invites the objection that to mix politics and morality, for whatever good ends, is to consort with totalitarian possibilities. Mr. Will replies, plausibly enough, that the greater vulnerability lies in atomized, dislocated societies, not in stable communities with a lively sense of common purposes and shared traditions. Still, ''Statecraft as Soulcraft'' leaves a lurking worry. Missing from it is any clear commitment to democracy. For example, the American institution most powerfully equipped for democratic soulcraft, the public school, finds scant support from Mr. Will, who for all his praise of the public estate, would subsidize private schools through tuition tax credits. And despite his assurance that soulcraft is ''the citizenry working on itself,'' he also asserts that ''the basic political right is to good government, not self-government.'' If the aim of politics is, as Mr. Will says, ''a warm citizenship, approximating friendship, based on a sense of shared values and a shared fate,'' democracy would seem an essential, not merely an incidential ingredient. Liberals and democrats would do well to take up the challenge Mr. Will puts to his fellow conservatives - to argue for a vision of the good society, unembarrassed by the thought that it has nothing to do with politics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVES ARE FAINTLY PRAISED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/civil-rights-moves-are-faintly-praised.html,"Not since Congress passed the Fair Housing Act of 1968, six days after the killing of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., has the capital seen such a flurry of official civil rights activity. The Reagan Administration last week filed its first school desegregation suit, against the State of Alabama, and sent draft legislation to Congress to strengthen enforcement of the housing law. President Reagan's three nominees to the United States Commission on Civil Rights stressed their concern for blacks, women and Hispanic Americans as they went through rigorous questioning at a Senate confirmation hearing. The Justice Department asked a Federal court to enforce the Voting Rights Act in two counties of Mississippi. And Mr. Reagan signed an executive order requiring Federal agencies to give greater attention to minority businesses in awarding contracts. William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, just back from a tour of the Mississippi Delta, denied that the moves had been ''orchestrated,'' and Attorney General William French Smith said any suggestion of a political motive was ''totally unwarranted.'' But as serious planning for a possible re-election bid got under way last week, White House officials went out of their way to emphasize the President's long-standing civil rights commitment. To many observers, it appeared that politics was galvanizing the President to do what he might not have done for the sake of principle. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, described the initiatives as ''tokenism.'' Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 165 national organizations, said the Administration's civil rights record had been ''abysmal.'' The Congressional Black Caucus called it ''abominable.'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said the activity prior to the hearing on the civil rights commission nominees reminded him of the way in which the Administration had floated arms control proposals while lobbying for Senate confirmation of Kenneth L. Adelman as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Some conservatives doubt whether the civil rights strategy will work. Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said: ''The Administration is trying to appease the liberal Democratic black leadership by accepting their premises and arguing about the details. But there's no way the President is going to be able to outpromise Walter Mondale or John Glenn. He should be going on the offensive to secure the support of the black middle class, which is essentially conservative on issues such as crime, abortion and national defense.'' Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, said it was frustrating for Republican supporters of civil rights to see the President subjected to a ''daily avalanche'' of criticism. On the whole, many Republicans seemed to be saying that Mr. Reagan's motives were less important than the result: support for civil rights. But Democrats were skeptical. They said the credentials of the Civil Rights Commission nominees -all Democrats - were less important than the dangerous precedent Mr. Reagan would establish by dismissing the incumbents simply because he disliked their views. Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee forced postponement of a confirmation vote until September. William L. Taylor, a former staff director of the commission, called the Reagan initiatives ''an extraordinary public relations offensive'' and said, ''It doesn't have any real substance so far as I can tell.'' But, he added, it was helpful to civil rights groups to have the Administration acknowledge the need for a stronger fair housing law. ''It enhances our chances in Congress,'' he said. The housing debate now moves to the question of remedies. Civil rights groups want a system of administrative law judges, who they say could decide cases much more swiftly than regular Federal judges. President Reagan and the National Association of Realtors say that Federal Courts are the proper tribunal. Thomas Atkins, general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called the Administration's approach to school desegregation reluctant and ineffective. The Justice Department, he said, had been under a court order to take action on the Alabama case. In cases where the Administration is not under court order, lawyers noted, it prefers voluntary school desegregation plans, as in Chicago. Administration officials sometimes imply that their only major disagreement with civil rights groups is over the use of quotas and busing to overcome the effects of discrimination in employment and education. But Hyman Bookbinder of the American Jewish Committee, a firm opponent of quotas, said there was ''a very broadly held perception that this Administration and this Department of Justice are seeking to roll back the civil rights progress of the last 20 years.'' Public opinion polls show that Mr. Reagan has little support among blacks, and Administration officials express little hope of winning more. Frank R. Parker of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said he saw the President's civil rights overtures as ''an effort to convince white middle-class voters who believe in racial equality that the Administration believes in enforcing the law.'' Others said the strategy appeared designed to counteract a perception that the Administration's programs were unfair to minorities and the poor. The White House may have thus concluded that support for civil rights is good politics - that minority rights have majority support. But Mr. Reagan must walk a fine line. He must appear interested in enforcing the civil rights laws. But if he appears too zealous, according to observers at both ends of the political spectrum, he could easily alienate some of his conservative constituency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV VIEW; WHERE TIME STANDS STILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/arts/tv-view-where-time-stands-still.html,"Television, more than any other popular-entertainment medium, has just about demolished ordinary concepts of time. The past is constantly being recycled as stations search for material to fill their schedules. Old movies are so plentiful on television that today's children are growing up on the same films that proved so absorbing to their parents and even their grandparents. Pre-teens can be as knowledgeable as Woody Allen about such Humphrey Bogart movie classics as ''Casablanca.'' Although there have long been movie houses specializing in revivals, they tend to attract cultish audiences numbering at best in the mere hundreds for any given showing. Television conveys the same material to tens of thousands of viewers. And it does so continuously, around the clock. Furthermore, television's tendency to feed upon itself creates an on-going time warp. The daily schedules are crammed with programs produced as far back as a couple of decades ago. For older audiences, the reruns can generate a warm, nostalgic glow, but sociologists are still trying to determine the precise effects television's ''golden oldies'' might be having on youngsters watching them for the first time. Are these new viewers merely amused, or are they taking the content of those relics seriously? What do they make of the values, morality and interrelationships, particularly within the family, as depicted in those old programs? In any case, the sheer volume of present and past in television's cultural cupboard of popular entertainment continues to expand. Indeed, covering the massive flow of new programs coming out of California or New York studios, reviewers often tend to forget that television is more than the commercial networks and public television. And it is more than the new pay channels that offer movies uncensored and without interruptions. Television also consists of independent stations that traditionally have relied on not only old movies but recycled television series to fill their daily schedules. There's one good reason for this phenomenon. The old stuff is usually cheaper, certainly much cheaper than producing new material of similar quality. Now, cable television has given birth to the ''superstation,'' which is really an independent station sending its programming over cable lines or via satellites to viewers far from its home base. One of the first and most successful superstations is Ted Turner's WTBS, which operates out of Atlanta but is available to cable subscribers in cities and towns across the country, including New York. And, as it happens, WTBS is notoriously partial to old TV series. The always colorful Mr. Turner is fond of explaining, with a sanctimoniousness practically begging for skepticism, that the old shows represented good, clean family entertainment. Unlike their more permissive contemporary counterparts, they reflected the ''decent'' values that made this country great. Of course, they also remain cheaper to buy and are a major factor in increasing the station's profits. Consider some of the fare that can be seen on WTBS these days, scattered throughout the station's schedule from morning to night. There are the old sit-coms, ranging from the disposable silliness of ''The Addams Family'' and ''Gomer Pyle, USMC'' to the frequent brilliance of ''I Love Lucy.'' One recent installment of the latter had Lucille Ball eager to get the job of doing commercials on a television show that was to have Desi Arnaz as host. After setting up the situation, rather laboriously, Lucy was required to go through a long rehearsal for selling a health potion that, unknown to her, was made up of 23 percent alcohol. The selling patter ended with Lucy taking a spoonful of the nasty stuff and observing, with a wink, that ''it's so tasty, too - tastes just like candy.'' By the third ''take,'' of course, Lucy began getting noticeably woozy and the selling quickly disintegrated into a hilarious batch of non sequiturs and hiccoughs. That kind of routine, like the early films of Chaplin or Keaton, is truly timeless. One wonders if the reliance on insults and wisecracking that so often tries to pass for humor in today's sit-coms will amuse future generations of viewers. There are other programs, however, in which the content supposedly reflects the attitudes of a particular era. They are presumably the ones that Mr. Turner lauds for their decent values. The classic in this category is undoubtedly ''Father Knows Best,'' the half-hour situation comedy that began on radio in 1949 and then was brought to television in 1954. Its final, first-run broadcast was on April 5, 1963. The star of the series for all of those years was Robert Young. He played an insurance executive named Jim Anderson in a Midwestern town called Springfield. His TV wife Margaret was Jane Wyatt. They had three children, evidently the perfect total for any decent family: Betty (Elinor Donahue), often called Princess by daddy; James Jr. (Billy Gray), a.k.a. Bud; and Kathy (Lauren Chapin), daddy's Kitten. In one episode recently carried on WTBS, Betty agrees to take care of a neighbor's baby for a few days. Daddy, of course, will not hear of Betty staying by herself in a stranger's home; so, the baby is brought over to the Anderson place. Quickly becoming the center of attention, the infant triggers outbursts of jealousy and resentment in Bud and Kathy. Fortunately, the child's parents, fretting over its welfare, return early, furnishing a resolution of sorts. The final scene has the Andersons discovering Kathy sleeping in her old crib, sucking her thumb. Father, always knowing best, warmly assures her that ''you're our baby, Kitten, you'll always be our baby.'' And thus, the concept of the nuclear family is perceived as it should be, not necessarily as it really is. The same sort of idealized past can be found in ''My Three Sons,'' a sit-com that had its premiere in 1960 with Fred MacMurray as Steve Douglas, an aviation engineer and head of an all-male household in a medium-sized Middle Western city. A week or so ago, Steve could be seen genially tolerating the filmmaking aspirations of his oldest son Robbie (Don Grady). Doing a class project for high school, Robbie becomes ensnared in the avant-garde ambitions of an attractive classmate named Gina. He begins his film recording some ''ordinary'' scenes of his family, but Gina soon has him exploring more ''meaningful'' themes of personal freedom. In the end, of course, the footage about the family is voted best in the class while Gina's pretentiousness is good only for laughs. Gee, says dad, ''I guess our dull and ordinary routines are kind of interesting after all.'' It is all very sweet and comforting, ages away from the drugs, premarital sex and abortions that receive so much attention on some of today's entertainments. It is also too simplistic to be real. Anybody hankering after the easy answers and comforting certainties of yesteryear can vicariously relive it all with little effort. The past is solidly entrenched in the daily television schedule, there for the sampling, presumably forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CANDIDATES BEGIN SPRINT FOR CAMPAIGN FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/candidates-begin-sprint-for-campaign-funds.html,"The Democratic National Committee held its issues forum for Presidential candidates in a downtown hotel here last week. But another event that revealed a great deal about the status of the Democrats' contest took place a few miles away, at the Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church. There, on Thursday night, the choir of the black church sang ''Sign Me Up,'' a spiritual with voter-registration overtones, and the minister greeted the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson with a shout of ''Run, Jesse, run.'' Mr. Jackson had a grand time encouraging the guessing game over whether he will turn his voter-registration crusade into a fullfledged convention candidacy. The black minister from Chicago reminded the committee that he is already running third in many public opinion polls behind former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senator John Glenn of Ohio. That means, he said, that even without a formal announcement, he has ''greater market appeal'' than Senators Alan Cranston of California, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Gary Hart of Colorado and former Governor Reubin Askew of Florida. On the surface, the Democrats were cheerful about letting Rev. Jackson use their four-day meeting as a stage to generate suspense about his plans. Behind the scenes, there was plenty of speculation about how badly a Jackson candidacy would hurt Mr. Mondale, who is counting on heavy minority support. But the six announced candidates have other worries. They know, for example, that whatever he does, they face the chore of slogging through the dog days of summer despite the indifference of the vacationing public. In the period between now and Labor Day, the candidates must try to raise as much money as possible before the New Jersey straw poll September 12-13 ushers in an unremitting grind that will extend into the 1984 primaries. Mr. Mondale has been particularly busy and successful at fundraising, piling up a $2 million surplus so far. Many Democratic strategists believe that cash on hand, particularly if saved for advertising, could be a big factor in the winnowing process in March, when a number of important primaries come close together. For Mr. Mondale and Mr. Glenn, other kinds of testing are going on as well. Mr. Mondale seems to be emerging from a bad period in which Mr. Glenn pulled even with him in the polls and Mr. Cranston beat him in the Wisconsin straw poll. That fed the feeling he had shaky support among party activists and the public was looking for a fresher face. In responding to these developments, he exhibited a peevish streak that added to his difficulties. But Mr. Mondale seems to have regained his humor and some momentum among party activists, and it seems to be Mr. Glenn's turn to take the pressure. Mr. Glenn had an easy ride through the spring, gaining in the polls while avoiding the campaign fray. But he is entering a period when his skills as a major candidate will get closer scrutiny. Mondale advisers have long contended privately that Mr. Glenn will not be able ''to breathe at high altitude,'' as they put it. Moving in on a Two-Way Race In fact, he got bad reviews from Democratic House members after a closed-door political meeting in Washington last week. In Detroit, a question on what he would do in his first hundred days seemed to catch him unprepared. In general, however, his speaking style has improved, and his advisers believe that grassroots voters are less concerned than the capital's political community over fine-tuned answers on policy. The other four announced candidates now find themselves struggling against a general consensus that the party has a two-way race. Mr. Askew, looking for a surprise showing in Iowa's caucuses, has been quietly working among Catholic voters who share his misgivings about abortion. Mr. Hart skipped the issues forum in Detroit to filibuster against the MX missile, part of a bold-stroke plan with which his advisers hope to invigorate a campaign that has not drawn the support they expected. Mr. Cranston and his staff, after making gains on the nuclear freeze, seem to be taking a breather. And Mr. Hollings, stung last week when the National Association of Colored People rebuked him for what they regarded as a suspect commitment to civil rights, is still searching for a way to become more than an asterisk in the polls. All these candidates were allotted one hour in Detroit. Party leaders were in a quandary as to what to do about Mr. Jackson. Since he was trailed everywhere by television crews and reporters and is demonstrably popular with black voters, who make up 20 percent of the Democratic electorate, he could hardly be ignored. So it was decreed that Mr. Jackson would be alloted 10 minutes on Friday, provided he limited himself to civil rights. But Mr. Jackson's presence alone was sufficient to underscore questions he raises. Will a black candidacy benefit the Democratic party by encouraging minority registration or polarize it? Will a Jackson candidacy, by taking black support from Mr. Mondale, open the way for Mr. Glenn. That the Mondale people hope Mr. Jackson will eventually bow out and throw his support to them was clear at the Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church. When Mr. Jackson arrived, he had two smiling escorts: John Riley, the senior adviser in the Mondale campaign, and Thomas Donilan, a Mondale political consultant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WILL THE REAL REAGAN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PLEASE STAND UP?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/will-the-real-reagan-justice-department-please-stand-up.html,"It was the best of times and the worst of times for the Justice Department during the Supreme Court term that ended this month. In fact, it sometimes seemed there were two Justice Departments filing briefs and arguing cases before the High Court. One - the traditional defender of Federal agencies, their programs and statutes - had a success rate that could only be called impressive. Using legal arguments that could have been made, and often were, any time during the past 10 years by other Administrations, this department won many more cases than it lost on topics such as Federal benefit programs, immigration, taxation, criminal procedure and, of special satisfaction to many of its lawyers, the legislative veto. The other Justice Department - the proselytizer for the Reagan Administration's political and social agenda - compiled a record that was at best spotty and sometimes disastrous. This was the department that told the Court the Internal Revenue Service had no legal authority to deny tax exempt status to discriminatory private schools; that state and local opposition to abortion merited ''heavy deference'' from Federal judges; and that there was no legal impediment to revoking a previous Administration's regulation that mandated automatic seat belts or airbags in new cars. (The rule was unpopular with the new deregulators.) By wide margins, the Justices rejected these arguments, handing the Administration stunning losses that overshadowed several legal victories on Reagan ''agenda'' issues, such as tuition tax deductions and limitations on court-awarded attorneys fees. All three losses were to some degree self-inflicted wounds. The Justice Department was originally on the winning side in the Bob Jones University tax exemption case, but switched at the last minute on orders from the White House. The Government had to join the legal debate on this matter, since the question was one of Federal tax policy, but not the abortion case. The Supreme Court had already agreed to review regulations in Missouri and Akron, Ohio, which restricted access to abortion, when Solicitor General Rex E. Lee filed a brief that said the abortion issue is a matter for elected officials, not Federal judges, to decide. As a nonparty, the Government had to seek special permission to argue before the Court. It was there that Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, holding high a copy of the brief and glaring at the Solicitor General in a mixture of anger and incredulity, demanded: ''Did you write this brief personally?'' A Tradition of Deference The airbag case was an Administration appeal that many Government lawyers had advised against filing. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had ruled the Administration's rescission of the airbag rule ''arbitrary and capricious.'' The appeals court opinion was persuasive. More important, it turned on the specific facts of a single and unusual case, and thus did not seem to meet the usual criteria for a Supreme Court review. The Court did take the case, however, displaying the deference it has traditionally accorded Government appeals; it takes roughly twothirds of Government cases as against about 3 percent of everyone else's. One question raised by the experience this term is whether the Government can continue to count on that deference. The Court rejected the Justice Department's advice on two notable occasions. It refused the department's request to hear an appeal by the school board of Nashville, Tenn. from a Federal court busing order. The order, based on a finding that Nashville schools remained segregated after 27 years of litigation, was consistent with Supreme Court precedents in this area. Career lawyers within Justice had warned their superiors that the grounds for Nashville's appeal were so weak that the department would be jeopardizing its credibility by coming anywhere near the case. The second rebuff came the last day of the term. The new Reagan Administration majority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wanted to reverse an existing policy that favored states and municipalities over private industry in renewals of operating licenses for hydroelectric power plants. Unfortunately for the commission, a Federal appeals court had just upheld the policy and an appeal by the utility industry was pending at the Supreme Court. Solicitor General Lee asked the Justices to send the case back to the appeals court for reconsideration ''in light of intervening circumstances,'' namely the energy commission's change of membership and heart. It was a highly unusual request and the Court said ''no'' by denying the utility industry's appeal. So far, the Court has appeared able to distinguish one Justice Department from the other, separating cases that represent the Government's traditional institutional interests from those that seek to advance Administration goals. But further tests of the department's credibility lie ahead. It is currently considering whether to join Alabama's appeal from a lower court decision that the state's school prayer laws are unconstitutional. The department already has asked the Court to rule that a city may include a Nativity scene as part of an official Christmas display. According to the Government's brief, a Federal appeals court decision that such a display in Pawtucket, R.I. was unconstitutional ''mandates an artificial and undesirable sterility in public life.'' Erosion of the Government's credibility would be a more serious and lasting institutional blow than the loss of one case or many. Highly placed Administration lawyers acknowledge the risk, but insist there is nothing wrong with trying to use the Supreme Court to advance the cause. Legal arguments that are lost on nine judges may still reassure watchful voters of the Administration's commitment. As one official put it: ''If you win too many, you're being too timid.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/nyregion/westchester-journal-032409.html,"time Westchester resident, has gone Hollywood. For years, a life-size effigy of Paine resided in the writer's New Rochelle cottage, given to him in 1784 by the state in gratitude for his service during the Revolutionary War. Most recently, the deteriorating figure had been relegated to storage. The members of the Huguenot-Thomas Paine Historical Association, which maintains the cottage and the Thomas Paine Museum, decided to try to remedy that. Last May, they enlisted the aid of a makeup artist from Larchmont, Dick Smith, known for aging Dustin Hoffman in ''Little Big Man'' and Marlon Brando in ''The Godfather'' and for creating the demonic Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist.'' He also designed the apparitions in ''Ghost Story'' and the experiments in ''Altered States.'' ''They read about me and called,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They figured, nothing ventured, nothing gained.'' What they gained was not an offer to repair the effigy, which Mr. Smith called ''a total disaster,'' but to make a new head and pair of hands for it. ''If I had charged them my normal price, it would have knocked them off their feet,'' Mr. Smith said; he charged them nothing. Mr. Smith worked at his home for a few weeks using an acrylic that was ''least likely to yellow.'' It was not easy. ''Everything seemed to go wrong for a time,'' he said. ''I never had such a run of bad luck.'' But even adversity had some fortunate consequences. The acrylic developed ''some interesting craters,'' resulting in a more realistically pockmarked face. When he had finished his sculpturing, Mr. Smith obtained a new costume and wig for the statue and delivered it June 2. ''I'm pleased with him,'' he said. ''I see some things I could have done better, but the old one didn't even look like Thomas Paine. It bore no resemblance to that wonderful, big-nosed man.'' Peter S. Gannon, past president of the association, was more enthusiastic. ''It's fantastic,'' he said, ''it's just so perfectly Paine it's incredible. Everybody who has seen it is excited. It's Paine in the flesh.'' Or at least in the acrylic. Westchester residents will have a special opportunity to pass their own judgments next Sunday, when the Paine association has a fund-raising lawn party from 3 P.M. to 6 at the cottage, at the corner of North and Paine Avenues. Mr. Smith will be the guest of honor, and donations of $6 will be asked. The effigy is also on view weekends from 2 to 5 P.M. There is no admission charge, but donations are welcome. - Gary Kriss The county Board of Legislators called on the state last week to enact a law to require physicians to notify parents before performing abortions on minors. The lawmakers approved a similar measure in 1980, but it was vetoed by Alfred B. DelBello, who was County Executive, as being outside the county's jurisdiction. Efforts in Albany to approve notification laws have failed. The vote on the request for the state to act was 11 to 6, almost completely along party lines. Among the Republicans, only Edward M. Gibbs of Peekskill, vice chairman, voted no. John A. DeRario of New Rochelle was the sole Democrat in favor. Mr. Gibbs said: ''We have no stand in this matter. The state reserves the right to legislate.'' He said that, in any case, ''notification has led to physical abuse and the breakup of weak family relationships.'' Mr. DeRario argued for an end to the situation where ''you can take a girl out of school for an abortion without telling the parents.'' John E. Hand, Republican of Yorktown Heights, introduced the resolution, saying it asked that any state law be ''tailored to meet U.S. Supreme Court standards.'' The High Court last month upheld parental or judicial consent when a girl was not ''emancipated'' or mature enough to make her own decision. But it also struck down an Akron, Ohio, ordinance because it did not protect the rights of mature minors. The ruling recalled that the Court had held that ''the state may not impose a blanket provision'' ...''requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor.'' Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale, said the major impact of the legislation would be to delay young women's seeking medical assistance. This was characterized by John P. O'Leary, Republican of Yonkers, as ''scare tactics.'' Several legislators spoke of their own daughters, but Sandra R. Galef, Democrat of Ossining, said, ''We have to look beyond our personal interests.'' ''There are many families where problems would follow notification.'' she said. ''It comes down to intrusion on individual rights.'' Edward J. Brady, Republican of Thornwood and the majority leader, asked, ''How can it be that a child can't get an arm set without parental notification?'' Mrs. Hochberg said it was because of ''the threat of medical malpractice suits, but doctors are protected regarding venereal disease and in this area.'' Dominick D. Pierro, Republican of Port Chester, said, ''Our earlier law was bad, like passing local legislation on the death penalty, but now we should get a law that's acceptable to the Supreme Court.'' Ronald C. Tocci, Democrat of New Rochelle, favored notification and called for more study, but the vote was taken and the resolution approved. - James Feron In its second year in the United States, American Foreign Study Programs has added Westchester County to its list of areas in the nation that are available to French students participating in onemonth cultural exchanges. However, the organizers of the program are learning that finding host families in the county is ''a little harder than we thought,'' according to Vera Sklaar, national coordinator of the organization, which has its American headquarters in White Plains. With 20 years' experience arranging programs for 5,000 students a year between France and England, the Paris-based program has been seeking families to provide room and meals for students between 14 and 22. In exchange for ''inviting the world home in the person of a student from another land,'' the program hopes the host families will be exposed to the students' cultures. Two groups of 15 students each are in the county currently, but 20 who are due to arrive Aug. 4 are without hosts. ''Things are moving a little slower than we anticipated,'' Mrs. Sklaar said. ''It's a little difficult getting through to people that it would be fun.'' Many of the students to be placed are male, according to Mrs. Sklaar, because ''we always run out of girls first.'' She said the usual advance correspondence between the hosts and students would probably not take place. ''There's the element of the blind date about it now,'' she said. The not-for-profit program says it is not educationally oriented. Mrs. Sklaar said it was affiliated with a French version of Parent-Teacher Associations and the Ministry of Education. The groups will not attend any classes but will concentrate on developing conversational English. All of the 800 students who will visit the United States, with 200 on the East Coast, have studied English for at least two years. Groups in other parts of the country will participate in academic studies. Coordinators drawn from the ranks of teachers and social workers are supervisors and recreation planners; one French leader is available for each 45 students. Executives of the program would like to offer an exchange next year for American teen-agers who are members of host families. For information, call the local coordinator, Jane Berkowicz, at 946-4235. - John B.

"CATHOLIC PAPER, CHILD OF FRENCH HISTORY, IS REBORN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/18/world/catholic-paper-child-of-french-history-is-reborn.html,"''In our view, the daily press is the plague of our era,'' said the editorial in the very first issue. ''The best of the newspapers are worth nothing.'' The words were written 100 years ago last month by the Rev. Francois Picard. With them, he and a group of Assumptionist priests launched La Croix, a daily newspaper determined to preach the religious order's combative, monarchist version of Roman Catholicism to what was rapidly becoming one of the most secular countries in the West. La Croix is celebrating its 100th anniversary this summer, but its founders might have some difficulty in recognizing what has become of their journal, or indeed of their religious order. ''If I refer to the first editorial of the paper, it saw the rights of man as opposed to the rights of God,'' said the Rev. Noel Copin, a well-known television journalist who began his career at La Croix and recently returned as its managing editor. ''Today the cause of the rights of man is one of the permanent themes of our combat.'' So is support for democracy, the welfare state and help for the third world. The changes in the paper and in the Assumptionist order reflect one of the most profound shifts in French life over the last three decades: A virtual end to the struggle between Catholicism and the secular republic, and the blossoming of a variety of relationships between French Catholicism and the political left. Even though a majority of practicing Catholics here still vote for parties of the right, the encounter between Catholicism and the left has changed both sides. Founder Hated the Revolution And few parts of the church have changed as much as the Assumptionists. When the Rev. Emmanuel d'Alzon founded the order in 1845 at the College of the Assumption in Nimes, his purpose was largely to fight the French Republic and its secular doctrines. One recently published Catholic guide to the various religious orders described Father d'Alzon's hatred of the French Revolution as ''quasi-obsessional.'' How profound was the antipathy between the church and the anticlerical left? To answer, the Rev. Henri Guillemin, an Assumptionist official, took a recent visitor to the Assumptionists' headquarters in the Latin Quarter here down a corridor for a look at a 13th-century statue of Our Lady of Salvation. ''If you notice, the nose was originally chipped off, and there's damage to the face and the arms, and to the Baby Jesus in her arms,'' he said. ''That happened when a supporter of the Paris Commune of 1871 shot the statue in the face, and then took a hammer to it.'' The period of the Commune, when a group of revolutionaries took control of Paris for two months, is heroic in the history of the left but was nothing short of a disaster in the eyes of Catholics. Originally, the Assumptionists sought to restore the church through religious education and pilgrimages to holy places. In 1873, as part of the latter mission, they started a magazine called The Pilgrim. That, said Father Guillemin, is when the order learned the power of the press. Ten years later La Croix was born and the history of the order, its daily and French Catholicism have been intertwined ever since. Wrong Side of the Dreyfus Case ''At the beginning La Croix was monarchist, nationalist and anti-Semitic,'' said the Rev. Charles Monsch, who after 34 years as the paper's chief librarian, serves as what one journalist described as ''the ministry of memory.'' The paper's anti-Semitism was especially virulent in 1894, when a Jewish army officer was accused of treason in what has become known as the Dreyfus Affair. Despite an anticlerical Government's efforts to shut the paper down at the turn of the century by temporarily throwing the Assumptionists out of France, La Croix prospered. During the German occupation from 1940 to 1944, La Croix was a mixture of Vatican pronouncements and articles sympathetic to Vichy and the Nazis. But Father Guillemin argues that careful readers could see non-Vichy messages if they read between the lines, and while most Vichyite papers were shut down, La Croix was allowed to remain open after the liberation. A Postwar Rebirth It was in the postwar period that the new French Catholic church was born, and the Assumptionists reflected the change. ''None of us were the same after the war,'' said Father Guillemin, who went underground during the occupation to avoid compulsory work in Germany and resumed his religious studies in the late 1940's. In the mid-1950's a new La Croix also began to take shape. It dropped the crucifix from its masthead and its style began to resemble that of a modern daily - and a daily that won praise from secular journalists. Politically, the paper and the order embraced the modern world, moving toward a kind of centrist progressivism that increasingly characterized the church's approach to politics. Today the influence of what Father Monsch called social Catholicism can be seen in both the governing Socialist Party and in the opposition. The church and the Socialist Government are skirmishing over the role of religious schools, but for the most part, the old clerical-secular battles are over. Crisis and Reorganization Like many religious orders, the Assumptionists have faced a crisis in vocations - their numbers have declined to 1,400 from about 1,900 in the late 1960's - and the order reorganized itself in the late 1960's. The emphasis is on small communities of five to a dozen priests living together, with the priests often pursuing entirely different tasks. But much of the order's energy is still focused on its publishing house, Bayard Press. The house puts out not only La Croix - ''the apple of our eye,'' said Father Guillemin - but a wide range of magazines and books. The profits from Bayard's other activities cover La Croix's annual deficit of about $1 million, and also keep it independent from direct ecclesiastical or private control. Unlike most of France's national papers, which rely heavily on newsstand sales, this afternoon daily is supported by subscribers, who account for over 80 percent of 115,000 daily sales. A Policy of 'No Slogans' ''No slogans,'' is how one priest described the paper's politics at a mass held in the paper's honor last month at Notre Dame. The result is that conservatives disagree with the paper's social democratic approach to economic issues, while some members of the left find the paper's opposition to abortion or its occasional criticisms of the disarmament movement hard to accept. With a crisp new layout, the paper's circulation has begun to climb after a decline over the last few years. But Catholic it will remain, as long as the Assumptionists have anything to do with it. ''If our founders came back, they'd initially be very agitated over what has happened to the paper and the order,'' said Father Guillemin. ''But I like to think that they'd eventually understand that we're still doing their work in promulgating the Gospel.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SHOPPING MALLS PROTEST INTRUSION BY PROTESTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/19/nyregion/shopping-malls-protest-intrusion-by-protesters.html,"Many shopping mall operators say they have had the uncomfortable feeling of late that the outside world is seeping into their cool, stone, windowless palaces of retailing. Here in a suburb of Hartford, attorneys for the 127-store Westfarms Mall have been battling in court for more than two years to keep out the National Organization for Women. The women's organization argues that even though such malls are private property, they have become the nation's ''new downtowns,'' public places where individuals and groups have as much right to collect signatures on petitions and hand out literature as on any street corner. Moreover, argues Martin Margulies, the group's attorney, ''malls are the place, the only place, to see people in the suburbs anymore.'' The women's organization won the first round in its court battle with Westfarms Mall early last year when a judge granted them admittance for a set time to gather signatures on petitions supporting ratification of the equal rights amendment. In March of this year the group won the right to return to the mall amid dire warnings by attorneys for the mall that this would open the door for radical groups. Within days the Ku Klux Klan showed up to distribute literature, and the mall attorneys asked for a rehearing. A court decision is expected within days in the case, one of a rash in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey challenging the rights of malls to exclude such groups. There is deep concern over allowing the women's group and its folding card table into the mall, officials of mall-developing companies said, because the nation's more than 2,000 enclosed malls are overwhelmingly successful, finely tuned selling machines in which everything from climate to clientele have always been closely controlled to produce an impeccably pleasant shopping environment. Although malls teeming with thousands of shoppers seem to be public marketplaces, they are decidedly not, the officials said. Retailers not fitting the total marketing concept are not allowed in, the officials said, and the ones that are have their hours set and their store designs approved by mall managements. Malls contain no pool halls or gin mills or those who frequent them, no Hare Krishnas soliciting funds, no one with leaflets protesting abortion or reminding shoppers of the potential for nuclear holocaust, no inclement weather, no windows, no clocks -nothing to break the spell. ''We in the industry are quite concerned about a loss of control,'' said Peter Hollis, senior vice president for the Taubman Company, one of the nation's largest mall developers and the management concern for Westfarms. ''The hassle-free environment is the whole basis of shopping mall development.'' ''And malls are just a beginning,'' warned Robert Dombroff, attorney for Westfarms. ''If the court allows activist groups into malls, they must also be allowed into department stores. Both are private property. Condominiums, movie theaters, bowling alleys and churches will be next.'' Mall operators worry that if the National Organization for Women is allowed in, other groups, some of them undesirable, will demand equal rights. Some worry that if their malls are deemed public, they may one day be obliged to lease space to pornography shops. When the Klan appeared at the Westfarms Mall, it cited its right to be there by virtue of the NOW decision -and the police, also citing the NOW decision, refused to arrest the Klan members for trespassing. Palmer McGee, Farmington Town Attorney, said, ''We made no trespassing arrests because the judge's ruling seemed to be going along with rulings in other states that malls are now just like the town green, that they are public domain.'' The police also recently refused to arrest on trespassing charges members of an antinuclear power group and the Constitutional Revivalists organization. Klan members departed at the suggestion of the police, but a fight broke out between anti-Klan protesters and police officers in riot gear, resulting in several arrests and minor injuries. Mr. Dombroff immediately asked the court to reverse its ruling admitting NOW, something the judge is to decide within a few days. Mr. Dombroff said that the previous ruling had produced ''chaos'' and that the mall could no longer protect its private property. He introduced figures indicating a significant loss of sales at the mall the day of the Klan melee. Mr. Margulies called the clash ''one of the prices we have to pay for a First Amendment''. Last March antinuclear activists on Long Island protesting the construction of the Shoreham nuclear power plant won the right to distribute literature in the South Haven Mall. Mall officials had argued that the mall was designed to be ''a relaxed, pleasant, noncontroversial, family oriented place,'' inappropriate to such activity, but a State Supreme Court justice said that the mall was ''public or quasi-public property'' and that the intrusion on the right of privacy was minimal compared with the group's right of free speech. The judge noted that the mall opened its doors to charity auctions, permitted recruitment by the Army and local universities and played host to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. He added that the mall ''could be considered to perform the functional equivalent of a town center.'' The decision has been appealed. In April a Municipal Court judge in Paramus, N.J., ruled in favor of the owners of the Bergen Mall in a case brought by a political candidate who wanted to distribute campaign materials there. The attorney for the candidate, who has appealed the decision, said: ''There is no real downtown Paramus. Areas of the mall outside the stores are the town's public sidewalks.'' He noted that community events were held at the mall and that it contained a meeting hall, a post office and a Roman Catholic chapel. The United States Supreme Court held in 1980 that the First Amendment did not guarantee the right to pass petitions and distribute handbills in shopping malls, but it said that states could interpret their own constitutions to protect such activities, and several states have. Most malls involved have been allowed to promulgate rigid guidelines for the activities of such groups once inside, such as where tables can be placed and how actively the groups might solicit shoppers. ''The malls have supplanted downtowns,'' said Mr. Margulies, ''and have derived substantial benefits. Now they must fulfill some responsibilities.'' He and other attorneys across the country are now arguing that the malls invite the public in and that those who accept the invitation take their constitutional rights in with them. Mr. Hollis said that people in the mall business were closely watching what happens to NOW and its folding card table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WORKING PROFILE; AIDE FOCUSES ON 'ABILITY TO LOOK FOWARD',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/us/working-profile-aide-focuses-on-ability-to-look-foward.html,"Long-range planning has not received much priority in the modern White House, as recent Administrations have rarely looked more than a few months ahead. But President Reagan has just hired Bruce K. Chapman, a Harvard-trained former liberal, to think about what the future of the national Government ought to be. Jerry Falwell and others of the new right need not worry about his background. Mr. Chapman has put his past behind him and comes to the job with a conservative philosophy that even Mr. Reagan might envy. While the President goes back to small-town Illinois for his vision for America, Mr. Chapman goes back to Socrates in ancient Greece. Mr. Chapman, 42 years old, who has been director of the Census Bureau for the past two years, takes over this week as deputy assistant to the President and director of the Office of Planning and Evaluation in the White House, an office that has been vacant for some time. According to the announcement of the appointment, Mr. Chapman will report to Edwin Meese 3d, the President's counselor, and will be responsible for ''long-range issues identification, statistical analysis, and program evaluation.'' Condemns Liberals in Address On June 4, when Mr. Chapman was running the Census Bureau and there was no hint, at least in public, that he would be moving to the White House, he delivered a commencement address at Monmouth College in Illinois that added up to a strong condemnation of liberals and liberal causes so prominent in American government since the New Deal. The address was surprising for two reasons. First, census directors usually concern themselves with the collection of data and leave the enunciation of issues to Cabinet members and others involved in partisan programs. Second, Mr. Chapman, a former Treasurer of Washington State, had been a moderate Republican throughout his political career, which began as a member of the Seattle City Council. He was a rebel Republican in his youth when he was a liberal journalist and a member of the Ripon Society, a group of moderate and liberal young Republicans who challenged the old conservatives, including Mr. Reagan. His appointment to the White House staff was a surprise. Mr. Chapman had long been known as ''Mr. Clean,'' a nickname he picked up when he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Washington, and some considered him ill-suited for the brawls of the White House, where Presidential aides, as they have in every Administration, fight with long knives. Re-election Effort Is Hinted Yet it seemed to some that Mr. Chapman, having turned in his liberal credentials, was being brought to the White House to help shore up the Reagan policies for the re-election effort next year, an effort already under way even though Mr. Reagan has not announced his intention to run. Not so, Mr. Chapman said in an interview. He said he would be called on to supply data on current issues, but that his main task would be to give the Government ''the ability to look forward'' in the development of policies as it never has before. According to the White House announcement, Mr. Chapman ''also will help stimulate the climate for public discussion of long-range issues of importance to the President's goals.'' For this, Mr. Chapman's address at Monmouth College suggested he might be the perfect person for the job. He represents a converging of the intellectual left with the religious right within the party under the Reagan banner. What Mr. Chapman believes he believes with a parson's fervor, and the Monmouth address was an outpouring of his personal feelings. 'Sophistical Values' Are Scorned He drew parallels between modern America with the ''corrupt democracy'' of Greece, in which the Sophists, holding that man himself was the measure of all things, opposed Socrates, ''a religious man, a man of reason, a patriot.'' ''Isn't it ironic that these shabby, discredited, sophistical values once more are considered fashionable?'' he said. On sexual freedom, he said: ''The pendulum has swung far away from traditional morality, past liberty and into license. But far from the scene of hedonistic bliss, as promised, we see before us a frightening landscape of personal and social tragedy. Medical science itself apparently cannot keep up with the development of exotic new diseases. We also are witnessing a steep rise in child abuse, a rocketing increase in abortions - terminating one out of three pregnancies - and a sharp rise in the proportion of children born out of wedlock -one out of eight children now for the population as a whole.'' On crime: ''Another example of present-day sophistry that needs to be exposed is the idea that crime is a response to bad economic conditions rather than a reflection of the antisocial attitudes of individuals and an atmosphere that subtly tolerates crime. The statistics show no particular correlation between high unemployment levels, or an increase in poverty, and high crime rates.'' On the family: ''A census study shows that poverty is more the result of family dissolution than the cause of family dissolution.'' Rather than providing greater subsidies to the poor, ''the Government should be asking itself: 'What economic and social disincentives to family intactness should be removed?' '' On the national defense: ''Our willingness to promote our ideals patiently and persistently - the will of the West - is weakened by many of our own internal critics. For them, a reflexive cynicism about their own country is easier, perhaps because it often offers a quicker path to career success than to owning up to the demanding and fearsome realities we face.'' In a recent interview, Mr. Chapman said that the Republican Party had changed more than he had, and that it had shed much of the negativism that he and George F. Gilder, an early advocate of supply-side economics, had found objectionable in the book they wrote in 1966, ''The Party That Lost Its Head.'' ''But finally,'' he said. ''I have become more conservative as I have grown older.'' And the ideas he expounded at Monmouth College are compatible with those expressed by Senator Barry Goldwater in his climb to the Republican Presidential nomination 20 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"14 INTELLECTUALS GET AWARDS OF UP TO $300,000",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/us/14-intellectuals-get-awards-of-up-to-300000.html,"Fourteen ''exceptionally talented individuals'' were named yesterday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago to receive awards ranging from $24,000 to $60,000 annually for five years. They included Randall Forsberg, a leader in the nuclear freeze movement, and Alice M. Rivlin, an economist who is leaving as director of the Congressional Budget Office, and Prof. Sylvia Law of New York University, a legal scholar who has been an advocate of the right to abortion. The latest awards of the foundation went to more individuals identified with public policy issues than in the past, according to members of the selection committee. Ninety-six people have received awarded since the program began in 1981. ''It shows we are not afraid to pick controversial individuals,'' said J. Roderick MacArthur, chairman of the MacArthur Fellows Program. ''We like to think of ourselves as fearless. We're doing our best to look at the promise of individuals and not to worry about the causes they espouse.'' Mr. MacArthur is the son of John D. MacArthur, a billionaire insurance and real estate executive who died in 1978, leaving his family and business associates to set up the MacArthur Foundation. The younger Mr. MacArthur initiated the fellowships as ''no-strings awards'' to enable scientists, scholars and artists to pursue research or creative activity. The awards are tax-free. The recipients of MacArthur awards cannot apply; they must be recommended to the selection committee by nominators who act as talent scouts and whose identities is secret. Those awarded grants do not have to account for how they spend their time or the money. Of the 96 winners, 13 have been women and the current selection of four was higher than in the past. The size of a grant is determined by a recipient's age. A minimum grant of $24,000 annually would go to a 21-year-old person. The grants increase to $60,000 for winners 66 years years old or older. The highest award was $300,000. Miss Forsberg, 40 years old, who is the director of a small liberal study group called the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies in Brookline, Mass., is credited with devising the concept of a nuclear freeze. She will receive a five-year award totaling $204,000. Miss Rivlin, 52, has served two four-year terms as head of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan investigative agency advising legislators on economic policy. She was awarded $252,000. Professor Law, 41, is a litigator and legal scholar who has served as counsel for welfare recipients in Supreme Court cases. She was given $208,000. The other recipients were: Seweryn Bialer, 56, professor of political science, Columbia University; his studies of Soviet and Polish politics include a current work on the Soviet Union as a global power and an analysis of Leninism and the peasantry; $268,000. William C. Clark, 34, special technical assistant to the director, Institute for Energy Analysis, Oak Ridge, Tenn.; he is a specialist in ecological and environmental studies; $180,000. Alexander George, 63, professor of political science at Stanford University; he is a specialist in American-Soviet relations and has written about crisis management in international affairs; $295,200. Mott Greene, 37, assistant professor of geology at Skidmore College; his concern is with the history of geology; $192,000. James Gunn, 44, professor of astronomy at Princeton University; he works in astronomical observation, theory and instrumentation; $220,000. John J. Hopfield, 50, professor at California Institute of Technology; he has made contributions to scientific developments in solid state physics; $244,000. Robert Merton, 73, sociologist and professor emeritus at Columbia University; he has pioneered in ideas about status and role and made major contributions to sociological theory; $300,000. Walter Morris Jr., 30, technical adviser and collector of Chiapas folk art at the Museo Nacional de Industrias y Arte Popular in Mexico; he founded an indepedent weavers' cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico; $164,000. Attipat Krishnaswami Ramanujan, 54, professor on social thought, University of Chicago; born in Mysore, India., he is a poet and translator and has written about linguistics and folklore; $260,000. Richard Schoen, 32, professor of mathematics, University of California at Berkeley; he works on global nonlinear partial differential equations with an application to differential geometry; $172,000.

2 WOMEN BECOME PREGNANT WITH TRANSFERRED EMBRYOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/22/us/2-women-become-pregnant-with-transferred-embryos.html,"A team of California doctors reported yesterday what it said were the world's first two pregnancies achieved as a result of a technique in which an embryo is transferred from one woman to another. Experts in the fields of obstetrics and embryology hailed the achievement and said it would probably substantially enhance the possibility of parenthood for women who might otherwise be infertile. The report comes amid increasing activity in reproductive physiology. In the last several years, research and laboratory work in the field has led to the birth of more than 100 babies as a result of in vitro fertilization, the uniting of sperm and egg outside the womb in a glass dish. The new technique differs from that ''test-tube'' method in that sperm from the prospective father is first placed in the uterus of the woman who donates her ovum. Then, in the first week of her pregnancy, the resulting tiny embryo, a microscopic clump of about 100 cells, is flushed out of her womb and is transferred to the womb of the woman who will carry the baby to full term and be known as the infant's mother. Several experts in reproductive physiology said they believed that this ''in vivo'' method might well be superior to the ''test-tube'' method because the chances of success would be far higher. Only about one-quarter of in vitro attempts at fertilization have been successful. Many moral, religious and legal questions about such pregnancies have led some researchers to shy away from such experimentation. Associates of the medical team at University of California at Los Angeles, for example, said its members had agreed to undertake the work only after groups of researchers at other hospitals had declined to do so. The principal researcher in the team, which works at the Harbor General Hospital-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Torrance, is Dr. John E. Buster, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the U.C.L.A. Medical School. He was assisted by Dr. Maria Bustillo, an assistant professor, and five other specialists. Their report was published in the current issue of The Lancet, a medical journal printed in London. The issue has yet to be distributed in this country. Dr. Ian Craft, a leading British obstetrician, said in a telephone interview yesterday that he considered the California work to be important because it might be a more effective method of fertilization. Yet he cautioned that the method had yet to be perfected. Indeed, the group in Los Angeles was successful in only two of the six attempts it made. Two Successful Cases In the two successful cases, the account in The Lancet said, one of the women who received a transferred embryo was in her fifth month of pregnancy and the other was in her fifth week. Neither of the women was identified by name or residence, nor was the donor, or donors, of the ovum. The report did not make clear if one or more donors had been involved. Dr. Wayne Decker, executive director of the New York Fertility Research Foundation, said of the report: ''I think it's a great thing. I hope it will stimulate more activity in this area. I have always felt this approach would have a much higher degree of success than the in vitro method.'' Dr. Randolph W. Seed, an assistant professor of surgery at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, who assisted in the development of the new technique along with his brother, Dr. Richard G. Seed, said in an interview that the technique was known as ''adoptive pregnancy.'' Dr. Seed said widespread use of the transfer technique might reduce to a small fraction the thousands of couples that would be unable to have children of their own. He said the technique would be of value to women who did not have functioning ovaries, to those afraid that their own ovum might in some way be genetically damaged and to those who might not be able to tolerate the surgery necessary for the ''test-tube'' fertilization procedure. Tool in Cattle Breeding Ovum transfer has become a major tool of commercial cattle breeding in the United States in recent years. The technique has been used in at least a dozen other species since before the turn of the century. At least 60,000 cattle have been born of ovum transfer in this country, with no detectable increase in the frequency of birth defects or other problems associated with pregnancy. Laboratory fertilization, the conventional technique for humans, was developed in Britain by Dr. Robert Edwards and Dr. Patrick Steptoe. The first baby conceived through this method was born in 1978 and as many as 130 others have followed at medical centers around the world. One major advantage of the ovum transfer technique over the ''testtube'' method is that the woman who is to carry the embryo to full term does not have to undergo surgery. In an earlier report in The Lancet, the Los Angeles group said, ''We see nonsurgical ovum donor transfer as an alternative to an in vitro fertilization when an infertile couple is willing to accept a donated ovum.'' The team of doctors added that the technique could be performed in a doctor's office and could be repeated until pregnancy had been achieved. Some specialists believe the method has one potential problem: A donor might remain pregnant if the flushing out of the uterus failed to remove a fertilized egg. They added that in such cases prospective donors would be informed of this possibility, which is considered remote, and offered the opportunity of abortion within days of the unsuccessful recovery of the embryo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POPULATION PRIZES FROM U.N. ASSAILED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/world/population-prizes-from-un-assailed.html,"Two $12,500 awards given by a United Nations population agency to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India and to China's family planning chief have been denounced as a travesty by a United States economist whom the agency enlisted as an adviser. The economist, Theodore W. Shultz of Chicago, said that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities had ignored the recommendations of private consultants and rewarded two nations that have used brutal methods to curb population growth. Mr. Shultz, a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, told the agency to remove his name from any material involving the prize. In a letter to Rafael M. Salas, the Fund's executive director, Mr. Shultz said the awards would damage family planning programs. ''The harm was done by awarding the prize to a public official in China where public policy is responsible for the appallingly high rate of female infanticide and a prize to the head of state of India despite her cruel mandated sterlization,'' Mr. Shultz wrote. Forced Sterilization During the emergency rule she imposed on India from 1975 to 1977, Mrs. Gandhi's Government was accused of forcing men in villages to undergo sterilization. China, whose family planning minister, Qian Xinzhong, received the other award, uses a system of punishment for couples who have two or more children. Women carrying a second child who refuse an abortion can lose 20 percent of their pay. Mr. Shultz, in a telephone interview, said this policy had caused ''a large increase in female infanticide.'' Mrs. Gandhi has said the charges against her were exaggerated, but they are among the reasons given for her defeat in elections in 1977. The Chinese Government has said female infanticide stems from a ''feudal mentality'' and that those who practice it would be punished. Mr. Schultz said he was one of five advisers chosen by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities to help a committee of diplomats who chose the winners of the prize. He appeared at a meeting in New York last March after studying the files of about 80 nominees, he said. The diplomats, he said, announced they would only consider heads of state or high officials for the prize, which is given for ''the most outstanding contribution to the awareness of population questions.'' ''None of the qualified nominees is a head of state or high public official,'' Mr. Shultz said in the interview. ''The decision of the committee was totally self-serving. As state-appointed members, they decided to court the favor of those to whom they are beholden regardless of the excellent qualifications of other nominees.'' U.N. Defends Awards Mr. Salas, the director of the United Nations Fund, defended the awards in a telephone conversation from Tokyo. He female infanticide is outlawed in China and its ''official policy is family planning.'' He said Mr. Schultz's charge that the harshness of this program encourages killing of female children ''is an inference.'' Mr. Salas acknowledged there ''were such accusations'' of forced sterilization in India under Mrs. Gandhi in the past, but added, ''There is no such complaint in India today.'' Mr. Salas said his committee had limited its consideration for this year's awards to ''public statesmen,'' but he denied the judges had engaged in selfpromotion. The chairman of the committee, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury of Bangladesh, declined to make any comment. The other diplomats who served as judges came from Australia, Mexico, Yugoslavia, Japan, Egypt, Burundi, Colombia, China and Tunisia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ANALYST AND HER ANALYSAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/books/the-analyst-and-her-analysand.html,"AUGUST By Judith Rossner. 376 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. $15.95. LIKE Parisians, shrinks leave town in August. If they're New York shrinks, they flock to the Hamptons, where for one brief month no patients interrupt their lives. The patients, meanwhile, must fend for themselves. Along with the shorter breaks at Christmas and Easter, the recurrence of the August hiatus lends a rhythm to both sides of the psychoanalytic relationship. Enduring it or delighting in it, patient and analyst must somehow come to terms with August - the ritualized intrusion of time into the timeless world of the analytic session. Judith Rossner's new novel takes its title and form from this fact of psychoanalytic sociology. Famous as a clinician of disordered minds - most memorably in ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' and ''Emmeline'' - Mrs. Rossner now turns her attention to the scene where disorders are supposed to get rectified. In meticulous detail, she narrates the five-year analysis of Dawn Henley by Dr. Lulu Shinefeld, the one a blond New England teen-ager, the other a fortyish Jewish Manhattanite. In the ordinary course of things, two such different women would never meet, but there's nothing ordinary about analysis, and as the two women grow and change, they make permanent marks on each other's lives.Walter Kendrick, who teaches English at Fordham University, is the author of ''The Novel Machine.'' At the start of analysis with Lulu in July 1975, Dawn is a mess. Fresh from a near-fatal car accident, an abortion and four wasted years with a male analyst whom she still thinks a god, she cries uncontrollably, falls asleep without warning and vomits on Lulu's kilim rug. Her background is enough to give Freud (or Krafft-Ebing) pause: Orphaned by 2, she was raised by Vera (her father's sister) and Tony, a lesbian couple whom she learned to call ''Daddy'' and ''Mommy'' respectively. In school they tried to teach her that daddy went to work while mommy stayed home; little Dawn insisted that in her household the reverse was true. The uproar that followed gave her no chance to explain that both her ''parents'' were women. Now Vera and Tony are ''divorced.'' As an apparently direct result, Dawn embarked on a series of suicidal disasters that brings her to Dr. Shinefeld. Lulu, however, isn't in much better shape. Recently divorced from her second husband (a psychoanalyst who had an affair with a 15-year-old he met in a deli), she has two prepubescent boys to take care of. Then there's Sascha, her 22-yearold daughter by her first husband (he abandoned Lulu while she was pregnant), who ran away from home and hasn't been heard from in four years. And Lulu's mother, dead from an overdose of sleeping pills. And her father, a confirmed alcoholic. Little wonder that, at her first August party, Lulu gets drunk and goes home with the handsome young bartender. ''AUGUST'' makes a promising start from these jumbled materials and follows through scrupulously. Dawn, whose dependence upon Lulu is at first so great that she becomes deeply depressed at the mere thought of August, gradually comes under her own control and begins to investigate her ''birth parents,'' whom she never knew. Dawn's father, like his sister Vera, was homosexual; Dawn meets his last lover, a Harvard professor still alive and flourishing in Provincetown. Dawn's mother never wanted a child; it was the trauma of giving birth to Dawn that killed her. In her sessions with Lulu, Dawn learns to accommodate not only these new facts but also the old images and fears that have driven her to crazy behavior. She discovers why a line from Dylan Thomas makes her panic, and why sepia is the color of death. In chapters that alternate with accounts of Dawn's therapy sessions, Lulu endures a roller-coasterish affair with another analyst, Charles Herman, and eventually gets reconciled (sort of) with the long-absent Sascha. Her self-accommodation is less drastic than Dawn's, less clear-cut, but their difference in age may account for that. When the novel and her analysis end, Dawn is 23 and setting out on marriage and a new life in Washington. Lulu is 44 and still learning how to live well. It's clear that, for Dawn, the hundreds of hours with Lulu have made it possible for her life to continue; without them, she'd have killed herself long since. It's less clear that Lulu's life wouldn't have taken exactly the same course whether Dawn had entered it or not. Five years may be responsible in both cases: Analysis gives them to the patient, but the doctor would have had them anyway. ''August'' reeks of real life, at least as it's lived by certain people in a certain time and place. Though the writing is sparse almost to deprivation, it conveys a genuine feeling of East Hampton in August, the Upper West Side all year round and the manners and mores of those who shuttle between them. Most of the novel is dialogue, for which Mrs. Rossner can't be faulted. The give-and-take of real conversation, its hesitations, repetitions and Freudian slips - all are reproduced with exact fidelity. And, except for the slightly lurid features of Dawn's background, none of the characters' deeds deviates even slightly from the expected behavior of well-to-do urban people in the late 1970's. THE reader is warned in an Author's Note that ''It would be useful to remember that the psychoanalysis that takes place within this novel bears approximately the resemblance to a real analysis that the novel bears to life.'' That resemblance has a Pre-Raphaelite quality: Primary attention is given to exacting detail and the composition of the whole is of less significance. Though there are condensations and summaries, Dawn's analysis is portrayed at greater length, and with greater faithfulness, than I've ever seen in a novel before. Dawn brings a cassette recorder to her first couple of sessions as a means of intimidating Lulu and reassuring herself; she soon abandons it, but Mrs. Rossner seems to have picked it up. The depiction of Dawn's analysis - meandering monologues from her, an occasional ''Tell me'' or ''What do you mean?'' from Lulu - is so eerily authentic that it seems not to be fiction at all. Mrs. Rossner has conveyed the exact feel of analysis - its tensions and relaxations, its insights achieved or evaded and also, at times, its longueurs. ''August'' is absolutely true to its own design; it's a model of rigor and restraint, even when it must take risks. For example, we never see Dawn except in her sessions with Lulu; we see the characters who inhabit her life only as she describes them. They're interesting people -especially Vera and Tony - and one sometimes wishes that Dawn would shut up and let Mrs. Rossner tells us their stories. It's a sort of compliment to Mrs. Rossner's skill that she arouses such interest in characters who are never directly portrayed, yet I occasionally felt frustrated. Dawn's journey of self-discovery has considerable suspense of its own, but no 20-year-old, no matter how neurotic, can consistently reward such intense, sustained attention. In Lulu's chapters, the risks and achievements are different. Here Mrs. Rossner takes the narrative into her own hands, providing terse but pointed commentary on Lulu's adventures. And Lulu is a remarkably well-drawn character. She has all the virtues and shortcomings that a woman of her background and station would have, and her five-year progress, as she passes the landmark age of 40, is portrayed with special delicacy. Again, however, the risks are those of restraint. Lulu's narrator clearly knows more than she does, but Lulu never gets the benefit of that wider knowledge. When she makes mistakes - like getting involved with Charles Herman, a self-serving jerk who doesn't deserve her - the reader wants to grab her shoulders and shake some sense into her. The effect is sometimes annoying, yet it's another compliment to Mrs. Rossner that she can make us just as impatient with Lulu as we might be if Lulu were real. Appreciation of the almost photographic realism of ''August'' depends to some degree on the reader's familiarity with the scenes and character types it describes. I suspect that readers who have been in analysis will respond much more powerfully to the book than those who have not; it also helps to know the Upper West Side and to have attended cookouts in the Hamptons. At times, the novel takes too much for granted. We never learn, for instance, exactly what sort of analyst Lulu is, where she belongs in the Byzantine hierarchy of her profession. She's not an M.D. but a clinical psychologist with a Ph.D, and she sneers at the orthodoxy of her second husband, ''for whom the Freudian prism had been a comfortable prison.'' Yet Dawn's analysis follows the ideal Freudian course, complete with dream interpretations, the heartbreak of penislessness and a remembered primal scene. Aficionados of analysis will no doubt be able to place Lulu, but I sometimes felt as if I were moving in a contextual vacuum. Both Lulu and Dawn have spent nearly half their lives engaged with analysis, yet the social, political and moral implications of this consuming devotion are left for the reader to draw. It may be that, having chosen a potentially sensational subject, Mrs. Rossner resolved to render it serious by treating it in the most austerely documentary manner she could devise. She has succeeded in that; indeed, the major complaint I have against ''August'' is that it's too austere, not sensational enough. In the world of today's novels, however, that complaint turns into another compliment. IN the last few years, psychoanalysis has again become a hot topic, for both novelists and journalists. Now, though, the excitement no longer comes from the discovery that dreams have meaning or that therapy can yield insights. Psychoanalysis has been solidly established in this country for two generations; now the excitement comes from recognizing its far-reaching effects on our lives and questioning the directions in which it has led us. ''August'' is testimony to this new interest and a valuable contribution to it. I know of no other account, imagined or factual, that gives such a vivid picture of the analytic experience, on both sides of its intense, troubled, ambiguous relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR DANES, 'PAPERLESS MARRIAGES' AND FEWER BIRTHS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/25/style/for-danes-paperless-marriages-and-fewer-births.html,"Nete Wingender and Vilhelm Niemann are almost, but not quite, the archetypical young Danish couple. They are: Blond. Unmarried. The parents of a 3-month-old child. They are not strictly typical, of course, because most Danish couples are not blond. But their approach to family life has become as Danish as apple Danish. Arrangements outside marriage now represent the standard household unit for young college-educated couples like Miss Wingender and Mr. Niemann. Births from these relationships account for more than one out of every three births in Denmark today, a figure three times the rate in France, which has the second-highest level of illegitimacy in the European Economic Community. ''Hardly anyone we know is married,'' says Mr. Niemann, 31 years old. ''Everyone has entered what we call a 'paperless marriage.' '' ''If one of our friends suddenly announced they were going to have a wedding ceremony it would be a sensation,'' asserts Miss Wingender, who had been married previously and divorced before she and Mr. Niemann began living together in 1978. While it has become commonplace in Europe and the United States for young couples to live together, the liaison usually becomes legalized before the birth of a child. But here one out of three ''paperless marriages'' continues with or without children for longer than five years, while the rest of the couples are more likely to end the relationship and start a new one than to marry. While a majority of working-class Danes continue to follow the traditional path to wedlock, the divorce rate has doubled in recent years, and the former partners are more likely to enter into a form of cohabitation than to remarry immediately, according to Government research. Cohabitation has no legal status in Denmark and carries no legal consequences no matter how long it may last. Custody of offspring, however, can become an issue for the courts. More troubling than illegitimacy to Danish demographers and economists is a decline in all births that has contributed to a minus 0.6 net population growth rate and has put Denmark in the forefront among rapidly aging populations. This negative growth rate is exceeded in the European Economic Community only by West Germany with a -1.6 rate. Because of contraception, abortion and recession, the number of babies born in Europe in 1981 was two-thirds the number born in 1964, and the continent's population is expected to grow by less than 3 percent by the end of the century, compared with 13 percent for the United States and an explosive 37 percent for the world. Most of the growth is expected in southern Europe and Ireland, where the population is expected to rise by 20 percent over the next 16 years while the countries of northern Europe show low or negative growth. Denmark's net population loss of 2,000 a year that began in 1981 should increase, according to projections, to an annual net loss of 16,000 after the turn of the century, a significant drain in a small country of slightly more than five million. Moreover, this trend is coupled with a steady rise in life expectancy that foreshadows a time not so far away when ever-decreasing numbers in the work force will be asked to support ever-increasing numbers of elderly pensioners. Denmark may be one of the first industrialized nations forced to work out a social and economic solution to that equation before it is addressed by other Western nations, including the United States. For the moment, Government planners are waiting to see if a slight upturn in marriages in the past year or two heralds a higher birth rate. Extensive Social Changes Scandinavia experienced the greatest expansion of social services combined with economic prosperity in all the West during the postwar decades, and with this improved standard of living came educational advances and extensive social changes characterized, particularly in Denmark and Sweden, by a great influx of women into the work force. At the end of the European baby boom in the early 1960's about 50 percent of married women in Denmark were working. The share is now 80 percent. Denmark leads the Common Market countries not only in the number of women working and in illegitimate births, but also in abortion and divorce rates. ''Women in the work force who were economically independent changed all perceptions and expectations of Danish society,'' said Erik Manniche of the University of Copenhagen's Institute of Sociology. ''There was an emphasis placed on personal development rather than child raising,'' he explained. ''Even in a recession with more than 10 percent unemployment in Denmark, the material side of life in Denmark has never been higher. It is the opportunity of a lifetime to be young and unemployed.'' Miss Wingender and Mr. Niemann would prefer being employed, although neither has held a job since leaving the university. Both were trained as teachers, and in Denmark, with a negative growth rate, teaching jobs are vanishing almost as fast as the traditional Danish family. ''Our situation shows the Danish social-security system works quite efficiently,'' said Mr. Niemann as he and Miss Wingender sunned themselves in the tranquillity of Orsteds Park in the center of Copenhagen the other day, taking turns rocking their infant son in his carriage. They receive the equivalent of $240 a week from the Government, and they say they are fortunate to have a spacious apartment despite a fierce shortage of good housing in Copenhagen. Their dream at the moment is for one of them to secure a teaching job elsewhere in Denmark because they say that Copenhagen, with its traffic and noise, is not an ideal place to raise their son. ''We want to live near the sea and the woods,'' said Miss Wingender, rocking the baby carriage. ''But it is only a dream.'' ''Many of our friends are like us,'' said Mr. Niemann, drawing on his pipe. ''No job, one child and a lot of dreams.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIGHTING CENSORSHIP,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/25/opinion/fighting-censorship.html,"The Reagan Administration's recent decision to withdraw financial support from a publication that was said to express ideas contrary to Administration policy is rightfully being challenged. When a government body, be it a school board or a national administration, tries to censor ideas with which it does not agree, constitutional principles - and democratic government - are jeopardized. For several years, the Agency for International Development subsidized International Family Planning Perspectives, a magazine published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. That subsidy was stopped because the magazine was said to advocate abortion in two articles, one about illegal abortion in Bangladesh, the other about Tunisia that mentioned abortion only in passing. The agency acted under instructions from the Administration to curtail Government spending on publications and from David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to consider whether the publication ''reflects Administration goals and priorities.'' The head of the agency, M. Peter McPherson, received letters from Senator Jesse Helms of North Caro-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TRIAL OF PARENTS IN DEATH OF SON GETS SUMMARIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/nyregion/trial-of-parents-in-death-of-son-gets-summaries.html,"Summations were presented today in the trial of an Irvington couple charged with the beating death of their 3-yearold son. The case, in which the couple's 5-year-old son testified that the parents had beaten his brother, is expected to go to the jury Thursday. The prosecution has said it will seek the death penalty for Allen Bass, 21, and Renee Nicely, 20, if they are convicted of the murder of Shawn Nicely last Sept. 26. In his summation in Essex County Superior Court, the prosecutor, Lawrence L. Monaco, charged that the couple had wantonly murdered the boy. The lawyer for the mother, William Graves, said she had unintentionally killed the boy during a psychotic rage. The lawyer for the father, David Glazer, argued his client was not involved and had slept through the beating. During his testimony in the three-week-old trial, which was shown to the jury on videotape, the 5-year-old boy, Davelle Nicely, testified that his father ''had stomped'' on his brother's back and that his mother ''had hit him too.'' 'He Said What He Saw' Mr. Monaco, assistant Essex County prosecutor, said the boy had lied to investigators during the early phases of the case to protect his mother by laying all the blame on his father. He said, however, that the boy told the truth when he was questioned in chambers by Judge Edwin Stern. ''Davelle wasn't making anything up,'' Mr. Monaco told the jury. ''He said what he saw. He saw Allen Bass and Renee Nicely commit murder.'' As he held up color photographs of the victim's bruised body, Mr. Monaco said Davelle had testified that Mr. Bass had punched Shawn in the eye and had stepped on his back. Earlier, Mr. Graves told the jury Mrs. Nicely did not mean to murder her son, but that she killed the boy in a rage that was triggered by an abortion she had undergone the previous morning. Mr. Glazer contended that Mr. Bass, who is the father of Miss Nicely's five children, had not participated in the killing and charged that the prosecutor's office had concealed information showing that the father had a good relationship with his children. Shawn was pronounced dead on arrival at Beth Israel Hospital here, after he was rushed from his home in Irvington. His parents had told the police the boy had fallen in the bathtub, but an autopsy revealed he had died from blows to the head and a lacerated liver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PARENTS GUILTY IN BOY'S DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/nyregion/parents-guilty-in-boy-s-death.html,"A 20-year-old mother of five children was found guilty of murder today in the beating death of her 3-year-old son. The child's father was convicted of aggravated manslaughter. The woman, Renee Nicely, who had her first child at the age of 14, faces the death penalty, and Allen G. Bass, the 21-year-old father of her children, could get up to 20 years in prison. Their son, Shawn Nicely, was beaten to death in the couple's Irvington apartment last Sept. 26. Judge Edwin Stern set Sept. 15 for the sentencing of Mr. Bass. He will decide next week when to schedule the trial for the penalty phase of Miss Nicely's case. The jury that convicted her will decide whether to impose the death penalty. As the jury of 10 women and 2 men was polled, Miss Nicely burst into tears and buried her face in her hands. After the jury had left the Essex County Courthouse, Miss Nicely resisted officers' attempts to return her to jail. ''I'm not going back in there,'' she said. ''What good is it going to do to kill me? I want to go home. Nobody can bring him back but God, and now they want to take my life. I'll never see the rest of my kids.'' During the four-week trial, the couple's 5-year-old son, Davelle, testified on videotape that his parents had beaten his brother and that his father ''had stomped on his back.'' Other witnesses testified that Miss Nicely had often punched and kicked Shawn. Psychiatrists, testifying for the defense, said the woman had suffered a ''psychotic episode,'' triggered by an abortion the day before the death of the boy. The jury, which deliberated eight hours over two days, also found both parents guilty of endangering the welfare of the child and Miss Nicely guilty of attempting to cause him serious bodily injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Wichita Life Groups Get Ban on Burning Fetuses,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/03/us/around-the-nation-wichita-life-groups-get-ban-on-burning-fetuses.html,"Wichita officials have banned the practice of disposing of human fetuses at a city- owned incinerator. They acted in response to complaints from anti-abortion activists who said animal remains were also burned there. The protesters, armed with color photographs of the fetuses, started a furor among politicians, public health officials and hospitals on disposing of human tissue. ''My first reaction was, that's appalling,'' Mayor Margalee Wright said on learning that a city incinerator has been used for at least 15 years to dispose of fetuses. ''I know there needs to be a more dignified way to dispose of fetal tissue.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOUSE DEMOCRATS SHUNNING A VETO BATTLE WITH REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/03/us/house-democrats-shunning-a-veto-battle-with-reagan.html,"Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives said today that they were trying to scale down spending bills to avoid a veto battle with President Reagan. According to the leaders, the White House is also showing a smaller appetite for a confrontation with Congress than earlier in the year. As a result the President, who vowed to cast a stream of vetoes against spending bills he considered excessive, has yet to reject an appropriation bill passed in the current session of Congress. Asked today if the Democratic leadership was consciously staying within spending limits set by the White House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the House Speaker, told reporters: ''The answer is yes. There's no sense in sending things over there and having them vetoed.'' To lawmakers in both parties, Congressional Democrats are moderating their position out of concern that they will be labeled ''big spenders'' by Mr. Reagan. And the President, in turn, is moving toward the center because he wants to rebut the Democratic charge that he is unfair to the poor. 'Movement on Both Sides' Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Democratic whip, summed up the situation today by saying, ''There is a kind of movement on both sides to avoid unnecessary confrontations.'' (Tonight, the House voted 381 to 35 to approve a three-year revenue-sharing bill that would return $5.02 billion a year to local governments, down from $5.3 billion that was in the original House plan, The Associated Press reported. The final figure is still $450 million a year more than was sought by Mr. Reagan, The measure now goes to the Senate, where the Finance Committee a month ago endorsed an extension that followed the President's recommendation.) Earlier today, the sense of accommodation was demonstrated when the House adopted a conference report appropriating $10.9 billion for the Department of Transportation. The final compromise was $368 million below the bill first passed by the House in June, but House negotiators agreed to the lower figure to satisfy the Reagan Administration and Senate Republicans. Representative William R. Ratchford of Connecticut, one of the Democratic conferees, noted that while the overall spending level in the transportation bill squared with Administration demands, the priorities established by Congress within the bill differed substantially from White House priorities. In particular, Congress allocated more money for mass transit, and less for airports, than Mr. Reagan requested. ''I thought it was important to get the bill signed,'' Mr. Ratchford said, ''and I was satisfied with the priorities we were able to set.'' Veto Threat Looms Large In addition, the Appropriations Committee today discussed, but did not vote on, a spending bill covering the Treasury Department and Postal Service that has already been defeated once by the House. The main reason for the defeat was a provision banning the use of Federal health insurance for abortions, but the bill also drew the fire of conservatives, who said it was too large. The treasury and postal legislation has been trimmed back by $160 million since its defeat, and one committee aide said, ''I think the threat of a veto looms very large.'' If Congress and the President do engage in a veto struggle, the most likely issue will be spending for education. Democrats feel strongly that Federal aid to education should be increased, and they believe Mr. Reagan has placed himself in a difficult position to veto a bill by stressing the education issue in recent weeks. ''If a veto comes, let it come,'' said Mr. Ratchford, a member of the Appropriations Committee. ''Then we'll see if the Administration is interested in rhetoric, or in doing something for education.'' Threat of Political Damage Probably the main reason for the Democrats' sense of caution is their belief that a veto battle could be politically damaging. One senior Democrat noted that, according to polls taken for the party, the ''big spender'' label was still the ''major negative'' for Democrats among voters. Earlier in the year, lawmakers in both parties were convinced that Mr. Reagan was intent on vetoing legislation to enhance his own image as a foe of a free-spending Congress. But now they sense that he wants to fashion a more positive image for himself, as a leader who advocates positive steps in such areas as education, civil rights and more equity for women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KENNEDY CONCENTRATES ON THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/05/us/kennedy-concentrates-on-the-senate.html,"The invitations still arrive, one after the other, day after day, from automobile workers and public employee unions, nuclear freeze organizations and health care groups. In recent weeks, state Democratic parties in Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Florida have sought him for the head table. But eight months into his self-imposed exile from Democratic Presidential politics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy is turning down almost all speaking invitations. ''I've spoken at enough conventions and midterm conventions over the years,'' the Massachusetts legislator said. ''To show up at these things,'' said Robert M. Shrum, one of the Senator's closest aides, ''would create the kind of impression that we don't want to create.'' Senator Kennedy, who for a dozen years was in the national political spotlight, if not in front of a pack of other potential Democratic Presidential nominees, is now somewhat reserved, even a bit contemplative. Having been rejected by his party in his struggle to wrest the nomination from President Carter in 1980, having announced his refusal to seek or accept the nomination in 1984, he is embarked on a new phase in his career. Focusing on Washington Though he has appeared three times in recent months with the declared Presidential challengers, he has repeatedly told his aides, his colleagues and his supporters that, at least for the moment, the Senate will be his arena. He seems to be trying to establish his political center of gravity in Washington rather than in state and local Democratic groups scattered around the country. ''He's always had more influence outside the chamber than inside the chamber,'' a Senate colleague from New England said privately. ''I think he's trying to change that.'' This summer, as the six declared Democratic candidates prepared to fly to state fairs and union conventions and to struggle with the constraints of their campaign budgets, Mr. Kennedy's political energies were concentrated on his Fund for a Democratic Majority, an effort to raise money to help the Democrats regain control of the Senate. His staff, moreover, was drafting plans to have him visit an aircraft carrier, a cruiser and a destroyer and to study some of the arcane details of the military budget. He now sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, having concluded that military issues are going to be of increasing importance on Capitol Hill, and he is one of the leaders of the nuclear freeze movement and the effort to halt deployment of the MX missile. Yet, for all his new concentration on events in Washington, Mr. Kennedy, who is 51 years old, remains the national symbol, if not the spokesman, of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Some surveys show him more popular with the rank and file than Senator John Glenn or former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. Unanswered Questions But there also remains that large residue of voters who regard him warily, some because of his strong identity with liberalism, others because he is involved in divorce proceedings and has left hanging a number of unanswered questions about his private life. And he is still a very irritating burr under the Republican saddle. ''Even if he is not a Presidential candidate,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who has quarreled bitterly with Mr. Kennedy over such issues as abortion and school prayer, ''Ted Kennedy is the quintessential liberal in this country.'' When the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a mass mailing last month, for example, it based its fund-raising entreaty on the specter that, if the Republicans lost their majority, ''Ted Kennedy could control the Senate in 1984.'' It is still an alluring pitch. ''Kennedy is the one Democrat clearly identifiable to Republicans,'' said Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the committee. ''The other Democrats have tried to mellow themselves or disappear, but he has not. He remains a symbol of why Republicans are Republicans.'' 'The Pressure's Off Him' Mr. Kennedy's friends say his new career approach has left him less intense and more at ease, both with his work in the Senate and with himself. ''The pressure's off him,'' said Senator Paul E. Tsongas, his Democratic colleague from Massachusetts. ''It's the same sort of ease you find around here from people who aren't going to run for re-election.'' The days now are filled with quiet briefings, beginning at his Virginia home and continuing on his ride to the Capitol, and the evenings often are occupied with meetings - a few cocktails with some guests, perhaps, but serious talk, over dinner and later in the living room, with scholars and Government experts about such topics as military preparedness, reorganizing the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military balance in Central America. The sessions go on late into the night. ''Right now it's not for him to make much of a fuss,'' said one aide. He wants to learn about these things before he goes off and declares himself an expert. He's taking his time. He hasn't done anything special, and that's all for the good.'' There was considerable skepticism in the warren of offices of the Senate Armed Services Committee when Mr. Kennedy won his assignment there. The Senator is regarded as something of a grandstander, even by some of his aides, and is hardly a natural partner to the committee chairman, Senator John Tower, a Texas Republican known for his quiet but strong support of the military. Nor has he yet acquired the stature of some of the young Democrats on the committee, who are regarded as serious students of military matters. Won Praise for Diligence ''Kennedy's style is to get ahold of a couple of issues,'' said one of his aides. ''We've told him he can do that in a year or two.'' Thus far Mr. Kennedy's contributions have been modest, but he has won high marks for his diligence, even from some of his detractors. ''He's used to grabbing a lot of press and not paying much attention, but we're surprised,'' said one member of the committee staff. ''He's very active. He's there all the time. His staff is working.'' Senator Kennedy is repeatedly asked how he views his new career approach, and his answer is almost always the same. ''I am comfortable with my decision,'' he said. ''I've never really second-guessed it.'' ''People measure me against my brothers' performance,'' he continued in a rare personal reflection. ''It's always been with me. But I like to believe that during the time I've been in the Senate that I've made some contribution. I take some satisfaction in that. My brothers were very much their own people. I like to think that I'm my own man, particularly now, in this time in my life.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STAGE: ESTELLE PARSONS IN 'ORGASMO ADULTO',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/05/theater/stage-estelle-parsons-in-orgasmo-adulto.html,"DON'T tell Estelle Parsons that biting political satire is all but extinct in the American theater. With heroic persistence, she is determined to contradict that fact. In ''Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From the Zoo,'' the actress spends almost five hours (divided over two nights) performing a cycle of largely satirical one-woman plays by the highly regarded, leftist Italian husband-and-wife team of Dario Fo and Franca Rame. It's hard to imagine a more noble mission. It's harder still to say that it pays off. Miss Parsons works with enormous dedication and energy. The plays are uncompromising in their convictions. And yet we sit at the Public's Newman Theater with the sinking sensation that ''Orgasmo Adulto'' isn't provoking the laughter, thought or outrage it intends. Miss Parsons does four monodramas a night, alternating a Program A and Program B. (On Tuesdays only, she performs a selection from A and B, Chinese-restaurant style.) The concerns of all eight pieces are similar. As the actress explains in a chatty, relaxed prologue, ''Orgasmo Adulto'' is ''an entertainment about the condition of women'' - or, more specifically, about how ''we're all prisoners of the male organ.'' The characters are usually oppressed wives and mothers who strike back as best they can at the male ''devil'' and the ''tail'' that this devil wears ''in front.'' This is reasonable subject matter, but the Fo-Rame approach to it here seems limited and tired. Most of the plays, first performed by Miss Rame in Milan in 1977, express a dogmatic, Freudian determinism reminiscent of Lina Wertmuller films like ''Swept Away'' and ''Seven Beauties'': The imagery of castration and excrement predominate as we continually witness the wages of male sexual aggression. Worse, Mr. Fo and Miss Rame don't cloak this theme in the scabrous black humor that might rehabilitate it. The mode is more often conventional (and obvious) farce, typified by a gag in which a woman slams a door on her lover's most vulnerable appendage. The other ideological aspects of ''Orgasmo Adulto'' are also primitively stated. Unlike Caryl Churchill, who finds novel ways to dramatize her connections between capitalism and male supremacy, Mr. Fo and Miss Rame give us a radicalized, overlong slice of ''I Love Lucy'' slapstick in which a wife who has ''everything'' in the way of housekeeping appliances is literally a prisoner in her own home. In another, similar sketch that might be a reject from Chaplin's ''Modern Times,'' a woman wakes up with nightmares about her factory job, frantically prepares for the day's drudgery and then - in a meager punchline - discovers that it is Sunday. The other big joke of this exercise - the harried wife keeps mixing up such household products as baby powder and grated cheese - is provided in three labored variations. As was the case with the other Fo play thus far seen in New York, ''We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!,'' it's possible that something has been lost in the English adaptation (Miss Parsons's own) or in the staging (attributed to the actress and Miss Rame). Maybe, too, the distance separating Italy's socio-sexual landscape from ours is just too vast. Miss Parsons tries to bridge that gap with asides - she equates Eurocommunists with her ''liberal friends on Central Park West'' - but too often American audiences may find themselves listening to unsophisticated lectures that don't travel well. Such matters as a woman's right to abortion or to a liberated role in lovemaking are melodramatically argued as if they were taboo topics never broached in a theater before. In a similar manner, simulated sex and scatological language are italicized constantly, apparently on the rather sexist assumption that men will be startled to see a woman engage in such ostensibly male prerogatives. Although Miss Parsons is an accomplished comedienne, she doesn't often overcome the hectoring and at times maudlin tone of the writing. (Almost every character threatens suicide.) The material's repetitiveness can emerge as a deadening whininess; the attempts to tap into the plays' indigenous, folkloric Italian roots are intermittent. Yet Miss Parsons never stops trying to stretch herself. There aren't many actors who would bravely plunge right into the final events of ''Medea,'' as is demanded by the reductivist, 15-minute version of the Euripides tragedy that concludes Program A. In general, Miss Parsons's outstanding turns occur in the few noncomic pieces - notably the pair that ends Program B. Both of them are moral fables about women who have belatedly raised their consciousnesses. As ''The Freak Mamma,'' a wife who has left her husband and son to become a sort of politicized bag lady, she's a pugnacious, self-invented crusader - a populist champion of justice riding a wave of rage that won't quit. In ''Monologue of a Whore in a Lunatic Asylum,'' the actress is a sweaty, quivering blur of runny lipstick and frizzy red curls, strapped in a chair to face an unseen interrogator. The metamorphosis is complete and moving in spite of such rhetorical lines as ''I'm not a whore because I want to be.'' Even when Miss Parsons falls short, her commitment both to her craft and to social change are unmistakable. Though ''Orgasmo Adulto'' mainly arouses feelings of indifference, it is informed, paradoxically, by an artistic impulse that is both passionate and rare.

"RUSSIA'S OTHER HALF; By SUSAN JACOBY; Susan Jacoby is the author of ""Inside Soviet Schools.'' Her ''Wild Justice: The Evolution of Revenge'' will be published this fall.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/books/russia-s-other-half-susan-jacoby-susan-jacoby-author-inside-soviet-schools-her.html,"MOSCOW WOMEN Thirteen Interviews. By Carola Hansson and Karin Liden. Translated by Gerry Bothmer, George Blecher and Lone Blecher. Introduction by Gail Warshofsky Lapidus. Illustrated. 194 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. Cloth, $16.95. Paper, $7.95. IN 1969 the November issue of the well-known Soviet magazine Novy Mir was held up by official censors while they decided what to do about a novel that was already set in type. Problems with the censors were nothing new for the magazine, which had published Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' in 1962 and whose editor, the late Aleksandr Tvardovsky, continued to fight cultural restrictions as the political climate grew more repressive in the late 60's. The only thing new was that the disputed piece of writing in 1969 did not deal with Stalinism or other wounds from the past but with everyday Russian domestic life - specifically, the difficulties of being a working mother in a society with no reliable contraceptives, almost no help from husbands with child care and housework and absolutely no official acknowledgement of the gap between the ideological lip service paid to sexual equality and the overburdened realities of women's lives. When ''A Week Like Any Other'' by Natalya Baranskaya finally appeared with major cuts by the censors, the issue of Novy Mir sold out immediately. ''Moscow Women,'' a collection of 13 interviews conducted in Moscow by two Russian-speaking writers for the Swedish broadcasting system, does not pick up where that provocative novel left off. Most of the women interviewed are too young to have read ''A Week Like Any Other'' when it was published, and that issue of Novy Mir has been removed from the shelves of most Soviet libraries. Moreover, these interviews make it abundantly clear that the absence of any coherent, sustained dialogue on women's issues is one of the major differences between sexual politics in the Soviet Union and in the West. In fact, most Russians - whether politically dissident or orthodox - would be baffled by the term ''sexual politics.'' The Soviet political system is, of course, one of the main factors inhibiting a serious evaluation of the role of women; Communist Party leaders are no more favorably disposed toward a women's movement than they are toward any unofficial movement. However, traditional Russian attitudes toward femininity - attitudes that are, as Carola Hansson and Karin Liden note, shared by both women and men - are equally important. Most Russians and all of the women interviewed here subscribe to the notion of intrinsically different masculine and feminine natures, with the range of feminine possibility defined in Tolstoyan terms. Sweet Kitty, dutiful Natasha and doomed Anna are the feminine prototypes; there has never been a Nora in the mainstream of Russian literature. Masha, a 23-year- old mother and engineer, defines femininity as ''delicacy, a little mystery, an ability to bring out the attractive qualities within oneself and to hide the bad ones. A woman mustn't lose her temper. And of course she has to take care of her appearance. . . . As a mother, a woman . . . ought to put her child before herself.'' These interviews suggest that Russian women face two distinct dilemmas. One is the familiar problem of combining child rearing with a job - a problem exacerbated by a dearth of consumer products and services, ranging from dry cleaners to baby-sitting agencies. The other is that Russian women do not have access to effective contraceptives. Abortion, performed without anesthetic in a manner many Russian women see as punishment for sexual sins, is the main means of birth control. Birth control pills are rarely available, and when they are, many Russian women won't use them because they believe abortions are safer. Diaphragms come in only two sizes and are therefore regarded as totally unreliable. The lack of information about contraception is revealed in an interview with Sonya, a 23- year-old housewife who has clearly confused birth control pills with thalidomide: ''No, I never wanted to use the pill. It contains hormones, and I think it must be harmful. I read that a pharmaceutical firm in West Germany . . . sold pills that caused dreadful birth defects, and a lot of disfigured babies were the result, without arms and legs. I would never even consider taking the pill.'' Much of the information presented in these interviews has already appeared in news reports from Moscow, but the voices of individual women revealing their fear and fatalism about their destinies are new. Most foreign correspondents in Russia are men, and few Russian women would be willing to discuss their intimate lives with any man, let alone a foreigner. When male correspondents write about women in the Soviet Union, their information is likely to have come from their wives' conversations with Russian women. ''Moscow Women'' should have been titled ''Young Moscow Women,'' because nine of the 13 interviews are with women in their early 20's. Their views on sex and childbearing are similar to those expressed by many women of different ages whom I knew in Moscow, but their grasp of other subjects - literature, economics, history - seems woefully limited by their age. This deficiency may be as much a fault of the interviewers, who seem to have limited themselves to conventional women's issues, as it is of the Russian women themselves. It is ironic that these liberated Western women did not find it worthwhile to ask the Russian women what they thought about their country. Nevertheless, the Russian voices in ''Moscow Women'' make a useful contribution to Western knowledge of an understudied aspect of Soviet life,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV VIEW; ON BALANCING FILMMAKING AND NEWS JOURNALISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/arts/tv-view-on-balancing-filmmaking-and-news-journalism.html,"The documentary is a news form; the documentary is an art form, too. It is also a creature of television. The networks, however, honor documentaries more by applauding them in the abstract than by allowing talented people in their news departments to go out and make them. It is public television that is now, and has been for some time, the documentary's home. No one is keeping an accurate count, but a fair estimate is that public television presents some 100 documentaries each season, which is rather more than the networks combined. This season, beginning in January, public television gave us the weekly series ''Frontline,'' 26 one-hour documentaries that purported to examine the great issues of our time. In fact, they didn't always examine great issues, and sometimes they didn't examine anything at all. When ''Frontline'' was good, it was very good, and when it was bad, it was terrible. When it was good, it married news and art; when it was bad, it forgot about news and indulged itself in art. Filmmaking took precedence over journalism. Old verities about how you tell a news story were forgotten. The narrative was all, and it imposed its own rules. For example, in its opening program of the season, ''The Unauthorized History of the NFL,'' ''Frontline'' alleged connections between big-time gamblers and professional football. It also suggested that Carroll Rosenbloom, the owner of the Los Angeles Rams, had been murdered. The program was widely criticized as shoddy journalism, although scarcely anyone said it was boring. As a film, it was exciting. It was particularly exciting when one gambler said he had fixed a number of games in the late 60's, although he did not mention which games he had fixed. Later, it was disclosed that ''Frontline'' had paid him and two other gamblers for their appearances. (''I was suprised we had to pay so little,'' the producer of the segment was quoted as saying.) In effect, ''Frontline'' was hiring performers. This critic's own nomination for the least sound ''Frontline'' of the season was ''God's Banker,'' which investigated the death of Roberto Calvi, the president of Italy's largest private bank. In one sequence, an author in Milan said that an Italian magistrate, one day before he was murdered, had told him about an unwholesome pay-off involving Mr. Calvi and the Archbishop who was the head of the Vatican bank. The author in Milan said the magistrate had told him that the source of his information was Michele Sindona, the Italian financier. Again, this was exciting stuff: a dead magistrate and a scandalous connection between Mr. Calvi (''Frontline'' suggested that he had been murdered, too) and the Vatican. Minutes later, however, Mr. Sindona was interviewed in prison. He spoke freely about this and that, but he was never asked about what he supposedly had said to the murdered magistrate. One assumes he was not asked because if he denied that he had said something, the denial would have got in the way of the film. ''God's Banker'' was full of reporting like that. ''God's Banker'' originally appeared on the BBC, making a persuasive case that British exports to public television ought to be restricted to ''Masterpiece Theater.'' ''Klaus Barbie: The American Connection,'' another BBC-''Frontline'' production, strengthened the case. It indicted former American intelligence agents for buying information from, and even protecting, a Gestapo murderer. Granted that the Klaus Barbie case is particularly repugnant. The show never produced evidence that the agents it indicted knew about the atrocities Klaus Barbie had committed. In fact, it inadvertently produced evidence to the contrary, which it then ignored. What mattered most to the filmmakers was their own high moral tone. They were infinitely more interested in expressing their point of view than in substantiating it. Something similar happened in ''The Money Lenders,'' a documentary about the international banking system. It said that in Brazil and Mexico the rich got richer by siphoning off money that ought to help the poor. To show this, there was footage of the rich disporting themselves while the poor suffered. Simultaneously, the documentary argued that the International Monetary Fund shouldn't put restrictions on how Brazil and Mexico borrowed money because if it did their economies would be crippled and the poor would suffer even more. Granted that the I. M. F. is a hard institution to love; it is still a contradiction to argue that the fund shouldn't curtail a system that benefits the rich because if it does it will hurt the poor. On the other hand, the argument is a morally satisfying one to make. The filmmakers get some nifty footage and still come down on the side of goodness - against the oligarchies, sympathetic to the poor. None of this is to suggest that ''Frontline'' did not produce some excellent journalism. It did - on the murder of five Communists by Ku Klux Klansmen in Greensboro, N. C., on the effect of cutbacks in the Federal budget on Social Security recipients, on the District of Columbia's government, on Pentagon spending and other things. And none of this is to suggest, either, that a sensibility shaped by filmmakers, not journalists, cannot lead to splendid documentaries. Indeed, '''Frontline's'' finest moments had nothing to do with conventional journalism at all. And they were, undeniably, the work of filmmakers. There was, for example, Carol Langer's ''Children of Pride,'' an extraordinarily moving documentary about a man and his 18 adopted children, most of them handicapped physically or emotionally or both. There was also Mark Obenhaus's ''Abortion Clinic,'' a stunning work that almost justified the whole season. It even had a point of view. This involved neither freedom of choice nor anti- abortion, even though both sides in the debate could find something in the documentary to seize on. The point of view was simply the solemnity of abortion, and in expressing it the filmmaker made a gripping, even painful film. Whether it was important journalism is beside the point; the point is it proved a filmmaker can practice his craft wonderfully well and still not betray journalism. ''Frontline,'' one hopes, will blend good journalism and provocative filmmaking more often next season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A NEW SITUATION IN ADOPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/08/style/a-new-situation-in-adoption.html,"With two young boys to bring up and jobs that barely covered the monthly bills, Dan and Brenda were much like any other married couple struggling to get by. But after Brenda became pregnant again this year, she and her husband made a painful and unusual decision: They plan to give their baby up for adoption. ''You ask yourself, do you love it enough to give it what it absolutely has to have,'' Brenda said, her voice quavering. A native of Ohio, she is 22 years old and 8 months pregnant. ''It's going to have plenty of love and it's going to have clothes and food and a place to live,'' she went on. ''We're having trouble providing that for the kids we have now.'' Dan and Brenda, like other parents interviewed, asked not to be identified. Adoption agencies and lawyers in various parts of the country report that a small number of married couples are giving their babies up for adoption. A few say the practice has been increasing in recent years at least partly because of hard economic times. They say the babies are generally the result of unplanned pregnancies and are carried to term by women who do not believe in abortion. 'Chance to Get on Our Feet' ''By giving the child up, it gives us a chance to get on our feet,'' explained Dan, who is 35. He has temporarily left his job as a siding salesman in the West to accompany his wife to Little Rock, Ark., where several months of their living and medical expenses are being paid by the couple who will adopt their baby, in an arrangement made through a lawyer. ''If we kept the baby it would be a matter of us trying to survive on welfare,'' he said. ''We couldn't give her or him what we want to.'' ''The people I met are super,'' he said of the adoptive couple. ''They've got their own home and everything. They can give the baby what I couldn't.'' Richard Dietz, director of the adoption program of the Arkansas Division of Social Services, said financial assistance from adoptive couples, which can amount to thousands of dollars, might act as an inducement to poor women to surrender their infants. His agency has sought a state law that would require all those arranging adoptions to be licensed. Arkansas, like New York, allows doctors and lawyers to arrange adoptions without the approval of a state agency, though court authorization is required to make the adoption legal. Criticism of the Process The whole process of advertising for babies and arranging adoptions independently is deplored by William Pierce, executive director of the National Committee for Adoption, an association of agencies. He calls it baby brokering. Discussing the role of married couples in adoptions, Stanley Michelman, a New York lawyer whom Dan and Brenda sought out, said, ''I've seen twice as many married couples this year as in the past.'' He estimated the number at 15 to 20. In Santa Monica, Calif., Karen Lane said that during the last two years of law practice she encountered fewer than 20 married couples among the 100 to 150 people relinquishing babies for adoption. ''In all cases except one they already have a young child they can barely take care of, and they don't want to take from one mouth and give to another,'' she said. While there is no central source that records statistics on who gives up children for adoption, officials of national associations say they have seen the number of married couples increasing for several years. Elizabeth Cole of the Child Welfare League of America, whose member agencies primarily serve whites, said she began noticing such couples coming in about five years ago. ''Many of them were not the typical disorganized, poor client who can't cope,'' she said. ''These people seemed put together. But if they'd kept the child, they would have had less money than they wanted. These people also didn't want to give that much emotionally to a child. It really is a fairly wise thing to do. They might have bruised the child emotionally if not physically.'' Mrs. Cole believes the state of the economy has played a role. ''The economy is frightening people,'' she said. ''They're uncertain about their futures.'' Jean Price, director of social services for the Children's Home Society of Florida, the state's largest private statewide adoption agency, has noticed some movement in the last two years toward the surrendering of newborns by married couples. Of the 400 children the society places each year, 10 to 20 infants now come from such couples. ''The economy is one factor,'' she said. ''I think there are other factors too. Maybe they've had all they can parent.'' Richard Pancost, executive director of the Children's Home Society of California, said he had noticed that a few more married couples in his state were giving children up for adoption. So did Nadine Harris Clark, director of adoption services for Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, who discerned marital problems arising from a lack of money as a reason. An official at the New York State Department of Social Services said no statistics on married couples and adoption were available for New York. Officials of private adoption agencies in New York City said they rarely encountered married couples who planned to have their babies adopted. Dan and Brenda lost an infant to crib death at Christmas a year ago and are afraid of enduring such a tragedy again. They take comfort, they say, from knowing that the child they are relinquishing will fulfill the dreams of a couple who have been unable to have children. But the choice is not easy to make or to live with, women who have been through it report. ''I cried a whole lot afterwards,'' said Jean, 25, who gave up a son in February. ''There was an empty space in my life.'' It was her second child by the man she has lived with for eight years. The couple who adopted her child are Jewish, Jean said, and with the help of her social worker she is drafting a letter to be given to him on the day of his bar mitzvah, ''when he becomes a man.'' She said: ''I want him to know he was conceived in love and to understand why I had to give him up. I was destitute.'' Cost Can Rise to $15,000 While she is glad that she was able to make another couple happy, she worried about explaining to an older son why she gave his little brother away. Jean answered an advertisement placed in an Arkansas newspaper by clients of Mr. Michelman. With money from the adoptive couple Mr. Michelman paid her rent for four months as well as all her medical bills and gave her $70 a week for food, utilities and miscellaneous expenses. With legal fees, the bill for the adoptive couple came to several thousand dollars. Mr. Michelman, who encourages couples seeking babies to advertise, said expenses could range up to $15,000. In criticizing such a practice, Mr. Pierce of the National Committee for Adoption, which consists of 121 adoption agencies, said that considering that there are at least a million infertile couples, and that only 50,000 infants were adopted last year, people can resort to desperate tactics. 'A Baby Is Not a Commodity' ''What's going on is baby brokering,'' he charged. ''A baby is not a commodity. The couples who place the ads aren't screened for the things we look at - their age, health, the stability of the marriage. The ad is the perfect way to insure that a vulnerable person is put in touch with a couple with money and a lawyer whose interest is not the baby but the client with money.'' One reason Arkansas officials wanted to exert more control is that they felt that biological mothers were not given enough counseling before relinquishing their infants, according to Mr. Dietz. He said there were cases where biological mothers had not thought about how they could keep their children and had not been told that they had 10 days after birth to withdraw their consent. In some instances legal action to get babies back from adoptive couples has been contemplated. Dan insists that he and his wife are going to surrender their baby. ''It's better for ourselves and the child,'' he said. His wife said: ''In a way you're happy making someone else happy. But it's sad too. You're giving up a part of yourself.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'THE FETUS LOST IN THE LABYRINTHINE WAYS OF THE LAW',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/opinion/l-the-fetus-lost-in-the-labyrinthine-ways-of-the-law-090559.html,"To the Editor: An uneasy calm has settled over the abortion scene. An anti-abortion constitutional amendment lies stillborn in the Senate, and the Supreme Court has emphatically reaffirmed (and even expanded upon) the position it staked out 10 years ago in Roe v. Wade - that for the first two-thirds of a pregnancy the incipient mother is free to dispose of the fetus as though it were a wart or some other such obnoxious excrescence. A majority of the present Court has agreed with the Roe v. Wade Court that, up until the final trimester, abortion is to be regarded as just another surgical procedure. To regard the destruction of the fetus as just another surgical procedure is to disregard centuries of criminology, theology and moral philosophy. It is not so much that I disagree with the Court's abortion decisions - what is suggested is that the Court should not have decided them at all. The approach taken by the Court in these cases is in the best tradition of legal formalism. An examination of the text of the Constitution persuades the Court that a fetus is not a ''person'' and so is not worthy of the protections of the 14th Amendment. Next, evading the question of when life begins, the Court neatly calibrates the value of the fetus by dividing its time in the womb into roughly three equal periods. Then, employing what is called the ''compelling interest'' test, it decrees that only during the final trimester can the mother have any restrictions placed upon her as regards the fetus. Such quaint legal formalism is entirely appropriate to the judicial resolution of property and inheritance matters. It is wildly inappropriate in the abortion context, where so many complex extrajudicial theories coalesce. The Court itself has long recognized that there are some matters that are beyond judicial cognizance. One of these is where there are no judicially manageable standards to guide the Court in its decision. At one time, legislative redistricting was found to fall in this category. Clearly, the abortion question is a classic example of a situation where the only judicial standards available are artificial, informed by a legal formalism that is simply not up to the task. The courts should step aside. Someone has said that the purest example of true democracy in action is the lynch mob. In our constitutional democracy, the Supreme Court has enjoyed its finest hour when it has served as an anti-majoritarian counterforce to the excesses of democracy. Tragically, where the fetus is concerned, it has abandoned its role of protecting the politically powerless. The people, through their elected local representatives, should be given the nonreviewable power to allocate the relative rights of the fetus and the mother. Much as the self in Walker Percy's recent book is ''Lost in the Cosmos,'' so is the fetus lost in the labyrinthine ways of the law. BILLUPS P.

"POLITICS; THIS YEAR, THE PARTY POLITICAL CHIEFS ARE WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/us/politics-this-year-the-party-political-chiefs-are-women.html,"As the Republican and Democratic National Committees gear up for the 1984 Presidential election, they will both enter the contest for the first time with women as political directors. But there the similarities end. Linden H. Kettlewell, a 30-year-old lawyer from Texas who was appointed last month as political director of the Republican National Committee, and Ann F. Lewis, a 45-year-old political organizer who was selected two and a half years ago to head the political division of the Democratic National Committee, see their roles in entirely different lights. Mrs. Lewis had never met the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Charles T. Manatt, when he took over the shambles of the party in the aftermath of the 1980 election. A founding organizer of the National Women's Political Caucus, former administrative aide to Representatives Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and Stanley Lundine, Democrat of New York, Mrs. Lewis said she had applied for the job of political director at the suggestion of a number of Democratic women. ''They didn't think I'd get it, but they thought the party would owe us one, that I could become a bargaining chip,'' said Mrs. Lewis, who is the sister of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''The assumption was that given the way Washington works, the job would go to someone Chuck Manatt knew all his life. The fact I was considered was because women had grown in power. I am the first woman to serve on the senior staff or a political staff of either party.'' Mrs. Lewis said that as a woman in a prominent party post, she carried a ''responsibility to other women'' and that meant capitalizing on the growing tendency of women to vote Democratic, sometimes called the gender gap, for the Democrats. ''By any standard,'' she added, ''the job of a political technician like myself is to make the most of this. And not only to win elections but to form a government of all the people.'' A Combination of Roles ''If we win because of women and minorities,'' she said referring to the Presidential election, ''we'll have to make sure the Government reflects it.'' An avowed feminist and mother of three, Mrs. Lewis is considered by party officials and other political professionals to have savvy political instincts. She says she combines the roles of advocate and technician and hence spends a good deal of time speaking around the country on the genesis of the gender gap and in training sessions for local party officials. She noted that several polls published in the spring showed that the ''entire margins'' of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senator John Glenn over President Reagan were made up of women. ''Women and women's issues have to be an important part of the campaign, and more than just appointments,'' she continued. ''The Administration has given a bad name to appointing women. Women are looking at a broader spread of issues, particularly economic equity.'' The Problem of Money Mrs. Lewis said that one of her chief tasks is to make sure that there is a ''woman's component'' in every facet of the Democratic Party, including the training of candidates, party building at state and local levels and campaign services. But one of the largest problems, she added, is a lack of money, both for the political division and for female candidates. Mrs. Lewis, whose salary is $55,000, has an annual budget of about $1 million and a staff of eight. Women in the Democratic Party, Mrs. Lewis says, have a much more difficult time putting together a successful candidacy than do men, because they do not have the ''original'' contacts. ''They are least likely to have access to large early donors in the beginning,'' she said. ''The toughest challenge we face is to be of assistance to women candidates financially.'' Last year, a special fund for female candidates, named after Eleanor Roosevelt, was created at the committee, and 50 women in the party received $1,000 each. ''In many cases, those were the only funds they received from party sources,'' Mrs. Lewis said. ''It troubles me that the assumption is made that I'm a token,'' said Mrs. Kettlewell, as she sat at the desk vacated by her predecessor, Richard N. Bond, ''because I don't think that is the way the party works, or the way the chairman, Frank Fahrenkopf, works.'' Despite the drumbeat of complaints from women's organizations and from Republican legislators who are women about the record of the Reagan Administration on issues ranging from economics to abortion, Mrs. Kettlewell believes that almost all is well with the Republican Party and with female voters. The growing trend among women to vote for Democrats over Republicans could be stopped, she contends, if the record was explained. ''It's a perception problem,'' she said. ''The White House and the Republican Party have the responsibility to explain the initiatives.'' Mrs. Kettlewell cited the drop in inflation and the lowering of mortgage rates as factors that should convince women that the Administration was working in their interest. When she came to the capital two years ago as an aide to Senator Paul Laxalt, the Nevada Republican who now is also the general chairman of the Republican Party, Mrs. Kettlewell had never lived east of the Mississippi. She grew up in rural western Texas in a family where volunteering in political campaigns was part of the household routine. A Move to Nevada In 1976, she was the Texas state youth coordinator for Gerald R. Ford in the primary against Ronald Reagan, which Mr. Reagan won. The following year, she became the executive director of the Texas Republican County Chairman's Association and in 1978 moved to Reno to take the post of executive director of the Nevada Republican Party. There, she met Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., then chairman of the state party and now chairman of the Republican National Committee. When Mr. Fahrenkopf assumed leadership of the party committee at the beginning of the year, he invited Mrs. Kettlewell to leave her job as legislative director for Senator John Tower of Texas and work as his counselor. She says it is not her role to be an advocate for policy positions within the party. Asked whether she thought the President should support the Economic Equity Act, which deals with sex discrimination in insurance, taxes and retirement matters, and with the enforcement of child support laws, Mrs. Kettlewell replied: ''As the political director of this committee, I don't have to satisfy questions about why he is not supporting the Economic Equity Act. I am neither a policy enforcer or a policy writer. I am a political technician.'' Mrs. Kettlewell described herself as a ''strict constitutionalist'' and said she never supported passage of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which, until 1980, was contained in the Republican Party platform. ''I had some questions about an amendment as broad as that one,'' she said. Personal Stand Against Abortion Reared as a Roman Catholic, Mrs. Kettlewell says she is opposed to abortion. ''I hold that as a personal stand,'' she said. ''I don't think it has anything to do with the job I'm in.'' The Republican National Committee's political division has a staff of 130 people, and from April to December of this year will operate on a budget of $6.9 million, according to Mrs. Kettlewell, whose salary is $50,000. Her chief task, Mrs. Kettlewell believes, is to turn the party back to grass-roots politicking. ''We've neglected the grass roots, thinking that technology can over overcome grass-roots organization,'' she said. ''You don't build a party from Congress up or the White House down but from the courthouse up. Every time you elect a county judge, you make it much more likely that you're going to elect a state legislator or a congressman or a President.'' Another of her chores, she said, is to recruit more women as candidates. ''Not because of the hue and cry about the gender gap,'' she added, ''but because they're qualified and give a different perspective.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JURY REJECTS DEATH PENALTY FOR MOTHER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/nyregion/jury-rejects-death-penalty-for-mother.html,"An Essex County jury tonight rejected the death penalty for a 20-year-old Irvington woman it convicted two weeks ago of the beating death of her 3-year-old son. The woman, Renee Nicely, faces life in prison, where she must serve at least 30 years before becoming eligible for parole. At 7:15 P.M., after the jury of 10 men and 2 women had deliberated more than 23 hours over three days, the jury foreman, Jean Roberts, read the verdict. She noted that although the jury had found the death of Shawn Nicely last Sept. 26 particularly vile, there were mitigatng factors, such as the woman's emotional stress of having undergone an abortion the day before the murder, and that her capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct was impaired. Sentencing Next Month Miss Nicely, who will be 21 Friday, sighed with relief as the verdict was read, and she smiled and rested her chin on her fingertips, held in a prayerful position on the defense table. Judge Edwin Stern set Sept. 22 for sentencing, seven days after Allen G. Bass, 21, the father of Miss Nicely's five children, is sentenced. He faces up to 20 years in prison for aggravated manslaughter in his son's death. In the first phase of the trial, which lasted four weeks, the couple's 5-year- old son, Davelle, testified on closed-circuit television how his parents had beaten his brother and how his father ''had stomped on his back.'' Other witnesses testified that Miss Nicely, who became pregnant with her first child at 14, had repeatedly been a child abuser, that she had often punched and kicked Shawn and that she had once dropped him on his head on the pavement. 'Psychotic Episode' Cited Witnesses said the woman had told friends that the boy was not hers and that she had been given the wrong baby when he was turned over to her three months after his birth. She had left him in the hospital, and the infant had lived with a foster mother. Defense psychiatrists testified that Miss Nicely had suffered abuse as a child and that she had undergone a ''psychotic episode,'' triggered by the abortion. An Essex County assistant prosecutor, Lawrence L. Monaco, urged the jurors in his summation not to allow sympathy to enter into their deliberations. ''Your verdict, ladies and gentlemen, must state in no uncertain terms that the cries of Shawn Nicely were heard and that the cries of of other children will not go unheard,'' Mr. Monaco said. ''You must do your duty.'' Carl Herman, a public defender, urged the jurors to spare Miss Nicely's life and sentence her to prison, where she could receive psychiatric help. ''This is not a criminal mind,'' he said in his summation. ''This is not an evil mind. This is a disturbed mind.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: 'THE LOUDS 10 YEARS LATER',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/movies/tv-the-louds-10-years-later.html,"YOU remember the Louds. Ten years ago if you did not see them on television, you read about them in newspapers and magazines. They were everywhere, Bill, Pat, the five children, an upper middle-class family from Santa Barbara, Calif., telling us about themselves while we hung on listening to every word. HBO is offering a new documentary about their lives: ''American Family Revisited - The Louds 10 Years Later.'' It will be seen at 8 tonight. First things first: The new documentary is not nearly the same slice of life as the old series. It is only one hour, and mostly it is an update on the Louds, along with clips from the old series and comments on what it all means. And what it all means, hotly debated in 1973, isn't that clear now. The 1973 ''American Family'' happened because the Louds had welcomed film makers into their home, and the film makers shot 300 hours of film. Edited into a public television spectacular in 12 parts, it showed some memorable scenes: Pat Loud telling her brother and his wife about her husband's infidelities, Lance Loud talking about his homosexuality, Pat Loud asking Bill Loud for a divorce. It was soap opera, raised up as cinema verite. The series made the Louds into pop celebrities, famous for being famous. They graced the covers of newsmagazines and they appeared on talk shows. Always they were asked how they could have exposed themselves so publicly. Everyone seemed to disapprove, usually suspecting, sometimes smugly, that the Louds confirmed the death of the American dream. They had a home, five kids, four cars, three dogs, two cats and a horse. Santa Barbara was a nice place to live, too. The Louds had it all, but it wasn't enough. The series made a prima facie case for their emptiness. What else could drive anyone to such vulgar display? So, why did the Louds really do it? ''We said: 'Who wants to watch home movies? This is a little diversion that nobody's going to watch,' '' Mrs. Loud says on the documentary. ''We gambled on that and lost.'' Mrs. Loud is now a literary agent, living comfortably, the documentary indicates, in New York. Her former husband, now remarried, is still in Santa Barbara, living comfortably, too, and continuing to see himself, he says, as ''an irresponsible rogue.'' He also says he feels ''no remorse for having done the series.'' The children, now adults, don't seem particularly maimed, either, even if none of them want to get married. Mrs. Loud, however, says she's been close to marrying again ''several'' times, but that she hasn't ''met the right person.'' Meanwhile, Delilah, who is now 26 and working in public relations in Los Angeles, says she's just not ready for marriage. Kevin, 30, who lives in a singles apartment in Houston and is employed by an oil company, says, ''God knows, I haven't met the right girl.'' Michele, 25, working in the fashion industry in New York, says her parents' divorce taught her ''marriage meant so much'' that she does not want to enter it lightly. Grant, 29, singing in club dates in California, ''growing more and more successful in show business,'' he says, seems too busy to even think about it. Which leaves Lance, now 31, who spent nine years in rock music and was living next to Michele in New York, and recently has returned to California. ''The same questions that bothered me then still bother me,'' he says, ''but now I don't wear blue lipstick.'' Lance is the most beguiling of the Louds, and this viewer hopes that his father, who says, ''I detest his way of life,'' will make up with him. Lance, meanwhile, says his father ''is a great guy.'' He also says, ''He's definitely a 'That's Life' type of guy, straight from the heart of Frank Sinatra. Baby, hit him with the pink spot.'' Lance may be on to something. All the Louds were hit by a spotlight, and the fact is they seemed to like it. When the series wound down they did Dick Cavett, Mike Douglas and Phil Donahue. Perhaps they legitimized a new form of behavior. If you watch a lot of television, you will be struck by how easily, even eagerly, people now embrace the camera. It watches abortions, open-heart surgery and therapy sessions of all kinds. What once was private now goes public. The camera confirms existence. Often it blurs it, too. When Mrs. Loud asked Mr. Loud for a divorce 10 years ago, it was the real stuff, a first. On television, it was also entertainment, which made it even better than the real stuff because usually the real stuff isn't fun to watch. After the Louds, the problem in television became one of doing it real and doing it funny, too. Norman Lear solved the problem with ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' and other programs. They were supposed to be real, but they were also outrageous. The programs won lots of awards. Where does reality go now? How do you top ''Real People?'' Its people are real because they can hold their breaths underwater for long periods of time, or do other curious things. The camera pays attention to them, just as it paid atention 10 years ago to the Louds. In the new documentary, however, they seem just like plain folks. Television has passed them by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HISPANIC LEADERS SEEK TO MOLD A VOTING BLOC FOR 1984,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/us/hispanic-leaders-seek-to-mold-a-voting-bloc-for-1984.html,"Both the Republican and Democratic parties are making major efforts to woo votes of Hispanic Americans, whose growing numbers and new political sophistication are giving them political power on a scale they have not known in two centuries of American democracy. President Reagan's scheduled speech this Saturday in El Paso before a Hispanic American veterans group, the American G.I. Forum, provides dramatic evidence of this. It comes only four days after 200 Mexican-American, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic leaders gathered here this week in San Antonio to map strategy to register one million more of their people to vote before the 1984 Presidential election. They were addressed by such national leaders as Vice President Bush for the Republicans and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts for the Democrats. While Democrats have long had the bulk of Hispanic support, new survey evidencestrongly suggests that Republicans have a chance of eating into that margin as affluence and class distinctions among Hispanic citizens grow. The more sophisticated of their leaders are attempting to use this division to wring commitments from both major parties, arguing that Hispanic voters may provide the ''swing vote'' in a close election. ''The Republicans are right - they do have an opportunity to cut dramatically into the Mexican-American vote,'' said William C. Valasquez, executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, sponsor of the new national campaign launched here. They could do that by responding better to Hispanic needs, he said, adding, ''Absent that, the vote will go 90 percent Democratic.'' New Element in Equation The emergence of the Hispanic minority as a potent political force in the Southwest, Northeast, Florida and parts of the Middle West has introduced a new and complex element into the political equation. The term Hispanic is a vague one that includes many groups with a common Spanish heritage but with local and national interests that are often very divergent. By far the largest, about 60 percent, are of Mexican origin. Puerto Ricans make up about 20 percent, and the prodominantly Republican Cubans, about 10 percent, with various Central and South American nationalities accounting for the rest. What makes these numbers particularly difficult to assess is that large numbers of these groups, except for the Puerto Ricans, are not American citizens and therefore are ineligible to vote. This week's meeting was an attempt to bury their differences and stress their commonality as a deprived minority. ''We are beginning to work together,'' said Millie Torres, chairman of the National Puerto Rican Coalition, ''This conference is evidence of a new level of political maturity among major Hispanic groups.'' The Mexican-Americans, or Chicanos, do not fit well into the usual liberal-conservative axis that some people use to American politics, according to polls conducted by Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a political scientist who directs the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He said they tended to be conservative on such issues as abortion and school prayer and sharply divided on gun control, but liberal on such matters as spending for education and other social programs and on foreign policy. Moreover, his polls show they tend to be more conservative on the issues than their leaders. ''They are not a natural constituency for Republicans, but the new socially mobile Mexican-Americans seem to be leaning in that direction,'' said Professor de la Garza. ''This is very important because if there is mobility, it has real implications for the Democratic Party. They will have to do something to hold onto them.'' Degree of Power Uncertain Just how much new power Hispanic voters have is uncertain. The growth in their numbers has been exaggerated, by leaders of this conference and others, by widespread misinterpretion of the 1980 Census. That census defined Hispanic in a different way from previous surveys, making comparisons with 1970 impossible. The 1980 Census count put the Hispanic population of voting age at 8.2 million, but this is difficult to interpret because an uncertain number, one-third, according to conference officials, were not citizens. It is unclear how many, if any, illegal aliens are fraudently registered to vote. Historically, Hispanic people have not voted in large numbers but those who have, have generally voted for the Democrats by about 3-to-1. It is uncertain what percentage of Hispanic Americans are registered today, with the figure varying from 40 percent or less to 62 percent depending on how one estimates the number of citizens. Nevertheless, it is clear that Hispanic influence has grown, if only from the growing number of Hispanic mayors, Congressmen and state legislators. The leadership hopes to increase registration from 3.4 million in 1980 to 4.4 million next year, adding 200,000 in New York, 400,000 in California, 201,000 in Texas, 40,000 in Florida and 35,000 in Illinois, ''The hands that historically have picked the lettuce in this country, and the hands that historically have picked the cotton in this country, are the hands that can pick the next President of this country,'' Gov. Toney Anaya of New Mexico, a Democrat, told the gathering here. Unanswered Questions Whether the leaderhip can turn out the vote and achieve this remains to be seen. Nor is it obvious that the group will vote as a bloc. Still, despite the difference between Chicanos and Puerto Ricans, they have one thing in common, according to Jake I. Alarid, vice chairman of the American G.I. Forum. He said, ''Our community has long been neglected by local, state and Federal governments and by the private sector.'' Despite the unity at the meeting, leaders concede there are differences among Hispanic groups. Indeed, such internal differences emerged in polls of Mexican-Americans in San Antonio and East Los Angeles and among Texas Mexican-American leaders conducted by Professor de la Garza and his colleague Robert R. Brischetto. There was considerable unanimity on such local issues as bilingual education. But the average Hispanic person was much more likely to cite inflation, rather than unemployment, as the major problem facing the country than the leadership. In addition, support for President Reagan and the Republicans differed substantially according to education, income and sex. For example, Hispanic people with a college education were twice as likely (38 percent to 19 percent) to approve of the way Mr. Reagan was handling his job, although the majority (53 percent) still disapproved. Conversely, Hispanic women were less likely to approve of Mr. Reagan, disclosing a ''gender gap'' similar to that observed nationally. Other studies have shown Hispanic people to be divided over immigration issues, though most - save the Cubans - oppose the Administration's Central American policies. Professor de la Garza said that an incipient but increasing class distinction may mean that a lot of younger, better educated, Hispanic voters who are already registered will tend to vote Republican. But newly enrolled voters, he went on, are likely to be less affluent and therefore more likely to vote Democratic. All of this suggests that, Mr. Brischetto said, ''If you are looking to appeal to Mexican-Americans as an ideologically singular group, you are fooling yourself.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO SELECTS FIRST WOMAN FOR HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/12/nyregion/cuomo-selects-first-woman-for-high-court.html,"Judith S. Kaye, a partner in a Manhattan law firm and vice president of the Legal Aid Society, was nominated by Governor Cuomo yesterday to be the first woman to serve as a judge on the state's highest court. The appointment of Mrs. Kaye to the Court of Appeals is subject to confirmation by the State Senate. At a news conference in his office at the World Trade Center, Mr. Cuomo praised Mrs. Kaye's ''extraordinary qualifications'' and called her a ''a lawyer of unusual ability, integrity and determination.'' Referring to the absence of a woman on the court, he said, ''In addition to adding excellence to the court, the appointment of Judith Kaye erases a stigma it has borne for too long a time.'' No Experience as a Judge Mrs. Kaye, a partner at the firm of Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Weyher, has never been a judge. Mr. Cuomo said this would not be a handicap and noted that several Court of Appeals judges had not previously served on the bench, including Adrian P. Burke, for whom he once was clerk. ''Like other great Court of Appeals judges who came to the bench directly from the practice of law,'' he said, ''her day-to-day life as an advocate has demonstrated the character, temperament, capacity for collegial activity and ability to articulate that are essential.'' Mrs. Kaye said she felt both ''inexplicably superb'' and ''engulfed by a sense of great responsibility'' when informed of her nomination yesterday morning. ''I would hope,'' she said, ''that I will continue the tradition of excellence of the Court of Appeals.'' Mrs. Kaye, 45 years old, would succeed Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg, who resigned last month, shortly in advance of his mandatory retirement. Mrs. Kaye, like Judge Fuchsberg, is regarded as a liberal, and her ascension to the bench would not be expected to alter the court's ideological balance. She declined at the news conference yesterday to characterize her judicial philosophy or to state her positions on such issues as the death penalty or abortion. ''Above all, my philosophy, if any, would be to be a fair, reasoned and impartial person attempting to render a just result in each case that comes before me,'' she said. Under the state's Constitution, the State Senate must act on her nomination within 30 days. Specialized in Commercial Law Mrs. Kaye, who was born in Monticello, N.Y., graduated from Barnard College and New York University Law School. Her specialty is commercial litigation, which she first practiced as an associate at the Wall Street firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and, more recently, as the only woman partner at the 70-member Olwein, Connelly firm. In addition to her law practice, Mrs. Kaye has served as vice president and director of the Legal Aid Society and is a member of the executive committee of the New York City Bar Association. She is also vice chairman of the Clients' Security Fund of New York, which reimburses clients for losses suffered at the hands of unscrupulous lawyers. Governor Cuomo had pledged to appoint a woman to an Appeals Court judgeship, which pays $80,892 a year, and has a 14-year term. A record number of women, including many leading judges and lawyers, applied for the post. At least 15 were interviewed by the Commission for Judicial Nomination, which by state law selects candidates for court posts. The Governor chose Mrs. Kaye from a list of seven candidates, two of whom were women. The panel's other recommendations were Betty Weinberg Ellerin, deputy chief administrative judge for New York City; Bertram R. Gelfand, the Bronx County surrogate; Judge Stewart F. Hancock Jr. of the Appellate Division, Fourth Department; Judge Leon D. Lazer of the Appellate Division, Second Department; Judge Joseph P. Sullivan of the Appellate Division, First Department, and Judge Abraham D. Sofaer of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Earlier this month, the Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, representing 2,000 women who are lawyers, recommended Judge Ellerin for the court post but declined to endorse Mrs. Kaye. One of those who had reviewed Mrs. Kaye's credentials said the association had found that Mrs. Kaye was weak in the areas of matrimonial and criminal law, and that she had practiced primarily in Federal rather than state courts. Judge Ellerin, whom the women's bar group recommended highly, had served on its board of directors and was a past president of its New York City chapter. Mrs. Kaye is not a member. All seven candidates were found ''well qualified'' by a State Bar Association panel. Other Views Are Sought Before selecting Mrs. Kaye, Mr. Cuomo and his staff sought the views of many practicing attorneys and former members of the Court of Appeals, including Charles D. Breitel, Stanley Fuld and Domenick J. Gabrielli. The Governor said that Mrs. Kaye was ''overwhelmingly endorsed by people whose judgment I have great, great respect for.'' In a statement issued yesterday, Marjorie Karowe, the president of the women's bar group, called the Governor's decision ''unfortunate.'' ''We do, however, extend our best wishes and our support to Mrs. Kaye and hope she will prove to be a distinguished member of the bench,'' Mrs. Karowe continued. Louis A. Craco, president of the City Bar Association, called Mrs. Kaye ''a lawyer of real excellence who has repeatedly demonstrated in practice her belief that the law should be a helping profession for all people.'' Lawrence H. Cooke, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, said the nomination marked ''a milestone in the history of the court.'' ''It's important to have the perspective of a woman on the bench,'' he said, ''and it's going to be thrilling to have a woman of her capabilities.'' The vacancy created by Judge Fuchsberg's resignation is the second filled by Mr. Cuomo. Earlier this year, he named Richard D. Simons to succeed Judge Gabrielli, who reached mandatory retirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE REGION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/14/weekinreview/the-region-100621.html,"Cuomo's ChoiceFor High Court ''I take my gender with me wherever I go,'' Judith S. Kaye was saying last week. So far, she has gone to the New York firm of Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Weyher as the only woman partner, and to the Legal Aid Society as vice president. Mrs. Kaye's next destination is New York State's highest tribunal, where she would be the first woman on the Court of Appeals. Governor Cuomo nominated her last week; the State Senate was expected to approve. Mrs. Kaye would not characterize her judicial philosophy or her position on issues such as the death penalty and abortion rights. Observers say she is a liberal, much like the man she would replace, Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg, who resigned in May, just short of his mandatory retirement date. Her appointment thus was not expected to alter the court's ideological makeup. Of seven candidates named by a selection committee last month, only Mrs. Kaye was not a judge. The Women's Bar Association of the State of New York found her weak in matrimonial and criminal law and more experienced in Federal, as against state courts. Marjorie Karowe, the association's president, called the nomination ''unfortunate,'' while extending the group's ''best wishes'' for Mrs. Kaye's success. Governor Cuomo praised her ''ability, integrity and determination.'' He said he had pledged to appoint a qualified woman to the court and had done so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FACING THE 'GENDER GAP' WITH CONFLICTING ADVICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/16/us/facing-the-gender-gap-with-conflicting-advice.html,"At the White House, a fierce debate surrounds President Reagan's recent steps to address feminist issues. The debate is under way because there is no agreement over why Mr. Reagan continues to fare so poorly among female voters. Consider the following arguments: - Some Reagan aides view the recession as the primary cause of erosion in Mr. Reagan's support among women. These aides maintain that once unemployment falls, women will support Mr. Reagan in greater numbers. In the meantime, these officials want Mr. Reagan to emphasize to women's groups his success in bringing down inflation. * Other officials, disagreeing sharply, say that budget cuts in food stamps, Social Security and other programs have fallen heavily on women and that Mr. Reagan must respond with new programs. Thus the President is being advised to push harder for changes in pension laws, tax benefits for child care and other programs affecting women. - Still other officials say that programs and policies are secondary to the fact that Mr. Reagan suffers from a generalized ''macho'' image that women don't seem to like. They think he should soften his image by meeting more with women, particularly working women, and appointing more women to Government posts. * A final theory accepted by many at the White House attributes the disparity in Mr. Reagan's support between male and female voters, the so- called gender gap, to heightened fears among women that Mr. Reagan is risking war in Central America and elsewhere. Here, Mr. Reagan is being advised to temper his display of firmness with assurances that he is trying to avoid war. In fact, Mr. Reagan is doing all these things, and as one woman who holds top Administration position put it, ''There has been a lot of flailing about with no clear unified strategy - no wonder it doesn't seem to be working.'' Problems Are 'Not Simple' ''Gender gap'' is the term for a trend that has turned up in virtually all polls. The New York Times/CBS News Poll of June 20-24, for example, showed a 24-point gap between Republican men and women on whether Mr. Reagan deserves to be re-elected. ''Basically, the gender gap is as serious for us as it's ever been,'' said another official, reviewing Mr. Reagan's recent speeches and actions on women's issues. ''We've done a lot of analysis of our political problems on women, and they're not simple. They're going to take time to deal with.'' Many women's groups believe that Mr. Reagan's strategy not only lacks coherence, but overlooks two other issues they feel have led to disenchantment among female voters: his opposition to abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. ''Although women feel strongly about abortion, many of them aren't aware of how Reagan is trying to take away their rights,'' said Kathy Wilson, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus. ''So we're going to be publicizing that fact in the months ahead.'' At the White House, there is a feeling that neither abortion nor the proposed amendment are factors in Mr. Reagan's problems. But there is also widespread agreement that Administration efforts to deal with women have been fitful at best. Lists, but Little Change Many officials complain that the President has been diverted by insubstantial enterprises, such as the Fifty States Project. That project compiled lists of laws and practices that discriminate against women and recommended changes on a state level, but the changes themselves have been slow. In addition, a Task Force on Legal Equity has compiled lists of discriminatory regulations and laws on the Federal level, but most are innocuous references to the male gender. A group of major legislative changes has yet to be enacted. Last year, a coordinating committee on women's issues met periodically at the White House, but it was disbanded after its chairman, Elizabeth H. Dole, left her job as a Presidential assistant to become Secretary of Transportation in February. Then Faith Ryan Whittlesey, who replaced Mrs. Dole as a liaison aide to special interest groups, offended women's organizations with comments that the gender gap would close once the economy turned around. Annoyed by that approach, Michael K. Deaver, the deputy White House chief of staff, created a new working group on women's issues and began meeting with Republican women in the House of Representatives to come up with some programs. Delay on Child Care Proposal The Deaver group is trying to build on changes enacted in 1981, including passage of a larger tax credit for child care costs and tax breaks for individual retirement accounts for nonworking women. But here again, there have been problems. In his State of the Union Message last January, Mr. Reagan proposed new steps to reduce delinquencies in child support payments by absent fathers. But it took months to negotiate with the Republican Congresswomen on a bill. The delay was caused by initial Administration reluctance to include incentives for the collection of child support payments in families not on welfare. It was Mr. Reagan who broke a stalemate by agreeing to accept inclusion of a program for these families. In other areas, some in the Reagan Administration want to increase the tax credit for child care and to increase the size of retirement accounts available to nonworking women. But the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget are resisting because both steps would increase the Federal deficit. Waiting for the Court In January, Mr. Reagan also endorsed the principle of equity in pension payments to men and women, and his aides promised legislation soon. But there were delays in this area because top officials wanted to wait first for a crucial Supreme Court ruling on the matter. ''Frankly, I would have liked to see us move a lot sooner on the pension issue,'' said a White House official. ''But we had to wait until some ambiguities were clarified by the Court.'' The slowness of all these efforts is frustrating to the men and women working on them. And once again, they are shadowed by the question: Is there any measureable political benefit to be gained by Mr. Reagan in seeking changes in pension, child support enforcement and other relatively obscure issues? ''Some people are making the case that it's a waste of time,'' acknowledged one White House official. But Secretary Dole, who still keeps on top of these and other issues affecting women, said: ''You do these things, not because of the political benefit, but because of the real problems that need to be addressed. It may well have an impact on voters, but the primary thing is that women need help.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MISSOURIO COURT RULES THAT A FETUS IS A PERSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/18/garden/missourio-court-rules-that-a-fetus-is-a-person.html,"A living fetus is legally a person under the state's wrongful- death law, the Missouri Supreme Court said recently, ruling that a Kansas couple had the right to sue for damage to their unborn child. The ruling reverses a previous interpretation of Missouri's wrongful- death statute that a fetus was not a person deserving the protection of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. ''Parents clearly have an interest in being protected against or compensated for the loss of a child they wish to have,'' wrote Special Judge James A. Pudlowski for the court. ''The fetus itself has an interest in being protected from injury before birth.'' James Bartimus, the lawyer for the parents, called the ruling ''one of the most significant decisions in Missouri in the last decade.'' ''I took this case at the beginning knowing I was going to try to change the law,'' he said. ''The previous law had been that the fetus had to be born alive to have a cause of action.'' Connecticut allows such an action on behalf of an unborn fetus. New York and New Jersey do not. Terry and Kevin O'Grady of Kansas City, Kan., filed the suit against St. Joseph Hospital of Kansas City, Mo., two doctors and a nurse. The O'Gradys charged that negligence in treating Mrs. O'Grady's ruptured uterus caused her baby to be stillborn in 1979. The O'Gradys said the fetus had shown healthy vital signs. Judge Pudlowski noted that in 1973 the United States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade upheld a mother's right to have an abortion, but he said that that historic case also recognized that a state had an interest in providing legal protection to the fetus. In Roe v. Wade, the Court defined ''viable fetus'' as one in ''that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems.'' Mr. Bartimus said this decision had no bearing on abortions because they did not involve viable fetuses and the death of the fetus was not through negligence on the part of the doctor, but rather an intentional act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION: A FORUM LEAST APPROPRIATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/19/opinion/l-abortion-a-forum-least-appropriate-108820.html,"To the Editor: I read with interest Prof. Billups Percy's recent letter (Aug. 10) criticizing the Supreme Court for its failure to defer to legislative resolution of the extremely contentious issue of abortion. The writer is quite correct in recognizing the limitations of the legal system to address an issue that involves fundamental and uncertain questions of theology, morality and science. Certainly legal formalisms fail us in such murky waters. But my complaint with the writer's conclusion is his failure to persuade that legislative solutions, predicated principally on politics, offer a more salutary and reassuring resolution of the issue. In the absence of any institution truly appropriate to deal with such fundamental questions of life, it would appear that the Supreme Court, insulated from the vagaries of politics, offers a more satisfactory avenue for the consideration of this largely philosophic issue than Congress. The process is surely imperfect but appears to be as well as we can do when we confront one of those instances in which the issue is beyond the resources of human knowledge.

WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/nyregion/westchester-journal-106469.html,"THE county has long had an association with the women's suffrage movement. One of the movement's leaders, Susan B. Anthony, once taught in New Rochelle. Another, Carrie Chapman Catt, made her home in that same city. Their efforts led to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. Next Friday at noon, on the 63d anniversary of the enactment of the Amendment, women of the county will mark the date by honoring a contemporary, Vickie Stein of Scarsdale, as ''Woman of the Year'' during ceremonies at the County Courthouse plaza in White Plains. The event will mark Women's Equality Day, which will be proclaimed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke . ''The purpose of the day is to celebrate the right to vote,'' explained Virginia Knaplund of Scarsdale, who, along with Lillian Worden , also of Scarsdale, was co-chairman of the Women's Equality Day committee that selected Mrs. Stein, as well as the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, which will receive the Project of the Year award for defending women's right to choose for or against abortion. The committee's members were drawn from 12 sponsoring organizations: Catholics for a Free Choice, the Northern Westchester Y.M. & Y.W.H.A., Planned Parenthood of Westchester, the Westchester Black Women's Political Caucus, the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, the Westchester National Organization for Women, the Westchester Women's Bar Association, the Westchester Women's Bar Association, the Westchester Women's Council, the Westchester Women's Federal Credit Union, Women of Westchester, the Yonkers Women's Task Force, and the Y.W.C.A. of White Plains and Central Westchester. Mrs. Stein, who was singled out for her work involving rights for women in cases of divorce and separation, rape and family violence, said she was ''very pleased to be recognized,'' but felt that it was more important that ''family violence and all its implications is being recognized.'' ''We're almost just getting started dealing with the problems,'' said Mrs. Stein, who heads the Family Violence Committee of the Women's Council. ''I still think there are many thousands of women in the county out there who are not reporting their abuse, because they are ashamed.'' Mrs. Stein made her home phone a Westchester hot line for abused women nine years ago and saw her efforts lead to the establishment of shelters and programs for county victims of domestic violence. She abandoned the hot line four years ago when the programs and shelters were created, but said she was thinking about ''accepting phone calls again,'' because she said she believed ''there are women out there who want to talk and don't trust the structures which have been established.'' Mrs. Stein, who first became involved with domestic violence through her work on the National Organization for Women's task force on marriage and divorce, is now deeply concerned with the sexual abuse of women and abuse against the elderly. She termed the latter ''Granny Abuse'' and said it represented ''her next big project.'' ''The elderly have less of a choice than do women,'' she explained. ''They have no place to go. It's a difficult problem, and it's going to take some time to get things started.'' Mrs. Stein will also be directing her efforts toward getting Family and Criminal Court judges to order seven-week educational sessions for men found guilty of violence against their wives. She said that this provision, adopted into law three years ago, has not been extensively used and that, consequently, the county has not held any sessions in the last year. ''I'm going to work very hard on this,'' she said. But on Friday, Mrs. Stein, who conceded that she was ''working behind the scenes,'' said she would enjoy being in the limelight. ''Yes, I have an ego,'' she confessed. ''I must say I'm enjoying the publicity for a change.'' Her award will be presented by the New York Secretary of State, Gail S. Shaffer, while former Representative Peter Peyser will present the Project of the Year award. Some of the past recipients of the Woman of the Year award, which was instituted in 1973, are also expected to be present at the ceremonies. - Gary Kriss The players will be wearing sneakers, not skates, but otherwise the rules will be those of professional ice hockey when an all-girls team from Maria Regina High School in Hartsdale takes on the New York Rangers All Stars Friday night. The game - which benefits the county's division of the American Cancer Society and the Phil Esposito Foundation - is being played at the Playland Ice Casino building, but in order to make the competition more equitable, the puck will be pushed over a wooden instead of a frozen surface. The idea for the event, which pits seven pros against 15 high school students and alumni, originated several years ago. Nancy Kubicek, now a student at Pace University, was attending Maria Regina and playing what she calls ''floor hockey'' during gym class: ''We used a puck with little ball bearings on it and played on the gym floor,'' she said. She was also going to Playland ice rink on weekends to watch the Rangers, particularly her favorite, Phil Esposito, at practice sessions. Eventually she decided it would be ''neat, a challenge,'' for her high school team to play the professional team, and she set about trying to arrange such an unlikely meeting. ''Everybody said to me, 'Yes, right' - they thought I was crazy,'' she recalls. ''But my mother, who really knows me, said, ''You can do it - you can do anything you want.' '' The road to success, however, proved to be lined with red tape, and it took almost three years of persistence to achieve the goal. Miss Kubicek sought out Mr. Esposito, she contacted public-relations personnel, she made numerous phone calls and wrote many letters and made in-person visits. Finally, Mr. Esposito, who is now a broadcaster for the team, decided simply to round up some of his colleagues and organize a game. The result was last year's match, played at the County Center to benefit the Muscular Distrophy Association. Attended by 1,000 people, it raised $10,000 for the charity and, as Miss Kubicek recalls it, ''It was fabulous.'' ''The Rangers put on a show,'' she said. ''The girls would be very determined. They would go down with the puck and think they were going to get a goal. Then the Rangers would stick out their sticks and laugh sarcastically and stop us. The girls would throw penalties at the Rangers, too, and we'd have mock fights. Several of the girls did score legitimately, and the Rangers looked startled, as if to say, how did that happen?'' As for this year's game, Miss Kubicek hopes to raise $15,000 for the local American Cancer Society and the Phil Esposito Foundation, which aids retired and injured hockey players. (Tickets are $6; for information call the American Cancer Society, 949-4800.) Mr. Esposito and others including Barry Beck, the Rangers captain, will go up against the Marina Regina team. Although he has been traded to another team, Ron Dugay is to be on hand, too. ''We used a plastic puck with little ball bearings last year, and the guys, who thought that we would be using a tennis ball, were surprised at how fast it can move,'' Miss Kubicek said. ''We're using it again this year. Three weeks ago, I ran into Ron Dugay in a restaurant. I said, 'We're going to beat you, we've been practicing.' He said, 'We've been practicing, too.' '' - Lynne Ames The hamlet of Chappaqua has restored a bit of ''green space'' near its busy main shopping area by turning an unused plot of land along King Street into a ''vest-pocket'' park - at least for the moment. Through the efforts of several Boy Scouts from the village's Troop 57, visitors to the ''downtown'' area will soon be able to relax on two benches in the shade of trees yet unplanted, view some floral arrangements and check the bulletin board for community news. There may even be murals to cover the blank brick and concrete walls that border the site. For 15-year-old Benjamin Auslander, the timing of the village's decision to do something with the lot couldn't have been better: The village wanted to put the 42-by-72-foot lot to temporary good use after tearing down the village's original highway garage, which had stood there for more than 50 years, and Ben needed a community project to fulfill a requirement to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout - the highest rank possible in Scouting. So, over the last three weeks, Ben and several other Scouts - Paul Haller, Chris White , Douglas Bantz, Michael Bindra and Richard Gonzales - have been clearing debris, digging trenches and laying railroad ties and wood chips. The trees and flowerbeds are to be planted by the town this fall. ''Its more work than I thought it was going to be, but I hope the town uses it and enjoys it,'' said Ben, who, along with the other Scouts involved, is a sophmore at Horace Greeley High school. Along with the experience gained in writing and presenting plans to local officials, recruiting and organizing his fellow scouts for the project, Ben said he was proud that his Eagle Scout project was ''out in the open, where you can see it.'' But, just how long the lot will remain open is now under study by the town of New Castle. According to Lois Mitchell, the Town Supervisor, the site will most likely be paved over again at some point in the future, this time as either the entrance or exit of a municipal parking lot. Increased development along King Street and in the village has put pressure on existing parking, so the town is looking at plans to condemn some privately owned property adjacent to the newly created park. No one from the town had mentioned this to Ben Auslander, but upon learning of the plot's possible fate, he responded like a true community-minded Scout: ''I'd be a little disappointed if it didn't remain a park, but if a parking lot would be best for the town, then I guess it's O.K.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THEATER; HOW THE SUMMERFARE MUSICALS FARED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/nyregion/theater-how-the-summerfare-musicals-fared.html,"GIVEN the mounting costs of mounting musicials, traditional out-of-town tryouts have dwindled. To a large extent, regional theater productions, small-scale workshops, extensive pre-Broadway tours and extended periods of previews in New York City have replaced them. The production of the three musicals in the Pepsico Summerfare, which ended two weeks ago, could be perceived as yet another alternative to the out-of-town tryout. Even though that designation was assiduously avoided by the festival's management, the fact remains that producers held options to put on each show if the local reactions were encouraging. In the case of two of them, such producers - who are usually looking for co-producers - were listed in the program as ''creative consultants.'' None of the three musicals worked according to the expressed intentions of their creators. The first one, ''Booth! Is Back in Town,'' which did not list a creative consultant, was adjudged an oddity - and a failure - not for its peculiarly placed punctuation mark alone. In a developmental stage for a score of years, during which it had a Lincoln Center Workshop production and a staging at the Williamstown Theater Festival, the musical, which purported to deal with the relationship between the Shakespearian actors Junius Booth and his son, Edwin, was pronounced a ''monumental muddle'' by one critic and ''a mess'' in need of ''wholesale surgery'' by another. By consensus, it suffered an identity crisis: was it a musical (Artur Rubinstein composed the score and Gretchen Cryer did the lyrics) or was it a play (the book was written by Austin Pendleton)? Creative consultant or not, producer Elliot Martin, who has been keeping a watchful eye on the project for more than six years and indicated that the late Zero Mostel once wanted to play Junius Booth, agreed that the recent version ''went far afield.'' Cumbersome scenery and ''too many ideas and plots'' distorted its essence, said Mr. Martin, who still regards it as ''a wonderful story'' that requires extensive rewriting. ''People are more interested in human relationships than in theater lore,'' Mr. Martin added, referring to the extraneous material that obliterated the show's central conflict. ''Booth!'' had been announced as a starring vehicle for Jason Robards during the forthcoming season at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, presumably another step toward Broadway. As a result of the failure of the Purchase production, it has been dropped, according to a Paper Mill spokesman. A tentative December Broadway opening, which has been listed in theatrical calendar publications, with Mr. Martin as producer and George Rose as star, appears unlikely at this point. ''Shakespeare and the Indians'' was another musicial in its third phase of development. With a score by Alan Jay Friedman and lyrics by Rob Preston and Rita Briggs, the show was once described by its author, Dale Wasserman, as ''a far-out western of sorts.'' Last summer, it was seen at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., and later in the fall at the Firehouse Dinner Theater in Omaha. Mr. Wasserman, who said that the musical had scored a success in Omaha, made revisions following that engagement, none of which, he said, were incorporated into the production at Purchase. Not pleased with what he saw here - it turned into ''a musical comedy instead of a serious play with music,'' he said - Mr. Wasserman, who compared the musical's ''philosophical'' theme with ''Man of La Mancha,'' which he also wrote, departed for his ranch in California after the first few performances, ''grimly intent on doing it again elsewhere,'' he said. Here again, the ''essence'' - or the real intentions - of the musical were missed and an overproduced show emerged, according to the author. Mr. Wasserman was attempting to deal with an individual's ''search for himself,'' here depicted by a character called ''the drifter'' who longed to recapture the purity of his past, which involved the early American mountain men. Ironically, Mr. Wasserman said he felt that the pressures that rule out-of- town tryouts in general and the commercial theater in particular were operating here as well. ''It's a contradiction.'' he said. ''I would have passed up this opportunity in favor of a workshop in an insulated atmosphere. I came away confused. I still don't know what we have. None of our revisions were done at Summerfare. The object was just to put on a show in a large theater because the paying customers were coming in.'' The author was not alone in his confusion. The director, the choreographer and the musical arranger, he said, were all replaced during the rehearsal period. A new director, Dennis Rosa, did a ''heroic job of pulling the show together in eight days.'' However, no single point of view prevailed, he declared. ''I still want to find out what it was I did,'' Mr. Wasserman added. In contrast to the simplicity required for the first two musicals, production values were just what the creators of ''Mrs. Farmer's Daughter,'' another problem-plagued musical, wanted. With its misleading title and undefined point of view, the show was performed in an expansive and experimental theater space, instead of the conventional proscenium theater where the other musicals took place. Attention focused on form: the directorial concept of Tom O'Horgan (who staged ''Lenny,'' ''Jesus Christ, Superstar'' and the Broadway production of ''Hair''). Content was unclear. Here was yet another inconclusive and discursive exploration - but the director insists, not an exploitation - of the life of the rebellious actress, Frances Farmer, who died of cancer in August 1970, six weeks before her 57th birthday. The tribulations of ''the troubled star,'' as she was called in one scene, included a hapless love affair with Clifford Odets, the playwright, an abortion, radical political activities, losing bouts with drugs and liquor, incarceration in prisons and psychiatric hospitals, shock therapy and intimations of lesbianism, lobotomies and rape. All that has provided titillating material for three recent Off- Broadway plays, three books, a film and a television drama. Another movie is in the making, according to Joseph Stockdale, professor and dean emeritus of the theater arts and film division at State University of New York at Purchase, who was a friend of Miss Farmer's during the last eight years of her life. The Purchase production was ''a viable way to get a look at it,'' Mr. O'Horgan said. ''We've learned a lot. The book now has to be restructured.'' A musical panorama with operatic overtones and echoes of cabaret style, ''Mrs. Farmer's Daughter'' had a book attributed to Mr. O'Horgan, Jack Eric Williams (who wrote the music and lyrics), and Mr. Stockdale (who was also credited with ''research and documentation'' and wound up as one of the actors as well). Rather than a sordid or sensational account of the actress's life, Mr. O'Horgan envisions ''Mrs. Farmer's Daughter'' - in which three performers played Frances Farmer: in her ''early, middle and mature years'' - as a statement about a survivor. ''It's about what happens to people when they speak out of turn,'' he added. Mr. Stockdale, who is otherwise a stickler for the facts about Miss Farmer's life, conceded that the musical was conceived in symbolic, mythic, metaphorical, philosophical and theatrically visual terms, thus rendering ''fiction more important than fact.'' Critics were invited to review ''Booth!'' and ''Mrs. Farmer's Daughter,'' much to the dismay of a number of those involved in their productions. Reviews of ''Shakespeare and the Indians'' were emphatically unsolicited. As Kathryn M. Gaffney, the festival director of marketing, said: ''We wanted to take a chance with three full-fledged new musicals. They played an important part in Summerfare's successs.'' By degrees, the musicals must now be rethought, redefined and reshaped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TV VIEW; ON GOSSIP, GLITZ AND OTHER REAL STUFF",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/arts/tv-view-on-gossip-glitz-and-other-real-stuff.html,"''Personal & Confidential,'' a new magazine show that has just had a one-week trial run on NBC, was right up front with what it was all about. ''We're bringing you everything that's personal and confidential,'' Steve Edwards, the amiable host, said, although this was really a contradiction because when you spread that kind of stuff around it's no longer personal and confidential. It's gossip and glitz. It may have had meaning once, but expose it on the tube and it has no meaning at all. It is not so much that the sacred becomes the profane; it is more that the profane becomes trivia. Consider the first show in the series. It featured the usual celebrity interviews, although the centerpiece of the program was a young woman in South Carolina who had shot and killed her husband. She sat on a park bench, her voice breaking, and talked about being a battered wife. She was about to tell us what happened when she picked up the gun, but she was interrupted by a commercial. When the commercial was over, Christine Belford, the co-host, did a little reprise. ''She's a battered wife and she can't take it anymore,'' Miss Belford said. She reminded the viewers of what the young woman was saying, lest it had slipped their minds during the commercial. Then the young woman went on about the killing. Minutes later, after an interview with the actress Linda Evans, ''Personal & Confidential'' had another ambitious segment. This one featured a California psychiatrist and his wife, advocates of a new technique for ''sexual enhancement.'' They had brought with them two of their patients, a young couple named Linda and Joe. In a brief therapy session - if you call a show ''Personal & Confidential,'' you are obligated to deliver the goods - the psychiatrist asked Joe what the problem was, and Joe said that Linda wasn't enjoying their sex life as much as she should. Joe said he knew this because of his experiences with other women. This viewer wondered if Joe watched television a lot and if this had heightened his expectations about sexual satisfaction. Linda, meanwhile, said that when Joe first expressed his misgivings she was ''defensive and hurt,'' but that now she understood. Perhaps she had become a heavy viewer, too. The psychiatrist, looking confident, gave Linda and Joe what appeared to be a book and said they should read it together. He said it would be ''fun.'' ''Personal & Confidential'' promised it would follow up on the new therapy in its next installment. It also promised to bring on the late William Holden's psychiatrist to give us ''the untold story'' about the movie star. Whatever questions this raises about medical ethics as opposed to the exciting new careers now open to psychiatrists on television, it brings up issues about television programming as well. How far, for instance, will network executives now go to satisfy what they interpret as the viewer's insatiable lust for the real stuff, the things that go on behind closed doors? Coincidentally, HBO has been showing a documentary, ''American Family Revisited - The Louds 10 Years Later.'' The Louds - Pat, Bill and their five children - may one day be recognized as seminal figures in our culture. Certainly they were pioneers. In the 12-part series ''American Family,'' which was shown on public television in 1973, Pat asked Bill for a divorce. This was as real as real could be, sanctified as cinema verite. It was also a first, the real stuff as entertainment. It was only a quick shuffle from there to ''Maude,'' a comedy where the real, supposedly funny stuff, was made up of menopause, abortions and emotional disorders. ''Maude'' is no longer with us, although the real stuff still is. Increasingly, it is interpreted as a matter of lifestyle, gossip and even news. ''Entertainment Tonight,'' well produced, often engaging, offers news about show business five nights a week. It is nationally syndicated and enormously successful, and much of its appeal lies in the rapidity of its presentation. Wham bam, and we are off on a new item. Last week, ''Entertainment Tonight'' celebrated its 500th program with another skillfully put together show: James Stewart was getting radiation for skin cancer; Burt Lancaster was facing a bypass operation; Rudolf Nureyev had pulled a tendon. Meanwhile, Mark Hamill carried his own luggage through an airport; Carrie Fisher found a new restaurant; Priscilla Presley was taking a trip. This is overload, of course. The meaning of things washes out. Or else, everything means the same thing, which is the same as saying it means nothing at all. Mr. Lancaster's bypass and Miss Fisher's dining habits register on us with the same emotional force. They are equally important, or equally trivial. The networks, meanwhile, are showing an increasing interest in duplicating the ''Entertainment Tonight'' format on other shows, although last week the independently produced ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' beat them to it. The program was put together by Robin Leach, who is a correspondent for ''Entertainment Tonight,'' and it was syndicated nationally in its fulsome two hours. It was supposed to be the first of four similar specials that Mr. Leach, who was also the chief reporter on the program, will do each year. ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' ranged from deferential to obsequious in the treatment of the many, many celebrities it presented. Liberace breathed the ''spirit of sincerity.'' Donald Sutherland was ''a Renaissance man.'' Michael Caine ''tells it like it is,'' and Susan Anton, when she visited China, ''turned the heads of a nation.'' On and on it went, and while it wasn't mean spirited, it did lead to stupefaction. Nothing meant anything, not even Meshulim Riklis saying that he loved to do Pia Zadora's laundry. On the other hand, it was supposed to mean something, and if it didn't, then what did? A young woman talking about killing her husband? That was preceded by pictures of Elizabeth Taylor and then it was interrupted by a commercial. The message is there is no message. What we see is what we see, and there is no point in thinking about any of it. Everything is all the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JUSTICE AIDE RESIGNS, DENOUNCING REAGAN VIEWS ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/23/us/justice-aide-resigns-denouncing-reagan-views-on-women-s-rights.html,"A Reagan appointee who had been working on the Administration's project to eliminate sex discrimination from Federal and state laws resigned today after assailing the project as ''a sham.'' Barbara Honegger, a special assistant in the Justice Department's civil rights division who had worked in the 1980 Reagan campaign and in the White House, said in an article published Sunday that she had become convinced that President Reagan did not care about women's rights. She said bureaucratic roadblocks and lack of interest in the Administration had so hobbled the effort to identify and propose changes in discriminatory Federal statutes that ''not a single law has been changed.'' Miss Honegger's article, in The Washington Post's opinion pages, also denounced the Administration's positions on other issues of concern to women, including its opposition to abortion and its recent brief urging the Supreme Court to narrow the coverage of a law barring sex discrimination in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Repeated efforts today to reach Miss Honegger for an interview proved unavailing. She did not answer the phone at her home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. Criticisms Are Disputed Moving to limit possible political damage to the Administration, a White House spokesman disputed Miss Honegger's criticisms and a Justice Department spokesman characterized her as a low-level functionary in a temporary appointment who had inflated the importance of her job and had unsuccessfully sought a more important position. Miss Honegger submitted a letter of resignation to Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, head of the civil rights division, effective today, according to Linda A. McCann, the department spokesman, apparently without waiting to see how her superiors would respond to her public criticism. The spokesman would not disclose the letter's contents. In her article, Miss Honegger said that Mr. Reagan ''has reneged on his commitment'' to root out Federal and state laws and regulations that discriminate against women. The Administration has referred to the project as an ''E.R.A. alternative'' and presented it as proof that Mr. Reagan's opposition to the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution did not mean that he was against equal rights for women. Action Is Applauded Feminist leaders applauded Miss Honegger's action. Kathy Wilson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, a Republican who denounced Mr. Reagan last month as ''a dangerous man'' on women's rights, said today that Miss Honegger had confirmed her view that the project to identify and amend laws that discriminate against women ''is a bumbling P.R. campaign at best.'' Before becoming disillusioned, Mrs. Wilson said, Miss Honegger ''told me a number of times that this President is really dedicated to equal rights for women.'' But later, Mrs. Wilson continued, Miss Honegger ''had a bird's eye view of the policymakers in the Administration and damns them with her view.'' While some career employees in the civil rights division have long complained that the Reagan Administration had cut back legal protections for women and members of minority groups, it is highly unusual for a political appointee like Miss Honegger to publicly assail the President she worked for. Miss Honegger said in her article that she had been ''project director of the Attorney General's Gender Discrimination Agency Review'' of Federal laws and regulations since she went to work for the Justice Department in the spring of 1982. A 'Technical' Aide But Linda McCann, the Justice Department spokesman, said today that Miss Honegger ''is not a project director,'' describing her rather as a ''technical'' aide whose job was ''feeding words into the computer and pulling the data out.'' She stressed that Miss Honegger, who is 35 years old, is not a lawyer, and that her temporary political appointment at the department had been due to expire at the end of September. She said she did not know Miss Honegger's salary, which was said to be $37,000 in various news reports. Larry Speakes, the chief White House spokesman, said the effort to eliminate discriminatory laws and regulations was ''not a sham.'' At his daily press briefing in California, where Mr. Reagan is vacationing, Mr. Speakes provided little detail on the project, but he said an interim report from the Justice Department listing discriminatory provisions was being studied by the White House staff and would be submitted to the Cabinet council on legal policy next month. White House Job From January 1981 to March 1982, Miss Honegger worked in the White House as special assistant to Martin Anderson, then Mr. Reagan's assistant for policy development. Dr. Anderson, now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University, said today that Miss Honegger ''was very intelligent and did an excellent job for me,'' and that her responsbilities included ''beginning the project of identifying Federal laws that discriminated against women'' in conjunction with others in the Administration. While noting that ''she gets her facts straight,'' Dr. Anderson would not comment on Miss Honegger's conclusion that this effort had proved to be a sham. Dr. Anderson said Miss Honegger had a graduate degree in parapsychology, the investigation of such psychic phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance, as well as a Stanford undergraduate degree with honors in creative writing and literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miss Reagan Is Hired As Adviser on Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/24/us/miss-reagan-is-hired-as-adviser-on-women.html,"President Reagan's spokesman confirmed today that Maureen Reagan, the President's daughter, had been hired by the Republican National Committee as a consultant to improve her father's image among women. Speaking to reporters as Mr. Reagan flew from Los Angeles to Seattle for a speech to an American Legion convention, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said: ''It's obvious from the polling there are some misconceptions out there among women about the President. That's exactly what we're trying to meet head-on.'' Mr. Speakes called Miss Reagan ''a good asset,'' adding that ''as the President's daughter, she'll have strong credibility'' in making speeches on her father's behalf. The newspaper USA Today reported that Miss Reagan, a 42-year-old former actress and talk show host, will work 80 hours a month. The newspaper said she talked with her father about the job six weeks ago. ''My father came to me and said 'I seem to have this problem, and I don't think I'm such a bad guy,' '' she told the newspaper. Miss Reagan was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat from California last year. She is a strong supporter of the equal rights amendment, which the President opposed, and of abortion rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOSTON'S MAYORAL RACE LULLS VOTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/27/us/boston-s-mayoral-race-lulls-voters.html,"At a forum for the city's nine mayoral candidates in an East Boston school Thursday night there were more campaign workers outside holding placards than there were people in the audience inside. It was a scene repeated many times this summer, as the candidates have struggled with a series of distractions that have left many of Boston's voters confused and indifferent. The distractions, which began with Mayor Kevin H. White's long indecision over whether to run again, appeared to have been finally settled last week when the State Legislature approved a two-week delay in the mayoral primary, scheduling the vote for Oct. 11. The delay was made necessary after a Federal judge ordered a change in the city's new system of district representation for the City Council and School Committee. But as the campaign approaches Labor Day, political analysts and the candidates themselves say the outcome is no clearer than it was months ago, with no certain favorites and no emotionally charged issues. 'Campaign Up for Grabs' ''It's like a marathon in which the runners have already passed Heartbreak Hill but in which no one has shot to the front or been carried off,'' said Robert R. Kiley, one of the candidates. He was referring to the steep grade near the end of the Boston Marathon where the winner often pulls away from the rest of the pack. ''The campaign is still up for grabs, more so than people think,'' remarked John Marttila, who has been conducting polls for the Coordinating Committee, a group of leading Boston businessmen and once served as Mayor White's campaign director. Although Mr. Marttila declined to comment on his latest poll, it is believed to show that none of the candidates has over 20 percent of the vote and that the gap between the top five candidates has narrowed in recent weeks. Many specialists estimate that with nine candidates running, it will take 20 percent to 25 percent of the vote to win one of the two places in the nonpartisan primary. The top two finishers in the primary compete against each other in the general election, which has been postponed by one week to Nov. 11 because of the court order. Five Leading Candidates At present, Mr. Marttila said, five candidates have a good chance to win a spot in the primary. The leader is David I. Finnegan, a former radio talk show host and School Committee president. He is followed by Raymond L. Flynn, a member of the City Council; Melvin H. King, a black former State Representative; Dennis J. Kearney, the Suffolk County Sheriff, and Lawrence S. DiCara, a former City Councillor. The remaining candidates are Michael Gelber, a follower of the conservative activist Lyndon H. LaRouche; Eloise Linger, of the Socialist Workers Party, and Frederick Langone, a longtime member of the City Council. Many voters have not yet focused on the election because of all the distractions, Mr. Marttila said, noting that the top three candidates now have been the three that were already the best known. Even the weather has conspired against the candidates, with Boston's best summer in years keeping many voters at the beach or in the mountains. But Mr. Marttila said he expects a more exciting race after Labor Day, as the candidates wage ''a very aggressive campaign with lots of street activity.'' ''Boston loves the stuff, like the Red Sox,'' he said. With such a close race and the number of undecided voters, a critical factor may be the endorsement of The Boston Globe, the city's dominant newspaper, Mr. Marttila suggested. The Globe, which takes a liberal editorial stance, is thought to be leaning toward Mr. Flynn or Mr. DiCara. One Candidate Is Enigma Unlike other elections here in recent years, racial tensions have not been an issue, and with the exception of Mr. Finnegan, all the top candidates are moderate to liberal. Mr. Finnegan's position is harder to assay. Articulate and confident, Mr. Finnegan comes from a family of Irish- American politicians. One brother is the state auditor. He has built on his family ties to develop a large and well- financed campaign organization. Earlier in the summer he was the acknowledged leader, winning 24 percent in public opinion polls, compared to 15 percent for Mr. Flynn, his closest competitor. But he has slipped recently as several candidates have criticized his assertion that Boston is in good financial condition and will not face a budget deficit or need new taxes. His opponents and some city officials predict that Boston faces a deficit of $30 million to $40 million for the fiscal year 1984 and up to $100 million the next year, with the city's problem compounded by its inability to raise property taxes by a new state law. Mr. Finnegan's optimism about the deficit and the lack of need for new taxes has been compared with the stance of President Reagan. Mr. Finnegan was also caught on the unpopular side of one of the most widely debated issues - how to revive the city's decaying neighborhoods. At first he rejected but has now embraced a call for requiring developers of new office buildings in the prosperous downtown business district to contribute to revitalizing old housing stock in the neighborhoods. Champion of Working Poor All the candidates have promised to improve the city's troubled public schools and tackle the crime problem. Mr. Flynn's campaign has shown the most momentum, although he is short of money. In the course of Boston's school busing crisis in 1974, Mr. Flynn was an outspoken opponent of busing to achieve desegregation and introduced a bill in the Legislature to abolish compulsory education as a way to circumvent the problem. Mr. Flynn has also been a strong opponent of abortion. But Mr. Flynn, a 43-year-old native of conservative South Boston, has emerged as a populist champion of the working poor. He has put together a coalition of labor unions, tenants' organizations and community activists, and some people believe he could prove to be a bridge between the city's white and black communities. Liberal Vote Is Split Mr. Flynn is one of several candidates who are expected to split the liberal vote and particularly cut into the support for Mr. King, the only black in the race. The large liberal field has also hurt Mr. Kiley, a former head of the city's transit authority who is regarded as a strong administrator and a favorite of the affluent, well-educated community in the Back Bay and Beacon Hill. Unlike past Boston elections, the candidates have avoided personal attacks on each other, making for a lack of drama but a high tone. Although Mayor White's decision in May not to run again dominated all election talk, he has rapidly become the forgotten man, and there are few questions about the corruption problem that dogged him, the candidates say. Even a report that Mr. White is trying to get 1,500 City Hall employees, including many of the Mayor's aides, transferred to permanent state jobs before he leaves office has not provoked an outcry from the candidates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CARDINAL COOKE IS TERMINALLY ILL WITH LEUKEMIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/27/nyregion/cardinal-cooke-is-terminally-ill-with-leukemia.html,"Terence Cardinal Cooke, the Archbishop of New York, is terminally ill with leukemia and could die within months, the archdiocese announced yesterday. The Cardinal does not plan to resign as the spiritual leader of 1.8 million Roman Catholics in the metropolitan area, a position he has held since 1968, a spokesman for the archdiocese said. The Cardinal is also Military Vicar for Roman Catholics in the nation's armed forces. ''The prognosis is that the disease is terminal,'' the spokesman, the Rev. Peter Finn, said. ''It's severe and it's moving quickly.'' Health 'Deteriorated Seriously' The statement by Father Finn, who is director of communications for the archdiocese, came after the archdiocese announced that the 62-year-old Cardinal was suffering from ''acute secondary leukemia complicated by a chronic lymphoma condition'' and that his health had ''deteriorated seriously.'' The Cardinal could live ''for several months or a much shorter time if serious complications set in,'' Father Finn said. The announcement said that Cardinal Cooke was taking the news of his illness ''with faith and peace of soul.'' It said that Pope John Paul II, who stayed at the Cardinal's chancery residence during his visit to the United States in 1979, had been informed of the situation. The Cardinal, according to the announcement, has been confined to his residence in the chancery behind St. Patrick's Cathedral, where he continues to oversee the operations of the archdiocese. Father Finn emphasized that the Cardinal was ''lucid'' and determined to remain as Archbishop over a diocese that consists of Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and 10 upstate counties. Doctors have treated the Cardinal for myelo-monoblastic leukemia and will continue to do so, the archdiocese said. Father Finn said that the Cardinal was experiencing ''some discomfort'' but had been ''an inspiration to all of us around him.'' Though restricted to his bed and a nearby chair, the Cardinal has met daily with his two principal aides, Bishop Joseph O'Keefe, the vicar general, and Msgr. Joseph P. Murphy, the archdiocesan chancellor, in an effort to keep up with church business. Scores of well-wishers voiced their support and prayers for the Cardinal. Governor Cuomo said in a statement, ''I join all New Yorkers - Catholics, Protestants and Jews - in praying for the Cardinal's recovery, and part of my prayer is a thanksgiving for the years he has served the people of New York, preaching, leading, healing.'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said: ''This is a time for prayer. There is not a man in New York who would be so much missed.'' The Cardinal was treated surgically for cancer of the lymph glands in 1964 and began suffering from lymphoma in 1975. Since 1974, he has suffered from malaria. Tests Earlier This Week The first news of the Cardinal's latest health problems was carried last week by Catholic New York, the archdiocesan weekly newspaper. The report said the Cardinal had been stricken with a severe urinary tract infection and would be forced to curtail his schedule. At that point, doctors believed medication and rest would correct the ailment. Tests conducted earlier this week produced the more serious diagnosis. The ruddy-faced, cheerful Archbishop became the youngest Cardinal in the world when he received the traditional red hat from Pope Paul VI in 1969 at age of 48. The previous year, he had been the choice to succeed Francis Cardinal Spellman as the seventh archbishop of New York since the see was founded in 1808. He had served Cardinal Spellman as secretary, chancellor and vicar general. The two churchmen were friends and regular dinner companions. A Heavy Workload Cardinal Cooke has carried a heavy workload and, his aides say, has given unstinting attention and energy to the multiplicity of duties that go with running a sprawling archdiocese, the fourth largest in the country in the number of Catholics. The Cardinal has consistently borne witness to the needs of the poor, a concern that was kindled early in his life. He pursued a master's degree in social work after finishing his seminary training and then taught at the Fordham School of Social Work. In 1957, the young priest was named Cardinal Spellman's personal secretary, and in 1965 he was ordained an Auxiliary Bishop. In the process, he became well schooled in the complex workings of the archdiocese and combined administrative talents with interest in those trapped by poverty and injustice. He was installed as Archbishop of New York in St. Patrick's Cathedral on April 4, 1968, the same day the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain in Memphis. The new Archbishop besought his listeners that day to approach poverty and racial tensions in ''a spirit of love'' and vowed to help the needy both spiritually and materially. Two Challenging Issues His position as a leading world Catholic prelate has required him to be an international figure, but the undiminished twang in his voice clearly identifies him everywhere as a true son of New York. Aides say he is most comfortable in New York and is devoted to its welfare. Two issues have posed challenges to the Cardinal in recent months. One was his role in this year's St. Patrick's Day Parade. The parade committee picked as grand marshal a supporter of the Irish Republican Army. The Cardinal, while strongly committed to the parade as a religious and folk tradition, was firmly opposed to the militant policies of the I.R.A. His response was to condemn violence and to remain inside St. Patrick's as the grand marshal passed. The second matter concerned the Pastoral Letter on War and Peace issued in May by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The letter strongly condemns nuclear war, accepts nuclear deterrence only as a step toward disarmament and calls for the concept of a nuclear freeze. Some aspects of the letter went farther than Cardinal Cooke preferred in opposing nuclear weapons. As Military Vicar, moreover, he met some Catholics in the armed services who believed that the bishops were undercutting their military roles. Longstanding Attitudes' The Cardinal responded by cautioning them against getting ''the unfortunate and misleading impression that the church does not appreciate your sacrifices and service as peacemakers.'' He balanced that assurance with the statement that the pastoral letter does raise questions ''about longstanding attitudes on war and peace.'' Over the years, the Cardinal has cultivated a broad variety of associations with leaders in many fields and, largely by dint of his personality and ecclesiastical standing, has gained access to a wide cross section of the city's civic and political life. He has remained aloof from partisan politics and rarely has inserted himself in urban squabbles. On questions such as abortion, he has been forceful and outspoken in opposition. In the subtle areas between church and state, he has been the quiet voice behind the scenes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 Vie for Seats in New Minority Districts,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/nyregion/5-vie-for-seats-in-new-minority-districts.html,"ERNEST S. DAVIS is the Assessor for the City of Mount Vernon. An architect by profession and a Democrat by party, Mr. Davis, who is 45 years old, says he spent the first of his 23 years in Mount Vernon ""staying out of local politics."" James A. Dickerson, a Republican, is a real estate broker who has lived for 59 of his 60 years in the county's fourth-largest city. He describes himself as an ""activist"" when it comes to Mount Vernon, its politics and the issues that affect its residents. On Nov. 8, kone of these two men could make history by becoming the first black to be elected to the county's Board of Legislators, which was created 13 years ago. The two are vying for the seat in the newly created 13th District -- one of two ""minority districts"" created by the Board during reapportionment. In the other minority district, the 16th in southwest Yonkers, Hermank Keith is hoping that the winner in the 13th will have to share the historic distinction with him. Mr. Keith, a black who received the Democratic Party nomination, is facing a primary fight Sept. 13 against Basil N. Apostle for the chance to run against William Ryff, the Republican candidate. The two races are considered significant in their political implications. They may show, for example, whether minority voters in the county will turn out in large numbers when there are viable black candidates. The races will also reflect how well black candidates can do in raising funds, gathering endorsements and in attracting white votes. The results, according to some political observors, could influence the political careers and ambitions of other potential minority candidates in the county. Although race is a factor in both districts, the candidates have strongly played down the racial issue in their campaigns. Mr. Keith, president of the Yonkers branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, believes that of the three blacks running for county legislative seats, he can least afford to be identified as a ""black candidate."" He noted that the 16th District's 50,298 residents, 37 percent are black and 21 percent are of Hispanic origin. Of about 17,000 registered voters, 9,000 are Democrats and 4,500 Republicans. ""Forty-two percent of my constituents are white,"" he said. ""The 16th is a multiethnic community of Jews, Italians, Polish, Hispanics and Arabs. If you're going to represent them and what affects them, you can't place the concerns of one ethnic group over those of another."" Both of Mr. Keith's opponents, who are white, Basil Apostle have said that race will not be made an issue in the campaign. But Mr. Apostle, a 45-year-old lawyer who was the first to enter the race in the new district, charged that some members within the Democratic Party ""allowed race to dictate their choice in nominating Mr. Keith."" ""They felt that because this was cast as a minority district, the party had to put up a minority candidate,"" said Mr. Apostle, who sought and won support from 21 of 36 Democratic district leaders to force a primary. ""I felt the party should look for the best possible candidate in deciding who to endorse."" Nevertheless, Mr. Apostle, whose campaign workers include his wife, Victoria, and son, Alexander, said he would focus his campaign on issues. ""I'm asking people to look at my record of service to the community,"" said Mr. Apostle, who made a losing bid for county legislator in 1979 in a race against Leonard N. Spano and also opposed Bruce Caputo in a losing bid for a State Assembly seat, ""I think I'm the better qualified of the candidates, and I represent a broader constituency than either Mr. Keith or Mr. Ryff,"" he said. Mr. Ryff, at 38 the youngest of the three candidates, readily acknowledges that ""very little"" separates the three men. He pointed out that all three were active participants in fighting the county on the Ludlow Park sewage-treatment plant, which forced the county to consult with the community on changes and modifications that might be made at the facility."" ""We all have active records of community service,"" he said during an interview at his home on Franklin Avenue, just across the street from where Mr. Keith lives. ""I know Herman and Basil. We're all friends. The way I see it, the benefactors of this race will be the people in the 16th District."" Mr. Ryff, a businessman who lives with his wife, Malene, and two sons, says he isn't worried about the racial composition of the district or the fact that Democrats outnumber Republicans. ""Yonkers residents have shown that they don't necessarily vote along party lines,"" he said, noting that although Democrats outnumber Republicans citywide, the Mayor, the majority on the City Council and all four incumbent county legislators are Republicans. The 46-year-old Mr. Keith, who lost his bid for the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination to Peter L. DiAferia this year, says he ""isn't sure"" whether being black would ""help or hurt him"" in the campaign. ""I've stepped on a lot of toes,"" he said, with a smile, adding that the housing- and school-segregation suit now being tried in Federal Court was initiated by the N.A.A.C.P. under his presidency. ""But I think if anyone looks back, they will see that everything I've done has been for the betterment of the city."" Mr. Keith, who has a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics, lives with his wife, Gail, and 6-year-old son, Jamaal. He says that a low turnout in the primary could determine his winning or losing the nomination. ""My success will depend on a large turnout among minorities,"" he said. ""There's no question that a good turnout could help me."" Meanwhile, the race in the 13th District, one of two districts representing Mount Vernon, appears to be a closely contested battle between two well-known and well-liked candidates. The district, formerly represented by Greg Young, a Democrat, who lost his job as a result of the geographic reapportionment, has a population of 51,458 -- 61 percent of whom are black and 5 percent of Hispanic origin. Of 19,489 registered voters, Democrats outnumber Republicans, 10,605 to 4,426. Mr. Davis, a former Buildings Commissioner in Mount Vernon, said he was running on his record of service to the city. Under his leadership, he noted, the first female Buildings Inspector was appointed, the position of Elevator Inspector was created and a training program for new inspectors was initiated. ""My background as an architect and as Buildings Commissioner and Assessor will be an added asset on the County Board,"" he said in explaining why he had chosen to run. ""I've been in the political process for seven years. I have the qualifications to do the job and be of service to the people of Mount Vernon."" Although he said he had not yet developed a platform, Mr. Davis said he favored the creation of a Department of Labor in county government -- a concept first put forward by Ogden Reid, the Democratic candidate for County Executive -- and would work to change the city's ""negative perception, by projecting Mount Vernon in a positive way."" Mr. Dickerson also said he was running on his record of service to the community, and stressed that it was a record ""of voluntary service, not paid."" ""I was on the Commission of Human Rights, Urban Renewal, Housing Task force and the Youth Advisory Council,"" he said, ticking off a list of his involvements. ""I've given myself to the community, not as a paid person, but a volunteer."" Mr. Dickerson, who made an unsuccessful bid two years ago for the 17th District legislative seat in Mount Vernon, losing to John A. DeRario, said that if Mount Vernon residents had not ""voted along party lines,"" he would have won that election. But he now believes that his Republican affiliation ""is something voters should think about in choosing a candidate."" He explained: ""First, the Board is Republican-dominated and I doubt that will change. Second, with Andy O'Rourke in as County Executive, which I expect he will be, that will give me and the people of this District a one-two punch -- someone working for them on the eighth floor and a friend on the ninth,"" he said, referring to the County Office Building. Neither candidate expects that being the first black to serve as a legislator in the county will result in any added pressure placed on them. On countywide issues, Mr. Dickerson said he favors legislation requiring doctors to notify the parents of girls under 18 who are seeking abortions; Mr. Davis said he could not support such a broad-based bill, unless certain provisions were included to take into consideration teen-agers who are supported themselves. On Indian Point, both agreed that the plant should remain closed until it is deemed safe or until an evacuation plan is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Fiscally, both men described themselves as ""moderates,"" who would seek to hold down spending but not at the expense of social programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1983 MARCH: LEFT REVIVES; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/29/us/1983-march-left-revives-news-analysis.html,"The significance of the civil rights march Saturday that drew more than 200,000 to the Lincoln Memorial went far beyond a commemoration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision for America two decades ago, according to a range of participants and outside observers. The diverse outpouring of Americans from across the nation was evidence of a revival of the activist left since Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980; it was an affirmation of the formation of new coalitions of groups - labor, blacks, Hispanic Americans, women, antinuclear activists and environmentalists, among others - that have frequently been at odds in recent years. It was also seen as an indication that poor blacks may not be quite so isolated from the rest of the nation as their failure to make economic progress over the past 20 years suggests. This was underlined by the presence of thousands of nonblack demonstrators who traveled hundreds of miles to Washington to bear witness with the blacks. And finally, it was a belated vindication of Dr. King's tactic of nonviolence and reconciliation, which in 1963 was being challenged by a number of black organizations that subsequently splintered and disappeared in the waves of urban riots that swept the cities. Many former leaders and members of those organizations joined Saturday's march to honor his memory. The black cause had not been so visible since the mid-1960's. In that period antiwar, environmental, women's, Hispanic, consumer and other movements were coming to the fore, and civil rights organizations, having achieved most of the laws they sought, slipped toward the background. New Organizations Involved Yet the consensus Saturday was that black organizations alone could never have organized such a march. As Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta points out, the 1963 march was a spontaneous outpouring of protest by blacks and whites against the violent resistance that the civil rights movement had been meeting across the South. Saturday's march, he said, was the result of organization by a range of interest groups on the national, regional and local levels that did not exist 20 years ago. Those groups, acting in coalitions formed in response to Reagan conservatism, began to show their strength last year. They were in a large sense responsible for the nuclear freeze demonstrations in the winter and spring of 1982 that caught official Washington by surprise. The coalitions on the left also have shown strength in elections. Organizing at the grass roots, they were able to turn out enough votes to oust a number of conservatives in Congress, state legislatures, city halls and county seats. Black and Hispanic adults registered and voted in record numbers in many areas, resulting in a surge of minority-group officeholders, including the Governor of New Mexico, Toney Anaya, and the Mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington. It was many of those same coalitions, operating in more than 350 communities, that recruited Saturday's marchers and thus set the tone for the speeches and slogans. So many causes were advocated that the event seemed unfocused except for one aspect: It was almost universally anti-Reagan. Hooks Tells It in Old Style The Rev. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one of the few speakers employing the old- fashioned preaching style that galvanized audiences in the 1960's, framed it in an emotional cadence: ''We are here because we are committed to the elimination of Reaganism from the face of the earth. We have had enough of it. Reagan no more in 1984. Reagan no more.'' The President has become the symbol if not the cause of many of the participants' troubles. Organized labor, seeing its base of high-paying industrial jobs in decline before and after the Reagan election, has been seeking and finding new allies. So has the women's movement in the wake of its loss on an equal rights amendment to the Constitution, the peace movement in its most recent concerns about nuclear destruction, and the environmental movement in its fears that efforts at economic survival may wipe out what it has gained in the last decade. Republicans Out of Picture And although it is too early to say what the coalitions on the left may do for the divided Democratic Party and its candidates, their efforts are almost all focused in that direction. Mr. Reagan's capturing of the Republican nomination and the decline in the influence of Republican moderates has resulted in leaving the activist left almost entirely to the Democrats. One of the ironies of the weekend march was that the party that once stood for black rights was a presence in the proceedings only as a perceived opponent. What effect, if any, the march itself may have on events is uncertain. Marches have become routine in Washington and are easily forgotten as events change and new issues emerge. Differences that split coalitions in the 1960's and 70's still exist. For example, there is the argument between blacks and Jews over whether there should be hiring goals or quotas for minority- group workers, or there are the conflicts about which goals should be at the top of the national agenda. Blacks themselves have become torn on whether big government programs are their answer to economic security. For all of its success on civil rights laws, the black movement has never been able to deal effectively with the question of economic gains for a large section of the black community. Dr. King, long before he was killed in Memphis in 1968, said economic equality was by far the most difficult goal to obtain and since then a succession of black leaders have agreed. And there is always the possibility, some who have watched developments pointed out, that the intensity of the left might cause a backlash on the right, just as it did in the 1970's when the ''new right'' organized around such issues as abortion, busing to achieve school desegregation and prayer in the schools. No Longer So Divided Yet the black movement showed Saturday that it was not so divided as it was in 1963 on tactics. At the height of the civil rights protests, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality, among others, favored abandoning the King tactics of nonviolent protest and Dr. King spent much of his energy trying to reconcile those groups with such traditional ones as the Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P. On Saturday, the overriding message from leader after leader was to organize and vote. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Chicago leader, for example, used a Biblical metaphor to tell the crowd: ''The regressive Reagan machine won because David did not use all his political rocks and did not pick up his slingshot. David had unused rocks just lying around.'' Many black leaders disagree sharply over whether it would be wise for Mr. Jackson to run for President, as he has indicated he might, rather than to align the black vote behind a friendly white candidate. Yet there was no call to radicalism and virtually no disagreement that the black protest should be directed chiefly through political organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/29/us/briefing-129623.html,"Fight Over Charity On Wednesday, the nine-member national eligibility committee for the Combined Federal Campaign will hold a public hearing in the auditorium of the Office of Personnel Management and hear requests from groups seeking financial support from the Government equivalent of United Way. Nothing very controversial or exciting there, right? Wrong. This otherwise obscure proceeding is certain to be the scene of at least two pitched battles, over abortion and compulsory unionism, and to rekindle a dispute over how the Government should distribute the $100 million in charitable contributions it collects annually from its employees. Planned Parenthood is going to try to demonstrate that it meets new, tighter eligibility requirements for sharing in the Combined Federal Campaign, to which 2.2 million civil service workers contributed last year. A group of militant antiabortion activists plans to protest any inclusion of Planned Parenthood and to show a film that one of them called ''pretty heavy stuff.'' A similar collision is expected between representatives of organized labor and the National Right to Work Committee, which opposes any sort of contracts that require employees to join unions. The committee was approved for a share of funds last year for the first time, and several unions asked their members to boycott the charitable operation altogether. In an effort to deny participation in the fund to groups mainly engaged in politics, the new regulations restrict eligibility to nonprofit tax-exempt charitable groups that provide ''direct and substantial health and welfare and other appropriate national voluntary services'' to their beneficiaries. Blacks for Reagan The picture on television will be similar - black faces framed by the pillars of the Lincoln Memorial - but the message will be very different. Where leaders of the Washington march denounced the Reagan Administration Saturday, on Tuesday the National Conservative Political Action Committee is to present the first recruits for ''Blacks for Reagan,'' a group of sports and entertainment personalities who are supporting the committee's independent campaign for the President's re-election. Craig Shirley, a N.C.P.A.C. spokesman, said the news conference would provide ''an opportunity to respond to the diatribes against President Reagan'' that were part of the weekend demonstration. Among the black celebrities who are to participate are Mabel King, a stage and screen actress, and Joe Profit, a former halfback for the Atlanta Falcons who is now in the advertising business. The conservative group's campaign in support of the President, who has not yet announced that he will run again, was originally budgeted at $5 to $6 million but may reach $10 million, Mr. Shirley said. A Message From Walesa The Ethics and Public Policy Center here has given the Shelby Collum Davis Award for ''outstanding public service marked by integrity and courage'' to Lech Walesa, the Polish union leader. An acceptance message that the center says was ''smuggled out of Poland'' is to be read at a presentation dinner in New York City in October. Mr. Davis, donor of the award, is an investment banker and former Ambassador to Switzerland. The Vote Under Study Most major Washington conferences make a routine try to get the President as a speaker and settle happily for a Cabinet officer or two. The most prestigious or well-placed may succeed in having the President drop by for a few words. Now comes a symposium so imposing that it has already enlisted two Presidents as participants and may wind up attracting two more, which pretty well exhausts the supply. From Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 at the Smithsonian Institution, Harvard's Kennedy School of Goverment and the American Broadcasting Company will conduct a conference on ''Voting for Democracy.'' Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter have already signed up for a joint appearance. Ronald Reagan is a possible participant depending on his schedule, and organizers still believe they have a chance of persuading Richard Nixon to accept his invitation. Some 40 public officials, scholars and journalists are to take part in discussions on voter turnout that will weigh changes in registration procedures, voting hours, candidates' access to broadcast time and provision by the news media of campaign and election night information. ABC says it hopes to weave part of the material into a television documentary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIBERTARIAN PARTY OPENS PARLEY TO PICK 1984 SLATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/us/libertarian-party-opens-parley-to-pick-1984-slate.html,"Without bands, banners and bunting, the unorthodox Libertarian Party quietly opened its weeklong national convention here yesterday in an unorthdox fashion, with two men debating abortion before an audience of fewer than 75 party members. Like their counterparts in the major political parties, Libertarian delegates will be selecting Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, adopting a platform, electing national officers and debating various issues. There will even be the familiar state standards identifying the various delegations when the full sessions of the convention begin Thursday in the ballroom of the Sheraton Centre Hotel. But, unlike the major parties, there will be no national anthems or pledges of allegience. ''Government should be kept at arm's length,'' said Gary Greenberg, the convention coordinator. Nor will there be opening prayers. The only music will be heard Saturday when the candidates are nominated. There will be no shortage of talk, however, including classes on economics and tax seminars that may make the convention tax deductible, according to a convention brochure. About 700 delegates are expected to attend the convention, but party officials say many will not arrive until the full sessions begin. Potential Candidate Drops Out The early acknowledged front-runner for the party's Presidential nomination, Gene Burns, the host of a radio talk show in Orlando, Fla., has dropped out, telling party leaders that they could not raise enough money for a serious campaign. David Bergland, a soft-spoken lawyer from Costa Mesa, Calif., who was the party's Vice Presidential candidate in 1976, is the new leader. But party leaders say they expect a challenge by Earl Ravenal, a Georgetown University professor, and James E. Norwood, a retired Air Force officer from Waco, Tex. Like major party leaders, they are hoping to drum up attendance and interest with a contest. One major qualification for the Vice Presidential candidate is independent wealth so he can help finance the national ticket, party leaders said. Three years ago ''our very generous Vice Presidential candidate,'' David Koch, a New York businessman who is not related to the Mayor, contributed $2 million of the $3.2 million spent in behalf of a ticket headed by Edward Clark, a Los Angeles lawyer. Mr. Clark and his wife, Alicia, the party's national chairman, are in effect the political ''ma and pa'' of the laissez-faire party, which believes that the less government there is, the better off people are. This even extends to the point of contracting private police and fire services and opposing antidrug legislation as restricting freedom. Mr. Clark polled 920,000 votes in 1980 out of a total of more than 86.5 million votes cast. The party was on the ballot in every state, as against 33 states in 1976, when it received 172,750 votes, and two states in 1972, when the party polled 5,000 votes a year after it was founded. No Plans to Run Again Mr. Clark, interviewed as he filled out a registration card in a decidedly unbustling meeting room at Sheraton Centre, said he was not interested in running again. ''The party ought not to be closely tied to one man,'' said the 53- year-old Harvard Law School graduate, whose casual appearance and quiet manner made him seem more like a tourist than a radical politician. The more animated Mrs. Clark, who is also 53, saw the admittedly hopeless Presidential campaign as ''a means of educating American voters, letting them know our ideas.'' She said the party also hoped to run candidates in as many as half the 435 Congressional districts. She said the party had about 30 elected officials nationwide, including only one in the tristate area, Dick Siano, a New Jersey township official. Mrs. Clark said she did not know the name of the township. The party says it has 7,000 dues-paying members around the nation, with almost 1,500 in California and about 2,000 in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area, according to Mr. Greenberg, who ran for Governor of New York in 1978 on the Libertarian ticket. He said most members were white, younger than 40 and a good number of them were professionals. The Libertarians want to drastically reduce government, including the military. They would bring all United States troops home, abolish taxes and rely on voluntary contributions. Government is viewed as a restriction on individual freedom. ''We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual,'' the party's statement of principles asserts. ''Governments throughout history have regularly operated on the opposite principle, that the state has the right to dispose of the lives of individuals and the fruits of their labor.'' Both major parties are cast as proponents of that view. Why is the convention so early and so long? Mr. Greenberg said the party needed all the time it could get to qualify its candidates around the country and to raise funds. As for the weeklong session with the main events scheduled for Thursday through Sunday, Mr. Greenberg said the party hoped to encourage attendance by promoting a combined vacation and convention. A banquet, a cabaret and a Brooklyn Bridge party and show are among the lighter side events. Yesterday's session included, in addition to the abortion debate, a platform committee panel and debates on tax credits and foreign policy. The major parties have four-day conventions next summer. But, their delegates manage to mix, more noisily, more convention pleasure with less convention business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FRIENDS SAY FEMINIST HEROINE IS SINCERE IF ECCENTRIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/us/friends-say-feminist-heroine-is-sincere-if-eccentric.html,"When Barbara Honegger denounced President Reagan's commitment to equal rights for women as a ''sham'' and resigned from the Justice Department last week, she became an instant heroine to some women's rights groups. But some of her new allies have winced as Miss Honegger has linked her beliefs about women's rights to her beliefs about the occult and the supernatural. ''It adds an element that distracts, detracts, from the substance of her original statement, but the substance holds,'' said a leader of a national women's organization who asked that she not be identified. Miss Honegger, who is 35 years old, has been held up to ridicule by Reagan Administration officials who have portrayed her as a person of small consequence, frivolous, not to be taken seriously. She retorts that this a baseless and desperate attempt to discredit her. Some of Miss Honegger's remarks in recent days have combined with the aspersions cast by Reagan aides to raise the question of whether her judgment is credible. In a recent interview, she said she knew how she wanted to be remembered: ''As the person who, through a coincidence of training, skill and fate, made the difference in the future of America - and particularly of American women.'' Unusual Spiritual Guidance As passionately as she has been a student of politics, Miss Honegger is also a dedicated student of the occult, her friends say. She was widely quoted last week as having said that supernatural influences had guided her course, marking her as destined to have an impact on the Reagan Administration and on women's rights. One of these influences, according to an article in The Los Angeles Times, was ''a source'' using her voice that told her that she would become a defender of women's rights in the Reagan Administration. Another article said she had written of ''omens of power'' in Mr. Reagan's ascension. Miss Honegger denied these accounts and said she never referred to ''a source'' or to ''omens.'' But while making these denials, she also said that she was indeed influenced by an unusual spiritual dynamic. ''I feel like a catalyst,'' she said in a recent interview. ''I am honored to have been used by the Force, if you will, with a capital F, like in 'Star Wars.' That's how I feel. You know, the Zeitgeist of history.'' Mentor Praises Her Work Miss Honegger went to the White House as special assistant to Martin Anderson, whom Mr. Reagan picked from the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University to be the Presidential assistant for policy development. Miss Honegger had been his research assistant. ''She demonstrated very good judgment,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''She did extraordinarily good work, was accurate, precise.'' There was never any case, he said, for complaint about her character. Miss Honegger was close friends at the White House with Douglas Bandow, a former special assistant to the President for policy development who is now editor of Inquiry magazine. ''She's a bright, engaging person who can get very committed to some issues,'' Mr. Bandow said. Her cause was women's rights, and she claims credit as the author of the Reagan Administration's proposed review of discriminatory laws as its alternative to a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights. A spokesman at the Justice Department, which Miss Honegger joined early last year, accused her of exaggerating her role, labeling her ''a low- level Munchkin.'' The President's spokesman, Larry Speakes, referred to her as ''the Easter Bunny at the White House Easter Egg Roll.'' But Mr. Bandow backed Miss Honegger's version, crediting her with originating the alternative. ''Even in the White House, she was always outspoken on her views about abortion and the E.R.A.,'' Mr. Bandow said. ''When you disagree with the President's position, it's not the usual fare to let people know.'' Earned Reputation as Eccentric Miss Honegger also was outspoken about her interest in parapsychology and coincidences. She earned a reputation in the White House as being ''somewhat odd,'' according to Mr. Bandow. As an example, he said, she wrote a manuscript discussing the significance of a particular grouping of three stars on events in the campaign. Mr. Bandow said this ''eccentricity'' did not appear to diminish people's regard for her work. Elizabeth H. Dole, the Secretary of Transportation and a defender of his policies on women, was for a time Miss Honegger's boss when Mrs. Dole was assistant to the President for public liaison. In a letter of recommendation made public by Miss Honegger, Mrs. Dole praised Miss Honegger's job skills and said she was ''a delightful person with whom to work.'' 'Claims Are Overblown' Mr. Bandow said he does not doubt the sincerity of Miss Honegger's beliefs, but he questioned the validity of her accusations. ''She's somebody who was sincerely disaffected but whose claims are overblown,'' he said. ''A lot of what happened to her project is just bureaucratic; it's not that the White House doesn't care about women.'' Mr. Bandow asserted that when Miss Honegger moved from the White House to the Justice Department, she found people paying less attention to her, a situation he said a person more experienced in government might have realized happens all the time. ''She attributed it to attitudes toward women's issues, but not so,'' he said. ''When you work at the White House, people pay attention to what you say more. It's easy to mix those up.'' But a friend of Miss Honegger's from college, Suzanne Guyette, disagreed. ''If you're jaded, you say, 'Well, it's just the system,' but if you're innocent, you want to do something about it,'' she said. ''It's refreshing to get somebody like Barbara who says, 'Wait, this is not the way it's supposed to work.' '' Accused Former Employer Miss Honegger had earlier rallied against what she perceived as sexual discrimination and won. It happened in 1975 when she was working as a medical school secretary at Stanford. She charged her boss, Karl Pribram, a psychiatrist, with mistreatment, alleging that he struck her in the head with his fist and that she was denied a job rank she was entitled to. Following an investigation, the university lowered Dr. Pribram's salary by $3,000, put him on two years' probation and paid Miss Honegger an $8,000 out-of-court settlement. A mediator also ordered a cash award to her for back pay. After that she was unable to find other work at Stanford until Mr. Anderson hired her, said Williamson Evers, a campus friend of Miss Honegger. ''She felt she was mistreated and she stood up, and we're seeing the same thing,'' Mr. Evers said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Abortion Notice Law Thrown Out on Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/31/us/around-the-nation-abortion-notice-law-thrown-out-on-appeal.html,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit today barred enforcement of an Indiana law requiring doctors to notify parents before performing abortions on minors. The court said the state requirement itself was constitutional, but there were insufficient legal provisions for mature girls who want the rule waived. The measure went into effect Sept. 1, 1982. It requires parents be advised 24 hours in advance of a daughter's abortion if she is under 18. Specifically, today's ruling said the law fails to provide for appointment of a lawyer to represent a daughter seeking a waiver of the notification provision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOSES FUND DRIVE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/us/planned-parenthood-loses-fund-drive-vote.html,"A Federal committee, heeding the arguments of anti-abortion activists, ruled today that Planned Parenthood should not be included in the Federal employees' charity fund. The recommendation could be overturned by Donald Devine, director of the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the money raised annually through voluntary payroll deductions for Federal workers. Last year, Mr. Devine did overrule the eligibility committee's decision and reinstated Planned Parenthood under a Federal court order stating that advocacy groups could participate in the fund. The eligibility committee of the Combined Federal Campaign, a Federal workers' joint charity appeal resembling the United Way, voted 7 to 2 against including Planned Parenthood after a debate by anti-abortion and abortion- rights activists. Committee Mood Hinted Just before today's vote, the chairman, Betty Brake, signaled the tone of the committee, saying, ''Anything so controversial cannot further the interest of the campaign.'' The decision came as a Federal court across town approved a Planned Parenthood suit seeking to be placed in the ''international services'' category of the fund campaign. It was not immediately clear what effect the court decision would have on today's eligibility ruling. The anti-abortion advocates at the committee meeting said Planned Parenthood had failed to meet financial and other criteria required to be among those benefiting from Federal worker payroll deductions. The campaign raises about $100 million annually from Federal employees and disperses it to about 180 charities, including such groups as the Heart Fund, the Lung Association and the Multiple Sclerosis Association. Pressure on Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood has been on the list since 1968, but has come under increasing fire because of its advocacy of birth control and the right to have an abortion. Of its $27 million annual budget, Planned Parenthood received about $500,000 last year from Federal campaign donations. ''Their international activities are paid for exclusively and wholly by Federal funds, so what they are doing is misrepresenting themselves,'' said Jim Bopp, of the national council for the Right to Life Committee. ''What they are involved with is essentially a deception.'' The president of Planned Parenthood, Faye Wattleton, argued that her group did not favor abortion but did not favor limiting a woman's options in the event of unwanted pregnancy. Desperate Struggle Seen ''I don't know anyone who is pro- abortion,'' she said. Anti-abortion groups attack her organization because it advocates family planning, she said, adding that attacks on her group's participation in the campaign ''are a part of a desperate struggle by the anti- abortion minority to undermine the work of Planned Parenthood.'' Barry Wood of the Citizens for Moral Decency said Planned Parenthood was actually responsible for the growing number of teen-age pregnancies because it provided contraceptives to teen-agers. ''I think we'd all agree that sexual intercourse is a major cause of pregnancy,'' Mr. Wood said. ''Planned Parenthood is encouraging sexual activity by counseling teen-agers. They provide free foam to girls, and they have condoms sitting out front in a big bowl with signs that say, 'Take one.' '' He concluded: ''Planned Parenthood is telling them to go ahead and have sex, enjoy its fun.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WHEN PARENTS KILL: THE STORY OF SHAWN, 3",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/nyregion/when-parents-kill-the-story-of-shawn-3.html,"Early on the Sunday morning of Sept. 26, 1982, as his brothers looked on and an upstairs neighbor heard his cries, Shawn Nicely was beaten to death. He was 3 years old. His killers were his own mother and father. uf921 They have been convicted and jailed, Renee Nicely for murder and Allen Bass for manslaughter. And Shawn has been buried - one of a million children believed to be abused or neglected each year, according to the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, and one of the 5,000 who are killed. Behind those statistics, behind the courtroom verdicts, is the story of Shawn Nicely and his 21-year-old parents, who began having children at the age of 15 and who never married. Theirs is the story of relatives, courts and state agencies, all aware of problems in the family, all unable or unwilling to solve them. It is the story of neighbors and friends who saw a little boy being beaten over a period of years and, for the most part, did nothing and told no one. But ultimately, this is the story of Renee Nicely, a girl trying to be a mother, denying that Shawn was her child, yet seeing in him a reflection of herself and her problems. In prison for his murder, she would write him a poem: I wish I knew who he was because his life was so dim. Who gave him to me? And why did he suffer so? The things I used to do to him, Tell me why? I don't know. I wish he was alive again But he was freed from sin. He would have ended up like me, But now he's free. He reminded me of myself when I was small. I hated that life so, I would recall. Shawn, could it be, was given to me So I could forget the way it used to be. Don't feel bad, I had it hard just like you. Bad thing is: I lived, you didn't make it through. You're lucky, you know, God took you away. I wish it was me killed on that Sunday. An Unwanted Birth And a Mother's Denial Complaining again about getting fat, Renee did her daily sit-ups on the evening of Feb. 17, 1979. She stayed in bed with stomach pains the next day, and her aunt, fearing appendicitis, called an ambulance. It was in the ambulance, bounding down the streets of Newark, that Shawn Nicely was born. ''Renee was saying, 'It's not happening, it's not happening,' '' recalled Sharon Boose, the aunt, with whom Renee was living. ''She looked at me as the baby was coming out and said, 'No, no, Aunt Sharon, it can't be. I'm not pregnant. It can't be.' '' For the first three months of his life, the boy had no name. The hospital referred to him as ''baby boy Nicely,'' and Renee, preparing to give him up, never saw him. She had dropped out of high school, and her Aunt Sharon - as her mother and another aunt had done before - ordered her out of the house. At 16, she had two sons, no husband and, now, no home. Renee placed the infant in a foster home until Mildred Bass, Allen Bass's mother, offered to take in her and the children. Mrs. Bass gained legal custody of Renee, her 18- month-old son Davell and the new baby, whom Renee reclaimed on May 4, 1979. 'Proud as She Could Be' She wanted to name him after his father, she said, but Allen opposed it. ''Shawn'' was the second choice. At first, most friends and relatives agree, Renee treated Shawn as she did Davell - with love and doting, despite flashes of temper and an ignorance of infant care. ''When she first had the baby,'' said Mary Mann, Renee's grandmother, ''she was proud as she could be.'' Renee called him ''Shawnee- pooh.'' Yet, within weeks, Renee began denying that Shawn was her child. It was Mrs. Bass, she said, who nurtured these doubts. Mrs. Bass, who declined to be interviewed, disputed that in testimony during Renee's trial, but friends and relatives recall her being as insistent as Renee on the point. The two supposedly said Shawn's skin was too dark for him to be Renee's child. They said a slight deformity of his feet proved it. They told some people that the hospital had given Renee the wrong child by mistake and others that Renee's Aunt Sharon had sold the baby. Mrs. Bass paid for blood tests for Renee and Allen - the results were inconclusive - and paid $700 to a lawyer, apparently in preparation for a lawsuit. ''Renee used to say the baby wasn't hers,'' said Monica Nicely, her sister. ''She said it all the time. I'd say, 'Well, he looks kind of like you.' She'd just say the babies were switched and Shawn wasn't hers.'' Rationale for Neglect No one could shake the idea from Renee, not even those who forced her to look at herself and Shawn together in a mirror. Renee's denial would become the rationale for Shawn's neglect, beatings and torments. Experts in the study of child abuse say such reasoning is common in such cases, as is the selection of one child among several as the target of mistreatment. ''At first,'' Renee said in an interview in the Essex County Jail, ''I didn't think somebody could just give you a kid and it not be yours. But Mrs. Bass kept trying to get me to go to blood tests and lawyers. I just started not liking Shawn, because I thought I got a kid somewhere in the world that I wouldn't never see because I got Shawn instead. I blamed Shawn.'' In December 1979, after arguments with Mrs. Bass and fist fights with Allen, Renee left the Bass household. Taking along her two sons and living on welfare, she rented a two- room apartment on 20th Avenue in nearby Irvington. She was 17 years old and eight months pregnant with her third child. Impatience and Ignorance Turn to Abuse Renee remembers leaving the lights on all night in her new apartment because she was afraid of the dark. She said she often ran out of food. Her furniture consisted of a bed, a crib, a dresser and a television, and she passed her days watching soap operas. Her favorite, she said, was ''All My Children.'' ''I was scared,'' Renee recalled. ''I wanted somebody to be there. But there wasn't nobody there, nobody but me, Davell and Shawn. And Ping on the way.''' Allen Bass Jr., nicknamed ''Ping,'' was born Jan. 13, 1980. Now with three children, Renee tried belatedly to learn how to be a mother. But she knew nothing of feeding schedules or infants' diets. When Davell was 2, Mrs. Boose recalled, Renee was giving him potato chips and bologna sandwiches. Renee testified that she had never toilet trained Shawn. ''She didn't have any patience,'' Mrs. Boose said. ''I put it down to her being young and wanting to go out.'' Expressions of Stress All the impatience and all the stresses found their target in Shawn. ''Stuff had started to change,'' said Gwendolyn Nicholson, a friend of Renee. ''I saw Renee beat Shawn a couple of times with her hand. I didn't know what he'd done wrong half the time. I'd ask her and she wouldn't say anything.'' ''She would knock the food out of the child's hand,'' said Karleen Young, another friend, who sometimes lived with Renee. ''And when she was telling him to pick up his toys, if he didn't move fast enough, she'd hit him upside his head.'' What Renee's friends noticed was not so much that she hit Shawn but that she ignored him. They recalled her leaving Shawn inside the apartment alone - the punishment Renee had most loathed as a child. She told her friends that Shawn was just sleeping, an excuse repeated so often they nicknamed him ''Sleeping Beauty.'' Visits From Sister Others were not so naive. Janie Bennett, a family friend who sometimes cared for Shawn on weekends, remembered that Renee left him in dirtied clothes after he had urinated or defecated. Most friends recall Shawn's clothes smelling and being ragtag. ''He didn't know how to use the bathroom by himself,'' Renee said, ''so I'd say, 'You stay inside until you know how.' '' When Renee made one of her rare visits to her mother's home in nearby East Orange, she took her other children, but never Shawn. The photographs she put in the family album never showed Shawn. And when her sister Monica visited - the only family member to regularly do so - she often left near tears. ''Monica used to always come here right after,'' said Mrs. Mann, Renee's grandmother, ''and tell me how Renee kept Shawn in a room, how she wouldn't feed him, how she'd throw things on him, how she'd hit him. Monica said how she bammed him in the nose and the blood just popped out. ''Renee started telling me Shawn was a demon. At first I thought she was kidding. I said, 'Why do you keep him alone in the room?' She said, 'To keep his evil spirits off the other kids.' '' As for Allen Bass, Renee said he sometimes hit all the children. Mr. Bass, who declined through his mother to be interviewed, testified at the trial that he had tried to stop Renee from mistreating Shawn. Renee's friends said Allen had treated the children kindly and added that, in his presence, Renee had treated Shawn fairly well. But the friends also said Allen had never actively intervened in the growing pattern of abuse. ''Was Allen a good father? I don't think so,'' said Mrs. Bennett, one of Renee's friends. ''I never seen him hit the kids or holler at them. But one day I asked Allen, 'Why do you let Renee do Shawn that way?' He said, 'That's Renee. She does what she wants to do.' I said, 'You don't care?' He said, 'No.' '' A Neighbor's Discovery Of a Hidden Child In August 1980, Renee and her three children moved to their last home together, a subsidized apartment on Berkeley Terrace in Irvington. Allen Bass, friends and neighbors say, was an occasional presence. If he had lived with Renee, she would have lost her welfare payments, so he often stayed with his mother. He told people that he worked as a model, and Mrs. Bass testified that he had held a con- struction job but had been dismissed for oversleeping and missing work. But others - including Renee, Miss Nicholson and Mrs. Boose - said Allen had supported himself by selling marijuana and pills. Irvington police records show that he was arrested, but not convicted, on charges involving drugs, robbery, possession of stolen property and nonsupport of his children. Kerry White, who lived in the apartment above Renee's, testified that he had seen Allen carrying a gun. Renee's new neighbors came to know her as a sweet girl, pretty though prone to chunkiness, with two young children named Davell and Ping. Oddly, the children called Renee ''Nay'' - never ''Mamma'' or ''Mom.'' Then, after a few months, Dolores Morton, who lived across the street, heard a strange story - that Renee had a third child hidden in the house. Mrs. Morton went to Renee's apartment on the pretext of seeing the baby, Ping, and noticed that the bedroom door was closed. A few days later, she visited again and paced the apartment with Ping in her arms until she could peak into the bedroom. ''I saw Shawn in there, balled up on the floor in a little knot,'' Mrs. Morton said. ''He looked like a ragamuffin, a little vagabond. I went in and picked him up. He put his little arms around me and gave me a big hug and said, 'Mamma?' I asked Renee, 'Can I take him for a night?' She said, 'You can have him.' Real nonchalant.'' Frances Allen, Renee's next-door neighbor, also discovered Shawn, thin and dressed raggedly, cowering around Renee. ''He looked,'' she said, ''like one of those little Biafran kids.'' Neighbor Heard Cries For months, Mrs. Allen said, she had been hearing the sound of children's cries coming from the Nicely apartment and had assumed they were from Davell or Ping. Now, she said, she realized the wails were Shawn's. Once the neighbors learned of Shawn, Renee began taking him outdoors. Some neighbors said they had seen her hit Shawn for letting his ball roll into the street, others that they had heard her call him by obscene names. Kerry White testified that in one fit of anger, Renee had held Shawn upside down and dropped him on his head. Renee said this had never happened, but admitted hitting Shawn, whipping him with a belt and sometimes leaving him in soiled clothes. ''One day he came to my door, and said, 'Miss Frances, can I use the bathroom?' '' Mrs. Allen said. ''I told him to go home and use his own. Davell heard and went and told Renee that Shawn had to go. Shawn was standing here crying. Renee went on to beat him and punch him. She pulled him into the house.I didn't see him come back out.'' Still, none of the friends, neighbors or relatives called the police or other agencies to report the beatings of Shawn. In October 1981, however, Renee let Mrs. Morton, the neighbor across the street, keep Shawn. ''I wanted somebody to take him,'' Renee said, ''because I didn't want him. He deserved for somebody to take care of him.'' Why not his mother? ''I'm not his mother.'' On Shawn's first day with her, Mrs. Morton said, he covered his face with his arms when she moved to stroke his hair. He shrieked when she began to wash him. After she tucked him into bed, she said, he crawled out and slept curled in a ball beneath the bed - the way he had in Renee's house. It took three weeks before Shawn slept on the bed. Toy Motorcycle and TV But soon, Mrs. Morton said, Shawn looked forward to his bubble baths. He rode around her living room on a toy motorcycle and watched baseball games on the television she had bought him. She took Shawn to her Bible study meetings and to church. Renee's behavior toward Shawn, Mrs. Morton said, was curious and contradictory. When a portrait photographer, going door to door, asked Renee if she wanted pictures taken of her children, she declined but told him that the woman across the street might want one of ''her child.'' Mrs. Morton had Shawn photographed in his favorite pajamas, the ones that looked like a baseball uniform. Mrs. Morton eventually persuaded Renee to give her custody of Shawn. They drew up an agreement, but when it came to the point of seeing a lawyer, Renee balked. She said she had feared that if she gave up Shawn, the state might take away her others - Davell, Ping and Michael, who was born May 8, 1981. Instead of giving up Shawn, Renee took him back in April 1982. ''He told me, 'I don't want to go back to Nay. Her not like me,' '' Mrs. Morton said. But legally, she said, she had no choice. ''It was so hard for me giving him back,'' Mrs. Morton said. ''When I was in the house, I would have to close my front door, because Shawn would be across the street, sitting on his steps with his eyes glued over here.'' Almost from the day Shawn was returned to his mother, Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Allen said, he looked dirtier, thinner and more frightened. Finding that Mrs. Morton had taught Shawn how to dance, Renee said, she and Allen would demand that he ''shake it'' until he begged to stop. Davell Nicely said Allen got Shawn drunk one night and watched him try again and again to stand. And once, Renee testified, she beat Shawn because he disobeyed her and then said Mrs. Morton was his real mother. ''My mother used to tell me, 'One day, you're going to have a kid and he'll have a smart mouth like you,' '' Renee said. ''And I did.'' A Re-enactment Of Childhood Pain Deny him as she might, Renee Nicely was joined with Shawn. She scorned him even as she indentified with him, re-enacting with him the rejection she had felt as a child. ''Shawn was the second and I was the second,'' Renee said. ''He was different from Davell and them, and I was different from my sisters. He had a rash, and when I was a kid I had a rash. I didn't like Shawn, and my mother didn't like me.'' Beverly Nicely said she had always loved her daughter Renee, but, perhaps, had never had the time to show it. Divorced and working as a keypunch operator, trying to move her family out of Newark, she had had only two or three hours each night for the vying affections of four children. ''Maybe Renee needed more attention,'' Mrs. Nicely said. ''You hate to say that, but you're working so hard to get out of that city life. I know she never had want for anything. Christmastime, she got lots of presents. School time, she got new clothes. Maybe I screamed and yelled too much and she couldn't take it. Maybe she needed a mother and father to be there with her, and we weren't.'' Spoiled by Her Father Alfred Nicely, Renee's father, favored her to the point of spoiling her. He called her ''Princess'' and promised her, as Renee testified, that ''one day he was going to take me to a world with just me and him.'' Mrs. Mann, Renee's grandmother, recalled that Mr. Nicely had told Renee that ''she could do anything because of how beautiful she was.'' Anything included disobeying her mother. Renee recalled ripping her mother's watchbands and necklaces, scratching furniture with pens, leaving letters written in a strange personal code on her mother's dresser. ''You couldn't say anything to Renee without her blowing up,'' her sister Monica said. One Christmas, Renee's Aunt Sharon bought her a gold bracelet. Renee refused the gift, saying she wasn't good enough to wear gold. ''I'd say, 'Renee, why do you punish yourself?' '' the aunt recalled. ''She'd say, 'Because I'm no good.' '' Occasionally, Mrs. Nicely spanked Renee to discipline her. But most often, she put Renee in her room alone as the other children played - just as Renee would isolate Shawn. When Renee was 11 and again when she was 14, Mrs. Nicely took her to a family counseling clinic. She finally tried to send her to a shelter for juvenile delinquents. ''They said, 'She's not a criminal,' '' Mrs. Nicely remembered. ''I said, 'But she needs help.' They said, 'She's incorrigible, and that's not a crime.' You cry out for help and no one wants to help. Until it's too late.'' Renee was sent to live with her aunt, Debra Handy, in Irvington. And it was there that she met Allen Bass, who lived on the same block. On Nov. 23, 1977, they had their first child, Davell. From Officials and Friends, Too Little Help As Renee's own family grew, and her problems with it, she came to the attention of the State Division of Youth and Family Services, a judge and a doctor. Almost all suspected or knew of the turbulence in her home, yet none succeeded in stopping it. When Mrs. Bass sought custody of Renee and the children, Judge Yale L. Apter of Essex County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court ordered the family-service division to help watch over Renee. ''I do not,'' he said in April 1979, ''want to see any more children.'' Renee was already 10 days pregnant. In all, she came under the supervision of the state agency twice - after the births of Davell and of Shawn. Both times, caseworkers found the babies to be in suitable homes, Davell with Renee's Aunt Sharon and Shawn with Mrs. Bass, and Renee's case receded among the 35,000 others in the state., At about 10 P.M. on June 30, 1982, it emerged again. An anonymous caller told the family-service agency's Newark office that a boy named Shawn Nicely had cigarette burns on his body and gave the boy's address. Within moments of the call, an emergency caseworker, Linnie Mae Penn, arrived at Renee's apartment. Miss Penn testified that she had found no cigarette burns or other marks of abuse on Shawn. She testified that Shawn had not cowered or ducked around Renee. A neighbor, Lilly White, was in Renee's apartment at the time and volunteered that Renee did not abuse her children, Miss Penn said. Examined by Physician Still, caseworkers followed up on Shawn. Twice, records show, they had Dr. P. Sundaram of Irvington examine Shawn for signs of abuse. Although an autopsy less than three months later found a number of old injuries, including broken bones, Dr. Sundaram reported no medical evidence of abuse. Caseworkers visited Renee 10 times during July, August and September of 1982. They noted no injuries on Shawn. Thomas Blatner, the director of the family-service agency, said the division had offered Renee a range of services: foster care for Shawn, a paid homemarker, day care, psychiatric help, counseling and even another blood test to prove Shawn was hers. ''But all this was voluntary,'' he said, ''and she turned it all down.'' For Mr. Blatner and others, the question remains: Why couldn't his agency somehow save Shawn? The director cited the agency's caseload - at any given time in 1982 each caseworker in the Newark office had 45 cases - and its tendency to answer crises rather than educate families to prevent them. And the agency, he said, was constrained by criticism that it moved too quickly to break up families. Finally, Mr. Blatner said, the community did not help. Neighbors like as Mrs. Allen and Kerry White said caseworkers had never questioned them about Shawn; but the neighbors never come forward either. ''This is a tragic example,'' Mr. Blatner said, ''of a case where we could not prove child abuse to the point of taking away the child. We felt there were problems in the home. We were aware the kid was dirty. But are we going to remove every kid who's dirty from his home? A major issue is that there were neighbors, people close to the situation, who did not come forward at the time we could've done something.'' Miss Penn, the caseworker, returned to Berkeley Terrace after Shawn was killed and found Lilly White, the neighbor who had told her that Renee Nicely did not abuse her children. Miss Penn asked the woman what she thought now. Lilly White's explanation, Miss Penn testified, was: ''She didn't want to get committed. She didn't want to be involved in it.'' 'Shawn's Not Going To Make It' In early September of 1982, Debra Handy went to an amusement park with Allen, Renee and all their children. ''Debra came home,'' said Mrs. Mann, Debra's mother and Renee's grandmother, and said, 'Mamma, I'm afraid Shawn's not going to make it. He had this blank stare. He's weak. He can't walk on his feet.' '' It was at 8 or 8:30 on the morning of Sept. 26, Kerry White testified, that he heard the loud thumps, a series of them, from the Nicely apartment below. Then came the crying and then the sound of Shawn shouting, ''Ow! Stop that.'' Then, he testified, he heard Renee say, '' 'Better not do it again or else I'll kick your butt.' '' More thumps - three, he testified - followed. The crying stopped. Kerry heard footsteps in Renee's apartment. Then he saw Renee running across the street to call the police from Mrs. Morton's house. She and Allen Bass initially told Mrs. Morton and the police the same story: Shawn had slipped in the bathtub and hit his head. Events Are in Doubt Exactly what happened in Renee's apartment that morning remains in some doubt, although everyone agrees that it began with Shawn dirtying his pants. Allen, who had stayed overnight, testified that he had slept through whatever occurred. Renee testified only that she hit Shawn sometime that morning. She now says that she lay in bed through whatever occurred, still weak from an abortion the previous day. Davell Nicely, who at the age of 5 testified against his mother and father, said that Renee had hit Shawn in the head with a broom and that Allen had stomped on Shawn's back. When the police arrived, they found blood in the bathtub, blood on the towels on the rack and a bloodied towel in the sink. Seeing the ambulance, Mrs. Allen, the next-door neighbor, called the family-service division to report a suspected case of child abuse. She was too late. Shawn was pronounced dead on arrival at Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark at 9:51 A.M. The Essex County Medical Examiner, Dr. Andre Talleyrand, attributed death to a combination of injuries, including internal hemorrhage, a laceration of the liver and lacerations and contusions of other internal organs. He also found a recent break in Shawn's right arm, one newly fractured rib, three previously fractured ribs, hemorrhaging on the tongue, bruised gums, a slight swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head, a new bruise on the left thigh and old scars on the buttocks, thigh and upper back. At the time of his death, Shawn Nicely stood 36 inches tall and weighed 31 pounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRASS-ROOTS GROUPS GO NATIONAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/magazine/grass-roots-groups-go-national.html,"IN CITIES, SUBURBS AND SMALL TOWNS FROM NEW Hampshire to Oregon, platoons of activists ranging from unemployed factory workers to high-school youths are knocking on at least 50,000 doors every evening to press the issue of the day, be it toxic waste in Missouri, utility rates in Ohio or tax reform in Connecticut. Late in the evening, they return to small, bare offices with money, commitments for assistance and names and addresses for computers. Soon, many will be installing telephone banks for the 1984 elections and beyond. In many grass-roots communities across the nation, where periodic waves of discontent have given rise to such protest movements as the agrarian revolt of the 1890's and the labor strikes of the 1930's, citizens are once again restless. The decline of the nation's old industrial base, uncertainty about what will replace it and concern over unemployment, falling incomes, farm foreclosures and bankruptcies have stirred new rumblings. A multitude of citizen-action groups on the left, which sprang up in the 1970's to secure specific but frequently narrow goals on the state or local level, are now seeking to organize the discontent nationally and reverse the drift toward conservatism evident in President Reagan's election in 1980. The activism on the left springs from a major development of a decade ago, when millions of citizens became disillusioned with the traditional forms of politics. They organized neighborhood, regional and state groups by the thousands to mount direct actions and legal challenges against what they perceived to be abuses of big government and big business in housing, taxes, insurance, the environment, energy prices, women's and minority rights. They are now broadening their agendas, forming coalitions with such old-line liberals as labor and farm groups. More important, they have been entering elective politics with the kinds of sophisticated candidate- support systems that would have been impossible three years ago. In so doing, they are taking a page from the book written by right- wing activists in the 1970's. Many leaders of this movement were the angry young of the 1960's who disrupted American society on behalf of civil rights, peace and a host of other causes before disappearing from the national scene. These old-time activists on the left are, how ever, only one element in the new political ferment. Thousands of new pressure groups organized around single issues - corporate political action committees (PAC's) and nuclear-freeze advocates, for example - are bringing about a profound change in American government, away from a representative system and toward a more directly participatory one. Yet, compared with other groups, the evolving and merging groups on the left have received less attention even though their influence, both actual and potential, may be greater. Many of its leaders say the movement has simply been doing what comes naturally, moving into national politics as a logical next step, with the Reagan Administration as both catalyst and target. They explain the rise of the groups as a result of their organizational maturity coinciding with circumstances favorable to expansion. They assert that even with a somewhat improved economy, unemployment is likely to continue at an elevated level, and the high industrial wages that sustained blue-collar families for decades may never return. The emergence of issues such as toxic waste has brought together blue- collar neighborhoods and environmentalists and moderated their past differences over jobs versus the environment. Labor unions, which for many years could elect or defeat candidates on their own, are losing members and therefore reaching out for allies wherever they can be found. The women's movement, after its crushing defeat in the battle for the equal rights amendment, is looking for new allies. All these centrifugal forces are contibuting to a new coalition. One group typical of this new development is the Illinois Public Action Council, or IPAC, a coalition of about 130 organizations across the state. In the upcoming 1984 elections, the group's new campaign strategies and techniques will invariably be pitted against those of the new right. The new movement is nonpartisan and appeals to citizens of various ideological persuasions; but, in practice, it is seeking to make its impact almost exclusively within the Democratic Party. Its leaders says it is hopeless to attempt any drastic change among Republicans. The idea for IPAC started with Saul Alinsky, a charismatic community organizer whose legacy lives on in thousands of self-help organizations across the nation. Alinsky, a product of Chicago's slums, perfected confrontational politics at a time when poor communities seemed to have few alternatives. If, for example, a municipality failed to pick up garbage, he and his followers would dump it on the steps of City Hall. When he died of a heart attack in 1972, his successes in Chicago and elsewhere appeared to have been temporary, as urban neighborhoods continued to decline and the revolutionary spirit of the 1960's died. Over time, however, neighborhood groups not only survived but proliferated, matured and gained power. Many of the groups are now engaged in moneymaking ventures involving real estate and transportation and crime-control services. Although very different from a neighborhood organization and involved in more enterprises than Alinsky probably ever dreamed of, IPAC is a direct descendant of one of his last organizations, the Citizen Action Program (CAP) in Chicago. CAP used confrontation stratagems and legal challenges to stop construction of an expressway, to force Commonwealth Edison to reduce air pollution and to secure legislation against the redlining of neighborhoods by banks. In 1975, Robert B. Creamer, a Louisianian who had moved to Chicago to work for Alinsky and later became CAP's associate director, established IPAC along with several other Alinsky followers as a means for applying pressure on a state-wide basis. At first, the group consisted primarily of neighborhood, elderly, minority and other special-interest organizations. Recently, it has added such liberal labor groups as the International Association of Machinists and the United Automobile Workers, as well as several farm groups brought together under a new umbrella organization called the Illinois Farm Alliance. Now 36, Creamer calls this organizing ''a self-conscious effort to build upon the same spirit as the Illinois Populist movement of the late 19th century and the anti-foreclosure protests of the 1930's.'' With an annual budget of $1.4 million, IPAC operates offices in six cities; canvasses 7,000 homes a day; runs a PAC providing personnel and research for candidates for the State Legislature and Congress, and maintains a full-time lobby in the Illinois capital of Springfield, where it has been winning some grudging respect in the largely conservative Legislature. On the national level, IPAC belongs to Citizen Action, a new federation claiming to speak for 3 million people in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon. This overarching organization's statement of purpose is ''to bring together low- and middle-income citizens of every type - urban and rural; women and men; black, Latino and white; senior citizens, union members and church members. All (of the organizations in the federation) emphasize community organizing and grass-roots leadership development as the key to social change. All address the economic questions of greatest concern to their members as neighborhood residents, consumers, taxpayers and workers.'' FOR THE MOST PART, THIS BROAD MOVEMENT'S top leaders show a surprising uniformity from group to group and state to state. Most are in their 30's or early 40's and egalitarian in their attitudes, preferring to stay in the background while pushing their local members up front. In 1965, when the civil-rights movement was at its peak and the anti-Vietnam protests were just beginning, they were high- school and college students. Like thousands of their peers, they took to the streets, part of a great national ideological outpouring against what was perceived as racial oppression and an immoral war. While the Stokely Carmichaels and Abbie Hoffmans grabbed headlines and went to court, these followers quietly organized rallies, marches and demonstrations. When the movement faltered in the 1970's, the current leaders did not splinter off into such radical and frequently violent groups as the Weathermen, nor did they join the workaday middle class, as most of the rank and file did. Instead, they turned their backs on the national scene and immmersed themselves in the neighborhoods, becoming what Harry C. Boyte in his book ''The Backyard Revolution'' called ''a new generation of organizers.'' Heather Booth, a soft-spoken woman in her late 30's, is a movement theorist and organizer. She grew up in Brooklyn, was converted to direct-action politics as a university student and led antiwar and women's protests before turning, along with her husband, Paul, to neighborhood organizing. In 1973, Mrs. Booth, a former schoolteacher, founded Chicago's Midwest Academy, which has trained an estimated 10,000 organizers in organizing low- and moderate-income people across the country. ''Politics was in disarray,'' says Mrs. Booth, recalling the mood of the early 1970's. ''People of good faith were embroiled in factionalism. They were bushed out and turning off or turning in on each other. Watergate was just beginning to be exposed. It was a pretty awful period. We were trying to find a way to hold on to something positive.'' What Mrs. Booth and others achieved in various regions over the next few years was substantial but circumscribed. They helped build organizations and institute techniques for assisting specific people to achieve such specific goals as stopping a freeway, filling potholes and pushing City Hall, the Legislature or Congress to enact certain consumer legislation. Still, the elective system the young activists had condemned as corrupt rolled on its own track with its consultants, pollsters, managers, media experts and candidates, unimpeded by the citizen-activist movement on the left. ''Take 'em on as they come up,'' was, with rare exception, the activist attitude toward elected Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives alike. The election of Ronald Reagan and, especially, the impact of the new right in 1980 changed that. Those working under the umbrella of Citizen Action, among others, decided they could not survive under the new order unless they got into elective politics. ''We were at the stage where we could no longer stay out,'' says Ira Arlook, executive director of the Cleveland- based Citizen Action. ''There were public officials with us on the issues whom the Republicans were making a special effort to knock off. We could not simply say to them, 'Good luck, hope you win.' '' To prepare for the 1982 Congressional elections and beyond, Citizen Action set up the State and Local Leadership Project, a nonpartisan training school for campaign workers based in Chicago and under Mrs. Booth's direction. Assistance was provided by Paul Tully, who had been with the George McGovern and Edward M. Kennedy Presidential campaigns and now works for Walter F. Mondale. Statewide groups set up PAC's, selected Congressional and legislative districts where Reagan Republicans could be defeated and sent their workers door to door promoting first the issues and then the candidates who supported their positions. Despite the fact that it was impossible in many instances to separate the effects of their efforts and those of the recession and a widespread reaction against the Reagan policies, their record was impressive, One of the movement's more celebrated winners was Doreen Del Bianco, a young activist elected to the Connecticut Legislature over a Republican incumbent. Miss Del Bianco joined the Connecticut Citizen Action Group four years ago when she decided to sign a petition for lower utility rates. ''I was just a housewife and blamed all my troubles on blacks, Puerto Ricans and other victims,'' she says, reflecting on her political transformation. ''Now I know it's the corporations that are keeping people down int he workplace and in the community.'' Miss Del Bianco eventually bacame one of the leaders of the group, and when the organization decided last year to support candidates in elections she enthusiastically entered the race for state representative from a Waterbury district that had traditionally sent moderates of both parties to Hartford. ''I entered the race because I was tired of talking to legislators who don't understand what it is to go from paycheck to paycheck, who don't understand how hard it is to pay Northeast utility bills, who don't get threatened when their property taxes go up,'' she says. Despite a cool reception fromt he Democratic Party in the district, Miss Del Bianco got enough money from labor unions and help from grassroots activists to win by a margin of 137 votes out of 8,200 cast. As could be expected, Miss Del Bianco has found herself at cross purposes with the Hartford corporate lobby, which considered her and her organization radical and out of step with the current probusiness trend in the country. For most of these groups, the first steps into politics were tentative. Next year, though, they plan a much more extensive effort IPAC, perhaps the most politically advanced of all the groups, is being watched as a bellwether for the movement elsewhere. In Illinois, as in other Midwestern states, plant closings, alyoffs, fiscal deficits on all levels, declining public services, farm foreclosures and discoveries of new toxic wastes have become routine occurrences. Some of the small industrial cities have unemployment rates above 20 percent. Every day at 2 P.M., IPAC canvassers gather in scattered locations across the state. In Rockford, Neil Lancaster, a veteran activist and a canvass supervisor, is giving a pep talk on the issues to a dozen or so workers in a store-front office with the stark, unkempt air of a union hall. The workers, in their 20's and 30's, are black and white men and women and, like Miss Lancaster, casually dressed in jeans and jackets. Utility rates have increased in the area, and Miss Lancaster predicts more hikes if President Reagan's bill to deregulate natural gas passes and the State Legislature fails to restrain prices. There is no pretense of objectivity in these briefings in the Populist tradition, the issue is black and white: the people versus big business and government. By the time Miss Lancaster ends the briefing, the canvassers, recruited from activist ranks, are filled with enough indignation to get them through the evenig. The canvass itself is a highly professional operation. The workers pile into cars and spread out over suburbs of small working-class houses whose occupants are, more often than not, frugal and conservative. When the door opens, Miss Lancaster, carrying a clipboard with credentials and a statement of purpose showing prominently, explains she is with IPAC, a group fairly well known throughout the state, working to keep utility rates down. Her approach is soft but direct. The resident, a white-collar man just home from work, looks vexed but lets her in for a brief discussion of the issues. She emerges five minutes later with a check for $15 from someone who may support the organization on other issues as well. The man has bought a piece of whatever political impact IPAC can make and a subscription to its newspaper, Illinois Action. Others turn her away or decline to contribute, but Miss Lancaster and other canvassers are often successful. She says the canvassing operation is meticulously accounted for. If a canvasser, who is paid slightly over the minimum hourly wage, cannot collect $80 an evening, he or she is fired. Canvassing is not conducted in areas where the population falls below a certain density because it takes too long to get to the next house. The money canvassers bring in - IPAC expects to gross more than $1 million this year - along with names and addresses for the computer banks, is the lifeblood of the organization's new initiatives. Although canvassing is not a new technique, these activists have so perfected it in the past year or two that many of them claim it has boosted their fortunes even more than the enormously successful direct-mail appeals have the new right's. At state headquarters in Chicago, IPAC director Creamer, along with a governing board representing various disparate groups, are reacing out in many new directions. The group has set its sights and resources on Congressional districts outside of Chicago, a city considered too encumbered by the old Democratic machine for IPAC to be effective (Although the group did not endorse anyone int he recent Mayoral primary, it did send out canvassers to work for Harold Washington int he general eleciton). IPAC is seeking - sometimes over the opposition of county chairmen - to rebuild the state Democratic Party around Populist issues and from the precinct level up. The attempt is to create the same kind of grass-roots structure that existed for many years in the Minnesota Democratic Farmer-Labor Party. For 1984, IPAC has targeted five conservatives Congressmen for defeat. The races will pit the techniques of the right against those of th left. In Presidential politics, IPAC is debating whether it should support a candidate in the Illinois Democratic primary next year, but organization labor has become such an important element in the coalition that its members have decided its choice would have to coincide with that of the A.F.L. - C.I.O., which has announced it will break with tradition and endorse a candidate before th primaries. IPAC leaders deny that they ahve become captives of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., explaing that they simply do not want to risk fracturing their coalition at this point. An IPAC endorsement would give any Democratic candidate a leg up in Illinois. Creamer has recruited Michael McGann, a deputy director of Senator Kennedy's 1980 Illinois Presidential campaign, from downstate Illinois to run the political operation. IPAC's finance director is Rahm Emmanuel, a 23-year-old, well-connected Chicagoan formerly with the Democratic National Committee, who brings in contributions from the North Side rich as well as national political action committees. Further adding to the diversity are leaders such as Vince Demuzio, a Democrat and assistant majority leader of the Illinois Senate, one of the spark plugs on the IPAC board and sponsor of much of its legislation. He is an alumnus of Lyndon Johnson's ''War on Poverty,'' having served as director of a federally funded, small-town antipoverty agency. Their match converging on Springfield from Chicago, Peoria and East St. Louis last spring was designed to give visibility to the coalition of farmers, urban blacks, the elderly, the unemployed, the clergy, working mothers and organized labor. Out of all this comminging, Creamer says, the various groups are trying to form ''a long-lasting progressive political movement that can redirect American politics in a humane, democratic direction. ''The process that is under way in Illinois,'' Creamer says, ''Is part of a larger national dialogue aimed at shaping an integrated progressive economic alternative - an alternative both to right-wing, supply-side dogma, and the traditional economic policies of the last 40 years.'' Creamer and other leaders across the nation speak of laws and policies that would direct more capital into ''Productive areas'' such as manufacturing plants and equipment and less into ''speculation, mergers and acquisitions.'' Frequently, their discussions trail off into economic theory, but the group's policies are clearly directed toward more public regualtion and broader participation by the people at the lower end of the economic ladder. They are seeking, among other things, larger public expenditures to clean up toxic waste; more consumer progtection, espeically against mortgage foreclosures and the cutoff of utilities: more regulation of energy prices; a shift away from sales and property tax to the graduated income tax; strengthening of work-safety laws, and higher funding of job-training and social programs - a platform hardly compatible with the Reagan philosophy or that of many modern-day Democrats. When asked how they are handling the emotional issues - abortion, prayer in public schools, and pornography, among others - that helped give rise to the new right by appealing to working-class people, most movement leaders answer identically: They ignore those issues, thus avoiding divisiveness. Michael Ansara, staff director of Massachusetts Fair Share in Boston, points out that a family could support the economic and environmental policies of his organization, which boasts 130,000 dues-paying families,a nd at the same time the social stance of the right-to-life movement. At the heart of the movement is an element of class struggle ''Our members say things used to work for them and they don't any more.'' says Ansara. ''Many have large families and grew up in the Catholic Church. Look at the member who is 35 years old, has worked hard, married, obeyed all the rules but is facing declining income and other troubles. They see young professional couples who broke all the rules, evaded the draft in the Vietnam War, lived together unmarried, have high salaries, drive a Volvo and are coming in buying up and restoring the houses of working people. that is the stereotype.'' The leaders of Massachusetts Fair Share are considering whether to move into elective politics prior to the 1984 elections. Groups across the country - in California, New York, Texas, Florida, Montana, Colorado and other states - are in various stages of development California's Campaign for Economic Democracy, headed by Tom Hayden, and ACORN, a national neighborhood movement for low and moderate-income people based in Little Rock, Ark. have long been supporting candidates. Most groups have not. But this year the trend is the same everywhere - toward coalitions and greater involvement in elections. Although the ascendancy of Reagan conservatism has encouraged a renaissance of the left, many cite progressivism's new importance as evidence that the ''new left'' has simply come of age. Lee Webb, executive director of the Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies, a privately funded, Washington-based research group, gives elected officials and some activists detailed technical assistance in pursuing laws and policies. He provides policies'' - how to deal with such issues as housing, plant closings, tax reform, economic development, pension fund investment, and others. Webb, a student of past progressive and political-reform movements, is seldom surprised when popular movements burst upon the national scene and find national officials poorly prepared to deal with them - as the nuclear-freeze movement did last Year. Webb thinks the nation, many of its citizens disillusioned with Washington's solutions, is reverting to a historic tradition of great movements beginning at the local and state levels and eventually bubbling up to the national scene. Leaders of the activist left think they may be on the verge of making an impact on national elections. Yet coalition politics have long been a shaky affair in this country. Efforts to unite the poor across racial lines have failed more often than they have succeeded. Paul Tully, a former State and Local Leadership Project adviser, views Citizen Action and other coalitions as a ''very serious operation,'' but warns that such politics work best when a ''fire-breathing dragon'' - as many in the movement view the Reagan Administration - offers a common threat. If the national prospers over the next year or so, the dragon may seem less threatening. Many leaders feel there is dragon enough in the structural changes taking place in the American economy. Ira Arlook of Citizen Action says that such issues as toxic waste are sufficient to keep the canvassers going for a long time. Significantly, the most wrenching social and economic changes are occurring not so much in marginal states as in those with large populations, big Congressional delegations and many electoral votes - Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, among others. It seems doubtful that the new progressive movement can achieve basic changes in American political thought at this stage. The radical change that it is seeking lies in putting segments of the economy - the banking institutions - under more democratic control, to give rand-and-file Americans a larger voice in how and where dollars are invested. But many of the issues, including public control of utility rates and tax reform, are quite traditional. And the movement seems locked in to supporting a traditionalist Democrat such as Walter Mondale for President in 1984. Yet it is expected to have a major impact next year in the Congressional and state elections. At a minimum, the new stirrings among the activists on the left are likely to add a balance to the political scales that was abSent in 1980, when the new right inspired many religious fundamentalists and other conservatives while many on the left boycotted the elections in any event, the nation need not be surprised if the activists on the left turn out, as IPAC's Creamer predicts, to be ''an incresingly important force in American politics.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MEXICO PROPOSES MAJOR REVISION OF ITS PANEL CODE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/world/mexico-proposes-major-revision-of-its-panel-code.html,"Mexico's Attorney General has proposed a major revision in the country's penal code that is intended to add greater flexibility to the judicial system and give fairer treatment to defendants. The proposal, which would provide the first major revision of the Mexican penal code in 52 years, would eliminate the longstanding presumption that a defendant acted with intent when committing a crime. A statement from the Attorney General's office said this was ''a source of injustice'' that often resulted in penalties harsher than deserved. The proposal would also alter the punishment against certain crimes - increasing penalties for rape and child abuse, for example, and reducing those for adultery and abortion - to bring them more into line with what the Attorney General's office described as the ''Mexican reality.'' Accused Can Still Be Jailed The proposal would not change the current provisions that allow a person accused of a crime to be jailed before trial. Reports of an earlier version of the proposal by the Attorney General, Sergio Garcia Ramirez, have already caused controversy because of liberalized provisions on abortion and adultery. But a spokesman for the Attorney General's office said these revisions did not differ greatly from the law as it was now applied, and that the other proposed revisions would have much broader significance. These were among the other major changes in the proposal: - Monetary penalties would be based on a defendant's income, making fines onerous in equal proportion to the rich and the poor. - Penalties for the use of some narcotics and dangerous drugs would be reduced, but sanctions for sale and distribution would be increased to punish the ''true delinquents.'' - An injured party would be permitted to include his claim for monetary damages in the criminal prosecution, making possible restitution part of the Government's criminal proceeding. - Mexican courts would, for the first time, have the option of placing convicted criminals in jail part time or under a system of probation, and could order criminals to repay their debt to society by performing public service work. - Penalties would be increased for rape and sexual abuse, with the law expanded to protect both men and women, and sanctions against kidnapping and serious incidents of child abuse would also be increased. Proposal Still Under Revision The proposal was developed by the offices of the Federal Attorney General, the District Attorney for the Federal District, to which it would initially apply, and the National Institute of Penal Sciences, a Government-supported academic group. The Attorney General's office said the formal document was still under revision and would probably not be presented to the Mexican Congress for several weeks. The proposal would recognize ''degrees of guilt,'' such as a legal distinction between the intentional and unintentional commission of a crime - for example, if one intended to injure another person with a blow, but that blow accidentally resulted in the victim's death. The legal system currently lacks this type of flexibility. In addition, the proposal would allow greater latitude in dealing with people who, because of ''error or ignorance,'' did not know they were committing a crime. The Attorney General said such a provision was particularly important in a country where there are ''ethnic groups not incorporated into the culture, who do not know the language, whose customs are different from those generally prevailing.'' But in Mexico, a heavily Roman Catholic country where the family still plays a dominant role, the changes in the abortion and adultery laws have drawn the most comment and controversy. Under current law, abortion is permitted if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, is caused by a rape or is the result of a woman's ''imprudence.'' The revision would permit abortions in the case of serious genetic defects or if the birth of the child would create grave economic hardship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/06/world/no-headline-145793.html,"Irish to Vote Tomorrow on Antiabortion Measure DUBLIN, Sept. 5 - After months of debate, confusion and sectarian division, Irish voters will decide on Wednesday whether to write a strong antiabortion amendment into the Constitution. ''Never in our history have we seen a campaign that was so bitter and divisive as the present one,'' Dick Spring, a leader of the Irish Labor Party, said over the weekend. ''Neighbor has been turned against neighbor. Eminent professional men have bitterly denounced each other in public. The churches could hardly be farther apart. Colleagues in the same political party have lunched personal attacks on each other.'' Abortion is illegal in Ireland in all but the most extreme cases where a mother's life is threatened by a pregnancy. But in the last two years antiabortion forces, with the support of the Roman Catholic Church and the Irish Republic's two main political parties, have managed to put the constitutional change to the voters in a national referendum. Concern About the Future Supporters of an amendment have argued that existing statutory laws against abortion could be overturned by liberal forces in the future or by new court interpretations of the law. The Constitution itself, they said, had to specifically guarantee the right to life to keep abortion out of Ireland. Those who have campaigned against the amendment countered that the additional safeguards were not necessary since there was no groundswell of popular opinion to liberalize the law in a land where divorce is not allowed and contraceptives are available only through medical prescription. Most Irish women who want to terminate a pregnancy go to England, where they can have an abortion on demand. The constitutional change would not affect that reality. Changing the Constitution to place the life of ''the unborn'' on equal footing with the life of the mother, those who oppose the amendment said, could contribute to the death of more Irish women than now occur. Moreover, they argued, introducing the antiabortion language strongly favored by the the Catholic Church could undercut recent moves within the Irish Republic to promote discussions with Protestants in Northern Ireland to find a basis for reunification. 5% of Country Non-Catholic Protestant and Jewish leaders in Ireland have spoken out against the amendment, saying that it would impose the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on everyone in the country. About 5 percent of the population is non-Catholic. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald urged rejection of the constitutional change, adding that he regretted that he initially endorsed the measure when it came up during last year's election campaign. Despite much opposition in leadership circles, the amendment is expected to be approved by a wide margin. A poll published in The Irish Times today placed the likely margin at more than 2 to 1. What voters are being asked to approve for inclusion in the Constitution is this paragraph: ''The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.'' Even after months of debate, the public continues to appear confused by the issue, with many still convinced that if they fail to support the change abortion will somehow get a legal foothold in Ireland. 'The Moral Backbone' ''The Irish people are going to stand up and show there's one place in the world with the moral backbone to keep the abortionists out,'' said Catherine O'Keefe of Kilkenny, a mother of three. Roman Catholic leaders said the way people voted on this issue should be a matter of individual conscience, but on Sunday parishes around the country rang with exhortations from bishops and priests urging parishioners to vote for the amendment. Some priests reportedly suggested that a vote against the amendment would be tantamount to being an accessory to an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POPE WARNS 25 U.S. BISHOPS ON SEX MORALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/06/world/pope-warns-25-us-bishops-on-sex-morals.html,"Pope John Paul II repeated Roman Catholic teaching against abortion, divorce, the ordination of women, birth control, premarital sex and homosexuality today in a speech to 25 visiting United States bishops. Church sources suggested the Pope chose the Americans as his forum because he considers the United States a center of sexual liberalism and believes elements within the church in the United States to be sympathetic to such views. The prelates were here to pay the visit to the Pope that is obligatory for bishops every five years. In the meeting at his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, the Pope told the bishops that they must ''proclaim without fear and ambiguity the many controverted truths of our age'' and went on to list the Roman Catholic church's teachings on sexuality. The Pope reminded the bishops of the church's doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage, citing approvingly from a pastoral letter of the United States episcopate that said: ''the covenant between a man and a woman in Christian marriage is as indissoluble and irrevocable as God's love for his people and Christ's love for his church.'' Speech Appears Defensives The Pope condemned premarital sex and homosexual activity as incompatible ''with God's plan for human love.'' He urged the bishops not to be silent against ''the unpopular truth that artificial birth control is against God's law.'' He restated his rejection of abortion by citing ''the rights of the unborn, the weak, the handicapped, the poor and the aged, no matter how current popular opinion views these issuses.'' Vatican sources noted in all the strictures a particulary defensive tone and an acknowledgment of the widespread unpopularity of the Roman Catholic doctrine, which the Pope appears to believe is particularly unwelcome among Catholics in the United States. The Pope restated his absolute exclusion of women from priestly functions. He did so, it was believed, because it was in the United States that he was most openly confronted with opposition from within the church on this issue. After declaring his support for the dignity of women and their right to ''every legitimate freedom that is consonant with their human nature and their womanhood,'' he told the bishops to be firm in rejecting any claim that women could serve as priests. Exclude Women Priests ''In this regard he must likewise endeavor to explain as cogently as he can that the church's teaching on the exclusion of women from priestly ordination is extraneous to the issue of discrimination and that it is linked rather to Christ's own design for his priesthood,'' the Pope said. ''The bishop must give proof of his pastoral ability and leadership by withdrawing all support from individuals or groups who in the name of progress, justice or compassion, or for any other alleged reason, promote the ordination of women to the priesthood,'' the Pope said. ''In so doing, such individuals or groups are in effect damaging the very dignity of women that they profess to promote and advance.'' In Washington, during his visit to the United States in October 1979, a nun turned an expected address of welcome into a demand for the admission of women to the ministry. The nun, Sister M. Theresa Kane, wearing street clothes despite the Pope's express wish, spoke of ''the intense suffering and pain'' of many women and urged John Paul ''to be open to and to respond to the voices coming from the women of this country who are desirous of serving in and through the church as fully participating members.'' The Pope cautioned the bishops today to expect criticism of their defense of the church's views. ''Precisely because he cannot renounce the preaching of the cross, the bishop will be called upon over and over again to accept criticism, to sacrifice popularity, and to admit failure in obtaining a consensus of doctrine acceptable to everyone,'' John Paul said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/garden/hers.html,"LATELY I have been observing a cruel, almost combative hostility toward children that amounts to a new ''cult of toughness.'' I first noticed it in 1979 when the United Nations International Year of the Child - a global campaign to end poverty and provide health and human rights to all children - was attacked by a number of groups, including Americans Against Abortion, which called it ''an intense propaganda campaign to 'liberate' children from their parents.'' The suggestion was that the millions of starving children were merely rebellious little brats who deserved no help at all. In 1980 I watched delegates convened to address the problems of children and families turn the White House Conference on Families into a forum for parental vituperation. Dozens of male delegates skipped over family economics, housing, violence and stress to rail against children who disobey their fathers (and to predict consequent doom for all other authority figures in Western civilization). A man who accused government job programs of ''coddling'' kids later acknowledged bitterly that he had been unemployed for 18 months. Several people sidetracked discussions of child abuse with a defense of corporal punishment. Why is spanking children so important? I asked one man. ''To teach them who's boss,'' he answered. The refrain became familiar: too many kids ''talk back''; they get ''big-shot ideas'' from television and books; they ''think the world owes them a living.'' The common enemy was ''permissiveness,'' the preferred cure ''discipline.'' For years various religious and political fundamentalists have validated parents' anger and offered relief in the form of authoritarian certainties. The Indiana Moral Majority leader, Greg Dixon, for example, engineered a weakening of his state's child-abuse laws in 1981 because ''the Bible instructs parents to whip their children with a rod.'' The Rev. Mr. Dixon insists that ''welts and bruises are a sign that a parent is doing a good job of discipline.'' More recently the new cult of toughness has found expression in books such as ''The Coming Parent Revolution,'' ''Back in Control,'' ''Toughlove,'' ''Dare to Discipline'' and ''Spank Me if You Love Me.'' Appealing to readers who are more interested in learning to  control  children than care for them, these books tend to underplay children's suffering and glorify parent power in the name of either God or the Family. ''We can trace to the Puritans the idea that children are inherently bad and it is up to adults to cleanse them of their evil,'' said Edward F. Zigler, professor of psychology at Yale and head of the psychology section of the Child Study Center there. ''Those who argue against heavy disipline may be accused of being too tender-minded, but today there is total consensus among behavioral scientists that hard disipline is counterproductive. It only teaches children that people who are big and strong can do what they want.'' Much of the get-tough impulse seems to originate in adult insecurity and the American fixation with power hierarchies. (Who's in charge? Who's on top? Who's No. 1?) When grown-ups feel powerless, one response is to take it out on children. ''Most concrete kinds of violence come from adults who are themselves vulnerable in some way,'' commented Dr. Robert Coles, the child psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard. ''For instance, when unemployment strikes, children become objects for adult rage and frustration. Among men especially, violence toward children is connected to bitter feelings of worthlessness and powerlessness.''  Children have always been readily available scapegoats for female impotence and anger. But now, without animals to tame or frontiers to conquer, with no control over economic conditions and world events, with women in revolt and machines displacing workers, men may look to children as the last subjects of male domination. When gender, class and racial supremacy fail, who but children will anchor the bottom of the chain of command? The truth is that many people who consider themselves child-loving sentimentalists love only docile and respectful children. They are not so fond of independent, free-thinking, quirky or opinionated children who are critical of adults. The defiant child magnifies adult impotence. The vulnerable child reminds us of our human frailty. The self-sufficient child proves us dispensable. Believing that children are intrinsically bad frees adults to be cruel and punitive. In many cases the psychological and political dynamics of power are intertwined. Some people with heavy responsibilities can live with their envy of carefree youth only if adults have the ultimate control of children's freedom; these people oppose any advance in children's rights for fear it will rob them of that edge. Other people feel their educational or intellectual superiority threatened by precocious children who are ''too smart for their own good'' or by child advocates whom they accuse of ''trying to undermine parents' authority.'' Still others suffer the existential knowledge that each year added to a child's age is a year stolen from a parent's youth. Altogether these diffuse resentments can make children, the most powerless people of all, seem privileged - and give adults unconscious reasons to retaliate against them. Moreover, it is not just extremists who get tough on children and ignore their needs. Millions of moderate citizens protest the cost of public education, child-care centers, infant-health programs and food stamps, and worry about their property values when juvenile facilities are planned for their neighborhoods. In this supposed child-loving country most of us quietly tolerate a situation in which one disabled child in five is not getting an education and 13 percent of our 17-year-olds (47 percent of black youths) are functionally illiterate. The poorest people in the land are kids. More babies die at birth in the United States than in 14 other countries. One child in six gets no health care at all. Eighteen million have never seen a dentist. More than a million have serious drinking problems. A quarter of a million youngsters try to commit suicide annually (10,000 succeed) and homicide has become one of the five leading causes of children's deaths - with parents or step-parents responsible for a third of them. On official levels, mistreatment of children can mean cutting 28 percent of Federal nutrition programs or it can mean maintaining a public policy that answers real suffering with benign neglect. ''We may be a youth-oriented society,'' Dr. Coles commented, ''but what we love is youth, not children.'' A few weeks ago, during the Governors' Conference, 250 state officials from around the nation gathered in Portland, Maine, to consider state- initiated solutions to children's problems. The well-chosen title of their three-day symposium was: ''America's Children Need Powerful Friends.'' Given the obsession with adult power over children, the idea of using adult power for children is refreshing. Having ''powerful friends'' in high places is the only hope for those with neither the vote, the voice nor the economic clout to fight for themselves. The question is, as the cult of toughness gains more converts, where are children's friends going to come from?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND BIG BUSINESS: A DELICATE BALANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/11/magazine/academic-research-and-big-business-a-delicate-balance.html,"HOWARD M. GOODMAN IS A brilliant molecular biologist and dedicated teacher. And, in this revolutionary era of corporate science, he has also become an astute businessman. Two and a half years ago, Goodman made a singular proposal to the officers of the West German- based Hoechst A.G., one of the world's largest chemical companies: Give me enough money to create a 100-person department of molecular biology at an American university, guarantee me 10 years of unrestricted basic research and, in exchange, I'll let you see what I do. Hoechst's response was to offer Goodman nearly $70 million, probably the largest single grant ever made in biology. When it came to writing a contract, Hoechst negotiated an important extra for itself: If Goodman should turn up something potentially marketable, Hoechst would have the exclusive option to license and develop it. The company would not, however, have the right to suggest moneymaking directions the research might take. Hoechst was happy, in spite of its limited role, and so was Howard Goodman. Others were more skeptical. Every institution that depends on the Federal Government for any or all of its financing is staring in the face of a $200 billion national deficit that continues to grow beyond the control of even a conservative Republican President, and that, paradoxically, seems to leave less money for everyone. The university is no exception. Federal funding for basic scientific research increased at a healthy rate of 5.9 percent annually - after inflation - between 1976 and 1980. Then the rate of increase came to a virtual standstill and, in fact, declined slightly. President Reagan's fiscal 1984 budget request proposes an 8.5 percent increase for basic science - well above the projected inflation rate of about 5 percent. But although the new figure sounds generous, it is influenced somewhat by a 10.3 percent increase for Defense Department basic research. Funds for basic research in the health sciences are slated to increase by only 3 percent. And at the National Institutes of Health, which finance 40 percent of all biomedical research in the country, the proposed increase of $73 million (for a total budget of $4.1 billion) is only 1.8 percent. The N.I.H. pays for nearly two-thirds of basic university science. The irony is that new discoveries in the life sciences are proliferating at an unprecedented rate. In molecular biology, the possibilities that have emerged in the last four or five years seem, to layman and specialist alike, positively breathtaking. Researchers in this field are synthesizing insulin and growth hormone as well as interferon and some vaccines that were previously rare, expensive or unavailable. New techniques for investigating cancer and other diseases, as well as all sorts of genetic disorders, are also within the realm of this research. Applications of genetic-engineering techniques to agriculture will result in equally revolutionary changes, probably within the next two decades. Scientists talk about genetically engineered bacteria that will eat up oil spills and pollutants, about cloning livestock, about developing pest-resistant and self-fertilizing strains of food crops. The technology is there. All that is lacking is money. For the cost of this research is also burgeoning at the very moment when traditional sources of funding seem to be evaporating like liquid nitrogen in a chemistry-class experiment. President Reagan would like to shift the burden for many Federal programs from the public to the private sector. And in the sciences, the private sector is more than willing to take on that burden, for the potential profit to be reaped in these fields is enormous. Industry, which earlier predicted and profited from the commercial possibilities of electronics and chemistry, is now investing its money in biotechnology. Hoechst's $70 million has gone to Massachusetts General Hospital - the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most highly respected health-care and teaching institutions in the country. Mass. General (as it is widely known) is not the only eminent institution to open the doors of its biomedical research labs to industry. In recent months, several companies have given huge sums of money in return for promises of patents or licenses that might derive from various lines of research. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company gave Harvard Medical School $6 million to be used by its department of genetics. The Celanese Corporation gave Yale $1.1 million for enzyme studies; the Bristol-Myers Company gave Yale $3 million for the production of anticancer drugs; W. R. Grace & Company gave M.I.T. up to $8.5 million for commercial applications of microbi= ology research. Monsanto gave $23.5 million to Washington University for research in medical uses of proteins and peptides and $4 million to Rockefeller University for research in photosynthesis. (Monsanto also gave $23 million to Harvard in 1977, for cancer research.) Where industry hasn't nudged its way into the university, it is luring scientists out. So many academics have been hired as part-time consultants to industry that, a year or two ago, an investment company looking for an unaffiliated molecular biologist reportedly approached 20 researchers before it found one without a commercial tie. Today, scientists agree, it would be difficult to find even that one among the top researchers, so rapid and comprehensive has the entanglement with industry been. Some scientists have quit academia altogether. Among the most notable is Walter Gilbert, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who gave up a tenured position at Harvard when he became chief executive officer of the multinational firm Biogen S.A., which he also helped to found. Other academics have also established their own companies. Genentech Inc., formed by scientists from the University of California, looked so promising that its stock jumped from $35 to $88 a share within hours of its first public offering in October 1980. (Genentech soon leveled off, and in late August was trading at about $43 a share.) Harvard, not wanting to miss the biotechnology boom, tried out another step in the university-industry waltz. That same October, it announced that it was considering forming its own profit-making biotechnology company, of which it would be a minority stockholder. The uproar over conflict of interest that greeted this plan made the front pages of newspapers around the country. Three weeks later, Harvard abandoned the plan. Mark F. Ptashne, the Harvard biochemist who conceived the idea, went on to found the independent Genetics Institute with another Harvard molecular biologist, Thomas P. Maniatis. Both remain on the Harvard faculty. Expectations for quick profits from biotechnology have moderated somewhat since then. Genetic-engineering research has turned out to be more expensive and more time-consuming than was initially predicted, and analysts have pushed the projection of big profits farther into the future. But no one doubts that they are there. When Biogen went public this spring, the entire $57.5 million offering was sold out by the start of trading the day it was first publicly offered. If the potential profits are enormous, so are the potential problems that go with this shift in funding. The university had long held profit-making and collaboration with profit-makers at arm's length. Basic research - the scientific quest for knowledge that may or may not lead to anything practical and that underlies most subsequent applied uses of science - has been the scientist's purest enterprise. But basic research does not often yield measurable profits. And if industry ever supplants the Federal Government as the primary supporter of basic research, many fear that it may not tolerate possibly pointless meandering by scientists who could be zeroing in on needed and profitable products. Is research conducted under profit-making auspices an acceptable alternative to public-sponsored study? Academia is struggling with this question and its no less difficult corollaries: ''The motive force of industry is profit,'' Lawrence G. Crowley, the president of the Stanford University Hospital, recently told a Yale symposium, ''and the mode is secrecy and proprietary control of information. The motive force of the university is the pursuit of knowledge and the mode is open to an exchange of ideas and unrestricted publication. The question is whether these two worlds can be bridged . . .'' Will faculty appointments come to be determined by the amount of money a researcher can bring in rather than the quality of his work? Will the quality of teaching deteriorate as professors are increasingly distracted by money-making consulting deals or grants from industry? Will applied research shoulder aside basic research as industry moves into the university? And if it does, who will do that essential work? And where? Can the scientist continue to fulfill his traditional obligations to society if his salary is being paid by industry? The Hoechst contract provides an opportunity to look in detail at some of these issues. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IS A new field, and the top molecular biologists, like Howard Goodman, are young, capable and efficient. The legendary absent- minded professor would drown in the sea of grant proposals, research papers and administrative and teaching duties that are an inescapable part of the modern scientist's life. Such demands notwithstanding, one recent morning in Boston, as Goodman and I were finishing a discussion during breakfast about the need for today's scientists to be organized, he began patting his pockets and searching through his coat. Then he announced sheepishly that he had locked his keys in the car. Goodman has intense blue eyes, sandy hair, a red beard and the energetic, encouraging manner of a college basketball coach. He speaks the arcane language of molecular biology with the distinctive twang of Brooklyn, where he was born, and Long Island, where he grew up. After studying physics at Williams College in Massachusetts, he received his Ph.D. in biophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He did postgraduate work at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, and in Geneva, where he met Deborah Cohen, whom he married in 1969. (Their daughter, Sylena, was born six years later.) In 1970, he moved to the University of California at San Francisco. There, in 1977, a year after he was made a full professor, he, William J. Rutter and other U.C.S.F. colleagues succeeded in transplanting the genetic instructions for making insulin from a rat cell to an E. coli bacterium. This was the first time scientists had transferred the genetic code for the manufacture of insulin, or any other hormone, and it was a crucial development in recombinant DNA technology. At the age of 41, when Goodman approached Hoechst, he was a major figure in the field of molecular biology. He was also well known to Hoechst, having served briefly as a Hoechst consultant in the late 1970's. The chemical company wasted no time signing him on. Seven months after Goodman's proposal, the ''Hoechst department,'' as the journal Science irreverently referred to it, was a fait accompli . The only major change was in location. Goodman had hoped to set up the department at San Francisco, but the bureaucracy of a public university proved too much of an obstacle. Massachusetts General was simultaneously wooing Goodman to head a proposed department of molecular biology. And when Goodman decided to make the move, he offered Mass. General the unexpected dividend of Hoechst's $70 million. A year and a half later, Goodman was at work, having assembled a preliminary staff of 50, which included Frederick Ausubel, a plant physiologist from Harvard University. Senior researchers like Ausubel are recommended by a search committee and appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty after consultation with Hoechst, which does not have the power to veto a candidate. Ausubel was attracted by the opportunity to pursue research projects that he might have found difficult to fund elsewhere. Postdoctoral fellows in Goodman's lab are ''the cream of the crop,'' according to one staffer. They are mostly graduates of the top Ph.D. programs in biological sciences, including those at M.I.T., the University of Wisconsin and Harvard. The doctoral candidates also are among the most promising graduates of Harvard, Radcliffe and U.C.S.F. Staff members, from Goodman to the technicians to the secretaries, are paid according to N.I.H. and Mass. General standards. Their salaries are not affected by the Hoechst contract. Goodman prefers not to discuss his own salary. Goodman occupies a tiny modern office in the department's provisional quarters at Mass. General's Jackson Tower. A permanent laboratory, almost three times the size of the two spacious floors already alloted to Goodman's staff, is scheduled to open in the new Wellman Research Building next year. The Jackson lab is open and bright, with high Formica- topped work tables jutting out from one wall like Manhattan piers in the Hudson River. Refrigerators, centrifuges and other equipment line the opposite wall. The Wellman lab will be built on the same design but a larger scale. Nearly $20 million of Goodman's funds from Hoechst will cover renovation, construction and equipment for the two laboratories. Despite the fact that Howard Goodman has a little more money to spend, and less paperwork to do to get it, the day-to-day operations of his lab are pretty much standard procedure for a university environment. The smoothness of his operation, however, was not achieved effortlessly. Mass. General, Hoechst and Goodman spent months negotiating a contract that would insure this seemingly ''normal'' procedure. Goodman wanted no restrictions on the kind of work he could do. His own interest is principally in the control and regulation of a certain type of gene, particularly genes that trigger the production of hormones. He is continuing his long-term study of insulin and is also working with growth hormone. (As an incidental part of this work, Goodman and his colleagues are trying to develop animal models for human genetic diseases.) A second general area of study in Goodman's lab is the process of tumor formation in plants afflicted with crown- gall disease. Ordinarily, tumor formation is studied by injecting an animal virus into mice. But in these afflicted plants, tumors are formed naturally, and the plant thus provides a unique opportunity for analyzing the process. Frederick Ausubel is studying symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Ausubel's team (and researchers elsewhere) would like to figure out how to improve the nitrogen-fixing capability of plants. Ultimately, they hope to make plants, especially the major cereal crops, able to fix nitrogen directly from the air. ''This would have the most significant impact of any one thing in genetic engineering,'' Ausubel says, adding that it is far in the future. The contract with Hoechst insures that Goodman's lab is free to pursue these interests as the scientists see fit. In many cases of corporate funding for chemistry, electronics and applied physics, when industry has given money it has also assumed the right to dictate what should and should not be studied. Mass. General felt this would be an abrogation of one of the most basic of academic freedoms. Arthur L. Caplan, an ethicist at the Hastings Center, an organization that deals with ethical issues in the life sciences, agrees. He feels that most universities give up too much in this regard in exchange for corporate dollars. ''When you take money from companies, there are almost always strings attached,'' he said recently in an interview in his office overlooking the institute's well-kept Westchester County grounds. ''It's not that the Government doesn't tell its grantees what to do,'' he continued. ''There are restrictions about how fast research must proceed, report data that has to be filed and so on. But it's a different way of dictating how research should be done from what a company says.'' The amount of money the Government allots to different areas of research is an indirect form of Federal restriction, he adds. A cancer researcher, for example, has probably found it easier to be financed in the last two decades than someone working on a less targeted disease. Companies funnel research in a different way. ''Research is pushed in the direction of productivity - not toward what will lead to the greatest scientific knowledge or what will do the most good for those who have the greatest need,'' said Caplan. Since he is not an academic and is therefore removed from the fray, Caplan can, perhaps, be somewhat Olympian in his observations. He gloomily predicts an inevitable increase in ''mission-oriented'' research in universities - applied as opposed to basic studies. ''Companies rarely encourage fishing expeditions,'' he said. But it is through fishing expeditions that some of the greatest breakthroughs are made. A 1976 study of the origins of 10 important clinical advances in the last 30 years found that ''basic research . . . pays off in terms of key discoveries almost twice as handsomely as other types of research and development combined.'' So far Hoechst has not attempted to promote any one direction of research, perhaps because the company feels that it has so little knowledge of molecular biology that anything Goodman discovers will be acceptable. ''The only restriction is that research must be in the field of molecular biology,'' says William H. Griesar, the New York attorney who represented Hoechst in the contract negotiations. ''We don't want Goodman tinkering with combustion engines.'' Goodman's response on hearing this was typically feisty: ''He may not want us tinkering with combustion engines, but we could. I don't think the contract prohibits us from doing anything. It just suggests that the general area of interest is molecular biology.'' Hoechst entered into the contract in the first place, Griesar says, because it wanted to expand its pharmaceutical division and knew that it needed a ''sudden infusion of knowledge'' in the field of biotechnology. That knowledge wasn't available in West Germany, so Hoechst was delighted and interested when Goodman came forward with his proposal. (The German public was not so delighted when it heard about this exodus of German cash.) ''The Germans felt that they'd fallen behind. And they had,'' Griesar says. Hoechst may or may not make money on what comes out of Goodman's lab. An often-quoted formula is that only one in 10 discoveries results in a patent, one in 10 patents results in a license, and one in 10 licenses yields more than $25,000 a year. Griesar asserts that, at any rate, patents are not the point. ''Hoechst came into this with a student mentality,'' he insists. ''You could say it was like buying a library card for one of the better libraries in the world in genetic engineering.'' At close to $70 million over a 10-year period, it is an expensive library card, but still a minuscule portion of Hoechst's annual budget of $270 million for pharmaceutical research. For Hoechst, Griesar says, the most important inducement was that Goodman would permit Hoechst scientists to observe firsthand what he was doing. The contract stipulates that Hoechst may send up to four trainees at a time to work in the department, provided only that they have acceptable academic qualifications. Dr. Hansgeorg Gareis, the chief Hoechst negotiator and a biochemist by training, seemed to feel that once his delegates were in the laboratory, they could take what they had learned back to West Germany and develop patentable inventions there. The agreement permits Hoechst to develop the expertise to produce moneymaking products while allowing Goodman to pursue basic research. For Mass. General this is a crucial aspect of the contract. Research and development are inextricably linked in the corporate scientific world; many university scientists make the transition from academy to corporation and back again without hesitation. But both Goodman and the hospital felt that within the university environment, basic and applied science must be kept separate, or at least that the intention of developing products must be kept out. ''It becomes a fine line,'' Goodman admits. ''I don't see it happening, but I can't say that there won't be a case where the practical and the scientific are so close together that it wouldn't be worth doing that one more step. But I think it's better done in a directed way by a company that has a motive for doing it.'' Other industry-university collaborations have not drawn such a clear distinction between basic and applied research. Monsanto's contract with Washington University, signed in June 1982, is more typical. It specifies that the researchers direct 30 percent of their work toward basic knowledge and 70 percent toward specific product development. Nevertheless, the Hoechst patent department wanted a guarantee that nobody else was going to make money on its investment. It was therefore written into the contract that any inventions made by researchers funded exclusively by Hoechst would result in exclusive licenses to Hoechst, with Mass. General retaining the patent. The contract guarantees the department $49.7 million between 1981 and 1990 for operating costs. If in any one year Goodman should want to exceed its yearly budget (he doesn't foresee doing it), which averages out to $6 million a year beginning in 1984, the contract gives Hoechst first-refusal rights to the funding of any additional research. If the company declines to finance the proposed research, Goodman or his colleagues may apply to the N.I.H. or other Government sources or (with written notice to Hoechst) to another corporation. Goodman and Mass. General are satisfied that this is a more than adequate guarantee of the right to pursue any research projects they choose. The potential for misuse of Government funds under that very guarantee, however, led to an investigation by Representative Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the subcommittee on investigations and oversight of the House Committee on Science and Technology. ''Is a foreign chemical company skimming the cream produced by decades of taxpayer-funded work?'' Gore asked at the start of a two- day hearing in June 1981. Unsatisfied by the testimony of Dr. Ronald Lamont-Havers, the director of research at Mass. General, Gore requested a copy of the then confidential contract, which he later submitted to the United States Comptroller General for scrutiny. The Comptroller found no illegality in the contract - no misuse of the more than $30 million a year in N.I.H. funding that Mass. General receives. At the same time, however, the Comptroller's report warned that ''care must be taken . . . that no Federal funds directly or indirectly support the research leading to an invention if M.G.H. is to claim that the terms of a (Government) funding agreement do not apply.'' (A footnote adds that an invention funded by the N.I.H. may be used as a ''building block'' for an invention funded exclusively by Hoechst.) In spite of assurances from the hospital that it was willing to comply and despite statements of confidence in this willingness by the N.I.H., Representative Gore remains skeptical. In a recent interview, he expressed concern about a clause in the contract that says in the case of discoveries made with collaborative funding, Hoechst shall pursue ''the most favorable license obtainable,'' ideally, an exclusive worldwide license. That same clause, however, goes on to say that ''in any event a nonexclusive worldwide license'' would do. Gore is also worried that Hoechst-sponsored scientists may be sharing equipment bought with N.I.H. funds, or in other ways indirectly benefiting from taxpayer money. For Goodman, this turn of events is ironic: ''I would have thought the hard thing would be to convince Hoechst to make this as open as it is, and I was surprised that the Government came in and said, in effect, 'Look, you better build a wall, a fence around yourselves, so you don't contaminate the Government things.' '' The N.I.H. itself is confident that it is getting its due. Dr. William F. Raub, the deputy director of extramural research and training at the N.I.H., was the chairman of a committee that made an inspection visit to Boston in December 1981. ''What we found on our site visit,'' he says, ''was that Mass. General had anticipated virtually every problem that any of us could think of and had made provisions - we thought to the very best of their ability - to insure that first and foremost the obligations of Mass. General to U.S. funding sources, primarily the N.I.H., would be honored.'' In a way, the fact that Hoechst is a foreign company is a red herring, for the deeper issues - the issues that are causing responsible academics to search their scientific souls - are irrelevant to the company's country of origin. Product-oriented research isn't the only concern of those who question industrial-academic agreements. Another is that scientists, knowing there is potential profit at stake for them or their funder, may become secretive about their work. The Monsanto-Washington University contract has a secrecy clause written in. According to the contract, technical developments may not be published without the agreement of Monsanto and, until publication, such developments must remain secret for a period of two years, with a two-year renewal option. Even more unusual for university science (but standard for industry) is the clause in the same contract that says that under certain circumstances faculty may be required to sign ''personal commitments of confidentiality.'' Goodman is sure there will be no such inhibitions in his lab. The Mass. General contract says that scientists will be free to collaborate ''with others.'' ''It's such a free- flowing thing,'' says Goodman, ''that anything is almost instantaneously communicated.'' Moreover, Goodman and the other senior researchers in the department will all be on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. In addition to being chairman of the department of molecular biology, Goodman is a professor in the genetics department and plans to work closely with Philip Leder, that department's chairman. Leder's work is paid for, in part, by Du Pont. Although Goodman is expected to give several lectures at the medical school, his teaching duties will mostly take place in the lab. Science is a collaborative pursuit. Communication between scientists is essential. One idea leads to another, and a scientist these days rarely discovers anything all by himself. The method of formal communication is the publication of papers. The Hoechst agreement requires Mass. General scientists to submit papers to Hoechst at least 30 days in advance of submission to a journal, so the Hoechst patent lawyers can make sure that anything patentable is not made public before the rights have been secured. Ordinarily, a Mass. General scientist submits a patent disclosure to the hospital's Office of Technology Administration (set up in 1978 to monitor patenting and consulting arrangements) when he first realizes he might have something patentable but before he is ready to publish his findings. Under the Hoechst contract, the scientist still submits that disclosure to the O.T.A., but the administrator must immediately advise the company of the invention. The researcher will also submit a draft of the final paper directly to Hoechst, although the company cannot request a delay in publication. The Washington University contract, perhaps more typical because it is oriented toward developmental research, gives Monsanto the right to request a delay in publication ''for a reasonably brief period.'' In spite of this and other restrictions, Dr. David M. Kipnis, head of the department of internal medicine at Washington, testified at a Gore committee hearing in June 1982 that he was confident that ''this arrangement will in no way hamper the free flow of scientific information.'' Everyone involved in industrial financing of academic research professes allegiance to the principle of academic freedom, but to critics the problem is exactly how this freedom is to be insured. There have been several meetings recently to discuss these issues, including one at Pajaro Dunes, Calif., in March 1982 and another in Philadelphia last December. The results of these gatherings have been strong on principle but vague on particulars. Last year, in response to a request from Representative Gore, the Association of American Universities put out a five-page statement outlining suggestions for guidelines for corporate-university collaborations. These included some broad general principles and announced the intention to set up a clearinghouse for future discussions. Increasingly, universities have been publishing their own guidelines for outside consulting work done by researchers. Most universities restrict the amount of a faculty member's consulting work. Harvard, Stanford, Yale and M.I.T. permit scientists to devote one day a week to consulting for industry. ''How do you qualify a scientist's time?'' asks M.I.T.'s Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist, David Baltimore, who, like Goodman, divides his day between science and administering a large, well- endowed department. ''Are you in an administrative or research mode when you write a grant proposal? And what about the 'shower-time' issue? What do you think about when you're in the shower? When you're not at the university?'' Last December, Yale announced that it would require annual disclosure by faculty members of consulting arrangements or substantial investment in a corporation. The University of California recently required faculty members to disclose their holdings, and as a result of those disclosures, forced three professors to end or alter corporate-sponsored research grants. (In one case, the professor in charge of the university laboratory was also president and sole owner of the sponsoring company.) Harvard, which published similar guidelines in May, had earlier insisted that Walter Gilbert give up either his tenured chair or his executive position with Biogen. Gilbert responded by giving up academe altogether. Neither Harvard Medical School nor Mass. General has made public its policies, but Howard Goodman says that the hospital requires disclosure of financial interests to the department chairman, who in turn reports to the Office of Technology Administration. Most schools are muddling along on their own, for now. Massachusetts General hopes that its Hoechst contract will serve as a model. John Robert Buchanan, a physician whose smoothness contrasts with the gruff informality of preoccupied scientists like Goodman and Baltimore, became general director of Mass. General after the Hoechst agreement was signed. Although the venture is not without risks, he says he is glad they did it. ''I think it's one of our responsibilities,'' he said. ''This kind of institution is in place, in part, to do things that are innovative, departures from the usual and customary. We do it in all kinds of endeavors. That's our social role.'' (Nevertheless, the full text of the Hoechst contract was not released until October 1981, five months after it was signed and four months after Representative Gore threatened to subpoena the material. When asked about this, Buchanan said that he was glad it had been made public and suggested that the hospital had been trying to avoid the controversy over detail that arises in such situations.) Buchanan - like others responsible for finding money to pay for research - sees private support as insurance. ''I guess if you were to ask me if it were better to support basic research from multiple bases,'' he says, ''even mindful that some of these bases carry conditions to which we are not fully accustomed, I'd have to say yes, that the potential good outweighs the risks, even though the risks may be regarded as grave by some.'' He does not believe that the Hoechst contract should be seen as a single base of support because, he says, ''support from other areas is not precluded. ''Obviously, I'd like to see the agreement renewed,'' he adds, ''but over the time of that guaranteed support, wise and prudent people would be seeking support through competitive mechanisms of the N.I.H. and others. And I believe that certain investigators coming into the laboratory will bring with them a certain amount o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 support, which we won't ask them to give up.'' Buchanan would also like to see Goodman's staff apply for Federal grants because this would keep them within the competitive process, which includes a review of the proposal by a group of the scientists'peers chosen by the N.I.H. One of the less-than-perfect aspects of even the best corporate arrangements is the loss of this peer review, which is an intrinsic part of N.I.H. funding. The Hoechst agreement attempts to compensate for this by providing for regular meetings of a scientific advisory committee, made up of two representatives from Mass. General, two from Hoechst, and four from outside academic institutions, chosen by the commit= tee itself. But Buchanan still prefers the N.I.H. peer review. ''It just isn't possible to get the same array of talent and energy to the process that the N.I.H. can mount,'' he says. Scientists at other institutions agree. David Baltimore is the director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at M.I.T., an administratively independent research facility set up with money given by the industrialist Edwin C. Whitehead; it also has seen its share of controversy. ''With something like Hoechst,'' says David Baltimore, whose research projects are still financed primarily by the Federal Government, ''young investigators aren't able to establish a track record. When they go out into the real world they may find it hard to get along.'' Baltimore also feels that the N.I.H. process makes a scientist ''accountable'' in a public way - scientifically accountable. Some fear that researchers in this lucrative field will be corrupted by money once the purity of the university is breached. (''Virginity'' is a word that constantly recurs in these discussions.) Derek C. Bok, the president of Harvard, thinks not. ''The quality of disinterestedness has never been universally achieved in practice,'' he writes in his book, ''Beyond the Ivory Tower: Social Responsibilities of the Modern University.'' ''Even Galileo tried to sell his inventions for money.'' Modern-day Galileos are motivated by ''competition, the lure of prizes, the snares of vanity and fame.'' Still, Harvard's guidelines for outside consul= tation include not just a time limitation but also a proscription on assuming an executive position in a corporation, if there is a conflict of interest. Many consultants are paid a flat fee for their work, but sometimes corporations issue stock or stock options instead. Some critics believe that this is when a potential conflict of interest arises, since a consultant may own a substantial portion of a company and continue to work for the university. The stock can be valuable. When Collaborative Research Inc. announced that it was going public in December 1981, it was reported that David Baltimore, who had obviously been a valued consultant, owned 316,965 shares of stock, estimated to be worth between $16 and $19 a share. Walter Gilbert's 460,000 shares of Biogen make him a paper millionaire many times over, as the stock traded at about $15 a share in late August. Gilbert, of course, is no longer associated with Harvard. As for Baltimore, neither he nor M.I.T. feels that his holdings pose a conflict. ''From the point of view of taking advantage of the university research laboratory,'' Baltimore said, ''it doesn't matter if you have an equity interest in an outside company. It's the time spent away from the university that could be significant. But as long as you are conscious of the fact that your primary loyalty is to the university, there should be no problem.'' One point that everyone agrees on is that the funding of research must continue to be primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government. ''The N.I.H. must always be the major supporter of biomedical research in this country,'' says Ronald Lamont-Havers of Mass. General, who also supports industry's role in the university. He seems to enjoy discussing the ethical opposition to his position, as he leans back precariously in his chair with his feet up on the desk. ''Industry can't hope to cover the tremendous breadth of research in biomedical areas,'' he admits, pointing out that all sorts of discoveries might be lost if industry tried to take over: ''No one can predict in what areas the great advances will come.'' Further, industry makes almost no contribution to the training of young scientists, Dr. Lamont- Havers says. The money goes to well-established figures. That training, of course, is crucial. ''Industry taking over the bulk of support would be disastrous.'' But - and here critics of industrial support may part company with him - ''industrial support as a supplement provides an important element of stability.'' In a sparsely furnished upstairs office at his home in Cambridge, I talked with Sheldon Krimsky, an associate professor of urban and environmental policy at Tufts University. A former member, along with Baltimore, of the Federal recombinant DNA advisory committee, Krimsky is worried. ''We've always had scientists who could blow the whistle when something seemed to be going amiss,'' he says. ''And now fewer and fewer of these people are available, because of the industry ties. We need someone who can ask where the technology is moving.'' Earlier, Art Caplan at the Hastings Center had expressed much the same sentiment: ''I worry about scientists becoming what we in the ethics trade call 'double agents.' A classic example is when a physician works in industrial health. Who is his master?'' To illustrate his point, Caplan mentioned the asbestos industry, in which company doctors for years failed to reveal the dangers of working with the toxic mineral. Representative Gore, too, sees a need for disinterested scientists: ''Our public policy makers are going to be presented in the next few years with problems that will be just excruciating - that may resemble in difficulty the questions surrounding abortion: decisions about trait selection, cloning, sex selection.'' Still, for Howard Goodman the Hoechst agreement is pretty close to ideal. It should be, since he wrote it. His original five-page proposal has been realized in almost every detail. He believes that the major effects have been extremely positive. ''We can take a chance on doing some more interesting science sometimes,'' he explains. Because Goodman and his colleagues aren't constantly applying for grants, they don't have to be constantly showing results. Most private and public funding situations are highly pressured these days. There just isn't enough money to go around. ''If you have a grant for three years, and you're not fairly productive, well, you're not going to get re-funded,'' Goodman says. ''That pressure probably produces a lot of good science, but you tend to see people doing the bread-and- butter problems, the ones they know are going to work. We have more flexibility. We have some stability. We can take on the more interesting but chancy kind of experiment.'' So for all the controversy, and in spite of the difficult questions of principle it raises, for Howard Goodman the arrangement works. ''The proof of the pudding is that we have great people, and on all the floors on every bench at all hours of the day and night people are doing science,'' he says. ''By and large everybody is happy.'' Massachusetts General Hospital is a powerful and prestigious institution. That it was able to negotiate a contract favorable to its interests, and which appeared to preserve academic freedom," indicates that it may be possible for the university and industry to coexist. But whether this kind of agreement turns out to be the rule or the exception remains to be seen. Mass. General was in a negotiating position that few institutions can equal. Hoechst needed the kind of knowledge the medical center could provide. Dr. Goodman was an exceptional lure. Other institutions may have a harder time preserving their independence against the interests of their benefactors.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRIVACY VS. COMPUTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/12/opinion/privacy-vs-computers.html,"Dramatic advances in information technology that allow computerized data banks to communicate with one another have far outpaced the development of legal controls that protect individual freedom. Unless something is done, we may be heading for a time when one's ability to exercise control over personal information about oneself is, as a practical matter, a thing of the past. Obviously, Government dossier-building long predates the computer. And, as the exploits of J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Investigation attest, manually kept records, containing factual data and the gossipy observations that defy computer coding, can wreak havoc with individual lives and, indeed, with our political system. Still, the relative inefficiency of the manual systems was a safeguard of sorts. The Federal Government's appetite for data about its citizens is insatiable. It is estimated, for example, that the Government maintains an average of 15 files on each American. And a study by New York State's Committee on Open Government two years ago found that state agencies kept 1,776 separate data systems containing 10,799 categories of information about New Yorkers. Each different system contained between two million and 10 million records. What is this information that the Government finds so crucial? It runs the gamut from tax and business records to certain medical prescriptions and records pertaining to abortions. Only last June, it was reported that New York drivers participating in the state's drinking driver program had to complete a questionnaire about their sex lives as a condition for reinstating their licenses. Once the data is gathered, it usually remains on file whether it is needed or not. v Add the capacity to link one data bank to another and the potential for social control multiplies. About half of the information held by New York State agencies is regularly shared with other Federal and state agencies. Computer-matching programs, in which one agency checks its records against another's or those of a business, have become common. Thus, information collected by one agency for a specific, often routine and rather innocuous purpose can be used by another agency for a different end. Consider the following examples: * To facilitate an investigation of Spanish-surname households in order to locate illegal aliens, the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service sought - unsuccessfully - to gain access last year to the New York City Board of Education's computerized file of one million students. * The Selective Service System cross-checks draft registration lists with Social Security and motor vehicle records to apprehend young men who have failed to register. * The Internal Revenue Service has just announced that it will match ''life style'' data compiled by various business information services with its own files to trigger tax audits. The list goes on and on. Regardless of the use to which they are put, these procedures raise a host of complicated and important issues, including the right against self-incrimination, the presumption of innocence and the right to personal privacy, that have yet to be adequately addressed. The legal protections so carefully worked out in the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 have been rendered largely ineffective and outmoded in the new computer age. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether computer-matching programs are as cost-effective as their proponents claim. The concern over computer-matching was the subject of Senate hearings last December, and continues to be an object of Congressional scrutiny. Closer to home, New York's recently enacted Personal Privacy Protection Law follows the lead of nine other states in requiring written standards to govern the collection, maintenance and dissemination of personal information. Beginning in 1984, New Yorkers will have the right to see a copy of most of the records held on them by state agencies, to challenge any inaccuracies and to see an account of disclosures from their files. It is too early to tell the degree to which the act will restrict use of computer-matching techniques. Disappointingly, the Committee on Open Government, which is charged with implementing the new law, is largely relegated to an advisory role, and certain health and criminal justice records are exempted from the law's coverage. Nonetheless, Governor Cuomo and the Legislature deserve credit for these first important steps forward. Without more such concerted efforts, personal privacy may become another victim of the computer revolution, like index cards alphabetized by last name and stored in metal file cabinets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR KINSEY INSTITUTE, NEW RESEARCH EFFORTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/14/garden/for-kinsey-institute-new-research-efforts.html,"THIRTY years ago today, when universities could still court ridicule and political reprisals for sponsoring research about human sexuality, the Alfred C. Kinsey Institute of Indiana University published ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,'' an 860-page book that documented America's changing views on sexual conduct and enhanced the effort to establish sex research as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry. The book, like its 1948 predecessor, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,'' quickly became a best seller and further established the Kinsey Institute, whose headquarters is in Bloomington, as a world leader in sex research, a role that persists. ''The response was tremendous,'' said Dr. Paul Gebhard, an associate of the late Dr. Kinsey in recalling the appearance of the book on women, which far exceeded the reaction to the first volume. ''Suddenly sex was no longer a taboo subject. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to know more about women's attitudes toward sex and what had influenced those attitudes. This was a far cry from the 1940's, when we started researching the sexual practices of both men and women. The public thought we were kooks then.'' Now, though hampered by continuing budgetary problems, the institute is continuing the work Dr. Kinsey pioneered. At the same time, under its new director, Dr. June Machover Reinsch, it is trying to broaden its scope in related fields and to encourage other scholars to tap its resources. Dr. Kinsey, a prominent zoologist who had spent most of his academic career studying wasps, decided to concentrate on human sexual behavior after he took a marriage-preparation course designed for students. In the late 1930's and 40's, when he began his studies of sexuality, he believed that it warranted objective, scientific research, so he and his small staff of anthropologists, statisticians and psychologists began conducting intensive interviews of men and women. When they undertook their project on women, interviewing 5,950 across the county, they found that half their subjects were not virgins when they married and that a fourth of married women had engaged in extramarital relations. Even more shocking to the public was the institute's finding that 77 percent of the married women who had engaged in premarital sex did not regret having done so. From its beginning in 1947 the institute had financial problems. Dr. Kinsey funded his initial studies out of his pocket and then persuaded Indiana University, the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Research Council, a Federal agency, to sponsor his investigations on a somewhat larger scale. As it turned out, the institute never received more than a few hundred thousand dollars from those sources. The institute's 1983-84 budget is in excess of $550,000, most of it from the Federal Government this time, which is not always the case. Although sex education and research have become more socially acceptable, funds are more difficult to find because the Federal Government and foundations are reluctant to support basic research such as that of Dr. Kinsey's. To appeal to more potential funding sources, the institute, in broadening its field, is undertaking research in prenatal development, menstrual disorders and other biomedical subjects once considered outside its sphere. Its new name, the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, reflects its new mission. The money crunch has also caused it to abandon Dr. Kinsey's policy of having all his researchers concentrate on one or two vast projects. It is supporting 10 smaller projects, ranging from a historical analysis of how the rise of Nazism affected the development of sexology to a psychological study of how personality traits and personal attitudes relate to stress and amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation. The changes in format, which began in 1981 when the university considered closing the institute but decided against it because of its wide reputation, have caused concern among the staff and other leaders in the field, who are worried about the direction of American sex research. ''The Kinsey Institute has had to get into biomedical research because that is the only way it can survive today,'' said Dr. John Money, professor of medical psychology and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and chairman of the institute's scientific advisory board. ''Many good projects like the ones Dr. Kinsey did cannot get funding today because the attitude is that sex research is frivolous and something that America can live without.'' The institute is working with endocrinologists and professionals from other disciplines because of the shortage of sex researchers. ''There are probably less than 100 professionals in the United States who devote more than 50 percent of their time to sex research,'' said Dr. Gebhard, who took over the institute after Dr. Kinsey's death in 1956 and retired as director in 1982. ''Unlike the 60's, people who might have gone into sex research are going into other fields because they can be assured of earning a living and getting promoted in academia.'' Dr. Wardell B. Pomeroy, a former Kinsey associate who is now academic dean of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco, believes that there is a backlash against sex research.''The efforts to rescind the abortion law and resistence to homosexuals makes it difficult for places like the Kinsey Institute to study controversial topics,'' he explained. Despite the risk the Kinsey Institute is continuing to support controversial research like that of Dr. Joseph Harry, a Northern Illinois University sociologist who is studying the differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals in suicide attempts. According to many who work in the field, much of the credit for the institute's new direction goes to Dr. Reinsch, a former New Yorker who became director in 1982. A pioneer in research on the effects of drugs on unborn children, she got the institute involved in an investigation of the underlying causes of sexual behavior. Her research at Rutgers University has shown that children exposed before birth to certain drugs are more likely than their unexposed siblings to respond aggressively when presented with hypothetical situations. She is now studying the long-term effects hormones taken by pregnant women have on children. Her grant of $204,300 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development was one of two major awards received by the institute during the 1982-83 academic year. Though her interest is in behavioral endocrinology and child development, Dr. Reinsch has made an effort to continue the more sociological and behavioral studies in the Kinsey pattern. In October, 16 high-school seniors from New York and other states will participate in a conference on adolescent life styles. They will be asked how students in their white upper-middle-class communities feel about sex education, contraception and other matters. The institute would like to expand the study to include black, working-class and other adolescents to get a more complete view. ''We also are considering re-interviewing the men and women who participated in the original studies because that would give us a good idea of how attitudes toward sex change over a lifetime,'' said Dr. Reinsch. ''Each year a few of them show up in Bloomington and tell us how much it meant to them to participate in those studies.'' Unlike the reticent Dr. Kinsey, who jealously guarded the institute's library and research materials, Dr. Reinsch has opened them up to scholars and the public. Lawyers have used the library to research cases on incest and historians have studied the institute's collection of erotica, said to be the largest in the world. Last year the small staff answered more than 1,300 requests for information. ''I'm hoping that the more scholars and the public know us the more they will support us,'' said Dr. Reinsch, who is no stranger to publicity, having worked as a promoter for the musical group Sly and the Family Stone before she went to graduate school. Dr. William H. Masters, chairman of the board of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis, commented: ''All of us working in the field owe a tremendous debt to Dr. Kinsey and the institute. If he had not had the determination to do his research and Indiana University had not had the courage to back him, my work in the physiology of sex would never have been possible. The institute will continue to play an important role in the field because it has set the standards for all of us.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLANNED PARENTHOOD DELETED FROM FEDERAL CHARITY DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/15/us/planned-parenthood-deleted-from-federal-charity-drive.html,"The Federal Office of Personnel Management today ousted Planned Parenthood from its annual Federal employee charity drive, handing anti-abortion groups a major victory. Donald Devine, the office's director, made the ruling after 10 days of hearings, after a Federal judge ordered him to hasten his decision. Mr. Devine said that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines for the drive. Planned Parenthood, which may fight the ruling in Federal court, had been a member of the Combined Federal Campaign for 14 years. The campaign is the Government's version of the United Way; it allows Federal workers to contribute to some 150 charities through one payroll deduction. Fraction of Group's Budget Last year, Planned Parenthood received about $500,000 from the campaign. The group has a $170 million budget. Dr. Richard Glasow, director of the education fund for the antiabortion National Right to Life Committee, praised the decision as an important step in challenging all Planned Parenthood fund-raising. Mr. Devine's decision essentially upheld a ruling by the campaign eligibility committee, which ruled two weeks ago that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines. Eligibility Standards Cited At the eligibility hearings, Right to Life asserted that Planned Parenthood received more than 50 percent of its funds from the Government and less than 20 percent from the public. Both were standards that could disallow participation in the employee campaign. Mr. Devine took the eligibility committee decision under advisement and held three more days of hearings on Planned Parenthood's application, but did not make a decision. ''This is an extremely important decision,'' said Mr. Glasow of Right to Life. ''It shows Planned Parenthood does not live up to regulations. ''It shows there are serious questions about their entire operation and that it represents to the Government things that are not true. This will cloud all of their financial fund-raising across the country.'' Motivation Is Assailed WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 (AP) - Planned Parenthood today asserted that its removal from a Federal employee charity drive was motivated by hostility to its activities in regard to abortion. Faye Wattleton, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that Mr. Devine of the Federal employee charity office had based his decision not to list Planned Parenthood on his publicly stated opposition to abortion. ''Mr. Devine has made no secret of his hostility to the activities of Planned Parenthood,'' she said. ''It is this hostility and not any of the various so- called technical issues that are at the root of his decision.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"IF THIS IS WASHINGTON, IT MUST BE 'HISPANIC WEEK'",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/16/us/if-this-is-washington-it-must-be-hispanic-week.html,"In proclaiming this as Hispanic Heritage Week, President Reagan has cast forth a Republican dragnet for that important voting group and left few appeals untried from what lately might be termed his Casa Blanca command post. The President, beaming under ''Viva Reagan'' banners, offered a few hesitant words of Spanish Wednesday night at the party's largest fund-raising dinner ever with by Hispanic supporters as hosts, and he hailed the group as preferring opportunity over ''welfare or handouts.'' Across the Potomac, a niche in the Pentagon's corridor of war heroes had been propitiously devoted to Hispanic soldiers. And down at the Department of Health and Human Services the first American Hispanic astronaut, Franklin Ramon Chang Diaz, was on hand for one of the half-dozen Hispanic-oriented ceremonies the Administration staged this week. ''We call it 'Hispanic Hysteria Week,' '' said Bob Neuman of the Democratic National Committee. He contended that the Administration's relentless two-month-old emphasis on the Hispanic vote was being viewed among Hispanic people as counterproductive pandering and had produced resentment. But Administration strategists say it has already paid off in improved opinion poll ratings for the President. 'Grand Stragety' Denied ''These guys don't know what subtlety is,'' Mr. Neuman complained, summarizing the point of Democrats and some independent Hispanic groups that the White House courting flies in the face of economic policies that have harmed Hispanic communities. Mr. Reagan himself rejected such complaints, asserting at one event this week, ''My concern is not something new or some grand campaign strategy.'' At an earlier event, the appointment of a Hispanic Republican, Katherine D. Ortega, as Treasurer of the United States, the President said Mrs. Ortega had been named ''not just because she is Hispanic.'' He thus affirmed that having some Spanish background does not hurt in Republican circles these days. Party officials candidly say the President is attempting to build a Hispanic voting buffer to offset expected damage among female and black voters in his presumed re-election bid. The Republicans' chief Hispanic leader, Tirso del Junco, a surgeon who is former party chairman in California, said that the first polling numbers on the President's Hispanic campaign showed Mr. Reagan's stock rebounding from recession lows back toward the 35 percent approval rating he is counting on. He contended that the party's Hispanic drive could entirely neutralize damage from women and blacks in Florida, and offset up to half of it in Texas and California. He's Hoping for More ''It's a question of where we have a better chance - in the black community where 80 percent of the people are against the death penalty, where 75 percent are in favor of abortion,'' he said, explaining why the focus was on the Hispanic rather than the black vote. ''I would hope the President does even more,'' Dr. del Junco said, dismissing the charge of pandering by stressing that the Hispanic rise in both parties was long overdue. Bettie Baca, his rival strategist at the Democratic National Committee, said she hoped Mr. Reagan kept it up, too, because heightened Hispanic political interest usually helps the Democrats most. Mrs. Baca, who is deputy vice chairman and director of Hispanic affairs for the Democrats, said that Hispanic Americans have long been a part of her party's executive council and not merely the ethnic ''auxiliary'' she feels the Republicans are hurriedly constructing. ''We don't feel the Hispanic community will buy into Reagan's rhetoric,'' Mrs. Baca said. ''Of course Hispanics are 'pro- family,' '' she continued, citing one of the President's themes. ''But they also want their families to have enough to eat.'' Enchiladas to the Queen Arnold S. Torres, director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said that right now the President might be enjoying short- lived publicity success. But once the campaign was under way, he said, Hispanic voters will look beyond the endorsements of affluent Hispanic Republcians for issues and substance and become more aware of what Mr. Torres summarized as a bad record of Aministration cuts in bilingual and other education programs, of nutrition aid cutbacks, of a weak and late starting record of Hispanic appointments and of attempting to remove the one Hispanic member of the United Statets Commission on Civil Rights as part of a general turnover of the panel. ''Mr. Reagan's idea of a statement to the Hispanic community is to point out he served enchiladas to the Queen,'' Mr. Torres said, referring to the luncheon that the Reagans gave at their ranch last summer for Queen Elizabeth II. ''Enchiladas to the queen! Come on!'' Privately, Republican strategists say even that line works well in the experienced hands of the President and within time-proven blandishments of ethnic politicking. Much more important politically, says Dr. del Junco, is the President's attention to Latin America as a major issue. Democrats, however, say the reaction of the Miami Hispanic community, which is largely anti-Castro, is one thing, while that of Hispanic people along the Texas border, who come from a different economic and political background, is quite another.

WOMEN'S BAR OFFERS AGENDA FOR ACTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/opinion/l-women-s-bar-offers-agenda-for-action-169843.html,"To the Editor: Enough is indeed enough! I write this letter on behalf of the New York Women's Bar Association, the largest of the 11 chapters of the Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, not so much in response to Marianne Stecich's Aug. 27 letter, as to set the record straight with respect to the history, purposes and accomplishments of the association. Although reasonable persons can differ on both the process and standards for evaluating candidates for judicial office, Miss Stecich's letter had little to do with that. Rather, it was an ad hominem attack on us that went beyond any fair comment. Ever since its incorporation in 1935, our association has been committed to and has pursued equality of opportunity and equal protection of the laws, the promotion of judicial reform, the elevation of the status of women. Our Legislative Committee studies, reports on and proposes legislation that is concerned with the advancement of women. It has helped effect the following changes in the laws of this state: Amendments to the Penal Law which eliminate the defenses of victim resistance and corroboration in rape cases, make it a violation of the Penal Law for a husband to beat his wife, and allow prosecution for rape by a separated husband under certain circumstances; funding for battered spouse shelters; the liberalization of abortion laws, and the securing of Medicaid funding for abortion. The N.Y.W.B.A. also sponsors the City Coalition on Child Sexual Abuse, made up of over 50 groups whose purposes include networking, community education, professional education, and legislation. The association does not endorse candidates for judicial office. It does, however, screen and rate them, based not upon gender or affiliation with our organization, but rather on character, experience, ability and a commitment to equal justice. We look forward to continuing our work for the advancement of women. MADELINE C. STOLLER, President, New York Women's Bar Association, New York, Sept. 7, 1983",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/weekinreview/ideas-trends-173756.html,"Not VeryCharitable When Donald Devine, director of the Federal Office of Personnel Management, last week banned Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. from sharing in the annual Government employees charity drive, antiabortion forces hailed a victory. They could not savor it. Next day, Federal District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green reversed the ban pending a full hearing. There was no mistaking how that hearing would end. Speaking from the bench, Judge Green noted ''the differential treatment, the extraordinary and inexplicable delays in considering (Planned Parenthood's) application, the controversial nature of Planned Parenthood's activities (it offers abortion referrals and operates some clinics where abortions are performed) and (Mr. Devine's) admitted bias against those activities.'' It was enough to make agency lawyers drop the case. Planned Parenthood, however, called for Congress to investigate the incident. An abortion foe, Mr. Devine had agreed with National Right to Life Committee complaints that Planned Parenthood did not meet the charity drive's guidelines; that it did not, for example, receive less than 50 percent of its funds from Government and more than 20 percent from the public. He admitted, however, ''my position on the abortion issue makes it more difficult for me to apply the same standards to Planned Parenthood as to everybody else.'' ''Not more difficult, impossible,'' said Winston E. Forrest, the federation's vice president for resources. According to Mr. Forrest, the agency held apart the organization's application ''without telling us and until it was almost too late to join the drive,'' which starts Oct. 1. Then, he said, it accepted the Right to Life audit of our audit, and our audit has been accepted by the charity campaign for the last 14 years.''

CARDINAL MEDEIROS OF BOSTON DIES AFTER CORONARY BYPASS OPERATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/obituaries/cardinal-medeiros-of-boston-dies-after-coronary-bypass-operation.html,"Humberto Cardinal Medeiros, spiritual leader of Boston's Roman Catholics, died this morning, a day after he underwent emergency heart surgery, a church official said. Cardinal Medeiros, 67 years old, died of coronary arrest at 7:46 A.M. at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, said the Rev. William Helmick, the Cardinal's secretary. Bishop Thomas V. Daily, chancellor of the archdiocese, said he had been elected to handle the day-to-day affairs of the archdiocese until the Vatican named a new archbishop. Bishop Daily said a funeral mass would be said Friday at Holy Cross Cathedral, where the Cardinal's body will lie in state. A Champion of Workers In 1931 Humberto Medeiros, a 16- year-old Portuguese immigrant who had not yet learned English, took a job sweeping floors in a textile plant in Fall River, Mass., for 62 cents a day. His experiences then were never forgotten, and later, as a Bishop in Brownsville, Tex., and as Archbishop of Boston, he would be considered a champion of the immigrant worker, the poor and minorities. In religious life, Cardinal Medeiros was considered an ecclesiastical conservative, a fierce opponent of liberalized abortion laws, slow to involve himself in Boston's racial problems and a staunch defender of Vatican policies. Support for labor unions was to be a continuing concern of the prelate's 37- year ministry. When he was named Bishop of Brownsville in 1966, farm workers in the Rio Grande valley were threatening a strike, and the new Bishop quickly supported the demands of the Mexican-American migrant workers. At times he would travel with the migrant workers because, ''I want to be with the people who need me.'' For the four years he was head of the Brownsville diocese, he spent Christmas and Easter in Texas jails visiting with prisoners and eating prison food. Born in the Azores Humberto Sousa Medeiros was born Oct. 6, 1915, in the village of Arrifes on Sao Miguel Island in the Azores and came to the United States when he was 16. He learned English while working in the mill in Fall River and later attended B.M.C. Rurfee High School. By 1940 he was a naturalized citizen, studying for the priesthood at Catholic University in Washington, where he earned a master's degree and a licentiate in sacred theology. After ordination in 1946, he was assistant pastor of parishes in Fall River, New Bedford and Somerset, Mass. In 1949 he studied at the North American College in Rome, a school noted for producing future leaders in the American church hierarchy. Catholic University awarded him a doctorate in theology in 1952, when he became assistant chancellor of the diocese of Fall River. He was later named chancellor, chief administrator and vicar for religious in the diocese. In 1960 he became pastor of St. Michael's parish in Fall River, a post he held until Pope Paul VI named him Bishop in 1966 and appointed him to the Brownsville diocese. In Brownsville, Bishop Medeiros added 18 parishes to the diocese and encouraged the church to sponsor housing projects for the needy. He was also chairman of the American bishops' committee on Latin America and a member of the bishops' committee on farm labor. Although a stern administrator, he was comfortable with the people of his diocese. When Brownsville was recovering from the effects of a hurricane in 1967, he opened the bishop's mansion to 11 families and nearly as many dogs made homeless by the storm. He was appointed Archbishop of Boston in 1970, to succeed Richard Cardinal Cushing as head of the nation's second largest archdiocese. The first person not of Irish heritage to lead Boston's two million Roman Catholics, he took his post as many Spanish-speaking Catholics were immigrating to the area. Although he was an unusually popular archbishop, he never won over the archdiocese to the degree of Cardinal Cushing, a situation that made it harder for him to exert political influence. Despite his experience in dealing with social issues, Archbishop Medeiros, who was named a Cardinal in 1973, set off several controversies in his years in Boston. When he called liberalized abortion ''the new barbarism,'' Protestant clergymen were quick to protest. Remark Angers Residents In one of several periods of racial tension over school busing, Cardinal Medeiros said he would not go into the South Boston area, where opposition to desegregation and busing was fervent, because ''no one there is listening to me,'' a remark that angered residents of that heavily Catholic area. He said his remarks about Catholics there came out of ''fatigue and anger,'' and he went to South Boston to hold several special masses. He had previously been criticized for not becoming involved in efforts to alleviate racial tension, but by 1979 Cardinal Medeiros organized an ecumenical coalition that drafted a ''covenant of justice, equity and harmony'' for Bostonians to sign. In 1980 Cardinal Medeiros had a pastoral letter read in the churches of the archdiocese in which he warned parishioners not to vote for candidates who favored liberalized abortion laws. While he did not mention specific candidates by name, church officials later acknowledged that the remarks were aimed at State Representative Barney Frank and to a lesser extent at United State Representative James M. Shannon. He opposed, however, the Catholic Bishops' backing of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to determine the abortion issues. The basis of his opposition was that the amendment did not explicitly outlaw abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN ADVISERS SAY HE WOULD FACE TOUGH RACE IN '84,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/us/reagan-s-campaign-advisers-say-he-would-face-tough-race-in-84.html,"A month before the planned formation of a committee to re-elect President Reagan, his advisers agree that if he decides to run he will face serious political problems winning a second term next year. In interviews, the advisers said they were troubled that the political coalition that elected Mr. Reagan in a landslide in 1980 had greatly atrophied. They said that despite the improvement in the President's popularity since last year, they feared he was not getting enough credit for recent improvements in the economy. The advisers said they believed instinctively that Mr. Reagan would win if he decided to seek re-election, but that he had his work cut out for him. ''We can proceed safely only on one assumption - it's going to be a tough race,'' said Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, general chairman of the Republican Party and the man who is expected to become chairman of Mr. Reagan's presumed re-election drive. ''The only secure area we have is his Western, Rocky Mountain base, where his approval rating is in the 60's,'' Senator Laxalt said. ''In the South, we only squeaked through last time in a number of states. In the Midwest, you look at the key states, and you can't say they're in the political sack. In the industrial states, we've got a lot of work to do.'' Another person chosen to play a key role in the campaign said: ''We put together a very tenuous coalition last time, and it's no longer there. We no longer have Carter to run against. And we've really been hurt among blue-collar workers in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Pennsylvania.'' Senator Laxalt and other Republican aides plan to form a re-election committee Oct. 15. They said they expected that by Nov. 1 the President would signal his own decision to run, perhaps by passing an affirmative word to aides, perhaps by making a more explicit statement. An official announcement, however, may not come until as late as next year. ''The President has not told me that he's going to be a candidate, and I don't think he's told anybody,'' a White House official said. ''But he's been briefed on everything we're doing, and he hasn't said don't do any of it. I'm certain he's running, but there's always a little apprehension.'' It is common for political aides to speak of the uphill campaigns they must wage, and, indeed, Mr. Reagan is expected to have many advantages if he runs. Among these are expected to be winning nomination without serious challenge and running while the economy is on the mend. Several Problems for Reagan In addition, the President does not seem to have been hurt personally by any scandals, and he is extremely adept at using the powers of an incumbent to define the issues and put others on the defensive. Despite these assets, however, Mr. Reagan's aides say they are concerned about several problems. For example, they say the President must work even harder in the months ahead to improve his standing among working-class ethnic groups, Hispanic Americans and Jews. In 1980, Mr. Reagan's ability to do much better among ethnic groups and Jews than Republicans generally do was essential to his victories in the industrial states and Florida, and Hispanic voters appear critical to his chances in Florida and the Southwest in 1984. The fear expressed by aides today is that, despite some improvements in his personal poll ratings, Mr. Reagan may be in a tougher position in 1984 to duplicate his performance of 1980. Although the economy may continue to improve, for example, unemployment could remain high in many areas. ''Even if we're below 9 percent unemployment nationally, it could still be at 12 or 18 percent in the big cities,'' said a key Reagan strategist. ''That's going to make it tough in the big states.'' The nationwide jobless rate is now 9.4 percent. Another factor feared by Reagan political advisers is the sizable registration drive Democrats expect to mount, especially among blacks. In the South, a significant increase in black voters, who are expected to vote overwhelmingly Democratic, could erase Mr. Reagan's 1980 margins of victory. A Reagan political strategist estimated that there would be perhaps 10 million more voters in 1984 than in 1980, most of them newly registered. ''Those new voters are not necessarily Republicans,'' he said. 220 Southern Counties Selected The Democratic registration drive among blacks is expected to be greatly aided by the possible candidacy of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Chicago-based civil rights leader. To counter it, the Republicans have selected 220 counties in the South that include suburbs and condominium apartment complexes, where so-called ''displaced Republicans'' from the North have moved. ''There hasn't been a good Republican registration effort since the 1972 Nixon campaign,'' a Reagan strategist said. ''The only place we've really started is Texas, so we're way behind. We've got to go all through the South, especially to those fundamentalist Christian groups that support the President. In a lot of states, they aren't registered.'' In 1980, Mr. Reagan defeated President Carter, the Democrat, by an electoral vote margin of 489 to 49. Mr. Reagan carried 44 states and received 50.7 percent of the popular vote, as against 41.1 percent for Mr. Carter. John B. Anderson, a former Republican Representative running as an independent, took most of the rest of the vote. Several Reagan aides said they fervently hoped a liberal third-party candidate would run next year and siphon votes from the Democratic nominee, as they believed Mr. Anderson did in 1980. ''We need 270 electoral votes to win, and I can go down state by state and tell you how we can get there,'' a Reagan strategist said. ''But there's no margin for error. A lot of states that are very, very crucial to us are also very, very close. There won't be any 44- state win.'' At the White House and among many Republicans, the general feeling is that the President would face a more difficult challenge from Senator John Glenn of Ohio than from former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. They reason that Mr. Glenn's status as the first American astronaut to orbit the earth and his centrist political approach would pose a greater threat to Mr. Reagan. But several strategists said Mr. Mondale would be a formidable threat because of the enthusiastic support he could command among labor unions, blacks, teachers and organized groups in general. Presidential aides say they do not foresee nearly as many difficulties if the nominee is any of the lesser known candidates, but they acknowledge that attitude could change. White House officials say they continue to be frustrated by their efforts to improve Mr. Reagan's standing among women. A key strategist said he felt that the drop in support for the President among women was his most serious political problem. Although the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll showed this week that the difference between women's and men's views of Mr. Reagan had narrowed significantly since June, that may be a short- lived effect of women liking and men disliking his responses to the Soviet downing of a South Korean airliner Sept. 1 over the island of Sakhalin. 'Gender Gap' Has Widened Moreover, polls taken by Richard Wirthlin, the President's pollster, show that this ''gender gap'' has widened somewhat for Mr. Reagan since 1980. ''It is not going well, but it has never gone well,'' said a key political adviser, speaking of the effort to win the women's vote. Another official said Mr. Wirthlin had cited 22 separate reasons for the President's support among women being relatively low. Some groups oppose Mr. Reagan over his stands on abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. Others cite the economy and their fears about war and violence. Still others dislike what they call Mr. Reagan's ''macho'' style. ''We've got to figure out which groups we can pick up,'' said a Presidential strategist. Still another difficulty for the President lies in his need to do well among blue-collar workers, many of them Roman Catholic, who defected from the Democrats in large numbers in 1980. Mr. Wirthlin's polls are said to show that, contrary to earlier fears, Mr. Reagan's strength among these voters remains the same, at about 40 percent. ''Wirthlin's polls don't show it, but my gut instinct tells me there's been some erosion,'' said one high-level strategist. ''In other words, I think a good Democratic effort can break some of it away.'' Accordingly, the President's aides are continuously vigilant on the perception that Mr. Reagan's budget cuts and glittering personal style make him ''a rich man's President.'' In keeping with the practice of 1982, White House officials said Mr. Reagan would keep black-tie events to a minimum and try as much as possible to return to the ranches, ethnic festivals and neighborhood campaigning that was one of his 1980 hallmarks. ''There's general agreement that he's going to travel and that a 'Rose Garden strategy' is not the right one for this President,'' a White House official said, referring to the practice of some incumbents in the past to campaign above the fray, appearing in public only at the White House Rose Garden. Yet, Mr. Reagan has not campaigned in a Northern industrial area since early April, when an appearance in Pittsburgh led to more publicity for the 4,000 anti-Reagan demonstrators than for the President. One campaign strategist spoke of the frustration over his perception that Mr. Reagan was not yet benefiting fully from an improved economy. ''In 1982, the voters didn't generally blame Reagan for their difficulties when things were bad,'' he said. ''The problem is, they don't seem to be giving him the political credit for the recovery.'' Foreign Policy Voctory Needed A bright spot for the Reagan strategists is their view that the President has improved his standing among Hispanic voters with a series of appearances and events in the last month. Although unemployment among Mexican-Americans remains high, the White House hopes Mr. Reagan can hold his own at 25 or 30 percent and not lose Texas and other states in the Southwest to the Democrats. Several aides said Mr. Reagan's chances would be dramatically enhanced by some sort of a breakthrough on the international scene. They predicted that any rise of support accruing from his handling of the Soviet downing of the South Korean airliner would be short-lived. ''We need a win somewhere, whether it's Latin America, the Middle East or with the Russians,'' an adviser said. ''If we had just one major foreign policy victory, we'd be in great shape.'' Administration officials said the publicity this summer over briefing documents from the Carter White House obtained by the Reagan campaign in 1980 would not hurt Mr. Reagan in 1984. But some officials worry that the continuing publicity may hurt some people, such as James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff. One major worry expressed by White House aides relates to what the President will decide in his budget for the fiscal year 1985. The budget is due in January. Will the President continue to cut food stamps, school aid and other popular programs to close a projected $200 billion deficit? Or will he submit a budget with few cuts and possibly even some election year ''goodies'' for some groups? The issue, White House aides say, has not yet been addressed. What has been addressed, they say, are Mr. Reagan's budget plans for his campaign. The organizers expect to send out more than two million pieces of mail by November to raise money for the early part of the campaign. The campaign expects to spend $21 million, about half of it in matching funds from the Federal Government, before the Republican convention next summer. This means that while the Democratic candidates are attacking each other in the primaries next spring, the President will probably have commercials of his own on the air, even though he will have no significant primary opposition. The campaign is expected to receive $40 million more in Federal funds to spend in the general election after the Republican convention. Other funds are expected to be spent in behalf of Mr. Reagan by the Republican National Committee, Republican organizations in various states and various independent groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE PRESIDENTIAL SLOTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/nyregion/playing-the-presidential-slots.html,"ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING was not the only game in town here last week. Politics in some of its manifestations was played with enthusiasm from the gambling casinos and the Boardwalk to City Hall. There were two beauty contests - one to pick Miss America and the other to select the state Democratic Party's current choice for President. However, Mayor Michael J. Matthews's interest in these two events was distracted by a movement aimed at forcing his recall and a new election for Mayor in November. Mr. Matthews, who is also a member of the State Assembly, is challenging the validity of the recall petitions in court. A hearing on the challenge originally scheduled for last Tuesday - the day the Democrats were voting in their Presidential straw poll - was postponed until tomorrow. (See the article on page 2.) The Miss America judges made their selection late last night from a lineup of young women, but the Democrats opted for a balding former Marine and astronaut, Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Mr. Glenn received 432 votes to 317 for former Vice President Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, and the Ohioan's campaign got a boost in the Northeast. Senator Glenn spoke to the convention of 1,500 delegates, and his backers worked hard during the two-day meeting to line up support for him. Mr. Mondale stayed away to campaign in Maine, and his absence cost him support and probably the top spot in the nonbinding straw poll. There were 284 delegates who did not vote for any of the six declared candidates whose names were on the ballot. Of these, 187 voted ''no preference,'' 67 voted for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, four for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, 10 for Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta, six for Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware (who addressed the convention), five for Senator Bill Bradley, two for George McGovern and two for Lyndon LaRouche, head of the U.S. Labor Party. One delegate voted for Peter Shapiro, the Essex County Executive. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina changed his plans and dropped in to address the convention on his way from Maine to Washington. He said he had left Mr. Mondale ''in Maine picking potatoes, while I came to New Jersey to pick some tomatoes.'' Despite his direct appeal for support, Mr. Hollings received only 26 votes in the poll. While the delegates were busy with workshops and seminars and listening to speeches in the general sessions at Bally's Park Place Casino, the whirr of slot machines and the hubbub at the gaming tables could be heard and viewed from a balcony one floor above the casino. Not many delegates visited the gaming tables until after each day's activity had ended. The following day, there were many tales of fortunes won - temporarily. The delegates were the targets of lobbying by issue-oriented groups that handed out literature and buttonholed people moving around the convention floor. At one point, an airplane pulling a banner flew low along the beachfront in front of the hotel. The banner read: ''Abortion Kills Future Democrats.'' The high point of the convention for many people was the address by Senator Biden, who said that the Democratic Party has been overwhelmed by the pleadings of special- interest groups and had lost to the Republican Party the initiative in shaping a national agenda. But he held out hope for the party in the mobilization of his generation - the post-war ''baby boom'' generation that Patrick Caddel, the political analyst, said earlier was beginning to make its considerable presence felt in the political process. Senator Biden, who is 40 years old, said that his generation would be ''tested on whether we have the moral courage, the realism, the idealism, the tenacity and the ability to sacrifice some of the current comfort to invest in the future.'' Mr. Biden said, like others, that his entry into politics had been inspired by John F. and Robert F. Kennedy and his commitment to civil rights by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He said that cynics were wrong when they believed his generation was ''ripe for Republican picking.'' ''They have misjudged us,'' Senator Biden said. ''Just because our political heroes were murdered does not mean that the dream does not live, buried in our broken hearts.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THEATER: 'THE ARBOR,' FROM BRITAIN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/theater/theater-the-arbor-from-britain.html,"WHEN very young writers snare our attention, it's not always because of what little they do know but because of the great deal that they don't know. They speak their hearts and minds directly, without regard for the conventions of craft or the self-consciousness of art. ''The Arbor,'' a British play by Andrea Dunbar at La Mama, is a perfect example. At the time this effort was begun (in 1977), its author was a 15-year-old working-class girl, writing to fulfill a classroom assignment in a grimy industrial enclave in Yorkshire. And her play asks us to take life straight: the cruel events tumble forward with no time out for such matters as structure, character development or authorial attitudinizing. Act I of ''The Arbor'' first came to light in 1980, when it was performed upstairs at London's Royal Court Theater, under the direction of Max Stafford-Clark. It was a winner in the Young Writers' Festival - the same event that inspired the Young Playwrights Festival that has enthralled New York for the past two years. After the first act's premiere, the Royal Court prevailed upon Miss Dunbar to expand the work into two acts for a main-stage production. The version at La Mama is the full-length one, with an American cast directed by Leonardo Shapiro. The play's heroine, Andrea, tells a story that is brutal in its simplicity. Pregnant at 15 and unwilling to have an abortion, the girl must leave regular school for a Dickensian school for unwed mothers. She fights with her unsupportive, alcoholic father; she gets caught up in a car-theft escapade with some local toughs; she loses her baby in a miscarriage. At the end of Act I, Andrea meets up again with the boy who took her to bed. He casually rejects Andrea, and then, as the heroine puts it, she ''never saw him no more.'' Although this modest play is not to be confused with ''A Taste of Honey,'' it is honest and at times affecting in the most plaintive way. We not only get a completely unsentimental portrait of Andrea, but also a streetwise sketch of a rugged social environment in which parents routinely brutalize their children - and sex is not so much a passionate fact of life as a relentless cycle of crime and punishment. Yet Miss Dunbar judges no one, not even herself, and that clear-eyed objectivity is embodied by Helen Nicholas, the young actress who plays Andrea as a cool, practical survivor who never looks back. With the exception of Leslie Lyles, who plays the girl's astringent mother and patronizing teacher (among other roles), the supporting cast is routine. (On the night I attended, one actor lapsed into a drawl worthy of ''Dallas.'') Mr. Shapiro's staging tends to run off the rails during the scenes of violent domestic and neighborhood brawling, but at least it's energetic. Bil Mikulewicz's set - all bricks and faceless doors - has a keen sense of place that is augmented by Arden Fingerhut's intricate lighting design. One does wish that Mr. Shapiro had resisted the inexplicable urge to cast Andrea's fellow unwed mothers with men in drag: it's a gimmick as far removed from the writing's rough-hewed naturalism as could be imagined. Curiously enough, ''The Arbor'' all but dies after intermission, even though the raw material itself is no less compelling. Andrea, now 18, gets pregnant again, by a Pakistani textile laborer; she must suffer the ostracization of her racist community as well as her lover's physical thrashings. But the spontaneity of Act I is gone, replaced by a routine, sledgehammer plottiness. Could the theater professionals who asked Miss Dunbar to expand her play be at fault? In Act II of ''The Arbor,'' a young writer's fresh voice has been diluted - not permanently, I hope - by some unmistakably ''adult'' notions of drama.

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/22/garden/hers.html,"WHY do so many women who agree with feminist goals choose to disavow feminism? For me the question became urgent a few weeks ago when I read concurrent disclaimers from three prominent, strong women: Christine Craft, the television anchorwoman who sued her employer; Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, and the actress Estelle Parsons. When I checked out each quotation, my question elicited very different but equally revealing answers. Chris Craft, the outspoken TV anchor who sued the station that demoted her for being ''too old, unattractive and not deferential to men,'' said in an interview in The New York Times: ''I'm not a feminist.'' Yet her case seemed to epitomize women's struggle against sexism. Following the logic of the old punchline - if it looks like a feminist, sounds like a feminist and acts like a feminist, it is a feminist - I asked her if she'd been misquoted. ''No,'' she said. ''I hate being categorized. Objectivity has always been my goal. If I said I'm a feminist, I'd never get another job as a reporter. I mean no slap against feminism, but this is my battle and mine alone.'' I suspect she resists being categorized because, despite more than a decade of women's movement activism on everything from child care to homemaker's rights, the category ''feminist'' still conjures for many an image of a narrow, negative fringe group. I can vouch for the power of those preconceptions: at virtually all my lecture appearances, believe it or not, someone says, ''I thought you'd be bigger.'' At 5 feet 4 inches I delight in being a ''decategorizing'' force. Each of us who calls herself a feminist testifies that feminists come in all sizes, races, marital states and sexual persuasions. Admission to our ''category'' is by commitment only.  When Miss Craft cites her desire for objectivity as a reason to disavow feminism, I'm reminded of Gloria Steinem's civil rights parody of the equal- time rule: ''O.K., we've heard from the black victims; now let's get the attack dogs' side of the story.'' It's as absurd to expect objectivity on racial brutality as it is to suggest there are two sides to the denial of human rights to women. Being a feminist - i.e., in favor of women's rights - should not stigmatize a woman reporter; it should mark her as a person with rudimentary human concerns and female self-interest. Put another way, would a black reporter be required to swear neutrality on the Voting Rights Act or apartheid before he or she could cover a story concerning such matters? And if it's true, as Miss Craft maintains, that a feminist could not get work as a reporter, maybe she should challenge that situation in her next lawsuit. Divide-and-conquer strategies get an assist when a public symbol like Miss Craft maintains that ''this is my battle and mine alone.'' There was a time not long ago when youth, beauty and obsequiousness were generally accepted standards for female worth. But today - because of the moral and legal climate created by thousands of women before her - Miss Craft was able to argue the injustice of that standard and win $500,000 for having been victimized by it. Ignoring those who marched, lobbied, went to court, took abuse and fought for every woman's right to be treated as a person, Miss Craft imagines that the battle originated at her news desk in Kansas City. A few days later,The Fire Island News quoted Representative Ferraro as saying she did not consider herself a feminist ''although she is in favor of the equal rights amendment and is prochoice on the abortion issue.'' Miss Craft had been an unknown quantity but Miss Ferraro's record matches nearly every item on anyone's feminist political agenda. Can she deny that she's a feminist? She didn't: ''I said that when I went to Congress in 1978 I did not run as a feminist or consider myself one. But I became a strong feminist when I got here and learned what is happening to women in this country. As Bella Abzug once tried to get across to President Carter, I'm trying to say that feminist issues are problems that affect women and they are very broad political and economic issues. Most people support feminism when they understand it.'' The third disclaimer appeared in a New York Times interview with Estelle Parsons, star of ''Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From the Zoo,'' eight one- woman plays by Dario Fo and Franca Rame. Miss Parsons told the reporter that the plays are about ''the condition of women'' - and ''how we're all prisoners of the male organ.'' That struck me as a fairly forthright, even radical, feminist summary. Yet she was quoted as insisting that she was ''not interested in feminist messages.'' I had seen her in ''Miss Reardon Drinks a Little,'' ''Miss Margarida's Way'' and the remarkable ''Mert and Phil'' - three plays with profound messages about ''the condition of women.'' I knew that she belongs to a networking group that helps women get jobs in the theater; could Miss Parsons not be a feminist? ''I didn't realize I was one when I did the interview,'' she said on the telephone the other morning. ''But these plays have led me into a lot of soul-searching about the patterns in my work and my life. Until now I didn't dare say myself what these plays are saying. I was afraid people would poke fun at me, so I withdrew from everything controversial. I've been wrong not to stand up and answer for my own commitments. It's not enough to just live your life. You have to recognize what you represent to other women. The women in the audience treat me as a feminist leader, but it is they who've raised my consciousness.'' While I was pondering all this, Carol Kleiman, associate financial editor of The Chicago Tribune, told me that the opening comment by 90 percent of the businesswomen she interviews is ''I'm not a feminist.'' ''These women are not comfortable being woman-identified,'' she explained, ''so they're trying to tell me they like men. Refusing to make common cause with feminism is a doomed effort to distance themselves from their sisters by making an alliance with the men who still, for the most part, control their destinies.'' Christine Craft continues to cultivate that alliance and disavow feminism no matter how she contradicts her own reality. Geraldine Ferraro and Estelle Parsons understand that facing women's reality makes a woman a feminist. They are in stellar company. Dr. Sally Ride, a true ''first,'' credits other women for her success and even for the fact that back in 1977 she applied for astronaut selection because of a notice posted in the Stanford University Women's Center. If it wasn't for the women's movement, says Dr. Ride, ''I wouldn't be where I am today.'' Can any woman truthfully disavow that statement?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRESIDENTIAL DECISION NEARS FOR JESSE JACKSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/22/us/presidential-decision-nears-for-jesse-jackson.html,"The Rev. Jesse Louis Jackson, just back from a European trip, is preparing to make a decision that could have a profound impact on politics next year: whether to run for President. The civil rights advocate who founded Operation PUSH is pondering that question amid a mixture of enthusiasm from a great many blacks and severe criticism from others, especially politicians. Supporters see a Jackson race as generating renewed interest in electoral politics and helping the Democratic Party, while others say he would divert attention from what they feel should be the main goal of blacks, defeating Ronald Reagan. Mr. Jackson is perceived by many as a man of energy with a probing mind, a silver tongue and a strong charisma, not just an ability to sway crowds but also personal charm and persuasiveness in one-on-one settings. And he is given credit for drawing attention to the needs of blacks, working to motivate schoolchildren and creating new business opportunities for black people. But he is also seen as an egocentric power seeker who upstages other black leaders and pursues publicity for accomplishments that others achieve with less fanfare. And Operation PUSH, which he founded in Chicago 12 years ago, is seen as poorly administered; questions have been raised about its management of Federal money. Nevertheless, Mr. Jackson's mere consideration of entering the race has put a lot of black political activity on hold, preventing some politicians from openly supporting other candidates. He has caused a split among blacks along class lines, with charges that the masses are for him and the middle class is in opposition. And he has caused white candidates to tread lightly among black voters and to defer to Mr. Jackson, out of fear of alienating him and his supporters. This was the portrait that emerged from a series of interviews and travels with Mr. Jackson, as well as talks with a host of other people, supporters and critics alike, and from watching him deal with individuals and crowds. 'The Poor Are Not Lazy' In Cleveland early this month, he stood tall and commanding before a crowd that grew and grew under a broiling sun. ''The poor are not lazy,'' he shouted as blacks from the tumbledown East Side drew toward him. ''They sweat in these steel mills. They clean other people's houses and then have their own houses to clean. ''The poor are not lazy. We just want to get paid for what we do.'' The crowd laughed, chanted and applauded until Mr. Jackson hushed them with a wave of his hands and asked everyone who was not registered to vote to come down the aisle. As 200 to 300 people began streaming forward, the crowd applauded steadily. Registrars set up a table to sign up voters on the spot. Lack of Follow-Through Seen But when he turned to leave for the airport, someone had to call out to keep the would-be voters from drifting away. Having lit the spark, Mr. Jackson said it was up to others to carry out the actual registration. Some people see that attitude as symbolic of a flaw in Mr. Jackson's leadership, as a failure to follow through. But Mr. Jackson says the role he can best fulfill is one of a communicator, a motivator. Motivation of others is a main concern in Mr. Jackson's consideration of a Presidential race. He says his appeal to an often overlooked segment of society could get more disadvantaged people to register, vote and take an active part in the political process, thereby encouraging the enactment of more progressive policies and helping the Democrats beat Mr. Reagan in 1984. ''Those are new voters,'' he said of the scores in Cleveland who headed for the registrars. ''The Democratic Party has not been able to inspire the people. I have.'' He Sees a 'Rainbow Coalition' Mr. Jackson sees himself as a voice for the poor and powerless of all races, whom he would unite in a ''rainbow coalition.'' ''If we increase the number of registered voters by registering blacks, Hispanics and the young,'' he says, ''we'll expand the party, not divide it.'' Some Blacks Foresee Divisiveness But division is what some black leaders fear. Though many support Mr. Jackson, believing that as blacks are winning local and state office in greater numbers, a black candidate should step forward and seek the Presidency, others feel his candidacy could drain support from liberal white candidates in the Democratic primaries, giving the nomination to someone farther to the political right. That could rob blacks of any influence over the eventual white Democratic nominee, in the view of Georgia State Senator Julian Bond. And most often heard is the concern that, by focusing attention on his own candidacy, Mr. Jackson might divert blacks from the effort to remove Mr. Reagan from the White House. Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta and John Lewis, a City Councilman there, have also expressed reservations about the effect of a campaign by Mr. Jackson. Efforts to Register Voters Mr. Jackson has since embarked on a number of swings to register voters, saying that black voters could and should elect far more blacks to all levels of public office as well as help defeat President Reagan in 1984. He exhorts blacks to run for office themselves, saying, ''If the leaders don't run, the masses don't register.'' Mr. Jackson has criticized Federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and spoken out against such practices as runoff primaries, dual registration in Mississippi, gerrymandering of districts, at-large voting and other measures that he feels are designed to thwart black political participation. ''Low registration isn't due to apathy - it's due to oppression,'' he contended. Mr. Lewis, the Atlanta City Councilman, was director of the Voter Education Project from 1970-77, when, he said, the organization helped register over four million blacks in the South. He said Mr. Jackson was exaggerating the situation. Some Views Are Known ''Without question there are still existing problems,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''But most of the problems we faced in the 60's are no longer there. Now citizen education is needed to encourage people to vote the entire ballot; not just President or governor, but lower positions like city councilperson or sheriff. In some of those positions there's a 60 percent dropoff.'' While Mr. Jackson has not yet said he will run, he has been traveling the dwill run, he has been traveling the ons, but some are known, including support both for stricter enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and for the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which he feels would stabilize families and open up job opportunities for women. He says he believes it is immoral for a woman to have an abortion except under medically extenuating circumstances, but would not favor taking away her freedom of choice. In the past, he has been quoted as equating abortion with murder. He Opposes 'Gunboat Diplomacy' He also advocates a policy toward corporations that would require them to rebuild their industrial base in the United States or to retrain American workers in exchange for tax breaks; a food policy that would put farmers back to work feeding the poor, rather than allowing billions of dollars worth of food to lie in storage, and education and health care programs for the very poor based on need, not income. In terms of foreign policy, Mr. Jackson said the nation should pursue a course that emphasizes human rights, economic fair play and negotiations, not ''gunboat diplomacy.'' The United States should use its leverage to end apartheid in South Africa, he said. While recognizing Israel's right to exist, he also calls for the creation of a Palestinian homeland, a position that has caused him problems with Jews. Media Attention and Strong Emotions Though he has held no public office, Mr. Jackson, through the force of his personality and from the platform of Operation PUSH, has repeatedly focused attention on issues and managed to seize the spotlight. ''Jesse understands the media well and has learned to use it well,'' said Thomas Todd, a Chicago lawyer who once served as executive vice president of Operation PUSH. ''He combines everything the media wants. He looks good, he sounds good and he excites passion, good and bad.'' ''He has an uncompromising sense of personal distinction,'' says Robert Tucker, another Chicago lawyer who has known Mr. Jackson for many years. ''Jesse not only believes in God, but he firmly believes God believes in him.'' ''It's Jesse! It's him!'' one woman exclaims as Mr. Jackson walks through an airport. A waitress tells him she would not have finished high school if it had not been for him. Black businessmen in Chicago and other cities say Mr. Jackson's threats of boycotts and other actions have opened up new business opportunities for them in that city and around the country, enabling them to hire and raise wages for more employees and, in the case of black banks, to help other minority businesses grow. Many Remain Critical Yet criticism of Mr. Jackson is vehement. ''Jesse is not running for President,'' says Vernon Jarrett, a black columnist with The Chicago Sun-Times who is one of Mr. Jackson's more severe critics. ''He's running for the office of chief power broker for black people at the Democratic convention, where he will be televised and portrayed as a black power broker. His agenda is the promotion of Jesse Jackson as the king, the emperor, the most important black person of this century.'' Now 41 years old, Mr. Jackson entered public life through the civil rights movement and by 1967 had worked his way to national director of Operation Breadbasket, the economic arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference designed to bring pressure on employers to hire and promote blacks and invest in black companies and products. He and the conference parted ways in 1971, and two weeks later Operation Breadbasket became Operation PUSH, with Mr. Jackson as its president. Boycotts Used as a Tool When he started in Chicago in the late 1960's, Mr. Jackson organized boycotts at local grocery stores to pressure the owners to provide more shelf space for goods produced by black entrepreneurs, and he fought to get A.&P. to hire a black building contractor. Since then he has branched out, and in the past two years he has negotiated detailed trade agreements - he calls them ''covenants'' - with several corporations, including Coca-Cola, Seven- Up, Burger King, Heublein and Southland, the Dallas company that franchises 7-Eleven. While not legally binding, the agreements generally commit the corporations to hiring more blacks, including people at the top levels, doing business with minority-owned concerns, awarding franchises and distributorships to blacks, making deposits in minority-owned banks, advertising in minority-owned publications and giving money to black colleges and other organizations. A Value Beyond Dollars Mr. Jackson estimates the value of the agreements at some $1.5 billion and says tens of thousands of new jobs have been created, although the precise economic impact is hard to pin down. Those who have benefited from Mr. Jackson's efforts say the dollar amounts are less important than the far-reaching principle established by him and by other civil rights groups that undertake the same effort. ''Jesse awakened the private sector,'' said Alvin J. Boutte, chairman of the board of the Independence Bank of Chicago. ''What he has done is more important than government involvement, because it will last longer.'' He added, ''I don't know what this bank would be without Jesse Jackson.'' Criticisms of Operation PUSH Mr. Jackson said he does not generally suggest to corporations which minority vendors they should hire to fulfill the terms of the covenants. But an affiliate of Operation PUSH called the International Trade Bureau does make recommendations to companies that wish to do business with minority concerns, particularly those companies that have signed the trade agreements. The trade bureau, which has more than 500 members, charges minority businesses $500 a year to join, and that request for money has drawn heated criticism. The St. Louis Sentinel, a black weekly newspaper, reported that after signing a covenant with Seven-Up last year, Mr. Jackson told black businessmen, ''If you want to play, you have to pay.'' The newspaper accused Mr. Jackson of having a ''million-dollar commitment to himself'' and of following a ''kickback approach.'' Jackson Calls It Service Fee Lawyers for Mr. Jackson and Operation PUSH, an acronym for People United to Serve Humanity, filed a $3 million libel suit. But Operation PUSH asked to withdraw from the action after a Federal district judge ordered the organization to produce its financial records. Mr. Jackson has said he would make the financial records public at the appropriate time. Mr. Jackson believes the $500 fee is reasonable for a company trying to find new business. ''Those who invest in the trade bureau earn service from the staff,'' he says, adding that a problem of the civil rights movement is that the people who have benefited from it feel no sense of obligation. But Barbara Reynolds, a black journalist who wrote a biography of Mr. Jackson, says he is running ''a silver rights movement, not a civil rights movement.'' ''There's nothing wrong with helping black business,'' Miss Reynolds says, ''but he's saying he's helping the poor and disenfranchised, and what would help blacks is jobs and training programs.'' She says Mr. Jackson is using his leverage with corporations to develop a personal patronage system among black businessmen. Jackson Responds to Charges Mr. Jackson answers: ''The more you serve people, the more they keep coming back to you. That just means I know how to deliver.'' He says he does not focus solely on jobs because ''full employment isn't enough.'' ''We had full employment during slavery,'' he says, arguing that bolstering black businesses in turn helps black workers. Other efforts by Mr. Jackson have generated controversy. When negotiating the trade agreements, he often recommended the corporations use consulting concerns to find qualified minority vendors. One of those consultants, Green, Herman & Associates, is headed by Ernest G. Green, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training in the Carter Administration who, shortly before leaving office, gave his routine approval to a $2 million grant to PUSH-Excel. Mr. Jackson's program for schoolchildren. Auditors Challenge Spending Mr. Green said that he gave no special attention to the PUSH-Excel grant and that there was no quid pro quo arrangement. Companies that use Green, Herman say they are pleased with the firm's work. In an unrelated incident, Government auditors are challenging the way PUSH-Excel spent $1.7 million in Federal grants. The program received $6.5 million from various Federal agencies. Auditors reviewing grants made under the Carter Administration have said $737,000 was improperly spent and have officially questioned another $1 million, for which they are seeking further documentation. Mr. Jackson dismisses the audits as a dispute between accountants, complains he is the target of Government leaks and says no wrongdoing has been charged. He said PUSH-Excel, of which he is board chairman, will repay any money due at the end of the auditing process. Motivation and Inspiration Through his PUSH-Excel program, Mr. Jackson attempts to motivate students both by inspiring them directly and by getting parents, local ministers and local businessmen to take a greater interest in their education. He feels his own motivation to excel sprang partly from his determination to overcome the taunts and slights he was subjected to as a child in Greenville, S.C., because he was born out of wedlock. ''I'd get great joy out of making the honor roll as an athlete because it defied stereotypes,'' he recalls. ''It was a challenge to me to be in class the morning after a game with my homework done. ''Public ridicule will either crush you or challenge you; it can take away your spirit or stimulate your adrenalin. I chose the achievement route.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Woman,21,Sentenced In Fatal Beating of Son",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/23/nyregion/woman21sentenced-in-fatal-beating-of-son.html,"A 21- year-old Irvington woman convicted of beating her 3-year-old son to death was sentenced today to life plus 25 years in prison by a judge who said he imposed the maximum term as a ''deterrent to child abuse.'' The woman, Renee Nicely, who has four other children, was ordered by Judge Edwin H. Stern of State Superior Court to serve a minimum of 42 1/2 years before becoming eligible for parole. Her attorney, Jeffrey Feldman, told Judge Stern, ''You might as well have sentenced her to death.'' Miss Nicely had contended that Allen Bass, 21, the child's father, had actually killed their son, Shawn. Mr. Bass was sentenced Sept. 15 to 20 years for aggravated manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. Miss Nicely was convicted July 29 by an Essex County jury of murder, aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a minor. The boy died after a beating in the bathroom of the couple's apartment last Sept. 26. After Miss Nicely's conviction, the jury began deliberations in the death- penalty phase of the trial, as required under the state's year-old law on capital punishment. In deciding against the death penalty, the jury found she ''was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance'' the day the boy was killed. Testimony showed that she had had an abortion the previous day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV WEEKEND; PEACETIME ARMY ACTION IN 'FOR LOVE AND HONOR',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/23/arts/tv-weekend-peacetime-army-action-in-for-love-and-honor.html,"''FOR LOVE AND HONOR,'' a new series making its debut as a two-hour movie on Channel 4 tonight at 9, is being presented as ''a realistic depiction of the peacetime Army.'' If so, the country is in worse condition than chronic worriers imagine. The show's 88th Airborne Division has been transformed into something like a college dormitory, resulting in something between ''Animal House'' and ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' The division is supposed to be training paratroopers for combat, but the bulk of the training seems to consist of occasional jogging sessions. The man in charge, Captain Wiecek (Gary Grubbs,) is decidedly sadistic. The good guy is First Sergeant Allard (Cliff Potts), who is fair and tough. Also on the good side is Master Sergeant Bell (Yaphet Kotto), a hardened Vietnam veteran, who bears similarities to the mean-but-lovable character played by Louis Gossett Jr. in ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' This man's Army has women in its ranks. Sergeant Allard is having an affair with Captain Engel (Shelley Smith), the division's chic top medic. Then there is Corporal Pavlik (Rachel Ticotin), who has to live in a barracks inhabited solely by male paratroopers. This separates the nice guys from the nasty male chauvinists, leaving the poor corporal insisting she will stick it out. The trainees are all pretty, both the boys and the girls. Scammer (Pete Kowanko) is a relentless womanizer. Duke (Keenan Ivory Wayans) wants to be a boxer. Utah (Tony Becker) is a nice rube from a Midwestern farm. Lucas (Eddie Velez) is a hot-blooded Hispanic-American soldier enamored of a young woman who turns out to be the commanding general's daughter. During a night jump, one of the chutes doesn't open, and a trainee, Scammer's best friend, is killed. As it turns out, the chute was ''packed'' by Corporal Pavlik. Scammer is inconsolable. Corporal Pavlik is inconsolable. The crisis ends in a barroom brawl, followed by Corporal Pavlik's playing a soulful piece of music on her guitar while the rest of the gang listens pensively. Mr. Potts gets through all this with some skill, and the rest of the cast shows signs of talent. It's the vehicle itself that refuses to justify even minimum belief. Teen-Age Pregnancies On 'That's the Spirit' Sunday morning at 10:30 on Channel 9, the syndicated series ''That's the Spirit'' begins a new season with a half-hour exploration of teen-age pregnancies. Mark Cordray, the host- narrator, talks about the subject with teen-age parents and teen-age students. This program is produced under Roman Catholic auspices, and abortion is hardly mentioned, never mind considered. The program is noteworthy because it confronts a real problem, which is reaching epidemic proportions, and the young people are sensitive and articulate. Asked if love conquers all, a young man feeding his infant daughter says, ''It doesn't happen like in the movies - no, it's not 'Love Story Part II.' '' A young woman with a child explains that she was responsible for making the child, and therefore, she is responsible for caring for it. The distinction is made between lasting love and romance or short-lived infatuations. There is no preaching. In a review yesterday of a new television series called ''Trauma Center,'' a critical reference was made to the speaking voice of Lou Ferrigno, an actor. It was subsequently learned that Mr. Ferrigno's speech difficulties were not the result of his characterization, but of hearing problems that affect his speech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Article 184750 -- No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/23/us/article-184750-no-title.html,"Democratic leaders succeeded today in winning House approval of $300 million more for education and job training. The action came as the House passed a $96.5 billion measure to finance a broad range of social service programs. The appropriation bill, approved by a vote of 310 to 101, provides funds for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education, as well as some other Federal programs. The bill exceeds President Reagan's requests by about $3.8 billion, but it is about $4 billion below the budget ceiling set earlier by Congress. The Democratic victory, after some lively debate, was the first part of a planned double assault on Mr. Reagan's efforts to cut spending for various domestic programs. Plan Is for $450 Million More The second move will come within the next week or so when the Democrats seek another $450 million or more for education programs as part of a catchall resolution to finance Government agencies into the 1984 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. At the same time, the Census Bureau reported today that changes in Federal aid programs made at Mr. Reagan's request had prevented an increase in the total number of households receiving food stamps, Medicaid and other Federal aid last year despite an increase in poverty and unemployment. (Page B10.) In choosing today to push for $300 million, rather than the $750 million or more that they eventually hope to get, Democratic leaders hoped to avoid a veto of the big appropriation bill that will finance operations of the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. They noted that even with the additional $300 million, the House bill is about at the same level as one approved by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee for those departments. Senate Must Still Act The Senate is expected to act on a similar measure drafted by its Appropriations Committee, and a House-Senate conference committee would reconcile any differences. The Democrats reasoned that President Reagan would be reluctant to veto the catchall resolution, even one with an additional $450 million, for fear of shutting down the various departments and agencies dependent on such stopgap financing to keep operating after Sept. 30. But Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, warned that the Democrats' plan might well backfire. In an emotional speech, he suggested that the President might not hold still for the additional domestic spending. Mr. Conte had sought to head off any confrontation between the Congress and the Reagan Administration over the levels of domestic spending. After consultations with White House officials, Mr. Conte said he felt that a Presidential veto could be avoided if the appropriation bill did not go any higher than $3.5 billion over the President's earlier request. Today's action might cause ''a deal with the Administration'' to collapse, Mr. Conte said. Prospects for passage of the catchall resolution were complicated by internal Democratic differences over an action Wednesday night by the House Appropriations Committee. It approved language barring funds for American forces in Lebanon unless the President acknowledges to Congress within 60 days that he is bound by the War Powers Resolution. O'Neill Cites 'Meddling' The Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., accused the Appropriations Committee of ''meddling with the rights of other committees,'' notably the Foreign Affairs Committee, which approved a compromise today invoking the War Powers Resolution. The Speaker asked the Appropriations Committee to redraft its bill, but committee members stood their ground and urged the Speaker to reconsider. Generally, the catchall appropriation resolution provides funds for those departments or agencies whose regular appropriations bills have not yet cleared Congress. The resolution for the coming fiscal year would finance all agencies except those for which individual appropriations had been enacted. At this point, money bills have been signed for the Departments of Energy, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, plus the legislative branch. A Vehicle for Extra Money However, an official in the office of the House parliamentarian said today that the resolution also can be used as a vehicle for appropriating additional funds for those agencies whose regular money bills have already cleared, such as the additional $450 million for education sought by the Democrats. The resolution, as drafted in committee, also would provide $425 million more for military assistance for Israel, for a total of $2.6 billion, and $65 million more for Egypt, for a total of $2.1 billion. While the centerpiece of today's floor action was the Democratic move to increase domestic spending, the House also engaged in its annual debate over abortion by reaffirming its stand against the use of Federal funds for such a purpose. Added to the appropriation bill, by a vote of 231 to 184, was an outright ban on use of any Federal funds for abortions. This is stronger than the present law, which permits abortions when a mother's life is in danger. Abortion Ban Called Unlikely However, Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who leads anti-abortion forces in the House, said he believed that the Senate would insist on allowing abortions when a mother's life is endangered and that the law as now written would remain unchanged. The appropriation bill includes $62.7 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services; $13.2 billion for the Department of Labor; $12.4 billion for the Department of Education, and a total of $8.2 billion for other programs, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The $300 million added to the bill under a proposal by the House Democratic leader, Jim Wright of Texas, includes $100 million more for grants to needy college students; $100 million for job training; $45 million for aid to the disadvantaged; $25 million to the Head Start program for preschool children, and a total of $30 million for various other education programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CARDINAL MEDEIROS TRIBUTE SURPRISES BOSTON CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/24/us/cardinal-medeiros-tribute-surprises-boston-catholics.html,"More than 2,000 people jammed the old brown stone Holy Cross Cathedral beside an elevated subway line in the city's South End today for a funeral mass for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, Humberto Cardinal Medeiros. The service marked the end of three days of crowded and emotional mourning for Cardinal Medeiros in which more than 50,000 people filed past his bier and subway trains outside the cathedral were slowed to a crawl to reduce the disturbance. The intensity of the tribute surprised Catholic leaders here. While this heavily Irish-American city is predominantly Catholic and the archdiocese is the nation's second largest, after Chicago's, Cardinal Medeiros was not always popular here. The Cardinal, a native of the Azores, was regarded as something of an outsider among the largely Irish-American clergy, and his support for court- ordered busing to end public school segregation aroused deep resentment. 'Higher Religious Sensibility' Hence, the homage for Cardinal Medeiros, who died last week at the age of 67, was regarded by some Catholics as a reminder of how important the church remains for many people here. ''My overwhelming impression is that there is a much higher religious sensibility in Boston than in other big cities,'' said the Rev. J. Donald Monan, president of Boston College, a Jesuit-run school. ''There is a bigger public awareness of religion and religious values,'' added Father Monan, who comes from Buffalo. ''You can see it in a lot of little ways that I thought had disappeared from the life of America,'' he said, pointing to the city transportation system's decision to slow the subways and provide free bus service to the cathedral. The funeral service, he also noted, was shown live for more than three hours by Boston's three major television stations, an unusual honor. 2 Million Catholics in Boston Area In part, the tribute for Cardinal Medeiros may stem from the sheer size of the archdiocese, which serves more than two million Catholics. It includes 410 parishes and is responsible for 160 parochial schools, eight colleges, four nursing schools and 12 hospitals. But the outpouring of feeling for the Cardinal also grows out of the distinctive history of the church in Boston. ''The difference between the church in Boston and other American cities is the same as the difference in Boston's immigrants,'' said Thomas H. O'Connor, a professor of history at Boston College and author of ''Bibles, Brahmins and Bosses: A Short History of Boston.'' Professor O'Connor said that when the first big wave of Irish immigrants landed in Boston in the potato famine of the 1840's, the immigrants arrived in a city that was already more than 200 years old, with a proud and well-established ruling class. Moreover, the members of this Yankee elite were descendants of the Puritans, who had fled England and an Anglican Church that they found too close in its ritual and hierarchy to Roman Catholicism. To make matters worse, Boston had little industry and few jobs for the boatloads of Irish, many of whom were poor and illiterate. 'A Militant Spirit of Alliance' A result was that the Irish in Boston encountered more hostility than they did in most other American cities, which were newer or more rapidly growing, Professor O'Connor said. ''Given the Irish feeling that they were under fire from the Yankees, they built up a militant spirit of alliance between the poor people and the clergy like that in Poland today between the church and the workers,'' he said. But this same sense of protracted struggle also made the church in Boston more defensive and isolated, the professor continued, especially in the first half of the 20th century, when the church was dominated by William Cardinal O'Connell and the city was run by Mayor James Michael Curley. This insularity began to change in the 1960's under Richard Cardinal Cushing, a revered native of South Boston who supported the ecumenical movement. A Changing City and Church But it was Cardinal Medeiros, appointed Archbishop in 1970, who was caught up in both a changing Boston and a changing church after the Second Vatican Council. The Cardinal, a quiet and humble man who was described by some priests as almost medieval in his faith, managed to rid the diocese of $60 million in debt created by Cardinal Cushing's ambitious building program. But he was not prepared for what David O'Brien, a professor of history at Holy Cross University in Worcester, called the ''conservative, tribal, Irish clerical culture'' of Boston. ''Unwittingly, Irish of all levels in Boston have tended to think that being Cardinal was one of their jobs, like being Mayor, and they were stunned when Medeiros was appointed,'' said William V. Shannon, a professor at Boston University and author of several books on the Irish in America. Cardinal Medeiros, therefore, lacked the personal rapport to help him guide the church through Boston's school busing crisis that was brought on as the city's small black community grew rapidly in the 1970's. He pledged that the church would not contribute to racial bigotry when Boston's schools were desegragated in 1974, and ordered that Catholic schools not accept students trying to avoid busing. But ''he didn't enforce it,'' said James T. Hannon, an instructor at Regis College, a women's Catholic school in suburban Weston. A study done by Mr. Hannon, who was formerly head of the Justice and Peace Commission in the archdiocese, found that 20 percent of Boston's white public school students transferred to parochial schools at the time. Conservative Attitude Cited Mr. Hannon, who also has done a study comparing the church in Boston to that in Milwaukee, termed Boston ''one of the most conservative dioceses in the country,'' a situation he attributed to its Irish origins. In the Middle West, where there are more German and Polish Catholics, the leaders have been more progressive, he said. Cardinal Medeiros's interest in social issues focused largely on fighting abortion, Mr. Hannon said, while church leaders in other cities became absorbed by problems of helping the poor or ending the arms race. Some nuns in Boston also believed that the church under Cardinal Medeiros was not responding to their calls for a greater role for women. Sister Frances Froehlich, who used to be head of the Sisters Senate in Boston, said she was disturbed when Cardinal Medeiros opposed the creation of a Women's Commission for the archdiocese. ''I think women are being denied access to full participation,'' she said, ''and that's discrimination.'' While recognizing that Pope John Paul II opposes women being ordained as priests, Sister Frances contended that other cities had still managed to share more power with women, who she said were ''doing most of the nitty-gritty of the church's work.'' There are no figures available to show whether the number of Catholics in the archdiocese is increasing, but a study conducted by the archdiocese predicts a decline in the number of priests, from 1,031 in 1980 to 818 by the year 2000. Professor O'Brien of Holy Cross said, ''There has been a sense of drift and discouragement among priests in Boston over the past 10 or 15 years, a lack of any sense that it's exciting to be a Catholic in Boston.'' He added, ''The other side of that conservatism is the residual loyalty. It doesn't take much of an invitation to get them back.'' Consequently, many here believe the Vactian's choice of a new archbishop will have a crucial effect on the direction of the church in Boston. ''Boston is coming out of a bad time, with the racial crisis,'' a former priest said, adding: ''The generosity of the spirit of the church has not been mobilized. But it is sleeping giant that could wake up and do a lot of good.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9TH DISTRICT: THE 'FAIR FIGHT' CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/nyregion/9th-district-the-fair-fight-campaign.html,"OSSINING AS the sun beat down on the Chilmark Shopping Center here, Bill Crosbie assembled campaign literature last week under the raised trunk lid of Stan Kirwin's Toyota. Then Mr. Crosbie, a County Legislator, set off with Mr. Kirwin, who is running for Ossining town justice, and two local Republican candiates to knock on doors in Indian Village, a section of small houses on neatly trimmed lawns in the eastern part of the village. ''I don't know the district yet,'' said Mr. Crosbie, a Republican. ''It's always best to go with a local leader who can introduce you.'' Down in Tarrytown, Sandy Galef toted her yellow campaign shopping bags up to Joseph Goldfeder, a 79- year-old retiree who was sunning himself on a bench outside Fascinating Foods on North Broadway. A Democrat who is also a County Legislator, Mrs. Galef explained that she was running against Mr. Crosbie. ''You better get yourself known,'' said Mr. Goldfeder, who lives in Tarrytown. The need for increased recognition in new neighborhoods has become a fact of political life for both William R. Crosbie, 59 years old, and Sandra R. Galef, 43, who are locked in the only ''fair fight'' race for a seat on the County Board of Legislators this fall. They are both running in the Ninth District, to which Mr. Crosbie was appointed this year and into which Mrs. Galef, a Democrat, was thrown by reapportionment. Only one will survive. Redistricting has meant the loss of the Second District for Mrs. Galef, who lives in Ossining and represented it for two years on the Board. She must now campaign in the less-familiar Ninth District, including Tarrytown, which has been Mr. Crosbie's home for 28 years. By contrast, Mr. Crosbie, a Legislator in the early 1970's who was appointed to serve out the term of Richard L. Brodsky - who was elected to the State Assembly in 1982 - must learn about the voters in Ossining and Briarcliff Manor, a Galef stronghold. The Ninth lies along the Hudson River and includes Tarrytown and an unincorporated part of the town of Greenburgh on the south, North Tarrytown, part of the town of Mount Pleasant and the villages of Briarcliff Manor and Ossining on the north. The Ninth District has lost the villages of Irvington and Elmsford and much of the rest of Greenburgh. The district has become more formally Republican in its party enrollment, according to County Board of Elections figures. Before reapportionment, there were 9,943 Democrats and 8,609 Republicans enrolled in the Ninth and 6,201 voters who stated no party preference. In the new Ninth, the figures stand at 7,328 Democrats, 7,643 Republicans and 6,540 independents. ''The only way I can win is to have the support of Republicans and independents,'' said Mrs. Galef last week. Both she and Mr. Crosbie acknowledge that Mrs. Galef has retained somewhat more of her old district's population than Mr. Crosbie has. ''All I've got to do is neutralize Ossining, and I'll win,'' said Mr. Crosbie. He declined to say how many votes he thought he would need. By last Tuesday, 1,422 signed petitions collected by the Common Sense Independent Party on Mrs. Galef's behalf had been filed with the Board of Elections, Mrs. Galef said. She will need 837 valid signatures to gain an independent line on the Nov. 8 ballot. Mr. Crosbie has the Conservative Party endorsement as well as the Republican line. A Right-to-Life Party candidate, Kathleen A. Yasinsac of Tarrytown, is also on the ballot. Mrs. Yasinsac, 41, a mother of four who for ''personal reasons'' does not plan to campaign actively, said that ''to keep the party viable you have to have candidates on the ballot.'' She added that more education was necessary for voters to realize that ''tax dollars are going for abortions.'' A number of issues divide the two major-party candidates, including Ossining Sewer District taxes, the Indian Point nuclear plants and how effective each can be as Board members. To homeowners answering his ring last week, Mr. Crosbie emphasized that Mrs. Galef had been responsible for ''a 220 percent increase'' this year in the tax rate for the Ossining Sanitary Sewer District. The rate for Ossining rose from $4.49 per $1,000 of assessed valuation last year to $14.39. Mr. Crosbie said that an ''artificially low'' 1982 rate had resulted from the return of $1.2 milllion in reserve funds for the district to taxpayers through lowered rates. He asserted that the action was ''against county policy'' and that the money should have been gradually returned over a period of several years. The funds were returned because the start of operations at the district's county sewage-treatment plant in Ossining had been delayed more than a year. It began to treat waste in June last year. Mrs. Galef said last week that ''my perspective is that that the money belongs in the taxpayers' pockets instead of in the county's reserves.'' Mr. Crosbie pointed out that in his 1983 budget message, Alfred B. DelBello, then the County Executive, had described the action as ''unfortunately contrary to county policy of using such reserves, on a planned basis, to ameliorate tax increases in future years.'' Mrs. Galef said that she had a letter approving the action signed by Mr. DelBello and Edward J. Brady, the Board's Republican majority leader. She said the letter had been written before the vote by which the Board of Legislators had approved the action. Potentially, the district's sewer rate may be reduced because of two new customers. Under one of three plans being considered by the county for the International Business Machines Corporation's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, it would join the sewer district. Another likely customer is a new facility being built by the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America - the Maryknoll Fathers - in the town of New Castle. In both cases, the county is negotiating the financial arrangements for using the sewer-treatment plant, which was built and is run by the county. Of the nuclear facilities at Indian Point, Mrs. Galef said, ''I still don't think we have a safe plant. We should shut them down until we have an evacuation plan that everybody agrees is acceptable. We have buses but no drivers. We haven't trained emergency workers.'' Mrs. Galef, whose home lies within a 10-mile radius of Indian Point, said she was not against nuclear power as such, ''but I'm concerned because we're in such a populated area.'' Mr. Crosbie, a vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York, said, ''The plant is safe. Close it, and we'll raise the cost of power to Con Ed customers. It might close General Motors.'' The G.M. plant in North Tarrytown is a major employer in the county. ''The evacuation plan has to be re- formed, but we don't want 2,000 people to lose their jobs,'' Mr. Crosbie said, referring to employment at the plants owned by Consolidated Edison and the New York State Power Authority. Mrs. Galef was critical of Mr. Crosbie's status as the only New York City commuter on the 17-member Board of Legislators because his bank position takes him away from Board duties. She is a homemaker and former teacher, whose husband, Steven A. Galef, is a New York lawyer. Mr. Crosbie said of the Board, ''This is a part-time job. I've been at 90 percent of the Board meetings and 99 percent of the budget meetings.'' He is a member of the Board's Budget and Appropriations and Public Works Committees. Mrs. Galef is on the Health and Hospitals and Legislation Committees. ''He indicates I'm a housewife and jobless,'' Mrs. Galef said of Mr. Crosbie, ''but I keep telling him I have a full-time job, I love it and want to keep it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POPE AGAIN EXHORTS U.S. ON SEXUAL MORALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/world/pope-again-exhorts-us-on-sexual-morality.html,"For the third time this month, Pope John Paul II made a major statement today condemning those who disobey the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on marriage and the family. Significantly, it was the second time this month that the Pope addressed such statements directly at the United States. As he had on Sept. 5, he chose a group of visiting American bishops to reiterate his opposition to what he is thought to view as a decline in morality in the United States. The Pope attacked ''the suggestion that other types of relationships can replace marriage and the family.'' He urged the 14 bishops to persuade Christian couples that there must be no cohabitation without the marriage sacraments. This alone, the Pope said, ''possesses the qualities of unity, permanence or indissolubility, fidelity and truthfulness.'' He linked conjugal love with procreation. ''The spouses share with God the continuing work of creation,'' the Pope said. ''The church encourages couples to be generous and hopeful, to realize that parenthood is a privilege,'' he continued. ''They must be encouraged to see the child as an enrichment of their marriage and a gift of God to themselves and to their children.'' The Pope urged couples to decide ''thoughtfully and prayerfully'' about the spacing of births and the number of children they have. He condemned any other form of family planning. ''Couples must be urged to avoid any actions that threaten a life already conceived, that denies or frustrates their procreative power, or violates the integrity of the marriage act,'' he said. He told the bishops that ''natural family planning'' was an important part of their ministries to families. The number of couples using it is constantly growing, he said, ''but much more concerted effort is needed.'' Priests must see to it that natural methods are known to couples and those who experience difficulty in their practice receive ''competent instruction,'' the Pope said. He denounced what he called present-day ''trivialization or desecration of sexuality.'' ''Sexual love is truly human only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and a woman commit themselves totally to one another until death,'' he said. The Pope noted in passing the role the American church is playing on behalf ''of the poor, for racial, ethnic and cultural minorities, as well as for the disadvantaged.'' But he turned again to family issues in paying tribute also to the church's activities in campaigning against abortion. ''We simply cannot accept the contemporary pursuit of exaggerated convenience and comfort,'' the Pope declared. ''We must realize that in our struggle to overcome the negative influences of modern society we are identified with Christ the Lord.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STAGE VIEW; EVEN MINIMAL SHEPARD IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/theater/stage-view-even-minimal-shepard-is-food-for-thought.html,"REGEN Nightingale Tues A.M. Back in 1970, Sam Shepard's ''Unseen Hand'' introduced us to the Sorcerers and Silent Ones of the High Commission of Nogoland, reclusive but awesomely influential creatures with a special enthusiasm for mind warps, time splits, telepathic force-fields, dimensional overlays and other brain-splintering voodoo. Well, 13 years later it looks rather as if Mr. Shepard was writing coded prophecies about himself. With ''True West'' nearly a year into its run at the Cherry Lane, ''Fool for Love'' thriving at Circle Rep, and ''Superstitions'' and ''The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill'' just arrived at La Mama, it is clear that he has cast a much more than ordinary spell over the theatrical faithful; no bad thing in my view, and perhaps no surprising one either, given the competition currently about. There is nothing like hearing some other dramatists hold forth on American themes to make one appreciate Shepard, even minor Shepard, and even minimal Shepard, such as the two fragments at La Mama. Take Erik Brogger's ''Basement Tapes'' at the Village Gate. On the quaint assumption that something called the Reactionary Independent Party is about to be launched, and at about 20 times the necessary length, this purported satire asserts that Mr. Nixon is tricky, Mr. Ford slow-witted and G. Gordon Liddy a mewling neurotic posing as a Nietzschian superhero. Could one conceive of the author of ''Operation Sidewinder'' producing a work so visually and verbally skimpy, so relentlessly rectilinear in its attack on skullduggery in high places? Or take Kathleen Tolan's ''Weekend Near Madison'' at the Astor Place. This won golden opinions at last February's Louisville Festival, and one can see why. It is deft, affectionate and amusing in its depiction of, respectively, a Wisconsin psychiatrist and his wife trying to survive the botched abortion of their first child, and two hard-line feminists deciding how best one of them is to become pregnant. But is it (asks a small voice) quite enough to be deft, affectionate and amusing about subjects which, if you think about them for more than a moment, do have darkish fissures running beneath the surface? Is it enough to end with a smile, a shrug, and the inference that these essentially well-meaning folk will muddle on through? It is a talented play, no doubt of it; but it suffers from one of the more crippling theatrical diseases, chronic evasiveness edging into terminal harmlessness. To borrow his own imagery, Shepard is as evasive as a supercharged Packard and as harmless as a rattlesnake in a mailbox. That curvilinear talent of his may express itself in oblique, metaphorical ways, but it customarily leaves you feeling you've been boxed up for two hours with someone with a conscientious zeal for confrontation, danger. He is not the man to let fissures of feeling remain unexplored or to wince away from ugly denouements. Think of Tilden at the end of ''Buried Child,'' lumbering onstage in his lobotomized way to present his wrangling, chaotic family with the corpse of the baby they have destroyed. Think of much of ''Fool for Love.'' This play's reviewers have quite properly ransacked its text for meaning and, quite rightly, found several of Mr. Shepard's peculiar concerns there: the preoccupation with a callous, rejecting yet still cherished father; the feeling that the family as a whole is a disaster zone; the rueful recognition of the decay of the West; the insistence on the unreliability of observation; the elusiveness of truth. But he has long proclaimed his indifference to ''ideas which speak only to the mind''; and I wonder if his critics have done enough justice to the sheer force of the piece, the way it constantly caps one piece of testimony to the unruliness of love with another and yet another. First and centrally, there's the protagonist's raging, resentful passion for her half-brother, himself seemingly unable to live either with or without her. Then out of the darkness comes a glare of lights, a screech of brakes, a sound of gunfire: his abandoned mistress, it seems, making herself rather drastically felt. And then we have one of the longest and most riveting of Mr. Shepard's celebrated monologues, describing the bigamous loves of the couple's father and his two wives' abject and finally suicidal obsession with him. Mr. Shepard flirts perilously with melodrama, given all the howling, banging on walls, and (to quote a stage direction as well as to describe Kitty Whitton Baker's fulsome performance) ''weeping'' of bodies; but flirtation stays safely short of consummation. Indeed, there were times when it seemed to me we had an American ''Ph edre'' on our hands. Or perhaps that's to overdo it. Certainly a visit to the double-bill at La Mama should discourage anyone tempted to deify Mr. Shepard, because at least one-half of it is too obvious and predictable to justify its belated premiere in New York. ''Pecos Bill'' was actually his contribution to the Bicentennial, and is just the sort of back-handed celebration one would expect of him: a gaudy cantata in which the outlaw of the title, arriving onstage on a wicker scorpion, boasts of strangling tornadoes, tearing down mountains and digging the Rio Grande by hand, only to end in querulous bewilderment: ''Why is we forsaken, lost in shame, forgotten?'' Still, the piece should provide the burgeoning Shepard industry with some useful footnotes. Not only does it contrast the magnificence of the myth with the bleakness of contemporary reality; it also reminds us of what was tawdry and squalid in that supposed magnificence. This is surely the answer to those who accuse Mr. Shepard of mindless nostalgia for the Old Frontier. He dreams, as many of us do, of release, liberty, being at one with the wilderness, but he knows what this often meant and means in practice. The Morphan Brothers scratching a living from robbing trains in ''The Unseen Hand.'' Crude, aggressive Lee in ''True West,'' gambling on his fighting dog in no-hope hamlets. Pecos Bill, the swaggering blabbermouth, killing his wife. ''Superstitions'' is even less easy to categorize as drama, consisting as it does of snippets from the scattered reverie Mr. Shepard recently published as ''Motel Chronicles,'' (and incidentally omitting its most striking segment, the tale of a friend's brain operation). Yet I must confess myself much more interested by the monologues nonchalantly put across by Mark Petrakis and by his occasional conversations with his co-star O-lan Shepard. They offer glimpses of the unsettled furniture of Mr. Shepard's mind: an American Primitive dresser here, a baroque table there, and everwhere chairs in which you and I, too, can sit if we fit. The piece is about dreads and fixations and morbid, pre-dawn imaginings. How the chainsaw will kick back and mutilate you. How nuclear disaster will come and no one will warn you, because you haven't a radio or a working phone or even a good friend to ring you. It is about compulsions and compulsive behavior. How you'll maybe win if you keep certain betting tickets in certain pockets. How you can exorcise an unwanted admirer by walking in perscribed patterns in front of her door - not letting her see you, of course, or you'll die. It would be a rather literal-minded scholarship that went on from here to draw attention to the many monomaniacs who stumble bug-eyed through Mr. Shepard's oeuvre: at the extreme point, Henry Hackenbush alias Howard Hughes in ''Seduced,'' a scrawny, wizened pharoah given to plastering his naked body with Kleenex; or Lanx and Wheeler in ''Angel City,'' moguls hell-bent on making a disaster movie capable of causing mass panic and mass suicide, thus relieving urban pollution in Los Angeles. It is what obsessional behavior means and represents that matters. It is a foredoomed attempt to gain or regain lost identity, understanding and control. It is desperate magic, born of disorder, helplessness and desolation. It is insecurity writ huge. This brings us, naturally enough, to that legion of the lost which peoples Mr. Shepard's plays. Their essential tragedy, or at least the reason they are lost, seems to me to be that they are simultaneously searching for things that are incompatible and possibly not attainable anyway: excitement and security, the exhilaration of self-fulfillment and a sense of belonging, freedom and roots. What chance for the dedicated loner in a world increasingly given over to money-men and real estate swindlers, like those who entrap, ruin and selectively slaughter the dilapidated family of ''Curse of the Starving Class''? What hope of genuine self-expression for exemplary victims like those at the centers of ''Geography of a Horse Dreamer'' and ''Angel City'' - the one a shaman in the hands of profiteering mafiosi, the other a writer in the grip of Hollywood, a place eloquently if high-handedly evoked by green ooze and fanged men with green skin? There is no escape, and no retreat. That would seem to be the glum conclusion of Mr. Shepard's ''family trilogy'': ''Starving Class,'' ''Buried Child,'' ''True West.'' Out there, in Norman Rockwell country, the avocados are rotting on the trees, father is drunkenly smashing in the door, and one sibling is trying to strangle another. The family is less a refuge than a trap which seduces, grips, then maims or kills; and its roots and traditions are also its curse, an inexorable handing-over of loss from one generation to the next. Hence the flamboyant and usually empty gestures to which Mr. Shepard's characters are prone. Flailing about for personal and social significance, they adopt masks, images, roles, sometimes pretending to themselves they are really faces, identities, selves. ''Pecos Bill'' would be a tiny example. The best, because it is Mr. Shepard's most extravagantly imaginative play, would be ''Tooth of Crime,'' a picture of a rock idol destroyed, not merely by a younger rival, but by the impossibility of sustaining the hard, mean style he must affect in order to survive. ''It ain't me,'' he yells; and shoots himself. It's said Mr. Shepard's plays are obscure. Don't be intimidated: they have become less quirky and more accessible in recent times, while getting no less original, complex and resonant. It's also said that he is exclusively American in his subject matter and appeal, a claim which ignores the interest taken in him in Britain, in Scandinavia and elsewhere. If you seek confirmation of his scope, listen to this brief, germane and far-from-parochial piece of self-explication: ''I think we're split in a much more devastating way than psychology can ever reveal. It's not so cute. Not some little thing we can get over. It's something we've got to live with.'' Those words could have come from David Storey or the late David Mercer, British dramatists whose obsession with the loss of their working-class roots has produced plays packed with the sense of fragmentation, disintegration. They could come from Samuel Beckett himself. In fact, they are Mr. Shepard's own observation on ''True West,'' which is about a tame brother who partly yearns to be wild and a wild brother who partly yearns to be tame, about the longings of the heart and the longings of the head and the impossibility of reconciling the two, at least on planet Earth. If ''Fool for Love'' is Mr. Shepard's motel-room ''Ph edre,'' ''True West'' is his West Coast ''Endgame.'' There is a level, and not so far beneath the surface, at which his brothers can claim kinship with Beckett's Hamm and Clov: ravenous body and troubled mind, each incomplete in itself, interdependent yet doomed to be hostile. No, Mr. Shepard is not ''just'' American. The truth rather is that he is a dramatist of international stature who brings a distinctively American idiom, context and imagination to universal confusions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BURGER'S WARREN COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/opinion/burger-s-warren-court.html,"Predictions of the death of the Warren Court have been considerably overstated. Whether they have been only premature, or will instead come to be viewed as false alarms, is likely to be decided in the next nine months and on Election Day 1984. Thirty years ago, Dwight D. Eisenhower named Earl Warren Chief Justice of the United States. On Oct. 3, the Supreme Court opens its 15th term under his successor, Warren E. Burger. Since 1969, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, all highly critical of Warren era rulings, have among them chosen six of the nine Justices. Of the 1960's liberal majority, only William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall still sit. A Democrat has not named a Justice in 16 years. Thus, we might reasonably have expected Warren Court cases protecting individual liberties to be more at home on a Smithsonian shelf than in a law library. Yet nothing so grave has occurred. Warren Court momentum has continued into the 1980's. The Burger Court appears most conservative when seen in its predecessor's shadow. Some cases have retreated from, or have refused to extend, 1960's precedents. Some have been dreadful for civil liberties. Some would have been decided differently by the Warren bench. But the Burger Court, taken out from under the Warren shadow, emerges as more responsive to individual rights than any other Supreme Court in our history. Landmark cases restricting capital punishment, assuring reproductive freedom, protecting commercial speech, upholding affirmative action to redress discrimination, expanding constitutional remedies and protecting the rights of women, aliens and children of unmarried parents have all been decided since 1970. Some of these cases were based on Warren Court precedents, but were not required by them. Why have three Republican Presidents with six appointments not succeeded in reversing the Court's liberal direction? How is it that Mr. Burger, William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor, the Justices most hostile to Warren Court rulings, have not won majorities that take strong conservative positions, or, frequently, majorities at all? The answer partly lies in the difficulty a President has in predicting how a candidate will vote once tenured on the Court. Also, some Presidents select solely on merit and nominal party affiliation, as President Ford has claimed in explaining his choice of John Paul Stevens. Most important, the Supreme Court is a collegial institution whose members must work together for years, even decades. So another explanation for the conservatives' failure to build a strong working majority lies in the attributes of individual Justices. It is increasingly clear that Mr. Brennan, seated in 1956, deserves much of the credit for fashioning the legal theories that support progressive decisions of the Warren and Burger eras. The ideas he advanced in the 1960's have influenced the Court's direction in the 1970's and 1980's. Among his opinions are such significant 1960's cases as Baker v. Carr, which held that Federal courts can review the apportionment of state legislative districts; New York Times v. Sullivan, the first in a series of cases giving the news media and others a constitutional defense in libel actions by public officials; and Shapiro v. Thompson, invalidating residency requirements for welfare applicants. The list continues into the Burger era, with such cases as Eisenstadt v. Baird, which recognized an unmarried person's right to birth control information and advanced the doctrinal basis for then pending abortion cases; Plyler v. Doe, striking down a Texas law denying free public education to illegal alien children; and a host of cases strengthening women's constitutional rights. Moroever, scholars have begun to identify Mr. Brennan's doctrinal contributions to opinions of other Justices and his facility for finding common ground that binds tentative majorities. To be sure, Mr. Brennan lost many battles after the liberal majority faded. Some positions - for example, that the death penalty is unconstitutional - probably would have failed in both eras. Others, like his view that Congress may not deny Medicaid for elective abortions, almost surely would have persuaded former colleagues. Supreme Court majorities cohere around principles, not personalities. The liberal momentum has continued in large part because of Mr. Brennan's intellectual strength. He is the Court's liberal theoretician, but he has been able to forge majorities by advancing principles also acceptable to Court centrists - something the conservatives have failed to do as often as one might have expected. Three dangers loom. Mr. Rehnquist could bid for doctrinal leadership when Mr. Brennan leaves. If he succeeded, he might attract the centrists and give conservatives more victories. Second, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Burger, Mr. Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Lewis F. Powell Jr., all well into their 70's, are likely to retire before the 1988 Presidential election. If Mr. Reagan wins in 1984, he may get to pick a Court majority in a very brief time. (Mr. Burger and Mr. Powell might leave before next summer to assure that their successors are Republicans.) The third danger is different. President Nixon tried to weaken the Court by nominating mediocre lawyers. President Reagan, who appears to have learned from that mistake, is likely to nominate intellectually stellar conservatives, able to challenge Mr. Brennan's doctrinal leadership while he sits, and thereafter to dominate constitutional jurisprudence. Virtually no nominee is likely to win Senate confirmation after the start of next summer. Nominations late in a Presidential year are generally delayed pending election returns, though an exception might be made for a person of national stature, a Democrat or a respected Senator. So the critical times for the Court and for the legacy of the 1960's are the next nine months and Election Day 1984. Not even the remarkable talents of a William J. Brennan would be able to resist if those tides of history flowed to the right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Charlotte Curtis Politics, Women and Money",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/arts/charlotte-curtis-politics-women-and-money.html,"THE invitation on Democratic National Committee stationery was for a women's luncheon with Isabelle Leeds and Marife Hernandez as the hosts, and it mentioned ''access to the decision- making process'' and hinted at ''benefits'' accruing to those who contributed between $1,000 and $10,000. Fourteen women, including Faith Stewart-Gordon of the Russian Tea Room, Betty Friedan and Mrs. Joseph E. Levine, the movie mogul's wife, were sufficiently intrigued, and they showed up at the ''21'' Club to see what was going on. Mrs. Leeds and Miss Hernandez, in Adolfo suits with ties, greeted guests. Over cocktails, Hamptons regulars compared notes with those who'd contemplated democracy in the meadows of Aspen, Colo. Lynn Cutler, Iowa's first woman county supervisor, who lost two Congressional bids before becoming the Democratic National Committee's vice chairman, began to put faces with names she was hearing, mostly for the first time. And after 45 minutes or so, Miss Hernandez urged everyone to her assigned table. Waiters were dishing up the gumbo when Mrs. Leeds welcomed everyone to ''21,'' which she called ''a home away from home for most of you.'' She made no bones about why they'd met. ''We always hear about the input men have in the party,'' she said. ''The question is how they got it. Well, they get it by paying to get into the game. What we're going to talk about is how we can get it and what the prices are.'' Miss Hernandez reminded everyone how busy they were. ''We're going to eat, think and talk at the same time,'' she said, introducing Mrs. Cutler. ''When we moved into the D.N.C.,'' Mrs. Cutler began, ''there was broken furniture lying on its sides. It looked like the fall of Saigon.'' What she meant was the chaos that party headquarters become after it loses a Presidential election, as in 1980. Instead of explaining, she said the Democratic National Committee was dedicated to women running for office. She was about to go on about women when three dressings (French, cheese and watercress) for the chicken salad appeared. While she paused to make her choice (watercress), Alice Heyman, who described herself as ''a fallen-away Republican,'' wanted an assessment of labor's support for women in 1984. ''The unions will support women,'' Mrs. Cutler said, sprinkling her salad with bacon bits. ''But we must deal with the big issues: the economy, war and peace.'' Mrs. Friedan looked distressed. ''If women are to be taken seriously,'' she said, ''we wouldn't be called here to give money but to give our ideas. I worry that the Democratic leadership doesn't take us as seriously as they take labor and minorities. If women work together, ours is a greater power than labor's.'' Mrs. Cutler gave up eating. ''But I'm here as the vice chair, not head of the women's division,'' she said. ''We're counting on you to help with the issues and the dollars. We want you in visible, viable places, in convention delegations. Or you can get there through contributions.'' She said she wanted the D.N.C.'s finance and business councils to be 50 percent women. The council literature was in folders at each place, but nobody'd gotten to it. If they had, they'd have found that it costs $1,000 to join the women's group, $5,000 for the finance council, and $10,000 for the business council. Besides a chance for commitment, the councils offer a quid pro quo called ''benefits.'' Finance members are promised ''quarterly meetings of a substantive and social nature'' where ''members are briefed by prominent Democrats,'' ''issue dinners and breakfasts'' with party bigwigs, and ''the opportunity'' to attend the national convention as ''honored guests'' with ''convention access.'' That means you're invited, allowed so many seats and invitations, and pay all your own expenses. Business council membership, including ''senior officials of major corporations, associations, and allied professional groups,'' promises the same quarterly meetings, but ''with nationally known speakers leading panels and discussion groups.'' That $10,000 guarantees ''contact not only with other leaders of the American business community,'' but with ''the political and intellectual leaders of America.'' The council also provides ''the opportunity'' to attend the convention. None of this came up at lunch. Mrs. Cutler's pitch was for women's equal participation and therefore equally expensive contributions to the national committee. Guests who spoke up wanted the national committee's support on women's issues first. ''I thought we were going to hear about an emergency registration campaign for women,'' Mrs. Friedan said. Robin Duke of the Abortion Rights Action League said women should be concerned with a wide range of national issues and not limit themselves to those specific to women. Bess Myerson seemed to agree. Barbaralee Diamondstein, an arts writer, wondered what the national committee had in mind for women who didn't have big money to contribute. Mrs. Cutler, who had been standing so long that she had taken a shoe off, assured her the party had work for them, Before leaving, Ellen Straus of radio station WMCA thanked the hosts. ''You've done well,'' she said. ''Before doing the next step, come back and listen to us.'' Mrs. Straus had reservations about a registration campaign. ''Do we really want to register all women or women who are with us?'' she asked. On that note, the lunch adjourned. Within days, Miss Hernandez, a former protocol chief for New York, paid up, becoming the first New York woman on the finance council. Mrs. Cutler wrote everyone, talking more quid pro quo for contributions, including $1,000 tickets for the Democratic Gala in Washington tomorrow and invitations to ''private dinner parties at the homes of prominent Democrats,'' where ''meaningful'' conversations might be held. Clearly, the Democratic National Committee was getting itself back in business again, shoring up what may or may not be ''meaningful'' relationships with women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; PHYSICAN-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY SLIPS AWAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/science/the-doctor-s-world-physican-patient-confidentiality-slips-away.html,"WHILE aboard an Amtrak train recently, a young doctor was telling a woman traveling with him about his cases. He spoke about how surgeons would soon probe into the brain of Mr. Jones, about the hormonal imbalances in Mrs. White's body and the clinical details of several other patients. He was learning medicine, this young doctor, and he was excited about it. He told his stories so enthusiastically that some passengers in the crowded train, who could not help but overhear the conversation, followed every word. The doctor sounded compassionate and interested in the psychological welfare of his patients and families. But, caught up in his enthusiasm, he apparently was referring to his patients by their real names. In doing so, the physician was betraying his patients by violating one of the fundamental tenets of medicine: the mandate to maintain confidentiality. In that betrayal, the young doctor was not alone. It has become increasingly apparent that patients can no longer assume that intimacies about their bodies or their private lives will be held in confidence by their physicians and those who work with those physicians. This has the potential for real danger. Total privacy may never have been possible, and all of us were aware of that on some level. But a patient's assumption that the doctor could be trusted has always been a necessary condition of effective treatment. Release of private information can, after all, be embarrassing and worse. There is, for instance, the story of a restaurant owner who was admitted to a hospital for an infection; when word got around about his illness, his business was severely hurt. The erosion of confidentiality is a troubling problem in medicine. The problem has become so nettlesome that the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is a Harvard teaching hospital, felt it had to post signs in its elevators recently saying: ''Hospital staff are reminded that patient information should not be discussed in public areas.'' James P. King, a hospital spokesman, observed that ''In too many hospitals in the country, rounds may be conducted in hallways or elevators, which is not appropriate.'' Part of the problem appears to be that some doctors - a small minority, one assumes - no longer value confidentiality as highly as virtually all doctors once did. One can only guess at the complicated reasons for this deterioration, but it is clear that these doctors reveal an absence of training and discipline that never would have been tolerated years ago. To some degree, the loss of privacy is not the fault of the doctors so much as it is a natural outgrowth of the way medicine and society have evolved. Even doctors who ardently wish they could maintain confidentiality can find themselves in doubt as to how to proceed. In the beginning, of course, there was no doubt. From the time of Hippocrates, doctors have sworn to protect the confidentiality of the information given to them by patients in the belief that the privacy of the patient-doctor relationship is an integral part of the healing process. That confidentiality has been viewed as a bond of trust that allows patients to confide in physicians all sorts of intimate details that they otherwise might not reveal to anyone else. A physician can collect almost a complete profile of a person's life in the hour or so needed to take a detailed medical history. In the process, single women may tell of abortions, married men about infidelities, others about psychological fears and teen-agers about using contraceptives. The thorough physician takes all these factors into account because any such secret, though it may not seem to be directly related to what brought the patient to the doctor, may influence the treatment and thus the course of an illness. Maintaining confidentiality was easier when there was a one-to-one relationship between doctor and patient. But that type of medical practice is vanishing. Now patients rarely see just one physician. The trend is for them to be cared for by a team of physicians or a series of them, each a specialist in a different area. The greater the number of people involved in a case, the greater the chance for confidentiality to diminish. For example, some patients who belong to health maintenance organizations may never see the same doctor in all their visits. Each time a new doctor treats them, there is a need to read the chart. That is particularly true in teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools where young doctors, like the one aboard the Amtrak train, care for patients and learn from them at the same time. The number of people involved in any case can go far beyond the team of doctors. Many of the larger teams have nonphysician members. And there are clerks who have access to operating room schedules, which can be extraordinarily revealing. Many of these people are pillars of discretion; some are not. In any case, hospital officials often have much less control over the indiscretions of nonmedical employees than they do over physicians. If you walk through hospital corridors or ride elevators in medical centers, you are bound to overhear the health workers tell stories that would make good plots for television soap operas. But in the hospitals, the stories are told with real names. Or ride a bus that picks up its passengers by a hospital. Too often, the hospital employees can be heard releasing their frustrations about difficult patients. If you sit in a doctor's waiting room, you may hear secretaries blurting out people's names as they book operations, take telephone calls for appointments, or discuss the personal finances of patients. The insurance system alone has eliminated any remnant of confidentiality. Dozens of people may see an individual's medical record, or portions of it, in checking on payments. Nevertheless, physicians themselves are sometimes the worst offenders, particularly at parties. The intellectual fascination associated with practicing medicine makes it natural for one physician meeting another to relate the intriguing details of a current case, perhaps with actual names being used. Often, the attending physician relates such stories in the presence of nonmedical people, too. Furthermore, some physicians brag about treating this celebrity or that prominent person. Whatever remaining bond of confidentiality might still exist, the patient is often the one to break it first. Some patients simply don't care who knows what. Others are so well aware of how little privacy there is that they have decided not to worry about it. The desire for confidentiality varies from culture to culture, too. A committee of the British National Health Service noted last month in The Lancet that attitudes toward privacy differed ''just as attitudes towards nakedness vary.'' In modern times, total confidentiality probably never existed. Eric W. Springer, a lawyer in Pittsburgh, said at a law and medicine conference at the University of Alabama in 1981, ''We are the victims of our own myth- making. There never was absolute confidentiality in health information, although many acted and pontificated as if this were the case.'' The statutory protections afforded such privileged communications vary widely among the states, Mr. Springer said, and because of changes in recent years, ''no repository is safe from attack; no piece of information is fully protected.'' Mr. Springer sees medicine going through an increasingly painful dilemma as the demands for confidentiality are met with growing demands for disclosure. Laws have broadened a physician's obligations in disclosing information obtained in treating a patient. Laws long have required physicians to tell health departments the names of patients who suffer from syphilis and some other sexually transmitted diseases so that epidemics can be thwarted. Doctors have been required to tell the police that they have removed bullets from patients. Newer compromises come from laws governing child abuse and occupational safety and health. In some countries laws may compel doctors to name individuals who take drugs that could impair the ability to drive. Doctors are well aware of the problem because there have been articles in medical journals calling confidentiality in medicine ''dead,'' ''shot full of holes'' or ''a decrepit concept.'' Moreover, few doctors are required to take the Hippocratic Oath before they obtain their medical licenses and, even when they do, the oath has no power beyond its tradition. What can be done? Perhaps greater attention should be paid to the problem in medical schools and health centers as well as in the insurance industry. Perhaps doctors could inform their patients, as some have suggested, about the limitations of confidentiality. What can the patient do? Not much, beyond banishing self-delusion.This discussion is certainly not meant as a suggestion that patients should be secretive in the doctor's office. A lie to a physician or an intentional omission of vital information could have results that are a much greater tragedy than the loss of a secret.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STOPGAP FEDERAL MONEY BILL IS VOTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/01/us/stopgap-federal-money-bill-is-voted.html,"Congress approached the new fiscal year with unaccustomed discipline today, swiftly approving a 40-day stopgap spending bill needed to keep the Government operating after midnight. The House gave final approval by a vote of 232 to 136, while the Senate approved the measure by voice vote. The measure now goes to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it Saturday, despite earlier Administration objections. Mr. Reagan's signature would avert a threatened shutdown of various Government agencies at the onset of the 1984 fiscal year Saturday. Administration budget officials had complained that the measure was nearly $10 billion above the President's request on domestic spending. But Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, told the House that he had received assurances from David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. ''I just got a call from the young slasher, and he informed me that he would recommend that the President sign,'' Mr. Conte said. In another action, House and Senate conferees postponed consideration of an extension of benefits for the long-term unemployed. The Senate approved an 18-month extension today, 89 to 0, while the House version would extend the benefits 45 days. The cost of the House version, if extended over a year, is estimated at $4.5 billion, while the Senate's version, supported by the Reagan Adminstration, would cost $3.7 billion over the 18 months. The bill would finance the Federal program for those who have exhausted the basic 26 weeks of jobless benefits and the special 13 weeks of extended benefits available in some states. The conferees are to resume discussions Monday. Money for the checks to be mailed next week was appropriated in the current fiscal year, so they will not be affected, officials said. Agreement in 80 Minutes Congress gave final approval to the stopgap spending measure after House and Senate conferees resolved their differences in an 80-minute session that contrasted with all-night sessions of previous years. To meet the midnight deadline, senators and representatives refrained from adding special-interest amendments after getting assurances that they would have ample opportunities to seek additional spending for their states and districts. The bill provides money though Nov. 10, as the Senate had proposed, rather than Nov. 15, which the House had wanted. At that time, a new resolution will be needed to provide continued funding for the agencies not covered by separate appropriation bills. The earlier date was intended to enable President Reagan to sign the next continuing resolution before his scheduled two-week trip to the Far East. Compromise on the Military The measure provides military spending at the rate of $247 billion annually, the amount approved by a House Appropriations subcommittee. The House bill had proposed $228 billion, and the Senate $253 billion. Officials of the Office of Management and Budget said the measure, if extended across the full year, would provide $74.9 billion in domestic spending above the levels fixed by law for programs such as Social Security or food stamps. This discretionary spending was $9.5 billion above the President's request, but $2.8 billion less than the current spending level and $6.7 billion under the ceilings in the budget resolution approved earlier this year by Congress. The bill continues prohibitions against the use of Federal funds for abortions except when the life of the mother is endangered, for busing to achieve school desegregation, and for efforts to bar school prayer. Baker Pleads for Reactor Despite his pleas to senators to withhold special-interest amendments, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the majority leader, sought to extract a commitment that funds ''should be continued'' for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in his home state of Tennessee. Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, argued against the proposal. ''I just have to keep faith with the House,'' he said. ''We made commitments to our colleagues in the Congress. We turned 'em all down.'' Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, replied, ''It's very important to the leader in the Senate that some reference be made to the project.'' Antiterrorist Money Voted The conferees ''deferred consideration'' of additional money for the project. Despite such arguments, the conferees did accept one amendment, which provided $5 million of the $50 million said to be needed for antiterrorist programs at the Los Angeles Olympics. Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the majority whip, brought up the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. ''I have visions of Munich,'' he said. ''This is not a routine thing.'' Four separate appropriation bills have been signed into law. They deal with housing and urban development, transportation, energy and water, and the legislative branch. A forthcoming supplemental appropriation bill is to provide the major vehicle for the dozens of special-interest amendments that are usually tacked onto continuing resolutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ENDORSEMENT SET BY WOMEN'S GROUP,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/01/us/endorsement-set-by-women-s-group.html,"Judy Goldsmith, head of the National Organization for Women, said today that NOW would for the first time endorse a Presidential candidate. The group will also ask each Presidential candidate to pledge to name a woman as his running mate in 1984, she said. But Mrs. Goldsmith said that defeating President Reagan was NOW's No. 1 priority for 1984. She said it would be weighed against the group's other goals, including its demand for a woman on the ticket, in deciding which candidate to endorse at the end of this year. ''It is definitely time'' for a woman to run for Vice President, Mrs. Goldsmith told a news conference as the annual convention of the 250,000-member organization opened here today. ''We will make it an issue in the endorsement,'' she said. ''It will not, any more than any of the others, stand by itself as the one, final determinant of whether we will endorse a candidate. Clearly it will be a major indicator of a candidate's commitment to equality for women.'' Candidates to Address Parley Earlier this week Democratic women leaders said at a meeting that the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket should go to a woman. The more than 2,000 delegates to the NOW convention will hear at least five of the Democratic contenders Sunday. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Senators John Glenn of Ohio, Gary Hart of Colorado and Alan Cranston of California and former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota are to speak and answer questions. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina may also address the convention. Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida, whose stands on abortion and rights of homosexuals are not in line with NOW's, was invited, but will not attend.

NORTH COUNTRY WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/books/north-country-women.html,"UNION STREET   By Pat Barker. 265 pp. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $13.95.  ''UNION STREET,'' Pat Barker's first novel, is set in the early 1970's in an unnamed city in England's industrial Northeast. The impoverished, grimy town has two basic industries: the steelworks, from which the men are frequently furloughed or prematurely retired, and the cake factory, where many of the women work or have worked. Miss Barker skillfully employs the factory setting to touch on matters like automation, race prejudice, feeblemindedness and the sheer human hardship experienced by some of those trapped on the assembly line. The author was born in the Northeast, in Thornaby- on-Tees, and lives now in nearby Durham. ''Union Street'' was well received when it appeared in England last year (the highest accolade or subtlest put- down being The New Statesman's comment that it was a ''long overdue working-class masterpiece''). Miss Barker was also included in a list of the 20 best young (under 40) British novelists, a designation almost as bleak and constricting as the landscape she draws and one that, as she was born in 1943, she will outgrow this year. Her novel is divided into seven sections, each named for a particular female. It begins with a chapter on the cheeky, prepubescent Kelly Brown, who is brutally raped by a man who has been shadowing her truant wanderings since morning, and ends with the near-octogenarian Alice Bell, who drags herself from home one wintry day to avoid the humiliation of the social welfare system and die in peace. Between these two are five quite wonderful chapters called ''Joanne Wilson,'' ''Lisa Goddard,'' ''Muriel Scaife,'' ''Iris King'' and ''Blonde Dinah.'' Together, the seven sections explore every permutation and nuance (both within and outside the desperate social milieu that is this author's artistic capital) of growing up, growing old, making do, making a liv Ivan Gold is a novelist and reviewer living in Boston. ing, having babies, raising children, absorbing grief, loving someone or hating where you are meant to love. Scores of characters, apart from the seven women named, spring vibrantly to life: their suitors, parents, siblings, husbands, children, their doctors and nurses and neighbors, as well as the denizens of the streets a cut above Union Street or a cut below. The seven women move easily and resonantly in and out of one another's lives and stories. This is a hoary fictional technique. John Dos Passos' ''U.S.A.'' comes quickly to mind, as does (for an American equivalent to the grinding, desperate poverty) the fiction of Harriette Arnow. Yet Miss Barker is equally capable of brilliantly bending the technical rules. Having situated us more or less comfortably in the head of Muriel Scaife, whose sickly young husband is about to die, she veers with great effect into the inner life of 12-year-old Richard Scaife, who will soon be dealing with the loss of the father he never really had. At the end of this story there is a scene in which Miss Barker manages to convey, with stunning economy and skill, the ineffable communion between bereaved wife and bereaved son. Her gifts are equally in evidence in ''Lisa Goddard,'' in which the harried mother of two young sons miserably awaits the birth of her third child, unwanted and overdue, while her ''redundant'' and boozing husband steals the money she has put aside for the new baby and beats her when she accuses him of the theft. She can scarcely accept the ''purple, howling dwarf'' she is finally delivered of: ''If she had been an animal she would have rejected it, would have sniffed at it and turned away, at once and finally.'' Here Miss Barker's magic lies in showing us how Lisa Goddard falls in love with her newborn daughter before they ever leave the hospital; you have to read it to believe it. Through many of the other chapters, as well as through her very own, moves the ample person of Iris King. She is earth mother and comforter to many, including Laura, her own violently schizophrenic aunt or perhaps cousin - Iris is not entirely sure which - who has a history of setting senior citizens on fire because they are of ''no use'' and is forgiven even for bopping Iris on the head with a vase. Iris is both bane and terror to others, among them her own pregnant 16- year-old daughter, Brenda. Iris threatens and cajoles Brenda into undergoing an abortion at the hands of the slovenly Big Irene, with horrific results. At the end, Iris (who never entirely forfeits our sympathy) is crooning to and stroking her socially acceptable grandson by her elder daughter. An unforgettable minor character is dotty old Mrs. Harrison, whose spouse, superannuated George Harrison, takes up with the ancient hooker Blonde Dinah. Miss Barker's pungent, raunchy North Country dialogue and her exact use of obscure words and neologisms, like a man's cheeks  juddering  while he sleeps, or the  scrumpling  of a newspaper for a fire, or an old woman's  muculent  eyes, alternate with passages of fine understated wit, for example this paragraph on the late John Scaife's mother-in-law: ''The old lady's conviction that her son-in-law had enjoyed excellent health, though a little shaken by his death, was by no means overcome.'' All in all, Pat Barker gives the sense of a writer who has enormous power that she has scarcely had to tap to write a first-rate first novel. I'm glad this book was published here and look forward to reading her next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOCAL STRUGGLE, LOCAL COMPROMISE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/books/local-struggle-local-compromise.html,"-1982  By Nathan Glazer. 359 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $20.  THE essays Nathan Glazer has written during the last 18 years constitute a model of social commentary - sustained, committed, detailed, lively and even-tempered. With extraordinary energy, Mr. Glazer has not only kept up with, but paid attention to, all the unexpected turnings of ethnic relations and ethnic ideology in the United States (and, more recently, in other countries). Of course, Mr. Glazer, who is a professor of sociology and education at Harvard University and co-editor of The Public Interest, has written on other issues during this period and he has written more on ethnic issues than the pieces in this volume; but this is his own selection, ''to form,'' he says, ''a running commentary on and analysis of issues of racial and ethnic conflict.'' The essays in ''Ethnic Dilemmas 1964-1982'' are occasionally repetitive, for Mr. Glazer's own convictions have not altered much over the years. He remains as committed to integration today as he was (and we all were) at the beginning of the civil rights movement. Michael Walzer , a professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, is the author of ''Spheres of Justice: A Defense of Pluralism and Equality.'' But he doesn't wear his convictions like blinders to narrow his vision; the collection as a whole is empirically rich, full of information about courts, schools, families and jobs. And Mr. Glazer has somehow managed to give his convictions an air of tentativeness and to acknowledge that his opponents might, sometimes, have a point. Indeed, our ethnic dilemmas are so difficult that it would take a fool to write about them in a conclusive voice. Again and again, Mr. Glazer poses the hardest question: What kind of society do we want to live in? He writes with a powerful urgency. No one but us can decide; the issue is not determined and the crucial choices are being made right now. Contemporary arguments about cultural pluralism, bilingualism and affirmative action are comparable to the arguments about immigration in the early 20th century. We will live differently tomorrow, with different opportunities, in different groups, under different legal arrangements, depending on how we choose today. The burden of Mr. Glazer's essays is a defense of what the American historian John Higham has called ''pluralistic integration,'' a kind of limited Americanization with the Government upholding a common political culture and a universalist law but not directly challenging ethnic loyalties. One can imagine Mr. Glazer, in a different mood, under different conditions, writing as Horace Kallen did in his social commentaries during the 1920's, attacking assimilationist pressures. But he is searching here for some middle ground between state-imposed uniformity and ethnic division, and it is his clear sense that the greater danger now is division. The danger is corporatism or, to use a religious analogy, establishmentarianism - that is, the recognition of ethnic groups as legal bodies with rights and entitlements. The United States is not threatened by the dominance of one such group, but by a systematic division of professional and bureaucratic positions and social resources among a range of groups. The bitterness and confusion that are likely to be engendered, or have already been engendered, by the process of defining the range and naming the groups is as much a part of the danger of such corporatism as is the likely outcome - a nation divided against itself. Mr. Glazer is not against division; he is committed to the separation of ethnic groups and the state, just as he is committed to the separation of church and state. These are the walls that, whether we love them or not, make good neighbors. His program is ''public neutrality and private freedom.'' I should stress that public neutrality, in his view, bars legal provision for, or enforcement of, ethnicity, but it is no bar to political activity on behalf of this or that ethnic group. He does not object to bloc voting, balanced tickets or political patronage. Nor does he object to legislation that expresses the cultural or religious preferences of groups that are able to put together a coalition and (temporarily) get their way. He would have preferred, for example, a state-by-state resolution of the issue of abortion, reflecting in each case the balance of ethnic and religious forces. Local struggle and local compromise are the best ways of dealing with political questions that involve the opposing views of ethnic and religious groups. Mr. Glazer prefers compromise to principle, politics to law, legislatures to courts. The right to organize politically to defend the material or ideal interests of one's group is a part of ''private freedom.'' But what are we to do about groups whose members lack the resources, skills or cohesiveness for this kind of collective self-defense? America's ethnic dilemmas have their origin for the most part in the inability of black Americans to make their way, on their own, from slavery and systematic exclusion to anything like pluralistic integration. It is the legal recognition of this inability, and then the attempt to find legal remedies through affirmative action and the enforcement of quotas, that has carried the country toward corporatism. When private freedom doesn't work, how can we maintain public neutrality? THREE responses to that question, three arguments against ethnic division, are reiterated throughout these essays. The first, and least satisfactory, is the claim that private freedom has indeed worked and is working in a ''rapid and satisfactory'' manner, as Mr. Glazer put it in 1978. I wonder if he would say that today. While real progress has been made in building up the black middle class, in 1983 we seem well on our way to the creation of a permanent and frighteningly large black underclass, unemployed or only intermittently employed, degraded and demoralized. To be sure, this underclass is not likely to be helped by affirmative action or by any quota system; still, Mr. Glazer is not always alert enough, I think, to the sense of desperation that lies just behind such proposals. His second argument is that legal remedies that are designed for blacks, and more or less well adapted to their situation, cannot be limited to them. We live under the rule of the law, and law must apply generally. Hence, from the very beginning, affirmative action programs have included all those groups whose situation might plausibly be compared to that of blacks - native Americans, Hispanics and Asian- Americans. But the last two of these turn out to be arbitrary composites, including groups that have done very well (Japanese and South Americans, for example) and hardly require help from the Government. Once help is available, however, it will be sought out; thus the demand of immigrants from India that they be included in the category ''Asian-Americans'' (how can they be left out?) despite their relative success in this country. And then what about white ethnics who lag behind many of the protected groups? Ultimately, quotas will have to be expanded; there will be legal pressure for universality and political pressure for inclusion. If some groups have rights, then all groups have rights, and since discrimination has been experienced by every successive wave of immigrants, the prospects for corporatist interventions to protect group rights are virtually unlimited. But, Mr. Glazer insists, so are the costs of intervention. For groups can have no enforceable rights unless they also have fixed memberships. Until now it has been a feature of American life that we move freely across group boundaries, emphasizing now one side, now the other, of our hyphenated identities or giving up such identities altogether and becoming, simply, Americans. If such movement is curtailed, we will find ourselves living more like French Canadians or Cypriots or even Lebanese than the way we live today. Mr. Glazer's third argument is a call for the acceptance of the consequences of a free and easy pluralism. ''If groups are real, then we must accept differences among them.'' The socioeconomic profile of each ethnic group differs from that of all the others because the groups themselves differ - in their internal culture, family arrangements and institutional development among other things. It makes no sense to defend cultural pluralism while denying its necessary consequences. Governmental action to annul those consequences and to maintain fixed statistical norms for group achievement will be costly, coercive, and, as long as the groups retain some independent vitality, unsuccessful. We must choose between socioeconomic uniformity and ethnic pluralism. If uniformity is what strict justice requires, then, in Mr. Glazer's view, we must give up strict justice and aim instead at a ''reasonable harmony'' of ethnic groups. But he suggests that justice might require something else - that we live with the differences among groups, even value them, and try ''to mitigate the negative consequences that society imposes for such differences.'' THAT last suggestion comes in an essay written in 1969. It isn't followed up, or even mentioned again, in the essays of the 70's and early 80's. But it seems to me to make a crucial point. Cultural differences that give rise to vast inequalities of wealth and power cannot be tolerated in a democratic society. That doesn't mean, however, that we can't tolerate cultural differences. What we can't tolerate are the vast inequalities - such as the extraordinary differences in black and white family incomes - that are called ''negative consequences'' of difference in a capitalist and bureaucratic society. Under conditions of greater equality, it would not matter if cultures differed; nor would it matter if, as a result of cultural differences, patterns of education and employment differed. If there were greater respect for each other among citizens, and if political power were more widely shared, and if disparities of wealth were limited and the connections of wealth with respect and power were cut, cultural differences would be easier to live with than they are today, and they might even be more interesting. That may be a utopian hope, but it lends itself also to practical proposals. And it suggests that the resolution of our ethnic dilemmas may be tied to a larger egalitarianism. Mr. Glazer, I suspect, would, prefer a different resolution - a gradual erosion, under conditions of freedom, of the different ethnic cultures, the ''forging of a single society.'' That would not, indeed, be a society of equals but rather a society where inequality was not aggravated by ethnicity. There is much to be said, however, for a society of a different sort, where ethnicity is not aggravated by inequality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6 DEMOCRATS APPEAL FOR BACKING AT NOW PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/03/us/6-democrats-appeal-for-backing-at-now-parley.html,"Six Democratic contenders for the White House promised applauding feminists today that they would consider picking a woman as a Vice-Presidential nominee in 1984. But minutes after hundreds of women jumped to their feet to applaud him, Senator John Glenn drew not whoops but catcalls. He told the annual conference of the National Organization for Women: ''Let me challenge you just a little bit on the E.R.A. I think we all loafed on the E.R.A. too much.'' ''What?'' many members of the the audience of 2,000 delegates called out in disbelieving and angry tones. ''Maybe you did, buddy,'' one woman shouted. ''I think when it was put forward we were very complacent about it and we didn't work hard enough,'' the Democratic Presidential candidate persisted, as the chorus of criticism continued. ''And I think the opposition, those on the other side, they outworked us, they outhustled us in many respects.'' Clarification Issued Senator Glenn later issued a clarification of his remarks about the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution, and met hastily with the leaders of the organization, which had struggled for years to win ratification of the measure. ''Certainly the women in that hall worked blood, sweat and tears,'' Betty Friedan said. She went to a reception given by the Senator afterward, where she said she told the Ohioan,''You may not have worked hard enough for the E.R.A., but we did.'' She reported that Senator Glenn said he meant that the establishment and leaders of the Democratic Party had not worked hard enough for the measure. Senator Glenn was one of six Presidential contenders who appeared today in a bid for the organization's support. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale received the warmest reception. In his written clarification Senator Glenn praised the ''tremendous sacrifice and hard work'' by NOW leaders and members and said he had meant to suggest ''that all those of us who hold national office, our party and all supporters of the E.R.A. must make every effort to see that this time we succeed.'' While some officials said most delegates would forgive his words as a slip of the tongue, NOW's president, Judy Goldsmith, said he ''may not have understood how many people in that room gave up time from their lives for the E.R.A.'' She added that he should have clarified better what he meant by ''we.'' 'Damage Control' Assessed Greg Schneiders, the Senator's press secretary, said ''only time will tell'' how effective were Senator Glenn's efforts at damage control. But he said he felt the Senator had straightened out the misimpression of criticism quickly enough that ''this will turn out to be a fairly minor thing.'' ''His speech was so well-received and he was so well-received, I think the day will turn out to be a plus.'' But Senator Glenn won a standing ovation when he closed his prepared speech by citing these words of the 19th-century suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton: ''To men, their rights and nothing more. To women, their rights and nothing less.'' His stumble came in an answer to a question. All the invited Democratic candidates appeared before the conference today; all voiced support for NOW positions on the equal rights proposal and each said he would seriously consider picking a woman as a Vice-Presidential candidate. Senator Gary Hart of Colorado said, ''I would be proud to run with a woman on either end of the ticket.'' Mr. Mondale, fresh from his victory in a Maine Democratic straw poll and having just received the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s general board, said he would not decide on his running mate before the Democratic nominating convention next July. He promised to solicit NOW's recommendations and take them ''very, very seriously.'' He said he would not choose anyone who is not a feminist. In response to the same question, former Senator George McGovern said, ''If there was ever anyone who has proved over the years that he needed help in the selection of a Vice-Presidential candidate, I qualify.'' He added that picking a woman is ''a very likely prospect.'' NOW has been pushing to have a woman named to the Democratic ticket. However, Mrs. Goldsmith said that a candidate would not have to promise to pick a woman as a Vice-Presidential candidate in order to be endorsed by the 250,000-member organtization. She said NOW's directors will make its endorsement when the board meets in December, or sooner. NOW's chief priority will be to back a candidate who can defeat President Reagan, she said. If President Reagan picks a woman for his running mate, as some have suggested, Mrs. Goldsmith said NOW will continue to work against him because, she went on, his policies harm women. Women at the conference saw today's performances by former Vice President Mondale, Mr. McGovern and Senators Hart, Glenn, Alan Cranston and Ernest F. Hollings as a tribute to their power. Taking note of the candidates' support of NOW's positions, Mrs. Friedan remarked, ''They all got it right. All of them have had such an education. There's light years of difference between the Presidential candidates last time and the time before, and now. They take women seriously.'' Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida, the seventh contender, was not invited to address the conference because he is not considered a supporter of freedom of choice on abortion. The candidates who appeared before the meeting supported a woman's right to an abortion and called for an end to inequities by sex in salaries, Social Security and private pension benefits and backed action aagainst child abuse, pornography and violence against women. In their conference here, women have been vociferous in their criticism of President Reagan, charging him with being callous and lacking compassion toward the most vulnerable groups in society, criticizing his budget cuts in social programs that affect poorer women and children and saying he has deliberately set out to reverse the progress of women toward equality of rights and opportunity. Leaders and some of the delegates meeting here believe President Reagan is mobilizing women, blacks, labor and Hispanic Americans into a coalition through his actions and policies, which they see as benefitting corporate America. ''We're a powerful coalition and we have the same enemy,'' said Michele Smith, a delegate from New Orleans. ''We need to unite and strengthen each other,'' she added. ''We're the majority.'' Asked if he thought the Democratic Party might come to be viewed as the captive of specialized interests because groups like women and labor are making such strong claims on it, Senator Mondale said he did not. ''I'm campaigning for the public interest,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KENNEDY TELLS FALWELL GROUP OF TOLERANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/us/kennedy-tells-falwell-group-of-tolerance.html,"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose political views sometimes test Moral Majority's belief in forgiveness, came here today to break bread with the Rev. Jerry Falwell and preach a message of religious tolerance. Mr. Kennedy, who was accompanied here by his daughter Kara and his sister Jean Kennedy Smith, received a friendly welcome from the estimated 5,000 students and townspeople who filled the college gymnasium. They laughed heartily at his one-liners and interrupted his remarks 16 times with applause, including his praise of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The college provided tight security for the Senator and carefully screened the questions asked by selected students. Both Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Falwell, who ate at the home of the evangelist before the program, said they had received vicious mail from people opposed to the Kennedy appearance. Kennedy in Good Form Mr. Kennedy was in good form, and when it was over, Mr. Falwell told him, ''You may have won a few souls tonight, but I'll get them back next Sunday.'' The Massachusetts Democrat told his audience of largely born-again Christians at Liberty Baptist College that groups such as Moral Majority had sometimes gone too far in mixing religion and politics. Mr. Falwell founded both Moral Majority and the college. Mr. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, said the controversy surrounding Moral Majority arose not only from its views, ''but from its name, which, in the minds of many, seems to imply that only one set of public policies is moral and only one majority can possibly be right.'' He added, ''Similarly, people are and should be perplexed when the religious lobbying group Christian Voice publishes a morality index of Congressional voting records which judges the morality of senators by their attitude toward Zimbabwe and Taiwan.'' Mr. Kennedy, whose personal life has been the subject of some of Mr. Falwell's sermons, touched on most of the controversial issues that divide him and Moral Majority: abortion, the proposed equal rights amendment, the nuclear freeze and school prayer. ''We sorely test our ability to live together if we too readily question each other's integrity,'' he said as the evangelist looked on. ''Dr. Falwell is not a 'warmonger,' and 'liberal clergymen' are not, as the Moral Majority suggested in a recent letter, equivalent to 'Soviet sympathizers.' ''The critics of official prayer in public schools are not 'pharisees.' And people are not 'sexist' because they stand against abortion; they are not 'murderers' because they believe in free choice,'' Senator Kennedy continued. The Senator's appearance here came about as the result of a computer error. Moral Majority inadvertently sent Mr. Kennedy a plastic membership card inviting him to join the fight against ''ultraliberals such as Ted Kennedy.'' When that was reported in newspapers, Cal Thomas, communications director for Moral Majority, sent the Senator a facetious note telling him he did not have to surrender the card. As an afterthought, Mr. Thomas said he ended the letter by suggesting that Mr. Kennedy speak at the college sometime. According to Robert Shrum, a Kennedy aide, the Senator read the note and broke into a big grin. ''Why not?,'' Mr. Shrum quoted him as saying. When Mr. Falwell heard that Mr. Kennedy had accepted the invitation, Mr. Thomas said, ''he turned white as a sheet and said, 'What!' He said some of his people thought Ted Kennedy was the Devil incarnate.'' Mr. Thomas said he convinced Mr. Falwell that aside from being a ''public relations stroke,'' having Mr. Kennedy come here would help dispel the idea some have that Moral Majority members are intolerant, closed- minded bigots. Mr. Falwell dispatched his private jet to Washington to fetch the Senator. In his remarks, Mr. Kennedy said, ''The separation of church and state can sometimes be frustrating for women and men of deep religious faith. They may be tempted to misuse government in order to impose a value which they cannot persuade others to accept. But once we succumb to that temptation, we step onto a slippery slope where everyone's freedom is at risk.'' Before the Senator arrived, one student at the college was asked for his thoughts on the event. ''Well,'' he replied, his mind probably scanning the scriptures for something appropriate, ''I guess if Daniel survived the lion's den Ted Kennedy won't have any trouble here. The Lord locked the jaws of the lions and the college has locked the mouths of the students.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT LETS STAND GUN BAN IN ILLINOIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/us/court-lets-stand-gun-ban-in-illinois.html,"The opening of the Supreme Court's new term today also marked the end of the legal road for some 700 appeals that the Justices decided not to hear. The 38-page ''order list'' that the Court issued this morning contained page after unbroken page of cases, most of which accumulated in the Court's three-month summer recess, that the Justices will never look at again. Among the more notable cases on that list were these: Gun Control The Court let stand an appeals court's ruling that a local ordinance banning the private possession of pistols did not violate the Constitution. At issue was an ordinance adopted in 1981 by the Illinois village of Morton Grove. Three groups of Morton Grove residents challenged the ordinance on the ground that it violated the Second Amendment's guarantee of ''the right of the people to keep and bear arms.'' The plaintiffs, supported in part by the National Rifle Association, lost in both Federal District Court and in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. The Supreme Court has issued only two decisions interpreting the Second Amendment. In 1886, it ruled that the amendment did not apply to the states at all, operating only as a limit on Federal legislation. In 1939, it rejected a Second Amendment challenge to a Federal law that prohibits transporting sawed-off shotguns in interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals based its decision on those two precedents. (Quilici v. Illinois, No. 82-1822). Religious Divorce The Court refused to hear an appeal from a ruling by New York's highest court that the promise contained in a Jewish marriage contract, to submit marital disputes to the authority of a rabbinical court, is enforceable in the civil courts of New York. Without a rabbinical divorce, known as a ''get,'' a Jewish woman may not remarry under Jewish law. A New York woman, Susan Avitzur, turned to the New York courts after her husband got a civil divorce and blocked her from obtaining a ''get'' by refusing to go before a rabbinical court. The New York Court of Appeals ruled, 4 to 3, earlier this year, that the promise contained in the ''ketubah,'' the standard Jewish marriage contract that the couple signed, to go before a religious panel was a prenuptial agreement that could be enforced as a civil contract. The former husband, Boaz Avitzur, sought a review on the ground that it was a violation of his religious freedom under the First Amendment to be required to submit to a religious body whose authority he no longer recognized. (Avitzur v. Avitzur, No. 82-1854). National Security The Court refused to review a ruling by a Federal appeals court that the National Security Agency is not required to obtain a warrant before scrutinizing private electronic communications. At issue in the case was not the intelligence agency's right to intercept worldwide electronic communications, one of its principal functions. Rather, the case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a Michigan lawyer, challenged the National Security Agency's warrantless examination of international telegrams that the lawyer had sent or received. The agency furnished summaries of the telegrams to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of a bureau investigation of the lawyer's activities. The lawyer, Abdeen M. Jabara, argued that his personal communications could not be examined without a warrant any more than the authorities could tap his telephone or read his mail. (Abdeen v. Webster, No. 82-1682). Wrongful Birth The Court let stand a ruling by the Supreme Court of Illinois that parents could not sue to recover the costs of rearing an unwanted child from a hospital that failed to diagnose the pregnancy in time to get a safe abortion. (Raja v. Reese Hospital, No. 83-17.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUSTICES TO RULE ON TRANSIT WAGES AND HOURS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/us/justices-to-rule-on-transit-wages-and-hours.html,"The Supreme Court, in its latest effort to map the elusive boundary between Federal and state authority, said today it would rule on whether publicly owned and operated mass transit systems must abide by Federal minimum wage and hour standards. Opening their 1983-84 term, the Justices accepted an appeal by the Federal Government from a decision by a Federal district court in Texas that public mass transit systems are immune from Federal wage and hour regulation. The lower court ruled that the immunity was required by the Constitution as a matter of state sovereignty. The case involves the San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, which sued in 1979 for a declaration that it was constitutionally immune from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Department of Labor filed a countersuit to require the transit authority to pay overtime to employees who worked more than 40 hours a week. The Government is arguing in its appeal that the lower court extended unduly the concept of state sovereignty that the Supreme Court announced in 1976, in a landmark ruling that the Justices have been trying to explain, without much success, ever since. Seeming Contradiction The latest case, Donovan v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit (No. 82- 1951), requires the Justices to reconcile two apparently contradictory decisions. The first is the 1976 ruling, National League of Cities v. Usery, in which the Court invoked the 10th Amendment to the Constitution to block Congress from extending the Federal minimum wage to state employees. The 10th Amendment provides that ''the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.'' That meant, the Court said in 1976, that Federal regulation could not ''displace the states' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.'' The opinion gave examples of some ''traditional governmental functions,'' but did not mention transit. Then two years ago, the Court ruled that the publicly operated Long Island Rail Road had no 10th Amendment immunity from the Federal law that gives railroad workers the right to strike. The operation of a commuter railroad, the Court said, is not a traditional government function. In its appeal in the San Antonio case, the Justice Department is telling the Court that mass transit, like commuter railroads, has not historically been one of the ''core state functions'' deserving of immunity from Federal regulation. On the other side, San Antonio and the American Public Transit Association are arguing that mass transit is now an integral government function like police, fire and sanitation, and that it is irrelevant for constitutional purposes that many transit systems have become public only in recent years. The Court today accepted 15 new cases for argument and decision this term, including five dealing with freedom of expression or information. At the same time, the Justices turned down some 700 appeals. The Court was greeted today with the result of one of its free-speech rulings last term, a decision that declared unconstitutional a Federal law that banned pickets from the public sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court building. A small group of anti-abortion pickets stood on the sidewalk this morning as the Court convened. Among other cases the Court added to its argument docket are these: Loitering Law The Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a New York law, struck down earlier this year by the state's highest court, that makes it a crime for a person to loiter in a public place for the purpose of ''engaging or soliciting another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse.'' The case, an appeal by the Erie County district attorney, is procedurally puzzling. The loitering law was a companion to a New York law prohibiting the act of sodomy itself between consenting adults. The New York Court of Appeals declared that law unconstitutional in 1980 in a decision known as Onofre, and the Supreme Court refused in 1981 to hear the state's appeal. When the New York Court of Appeals struck down the loitering law this year, it did so in a three-paragraph opinion based entirely on its Onofre decision. The court said it could not be a crime to loiter for the purpose of commiting an act that was itself not a crime. Although the Onofre decision is technically not before the Supreme Court, both sides in this case, N.Y. v. Uplinger (No. 82-1724), told the Justices it would be pointless to consider the loitering issue without deciding whether there is a constitutional right to engage in consensual sodomy, defined in the New York law as oral or anal sex between unmarried people. The Court has repeatedly turned down opportunities to decide that question. In accepting the case today, the Justices did not indicate their intention this time. Libel Order The Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a state trial court's order forbidding newspaper defendants in a libel suit from publishing any information they obtained in the course of pretrial discovery. Two Washington newspapers, The Seattle Times and The Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, were sued by the leader of a ''spiritualistic church'' about whom they had published derogatory articles. The plaintiff obtained a ''protective order'' prohibiting the papers from printing information about the church and its finances that they learned in the course of pretrial discovery. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the order. The newspapers are arguing, in Seattle Times v. Rhinehart (No. 82-1721), that under the First Amendment's free press guarantee, such a ''prior restraint'' can be justified only if the plaintiff can show that specific harm will result from publication. Cable Television The Court agreed to rule on the constitutionality of an Oklahoma law that prohibits cable television stations from broadcasting liquor advertisements. The ban was challenged by a group of Oklahoma cable systems, which argued that because it is technically impossible to excise individual commercials from satellite signals, the effect of the law would be to prevent the systems from retransmitting out-of- state signals to Oklahoma subscribers. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit said the ban did not violate the First Amendment. The Federal Government is supporting the cable systems' appeal, Capital Cities Cable v. Crisp (No. 82-1795). Sleeping Rights The Court accepted a Government appeal from a lower court ruling that demonstrators had a right to sleep in tents in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, as a way of dramatizing the plight of Washington's homeless people. A Federal regulation that prohibits ''camping'' in downtown Washington parks was interpreted by the National Park Service to prohibit sleeping in the tents. But the Federal appeals court here ruled last winter that the Government could not use that regulation to prohibit members of the Community for Creative Nonviolence from sleeping in their tents because sleeping was part of the message that the demonstrators had a First Amendment right to communicate. The Government's appeal, Watt v. CCNV (No. 82-1998), calls that view of the First Amendment ''misguided.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PERSONAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/05/garden/personal-health-208926.html,"ALTHOUGH many ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies are widely available, more than half the six million American women and girls who become pregnant each year do not want to have a child either at the time or at all. Most of the unintended pregnancies are a result of improper or inconsistent use of contraceptives or failure to use any birth-control measure. About half are terminated by abortion, a procedure decidedly safer for the pregnant woman than childbirth but often emotionally traumatic and certainly more problematic than the use of effective contraception. According to a report issued last week by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an organization devoted to birth- control policy and research, a major reason for ineffective use of contraceptives is fear of the health risks associated with modern methods. For example, periodic reports linking birth-control pills to such risks as heart attack, stroke, blood clots, infertility, liver and gallbladder disease and even cancer have prompted many women never to use them and others to stop. Reports associating intrauterine devices with pelvic infections and subsequent infertility have stifled growth in the use of those devices, even by women who are unlikely to experience the complications. And recent animal studies suggesting that vasectomy might increase a man's risk of heart disease have curbed enthusiasm for this popular method of contraception. The institute's report, ''Making Choices,'' was issued to help people evaluate the risks and benefits of contraceptive methods, compare them with the risks of not using contraception and, ultimately, to decide upon a safe and sensible contraceptive course for the three decades of life during which most women are fertile. As the report notes, the best contraceptive choice is likely to change several times during the course of a woman's fertile and sexually active years. What is best for you at 18 may be inappropriate at 28 and even dangerous at 38. Currently, 36 million American women face the problem of how to avoid getting pregnant unintentionally, and more than 90 percent of them are using some form of birth control. Among women, the pill is the most popular method, especially for those under 30. But sterilization is the nation's leading method - when figures for vasectomy and tubal sterilization are combined - and is especially popular among women over 30. The use of condoms, the method ranking third in preference, is almost double that of intrauterine devices, which barely surpass the diaphragm in popularity. Other techiques - spermicides, withdrawal and the so- called rhythm method - are considerably less popular, together accounting for fewer people than those who use no contraception. Many considerations other than safety must enter into a woman's choice of contraceptives, among them effectiveness, convenience and cost. For example, for the first year of use the pill and the diaphragm are the most expensive reversible methods, followed by the IUD. Sterilization operations, by far the most expensive, involve only one-time costs; they are five times more expensive for women than for men. A vasectomy is only slightly more expensive than an early abortion. A woman for whom both pregnancy and abortion are unacceptable options should probably consider only the most effective techniques: sterilization, the pill or the IUD, in descending order of effectiveness. If safety is the main concern a less effective but virtually harmless barrier method such as condoms or diaphragm, backed up by abortion when such methods fail, is less risky than, say, taking the pill or using an IUD. Barrier methods are most effective among older women, and all methods of contraception, including the pill, are used more effectively by women who definitely do not want to have more children. In evaluating the health risks of contraception it is important to put them in a context of countervailing benefits and alternatives. Three facts are clear: there is no such thing as risk-free contraception; in almost all cases every method of contraception is safer than getting pregnant and having a child; there is no one best method for everyone or even for most people. Here are some facts about risks and benefits to help guide your choice. The Pill For women under 25 who do not smoke the pill is the safest method of contraception, except for barrier methods backed up by abortion. For sexually active teen-agers the pill is the most effective and in most cases the safest method. The pill is most dangerous for women over 35 (90 percent of pill-related deaths occur in this age group) and for women of any age who smoke cigarettes. Yet surveys show that 40 percent of pill users are smokers. About 12 percent of pill users are still taking the more dangerous pills containing high doses of estrogen, although equally effective low-dose alternatives are readily available. Check the package insert or ask your physician or pharmacist, and if your brand contains more than 50 micrograms of estrogen, request your doctor to switch you to a low-dose pill. Because of pre-existing health problems, some women should never take birth-control pills. Among them are a history of phlebitis, stroke, heart disease, liver tumors, current liver disease or cancer of the breast or reproductive tract. To reduce risks to future fertility, the pill is best not taken by women who do not yet have an established menstrual pattern. The potential health benefits should also be considered. These include a reduced risk of developing such ailments as cancers of the ovary and uterus, benign breast disease, pelvic infections, iron-deficiency anemia, rheumatoid arthritis and a variety of menstrual disorders, among them painful periods and premenstrual tension syndrome. There is no demonstrated health benefit associated with periodically stopping use of the pill, nor should use be discontinued after five years unless other risk factors such as reaching age 35 make a cessation medically advisable. Intrauterine Devices Three types of IUD's are available: the Lippes loop, which acts as a mechanical barrier, and devices containing copper or releasing hormones, both of which include a chemical contraceptive. The main hazard is an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, which could lead to tubal damage and infertility; women who have more than one sexual partner are at greatest risk of these infections. Generally, young women who want to have children in the future are not the best candidates for IUD's unless they and their partners are monogamous. However, age itself does not affect risk. Should you become pregnant with an IUD in place, the safest course is to have the device removed as soon as possible. An ectopic pregnancy (occurring outside the uterus) should be suspected if an IUD user does not get her period and develops abdominal pain. Such pregnancies require prompt surgical treatment. IUD's are not suitable for women who have cancer or precancer of the uterus or cervix, pelvic infection, gonorrhea or abnormal uterine bleeding. Sterilization The complication rate associated with female sterilization is higher than that for any other contraceptive method, but the risks are limited to the time during and right after the procedure. The serious hazards are death from anesthesia, excessive bleeding necessitating a second operation and pelvic infection. Complications are least likely to occur after the modern techniques of minilaparotomy and laparoscopy, which are usually done under local anesthetic without overnight hospitalization. As for vasectomy, which is most often an office procedure, it is significantly safer than the sterilization of women. Despite a variety of frightening reports, there is no documented long- term health risk associated with the sterilization of either men or women. Several studies have not documented the reports of increased risk of heart disease after vasectomy. Barrier Methods Other than occasional irritation or allergic sensitivity, no health concerns are directly associated with the use of condoms, diaphragms and spermicides. The main problem is the high rate of unwanted pregnancy, which incurs its own risks far greater than birth control. If a woman relies on a barrier method throughout her reproductive span and uses it regularly and properly, she will face an average of two to three unwanted pregnancies. Still, if these pregnancies were terminated by early suction abortion, she would face the lowest health risk of any contraceptive user. The barrier methods appear to protect somewhat against a variety of sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea, vaginal infections such as trichomoniasis and candidiasis, and possibly also herpes. The risk of developing pelvic infections and cervical cancer may also be reduced.

"COOKE, 'GRAVELY ILL,' CONTINUES TO RECEIVE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/06/nyregion/cooke-gravely-ill-continues-to-receive-blood-transfusions.html,"Terence Cardinal Cooke is ''gravely ill,'' aides said yesterday, and is continuing to receive heavy doses of medication and blood transfusions at his residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. The 62-year-old Cardinal, the spiritual leader of 1.8 million Roman Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York, is suffering from acute leukemia. On Tuesday, his doctors said his condition had seriously worsened to the point where death appeared imminent. At a news conference yesterday, aides said the Cardinal's condition was unchanged. The Rev. Peter Finn, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the Cardinal was ''in some pain'' but ''clear and conscious.'' Father Finn said that Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, had informed the archdiocese that Pope John Paul II had offered a mass for the ailing Cardinal. Aware of Prayers Asked about the prognosis for the Cardinal, Father Finn said death could come ''within hours or days.'' He added that the Cardinal was aware of ''the prayers and concern for his welfare.'' He ''continues to accept his suffering with remarkable sense of purpose borne of his deep faith in the death and Resurrection of the Lord,'' Father Finn said. As news of the Cardinal's deteriorating condition spread through the city, thousands of worshipers filed into St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray for him. Many lighted candles and prayed silently, while others attended masses offered for the Cardinal throughout the day. ''I lit a candle and said a prayer that he doesn't suffer too much,'' said Ann Caveney of North Arlington, N.J. ''Today I made a special point to come for the Cardinal.'' Dahlia Varela of Palm Springs, Calif., recited the Lord's Prayer and a Hail Mary for the Cardinal. ''May he be without any pain,'' she said. Father Finn said Cardinal Cooke was getting considerable rest but continued to consult with Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, vicar general of the archdiocese, and other aides about archdiocesan affairs. The Cardinal was personally involved in the writing of several official statements issued under his name, according to the spokesman. These included a pastoral letter opposing abortion and euthanasia that is scheduled to be read Sunday at all masses in the archdiocese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TERENCE CARDINAL COOKE: A CALM VOICE IN AN AGE OF UPHEAVAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/obituaries/terence-cardinal-cooke-a-calm-voice-in-an-age-of-upheaval.html,"Cardinal Terence Cooke rose to a great height in the Roman Catholic Church without losing the simplicity and soul of a village priest. He was the seventh archbishop of New York, named to that high ecclesiastical post in 1968 by Pope Paul VI. A year later, he was summoned to Rome to receive the red hat of a cardinal at the unusually young age of 48. As the successor to Francis Cardinal Spellman, Cooke guided the archdiocese through upheavals touched off by shifting forces in both the church and the surrounding society. Unlike his more commanding predecessor, Cardinal Cooke exercised his authority with reserve and a distaste for public conflict. Though handpicked by Spellman to take over one of the world's most prominent Roman Catholic archdioceses, he took a far less combative stance than his mentor, shying from Spellman's bold exercise of personal and political power. By comparison, Cardinal Cooke was a mild-mannered, expertly managerial priest who worked largely through the machinery of the archdiocese to carry out church programs. ''He has shown great awareness of the complexities of the archdiocese,'' Monsignor James M. Connolly, head of the archdiocesan personnel board, said in a recent interview. ''He has been able to listen to all sides. He has had no fear of listening.'' On some subjects, most notably his steadfast opposition to abortion, Cooke was a national spokesman for the church. He also fought for improved welfare benefits in his role as leader of New York state's bishops. But on most matters he was a somewhat peripheral figure within the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. He was a genial pastor who exulted in mingling with his people. He golfed with President Nixon, presented debutantes and heard the tribulations of the dispossessed. Aides say his spirit of hope and joy, traits that resounded in his words and actions, remained with him through the last difficult days of his life after he learned of his terminal illness. During his leadership of 1.8 million Catholics, Cooke was hailed as a superb administrator but was sometimes criticized for failing to state a broad vision for the archdiocese. But he excelled at keeping the archdiocese's 900 separate corporate entities on solid footing through some difficult times. As he took the helm, the changes of the Second Vatican Council were shaking the church, the sexual revolution was challenging Catholic moral teaching and the city was about to plunge into a fiscal crisis. The Cardinal responded with a series of steps that shored up archdiocesan finances and broke new ground. Two of his initiatives became models for the church across the nation: an inner-city scholarship program to help poor minority students attend Catholic schools, and an interparish finance project to shore up poorer parishes. An uproar over the St. Patrick's Day parade this year placed the Cooke in the kind of highly visible, sensitive position that he liked to avoid. The crisis was precipitated by the parade committee's selection of a backer of the Irish Republican Army as grand marshal. The Cardinal's loyalties were torn between his aversion to the violent tactics of the IRA and his love of the parade's religious and folk tradition. Characteristically, he found a compromise, refusing to offer the customary archbishop's salute to the grand marshal from the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral but later emerging on the steps to observe the parade. Tireless Work With The Poor As a prelate whose heart was never far from his work with the needy, he campaigned tirelessly for charitable causes related to health care, social service and education. His travels to meetings and his pastoral visits took him constantly across the 4,717 square miles of the archdiocese, an area stretching from Staten Island, through Manhattan and the Bronx to seven upstate counties. A major shift in Catholic population took place during his reign. As the result of migration from the city of many middle-class Catholics, the majority of Cooke's constituents came to be located in the suburbs for the first time in the history of the archdiocese. Priests serving the 412 parishes under his care often praised him for permitting a diversity of approaches to pastoral work. ''He managed to provide a context within which a lot of viewpoints could be at home,'' said the Rev. Philip Murnion, the archdiocesan parish researcher. ''People could pursue a variety of interests.'' Many who encountered the Cardinal were surprised by his height, more than six feet, and the ease with which he could effortlessly move through crowds, bestowing greetings and blessings along the way. His aides were astounded by his memory for names and fragments of church business. He was in the tradition of the shepherd caring for his flock, and his personal gifts aided that mission. By temperment, he was gentle and warm, solicitous of others and not given to chiding or anger in the presence of those who disagreed with him.He had an understated quality of charm, abetted by his extraordinary ability to listen carefully to those to whom he turned for advice. ''My job, first and foremost, is to be a shepherd and servant of God's people,'' he once said. ''I have no other desire or purpose in life.'' In an age of ecumenism, the Cooke followed more closely the older tradition of the archbishop as caretaker of his own domain. Though open to some interfaith activities, he was primarily parochial and felt at home in his own archdiocese tending to its business. His participation on the national and international levels of the church were limited and generally had little impact. But he loved New York and spent his whole life in the service of the archdiocese. Marking the 175th anniversary of the founding of the archdiocesae in April, he bouyantly told a noontime congregation in the state's oldest parish, St. Peter's: It all began here, so far as the church of New York is concerned. Thank the Lord for all the blessings of these 175 years. On the day of his installation in April 1968, he spoke of moderation and the need for reconciliation. ''Let us improve the institutions and structures that have served us so well, making them glow with a rekindled spirit of love,'' he said. ''Let us avoid that iconoclasm which would tear down the past before moving ahead in the present to build a future.'' Turning to social stresses, he continued: ''In a spirit of love, we must approach the problems of poverty and racial tension. I pledge the spiritual and material resources of this archdiocese to uplift the poor, especially the disadvantataged in our ghettos.'' The problems he faced were monumental. Church finances were strained to the breaking point because of the mounting costs of running a huge system of schools, hospitals and welfare programs. New York City's fiscal collapse added to the crisis by slicing funds the city provided to help the church run these institutions. ''No archbishop ever had to face external problems as great as Cardinal Cooke did,'' said Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, who served as the archdiocesan spokesman for several years. ''He had to cope with 200 board meetings a year, inflation was the enemy and the church couldn't move fast enough to catch up. He had to face that kind of thing. He spent a vast amount of time finding ways to keep afloat.'' Those who looked to him for religious guidance found a leader of deep spirituality. Others who stood outside religion often said they saw him as a living exemplar of the beliefs he preached. He was elevated to the seat of the archdiocese, at a portentous time for the Roman Catholic church in the United States. The Second Vatican Council had completed its vast changes in church doctrine and practice in 1965. The difficult task of putting those changes into effect was at hand. As Cooke took over, the process of transition was already generating tension and confusion. At the same time, racial unrest and opposition to the Vietnam War were creating havoc on a national scale. That message was brought home in dramatic fashion. On April 4, 1968, the day of Cooke's installation as archbishop, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain in Memphis, touching off another wave of racial clashes. The church became the setting for clashes between liberals and conservatives over both sets of issues. Some priests and parishioners believed a strongly prophetic voice was needed at the helm of the archdiocese to push it in sharply new directions. They were skeptical that Cooke could fill that role. But others were impressed by his conciliatory manner, which aimed at consensus and avoided collisions. As he became engrossed in the myriad duties of running the archdiocese, he won solid backing. He grew in stature as a manager and a superior with a calming influence who listened to everyone carefully. Although he rarely satisfied liberal demands for him to speak out in favor of social causes such as disarmament, Cooke gave others broad leeway to do so. On the other hand, while some conservatives urged him to crack down harder on experiments with the liturgy, he left much of the decision on such matters to the local parishes, where conservatives could play a strong role. Whether addressing cultural, political or church issues, Cooke was more an expediter of established church teaching than an innovator testing the boundaries of a dogma or a rule. His inclination was to hold his own view in abeyance until an idea had won the approval of the highest authorities at the Vatican.When Rome had denounced racism, for example, he felt free to call it a ''sickness'' and urge for an end to discrimination. By contrast, he was hesistant to condemn nuclear weapons wholeheartedly, as some of his fellow bishops had, largely because the pope had not gone that far himself. A related factor was that Cooke, as military vicar, cared greatly for the welfare of Catholics in the armed forces. Some priests remained unhappy with Cooke's conservatism.Last year a group of priests and nuns publicly criticized Cooke for stating that atomic weapons were ''tolerable'' for the purpose of deterrence and arguing that a limited nuclear war could be fought. The Cardinal had made the statement in a letter to Catholic military chaplains. In their protest, the priests and nuns disassociated themselves from that view in favor of a more total renunciation of nuclear arms. In the face of many obstacles, Cooke helped reshape the archdiocese according to the dictates of Vatican II and the pressures under which the modern church must exist. At the time of his installation, parishes were still well attended and there were ample numbers of priests and nuns to serve them. In many ways, the church seemed to be at the height of its strength. Much of the stability was illusory, however. Powerful forces that no archbishop could control were racking the church. Priests and nuns, unhappy with mandatory celibacy or the church's stands on various social issues, would resign in astonishing numbers. Some lay people would balk at certain of the changes ordered by Vatican II. Others would drop out in protest of the encyclical forbidding artificial birth control. Furthermore, the financial underpinnings of the archdiocese had become shaky, requiring fast and effective remedies. That was the situation faced by Cooke after his formal investiture at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Cooke had been known as a longtime chancery official but his appointment to the top post stunned many church officials. Most had expected the choice to be Archbishop John J. Maguire or someone from the outside the archdiocese. But from a practical standpoint the selection made eminent sense. During the previous decade, Cooke had been moved rapidly up the promotional ladder of the archdiocese by Spellman. He began in 1957 as Spellman's personal secretary and quickly passed through a succession of chancery assignments culminating in his ordination as an auxiliary bishop with the title vicar general. Cardinal Spellmen had taken interest in him both personally. For many years, the younger man lived in the Cardinal's residence and the two dined and traveled together. Cardinal Spellman had pressed Pope Paul VI to name the Auxiliary Bishop as his successor. When the Pope followed this suggestion and made the appointment-three months after the Cardinals death in December 1967 - the new Archbishop was quick to express his indebtedness to his mentor 'Awesome Responsibility' ''Here I am with this sudden, awesome responsibility,'' he said shortly after his appointment, ''only too aware of my weaknesses, struggling with my faults. Referring to Spellman, he said: ''I'll need his vision and his judgment.'' He recalled a particular piece of advice from his mentor. ''You can't say yes to everything,'' Spellman had said. ''When you do say yes, say it quickly. But always take a half hour to say no, so you can understand the other fellow's side too.'' In his conversations, Cooke often remembered that counsel along with a maxim he had received from the other leading influence in forming his outlook, his father. Michael Cooke, a devoutly spiritual man, once told his son, ''Whatever you do, do it with all your heart.'' A Journey From Obscurity His own lif in the church was a journey from obscurity to one of the church's most visible and powerful seats. He was born on March 1, 1921, the son of Irish immigrants, Michael and Margaret Gannon Cooke. His father was a chauffeur who for a time whisked the actor John Barrymore about town and later worked in construction. Mr. and Mrs. Cooke lived in a tenement on the Upper West Side. Shortly after Terence was baptized, the family moved to the Bronx and later to West Nyack. His elementary schooling took place under the Benedictine order. His mother died when he was 9, leaving his father with Terence, an older brother, Joseph, and a younger sister, Katherine. Soon an aunt, Mary Gannon, moved into the Cooke home to assist with the child-rearing. Though the family's resources were meager, the elder Cooke managed to eke out funds for violin lessons for his musically attuned son, initiating him into a lifelong love. During his years at Cathedral High School, he decided to enter the priesthood. He went on to Cathedral College and St. Joseph's Seminary, later becoming the first graduate of the seminary to become archbishop. Cardinal Spellman ordained him a priest on Dec. 1, 1945, and he took his first assignment as an assistant at St. Athanasius parish in the South Bronx. His two-year stay there provided him with his only experience as a full-time parish priest. In 1947, he entered Catholic Univeristy in Washington to earn a Master of Social Work degree and did further graduate work at the University of Chicago. He returned to New York in 1949, and for the next five years served as a youth worker for Catholic Charities. At the same time, he taught at the Fordham School of Social Work and assisted at St. Jude Church in Manhattan. While at Catholic charities, he showed a skill at fund-raising that caught the attention of Spellman. The result was his assignment to St. Joseph's Seminary as bursar from 1954 to 1956. Thereafter, beginning with his appointment as Spellman's secretary, his star ascended swiftly. He became vice chancellor and chancellor, then auxiliary bishop and vicar general. All the while, he gained vast expertise in the workings of the archdiocese. From 1958, he supervised all constructon in the archdiocese and as vicar general he personally supervised 175 parishes in Manhattan and the Bronx. He built a reputation for efficiency, extreme dedication and a genuine sense of likeableness. Those who worked with him say that by nature he did not seek power or privilege, and would have been content as a parish priest. The Cardinal's era saw a striking shift in the administration of the church. Before Vatican II, church structures were notably hierarhical in both organization and day-to-day governance. The Council, however, rewrote the underlying principles. From that point on, the church was to be run on a conciliar basis. The whole ''people of God,'' as the church was defined by Vatican II, was to share in the authority. Bishops were to consult with their flocks, consider their views and grant them influence on decisions. This was a style of church leadership that came much easier to Cooke than to his predecessor. Although he shared much of Spellman's theological traditionalism, Cooke was far more relaxed about opening the decision-making process and decentralizing power in the archdiocese. He had been trained as a social worker to engage in group decisions, and that background availed him well in the formidable effort to recast the archdiocese along somewhat more democratic lines. Soon after he took over, a group of priests challenged him to institute several changes, including the establishment of a diocesan council and the issuing of yearly financial disclosures by the archdiocese. These and many other requests were met as Cooke, showed his willingness to comply fully with the spirit and the law of Vatican II. Cooke reshaped much of the archdiocesan operation in accordance with the Council's intent. Terms were set for pastors of parishes, a personnel board was founded to help deploy the clergy and diocesan-wide studies made recommendations on schools and parish financing. Out of these studies came two markedly different programs. One was an interparish financing arrangement whereby affluent parishes shared resources with struggling ones. The other was a major scholarship program that helped increase enrollment of minority children in Catholic schools. Diocesan officials proudly point to the fact that during Cooke's tenure none of the seven Catholic schools in Harlem were closed. At the height of the protests against the Vietnam War, the difference between Cooke and his predecessor was vividly illustrated. Spellman had called for the a ''victory'' by United States military forces. Cooke, pressed for a response, called in 1972 for a speedy end to the war while praising American motives. At a St. Patrick's ordination service for Jesuits in 1971, two candidates demanded that Cooke speak out against the war and resign as military vicar. They refused to come forward to signify their obedience to the archbishop. After one protester grabbed the microphone to voice these demands, a Jesuit superior moved to banish the disruptors from the church. But the Cooke interceded. Moving to the microphone, he explained that he worked for peace every day in quite different ways from those of the dissenters, including his duties as Military Vicar. He invited both men to come forward. One did, but the other still refused. To the holdout, Cooke said quietly, ''Peace to you, especially, my friend.'' Since the Cardinal's installation, the numbers of Catholics in the archdiocese declined from 2 million to 1.8 million, largely because of the migration of many Catholics to New Jersey and Long Island. But as the number of Irish and Italian Catholics fell, the number of Hispanic Catholics rose. At least a third of the Catholics in the archdiocese are now Hispanic, and their need for pastoral care was very much in the forefront of the Cardinal's thinking Cardinal Spellman had begun a program to train priests in Spanish to meet these needs. Cardinal Cooke took over the project and expanded it. In June, after the Supreme Court struck down local legislative restrictions on abortion, Cooke decried the decision. ''When our most basic institutions condone such violent disregard for life and for family rights, ''the value and nobility of every human life and every human family are dealt a lethal blow,'' he said. By custom, the archbishop of New York is titular head of New York state's bishops and, by canon law, he is military vicar. The Cardinal took a somewhat guarded stand of opposition to the bishops' pastoral letter on nuclear weapons, which took three drafts and nearly three years to complete. Personally aligned with a more conservative stance on defense, he found some provisions of the letter's strong rejection of nuclear war to his dislike. Although he accepted the general outlines of the completed letter, he also moved quickly to assure his military constituents that the bishops explicitly appreciated their service in the nation's defense. ''Your profession is peace,'' he wrote to them in May. ''Your ministry is peace. As you respond to the challenge of peace, you do so with the appreciation, understanding, support and prayers of your church.'' Despite the many problems facing the church, the Cardinal never showed signs that his boundless hopes for a better future had faltered, He remained enthusiastic about the church and spoke confidently about its ability to renew itself to meet the challenges of the times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Youngest Cardinal,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/opinion/the-youngest-cardinal.html,"When Archbishop Terence Cooke became Cardinal Cooke in 1969 he was only 48 years old, the youngest cardinal in the world. That seemed to augur long service, but his death at 62 concludes the shortest term of any cardinal ever to head the Archdiocese of New York. For most of those years he lived, nobly, with the pain of cancer. Nonetheless, he realized his early promise. Succeeding Francis Cardinal Spellman, a potent political figure, Cardinal Cooke devoted himself to managing his sprawling realm in a time of contention over the faith. He preferred administrative ventures to the philosophical. He was a harmonizer rather than a cutting political or social personage. Cardinal Cooke demonstrated his masterly tact in meeting the symbolic challenge posed by this year's St. Patrick's Day parade. He was confronted by a parade marshal, Michael Flannery, who pro- claimed the march to be a show of support for the Irish Republican Army. The Cardinal, the son of Irish immigrants, declined to greet Mr. Flannery in public but conferred privately, acknowledging Irish Catholic grievances but never condoning the I.R.A.'s violence. Cardinal Cooke used the influence of the world's wealthiest archdiocese to advance the church's opposition to abortion. He spoke also for a wider constituency, as when he focused his diocese's resources on poorer parishes and urged more American aid to poorer nations. He applied the physical suffering of his last days to the church's stand against mercy killing. Only last week, in a letter to his flock, he spoke out against euthanasia. Life is still beautiful, he insisted, and no less so because pain sometimes attends it. Beautiful, and in his case, brave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CARDINAL COOKE DIES AT 62 AFTER FIGHT WITH LEUKEMIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/obituaries/cardinal-cooke-dies-at-62-after-fight-with-leukemia.html,"Terence Cardinal Cooke, the spiritual head of the Archdiocese of New York and the Military Vicar of the United States, died at 4:45 A.M. yesterday at his residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. Death came to the 62-year-old Cardinal 41 days after the archdiocese told the public, in a statement dictated by the Cardinal, that he was critically ill with leukemia. Three days ago, it was announced that he was ''on the point of death.'' The Rev. Peter Finn, a spokesman for the archdiocese, formally announced at 11:30 A.M., ''Terence Cardinal Cooke, 10th Bishop, 7th Archbishop, 5th Cardinal of the See of New York and Vicar to military service, Veterans Administration hospitals and Government service overseas, completed his work on earth and was called home by Almighty God to heaven this morning at 4:45 A.M.'' A Stream of Worshipers At St. Patrick's, the mood was solemn and hushed as a steady stream of saddened worshipers filed into the cathedral after hearing of the Cardinal's death. They prayed, lighted candles and expressed their feelings of loss. Many extolled him as a warm-hearted man whose compassion had touched the city. As a board of church leaders were choosing Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe as interim administrator for the archdiocese, tributes from religious and political leaders poured into the Roman Catholic chancery office. (Page B7.) President Reagan, who visted the Cardinal Sept. 25, said, ''All of America is saddened by the loss of Cardinal Cooke, a saintly man and a great spiritual leader.'' At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II told the 220 prelates attending a Synod of Bishops session of the Cardinal's death. ''I thank God for his dedicated minis Cardinal Cooke's 15 years as Archbishop were shaped by upheavals in both church and society. Page B6. try and pray that the example of his devotion to the church may inspire the faithful for years to come,'' the Pope said. Mayor Koch ordered the city's flags lowered to half-staff, and Governor Cuomo broadened the order to include the entire state. Firefighters rang the special 5-5-5-5 alarm on historic fire engine bells to note the Cardinal's death. Normally the alarm, rung on bells in all city firehouses, is reserved for the death of a firefighter in the line of duty. Fire Commissioner Joseph E. Spinnato called the Cardinal ''a good friend of the department.'' The bells sounded for the last time yesterday as the department phased out the old system for summoning firefighters. When he died, the Cardinal was attended by his physician, Dr. Kevin Cahill, and two nurses. Msgr. Joseph Murphy, the archdiocesan Chancellor, was kneeling in prayer at his bedside. Church officials said the body of the Cardinal would lie in state at St. Patrick's Cathedral through the weekend, beginning tonight at 6 o'clock. The funeral was scheduled for Monday at 2 P.M. The Columbus Day parade, which would have coincided with the funeral, was canceled. In accordance with church procedure, the archdiocesan Board of Consultors, the Archbishop's highest advisory group, met after the Cardinal's death and chose Bishop O'Keefe, the archdiocesan vicar general, to administer church affairs until Pope John Paul II appoints a successor. Cardinal's Chief Aide Bishop O'Keefe, a former archdiocesan school superintendent, was the Cardinal's principal aide during the final weeks of the his life. The choice of the interim administrator is not regarded as an indication of the Pope's selection of a successor. Under church canon law, Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, will confer with prelates in the New York region and bishops from other parts of the nation to elicit names of suggested candidates. The delegate will then forward a list of recommendations to the Pope. The Pontiff is not required to choose a name from the list. Bishop Cooke became Archbishop in 1968 and Cardinal in 1969. The 175-year-old archdiocese, one of the most prominent in the world, stretches from Staten Island to Rockland and Dutchess Counties. With 1.8 million Catholics, it is the nation's fourth-largest. A Gentle, Cheerful Man The Cardinal, a gentle, cheerful man, was known as a superb administrator who kept the archdiocese in sound condition despite economic and religious challenges. In his years as Archbishop, he won great respect from Catholics and befriended a wide variety of non-Catholics. His death opened up the second major vacancy in a month within the American church. In September, Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston died, leaving the nation's third-largest archdiocese without a head. Within two years, two of the other seven archdioceses in which a Cardinal normally presides will become open. Timothy Cardinal Manning of Los Angeles and John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia are both due to step down at the mandatory retirement age of 75. The openings occur at a time when the future direction of the church in the United States appears to be a growing concern of Pope John Paul II. Church leaders have become increasingly aware that the Pope views the nation's Catholics somewhat warily. On several issues regarding sexual morality and church discipline, the Pope has repeatedly urged the Americans to strictly heed church law. The urgency of the appeals has convinced many church leaders that the Pope believes that too many American Catholics disobey these standards. In making key appointments, church officials say, the Pope may indicate the kind of leadership he wants. The New York appointment is especially important because of the significance of the archdiocese and the added responsibility of the archbishop as military vicar. The Ponfiff was lavish in his praise of Cardinal Cooke when illness confined the Cardinal to his residence. In response, Cardinal Cooke sent messages to the Pope, including the text of a pastoral letter, scheduled to be read in all parishes on Sunday, in which he continued his role as leader of the church's opposition to abortion. ''It is tragic,'' he wrote, ''that in our time, concepts which are disasterous to the well-being of God's human family - abortion, euthanasia and infanticide - are falsely presented as useful and even respectable solutions to human, family and social problems. ''From the depths of my being, I urge you to reject this antilife, antichild, antihuman view of life and to oppose with all your strength the deadly technologies of life destruction which daily result in the planned death of the innocent and the helpless.'' After the Cardinal was diagnosed as terminally ill in August, he stressed the meaning of life even when burdened by suffering. 'God's Special Gift' ''The 'gift of life,' God's special gift, is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by illness or weakness, hunger or poverty, mental of physical handicaps, loneliness or old age,'' the Cardinal wrote in his pastoral letter. Cardinal Cooke gave strong allegiance to popes and took an orthodox stance toward church moral and theological teachings. At the same time, his concern for the poor, sharpened by his training as a social worker, inclined him toward advocating projects to help the disadvantaged. He was thoroughly a New Yorker, an unabashed booster of the city who never lost the traces of Irish speech mannerisms or his socially gregarious urban ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CARDINAL COOKE REMEMBERED FOR KINDNESS IN LIFE AND COURAGE UNTIL DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/08/nyregion/cardinal-cooke-remembered-for-kindness-in-life-and-courage-until-death.html,"News Analysis The final weeks in the life of Terence Cardinal Cooke marked a departure in his service as Archbishop of New York. Through comments and messages, the Cardinal showed a personal side that had rarely been seen. He did so, associates said, to highlight certain issues and to offer himself as an example of faith. On Aug. 25, the Cardinal, in a statement he dictated to aides, informed the public that he was terminally ill with leukemia. The sudden announcement said the prognosis was that he would live a matter of weeks or months. Until then, aides had regularly asserted that the Cardinal's health was good. After the news of the illness, aides supplied more details of various ailments that had afflicted him for many years. They emphasized that the relative silence about the subject had been due to the Cardinal's desire to deflect attention from himself. A Self-Effacing Leader Cardinal Cooke was that kind of leader. Those who knew him for many years said he naturally avoided becoming the subject of concern, preferring to steer interest to his various concerns for the church and society. His long career in the church had made him an extraordinary public figure, but he was inclined to be self-effacing. After the Cardinal told the church he had only a short time to live, his approach changed somewhat in the view of many associates. He appeared to many Catholics to be acting somewhat out of character, allowing his critical condition to become an opportunity to give witness to such matters as the meaning of suffering, his deep opposition to abortion and his hopes for an end to the turmoil in Northern Ireland. Circumstances of the Cardinal's treatment became a significant factor in the ordeal. He made it known that he would refuse chemotherapy in order to live out his days as alertly as possible. That decision spoke as poignantly to many Catholics as did his attempts to provide moral instruction. The Cardinal's residence, which he chose over a hospital room, became the center of a vigorous endeavor to tie interest in his grave condition to the causes he most ardently espoused. 'Grace-Filled Moment' Many Catholics were especially struck by his references to his suffering. In several statements related by aides, he spoke of ''this grace-filled moment in my life.'' Many of his personal messages on the subject to friends and colleagues were made public. As church officials noted, the move disclosed the private character of the Cardinal to a striking degree. One illustration of his willingness to explain his feelings was a Sept. 6 letter to William Cardinal Baum, the highest ranking American prelate at the Vatican. ''My illness is an opportunity of grace as the Lord makes it possible for me to partake of his Passion and Death,'' Cardinal Cooke wrote. ''He continues to hold out to me at every moment the sure hope of Resurrection as daily He draws me close to His altar of sacrifice.'' In other remarks relayed by aides, the Cardinal stressed that he was offering his suffering for the church and, as he explained on one occasion, for all his ''brothers and sisters who have shared so much with me in faith and love and who are united with me in this moment of my life.'' Near Jesus Through Suffering The Rev. Peter Finn, at a press conference last week, noted that these references to suffering could strike non-Catholics and non-Christians as ''staged.'' Father Finn said the truth was that the Cardinal was sincerely endeavoring to underscore the church's traditional teaching that Jesus' followers can be united to him through suffering. Church officials followed similar reasoning in terms of the Cardinal's description of his suffering as a ''sublime privilege.'' They said the words were intended to reflect the Cardinal's acceptance of suffering and did not connote an eagerness to embrace it. A message from Pope John Paul II underscored a similar understanding of the spiritual blessings that the church teaches can emerge in suffering. The Pope wrote: ''I have spoken and written to him to thank him for what he has been in the Church of God - a living sign of Jesus Christ, a faithful pastor and servant of his people, living and willing to die for the church.'' Many tributes from religious and government leaders focused on the Cardinal as an example of courage and a model of faith enduring hardship. Abortion and Euthanasia The Cardinal addressed other matters with a similar candor. The most forceful appeals came in relation to his long fight against abortion and euthanasia. At every step, aides said, he was intensely aware of the widespread concern for his welfare and the opportunity that concern afforded him to testify to his moral and spiritual principles. His final pastoral letter on the ''Gift of Life'' is scheduled to be read tomorrow in all parishes of the archdiocese. It was read over Vatican Radio last Sunday. As officials prepared for the Cardinal's funeral on Monday, they pointed to the letter as the Cardinal's essential message in his final travail. The letter argues for an end to abortion, euthanasia and infanticide. ''It is at times when life is threatened,'' the Cardinal said in the letter, ''such as times of serious illness - that the Lord gives us a special grace to appreciate the 'gift of life' as an irreplaceable blessing.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR OUR YOUNG,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/nyregion/we-dont-know-how-to-care-for-our-young.html,"IN PHILADELPHIA, homicide is  the leading cause of death among children and youths. In New Jersey, three pre-teen girls beat and rob a crippled old woman. Across the nation, children are addicted to alcohol and drugs. Teen-age boys rape, rob and mug; teen-age girls, unprotected from rape and incest, and unprepared physically and emotionally, bear babies. Child pornography is big business. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among teen-agers. The message in all of this is: We don't know how to care for our young. There almost seems to be an inverse ratio between our success with technology and our failure with our offspring. We do not cherish and shield and educate them. Yet, we - with the astonishing brain that invented this technology - never would have evolved if our smaller-brained hominid ancestors had not cared for their babies so well that the bigger-brained ones could survive. The whole direction of human evolution has been toward bigger and better brains, which call for longer and better care. Our species arrived with the largest brain on the planet proportionate to body size, a brain so convoluted that we can use it far beyond the capacity of our fellow creatures to contemplate past, future and infinity, to create beauty and wreak horror and to behave nobly and despicably. Sometimes, we use it to glimpse dimensions of the mysterious universe that lies beyond time and space and the reach of Earth's other children. We have crossed a threshold, but we have not severed ourselves from the millions of years of evolution that carried us to it. We evolved, for all but the last eye-blink of our history, in gathering-hunting societies. Within that matrix, the hominid brain grew from the size of a chimpanzee's four million years ago to more than double that two million years ago, to more than three times that in Neanderthal man 200,000 years ago and to ourselves 50,000 years ago. As the brain enlarged, our babies needed more care, and for millions of years our hominid and australopithecine ancestors took good care of their young. A large-brained creature must be nurtured. The larger the brain, the more intensive and extensive must be the nurture. It's simple logistics: The birth canal can dilate only so far when the head is expelled; the bony ring in the pelvis cannot dilate at all. Since the skull cannot house at birth a brain that will quadruple in size, growth and development take place after birth. Each enlargement of the brain means that a more-dependent infant emerges from the womb. Other primate infants, notably those of our closest cousins - the chimpanzees and gorillas - do not develop normally in isolation; they must have mothering and interaction with the band. Obviously, babies and children in the line that led to us received increasing amounts of care over the eons. Almost as obviously, that care was administered lovingly (or where did the instinctive loving reaction that babies evoke in normal adults come from?). Evidence from all directions confirms that love is a must. As the neurologist James W. Prescott wrote: ''Studies suggest that, during formative periods of brain growth, certain kinds of sensory deprivation - such as lack of touching and rocking by the mother - result in incomplete or damaged development of the neuronal systems that control affection . . . The deprived infant may have difficulty controlling violent impulses as an adult.'' The agricultural revolution, which began about 10,000 years ago and is still going on, skewed our evolutionary course in ways that have yet to be assessed. The changes have gone too rapidly, accelerated too much, for us to adapt. We are the product not of a few millenniums of agriculture and technology, but of several million years of gathering and hunting. We are the product of life lived in small, cohesive bands where everyone knew everyone and everyone was important. Each member had to rely on all for survival, especially in the harsh, unpredictable environment of successive ice ages. Somewhere along the way, when speech brought the beginning of culture, each band would have cemented its closeness with communal agreement on right and wrong and intensified its spiritual life through communal music, dancing, art and religion. Such communities, tightly knit and cooperative, would have been far more conducive to the flowering of love, trust and commitment than our own mobile, noisy, overcrowded agglomeration of anonymous masses. Such communities would have cared for their offspring more carefully and consistently than we are able to. Above all, such communities, living off the land, would have had to limit the number of babies to what the land could support, just as the few remaining foraging-hunting groups do today. The incalculably important consequence was that each infant could command his mother's almost undivided attention for three to four years. This way of living does not encourage aggression. True, hominids learned to use weapons. They hunted game with them; perhaps, occasionally, they attacked other tribes. But to project onto them our own pathological aggression is wholly unjustified by our accumulating discoveries about our ancestors. We are today the only species that kills not only other species, but also its own for the sheer delight of killing. But this is not innate. The trait began, like the birth explosion and the degradation of women, with agriculture. The essential fact about us is that we are social and cultural organisms. We learn to love - or not to love, or to hate - with society. Children cannot learn to love unless they are taught. And are they today? If not, are we losing that capacity? Erich Fromm, for one, thought so. ''Real love,'' he wrote, ''is so rare today as to be outside the vision of most people.'' Every student of human development has concluded that babies cannot function or grow without love. For example, the psychologist Selma Fraiberg warns that a baby without human partners is a baby in deadly peril, ''robbed of his humanity,'' and the biologist George Wald fears that ''we are no longer taking good care of our young,'' that ''we have introduced them into a world that offers them little that they want and threatens their very existence.'' In this context, it is criminally irresponsible to insist that every fetus must be born, but to keep a stony indifference to its fate thereafter. Unless the future person that the fetus is to become is sacred, why is the fetus sacred? And if the developing human is sacred, then caring for it is a sacred responsibility. Those pro-lifers who would deny abortion to all American women because the millions of Americans who will die in the next war must be replaced are singularly ill-attuned to the real needs of real babies. Must we return to hunting and gathering? Of course not. Technology is here to stay. But if it is our master, not our servant, and if it has trapped us in a culture antagonistic to health and life and love, we would do well to understand what is happening and figure out what to do about it. We would do well to acknowledge the limits of technology. It has not brought forth a machine that bathes a baby in constant, joyous, stimulating, ego-strengthening affection. It has not produced one that copes with the twisted results of poor nurturing or none, or one that deals with the havoc that we wreak on ourselves and society. For 50,000 years, we have existed as homo sapiens, ''man who knows, man who is wise.'' What is the Latin for ''man who neglects his babies''?

"IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES;
PHOTOGRAPHY",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/arts/in-the-arts-critics-choices-photography.html,"''The Way We Live Now: Beyond Social Documentary'' at P.S. 1, curated by the critic Abigail Solomon-Godeau, is a group show in which 10 photographers use words and pictures to deal with issues, from nuclear power to abortion, from the point of view of the radical left. The most effective presentation is Lisa Lewenz's 1884 calendar entitled ''A View From Three Mile Island,'' which is illustrated with photographs of tacky but lovable American bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens. Each of these rooms has a door or window through which the cooling towers of a nearby nuclear power plant are visible. Also effective is Karen Knorr's ''Gentlemen,'' interiors with figures from elegant men's clubs, with slightly sardonic captions, and a sequence entitled ''Standing Up,'' by Carole Conde and Karl Beveridge, which uses collage to dramatize the difficulties of working women caught between the demands of factory and home. Also worth seeing at P.S. 1 is John Margolies's documentation of one of the most fantastic creations of American popular architecture, the miniature golf course filled with large, brightly painted concrete dinosaurs, sphinxes, Buddhas, Easter Island totems, fairy tale castles and gigantic pink flamingos. Margolies's photographs are documents as straightforward and unpretentious as a tourist's snapshot, but the subject matter is so bizarre that the photographs seem surreal. P.S. 1, located at 46-01 21st Street, Long Island City, is open Thursday to Sunday, 12 to 6 P.M., and both exhibitions run through Nov. 20.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPAIN'S ABORTION LAW FACES COURT CHALLENGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/world/spain-s-abortion-law-faces-court-challenge.html,"Parliament's vote this week to liberalize an antiabortion law has been greeted, as expected, with opposition by the Roman Catholic Church. The left has criticized the law for not going far enough. The old law, which dates from the Franco era, was regarded as one of the harshest in Europe because of the long prison terms involved. The new law, approved Thursday, allows abortions in cases of rape, malformation of the fetus or danger to the life of the mother. The Popular Alliance Party said it would challenge the law before the constitutional court on the ground that it denies the unborn child the right to life. The staunchly conservative daily El Alcazar printed the headline, ''Parliament Votes Against the Law of God.'' The Catholic Church had been campaigning against the bill since the Socialists first presented it in May. Posters on walls and storefronts here show hands folded in prayer over the words ''Mama, Don't Murder Me.'' Pope John Paul II, in a homily delivered at an outdoor mass during his visit last year, criticized abortion, as did Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who addressed a rally here in May. More recently the Catholic Church and the Socialist Government confronted each other over a Government ban on a parochial school textbook that lists abortion among violent acts together with terrorism and war. In a compromise, the Government agreed that it would not enforce the ban and the bishops pledged to advise teachers to use the text with discretion. They also agreed to revise another text, written but not yet printed, that condemns abortion in even harsher terms, listing it with with annihilation by nuclear bombs, concentration camps and systematic torture. The book now being used is new this school year and appeared just before the legislation was enacted. The Government has also proposed a new education law for public and private schools aimed at standardizing the state's control over those schools it subsidizes. Catholic schools receive substantial Government subsidies. The compromise was worked out after a barrage of attacks on the Government by bishops and members of the Popular Alliance Party. Bishop Jose Guerra Campos of Cuenca compared the Government ban to left-wing persecution of the church in the civil war of 1936-39. ''This is the most serious attack against the church committed so far this century,'' he said in an interview in El Alcazar. The conflict, called ''the war of the catechism'' by the press, gave the conservative opposition an issue to mobilize around. In a statement, it said: ''The great Catholic majority of Spain can see the incapacity of Spanish Socialism to overcome its old prejudices and the frailty of its promise to respect the right of parents to educate their children in traditional Christian morality.'' Both the bishops and the Popular Alliance appeared to be reaching back into the still-sensitive history of the civil war to sharpen their attack and give it an emotional tone. It is not known how the new abortion law, which could be held up until spring for constitutional review, will affect trials continuing under the old law. In Valencia a doctor is on trial for performing three abortions. His defense has been to present a list of 2,700 women who avow that they had abortions and demand equal treatment under the law. Their aim is to force the Government to try all of them or to release the doctor. Feminist groups, which say 300,000 women have illegal abortions every year, have held demonstrations outside Parliament for three days running to criticize the mildness of the new law. They want free abortion on demand. The Communist Party, also critical, abstained in Thursday's vote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SKILLFULLY MANGAING A HARD TRANSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/weekinreview/skillfully-mangaing-a-hard-transition.html,"Terence Cardinal Cooke, the Archbishop of New York who died of leukemia Thursday, was one of a handful of leading prelates caught in a vast sea change within the Roman Catholic Church. He was among those who were trained for service in a church that in many respects no longer existed when they rose to the hierarchy. To the end of his life, Cardinal Cooke seemed to belong to both the new order and the old. The Second Vatican Council, from 1962 to 1965, questioned the practices and beliefs of an ecclesiastical order largely shaped by the militant reactions of the Counter-Reformation. To the shock of many older Catholics, the Council declared that the church was no longer to be defined as ''the hierarchy,'' but as the ''people of God.'' Acting on that principle, the church fathers replaced the older model of monarchical rule by bishops with a system of authority that stressed collegiality and consultation. The implications were enormous for an archdiocese with the size, wealth and prominence of New York. Francis Cardinal Spellman, who presided during the Council, struggled for three years before his death to apply himself to the top- to-bottom reforms. But his style, marked by boldness and a heavy-handed exercise of power, rendered him ill-suited for the new agenda. His ways exemplified the past. And so it fell to his successor, then Auxiliary Bishop Terence Cooke, to broadly implement the Council's guidelines. In 1968, Terence James Cooke replaced Cardinal Spellman under circumstances that generally boded well for the church. The uplifting mood of the Council still lingered, the archdiocesan structures were strong and the ethnic church of old had planted deep roots in American soil. Large numbers of Catholics who had been shunted aside as a suspect minority were being integrated into the mainstream of the nation's financial and social life. Cardinal Cooke was tempermentally fit in many ways for the unfolding of a modernized church. In contrast to his predecessor, he was mild-mannered, comfortable about seeking the advice of clergy and laity and kept a relatively low profile. He projected warmth and care for the poor, befriended the powerful and maintained an image of a priest without guile. At the same time, he was a stickler for detail and expert at administration. Under Cardinal Cooke, the schools of the archdiocese were put on sound financial footing and a program for aiding poorer parishes was set in place. A personnel board was established to smooth the placement of priests and a clergy senate was formed to provide the Cardinal with regular briefings on the concerns of those closest to the parishes. The orderly transition to Vatican Council reforms was overseen by an Archbishop who felt most comfortable with household matters. Catholics often sensed that he lacked enthusiasm for many of the changes, such as those regarding some of the sacraments, but he supervised them without complaint. He followed the letter of the law even though many believed his heart was not always in it. Many of the Cardinal's actions showed a preference for the past. Decades ago, bishops were chiefly lords of their own domains, given great prerogatives by canon law and protected from most forms of outside interference. The Council shifted thinking in this area by underscoring the importance of regional conferences and interdiocesan cooperation. Cardinal Cooke took part in the sessions of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, but he remained a marginal figure in forging policies. He rarely spoke on an issue that fell outside his immediate field of responsibility. His long fight against abortion was his most sustained and vocal contribution. Moral issues that involved challenges to American military and social policy often left the Cardinal in a troubled position. He retained much of the reflexive patriotism that characterized earlier generations of immigrants. His role as military vicar reinforced this penchant. He went along with the bishops' recent pastoral letter condemning nuclear arms, but somewhat reluctantly, combining his endorsement with assurances to his two million Catholic military flock that their efforts were appreciated. Likewise, he could campaign hard for positions such as aid to Catholic schools or abortion, but backed away from taking strong stands on issues defined less explicitly by church thinking. Counseling Presidents The lofty reputation of the archdiocese kept it visible. When Presidents of the United States wanted to touch base with American Catholicism, they more often turned to the Archbishop of New York than to the president of the Bishops' Conference. But many church officials saw the archdiocese losing its past glory and attributed that decline in some degree to the cardinal's failure to provide strong national leadership on many crucial issues. Within the diocese, the criticism was heard that the Cardinal had also done little to articulate the church's mission and purpose in New York. On one hand, critics acknowledged, the Cardinal allowed priests and lay people great latitude to write their own scripts. But on the other hand, they viewed the lack of a strong central influence as a factor in causing malaise and confusion. As the archdiocese looks ahead to a successor, many Catholics voice awe at the magnitude of the job. The easy assurance of a bright future, present at Cardinal Cooke's installation, has given way to tough realities. The priest shortage worsens. More parishes struggle to maintain budgets. Attendance at mass has fallen. The church's political clout has diminished as a secular mood deepens. Still, Cardinal Cooke felt the confidence and stability of his boyhood church, as sturdy as a fortress, even as he led the archdiocese into an uncertain future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/10/us/briefing-221158.html,"Dear Sir: Shut Up Most Congressional offices are flooded with mail, and many members feel obliged to reply only to letters from their district or state. Outsiders and writers who seem demented usually receive a routine noncommittal a c k n o w l e d g m e n t . The closest a politic lawmaker is likely to come to a sharp retort is the classic: ''Dear Mr. Smith: You may be right. Sincerely.'' But Representative Gary Ackerman, a New York Democrat who has served in the House since March, has taken an aggressive posture. Last month he got a letter from a Californian who listed himself as a doctor with a box-number address. It was full of anti-Soviet tirades and underlined demands. Mr. Ackerman replied this way: ''Dear Dr. - - -: ''Thank you for your letter demanding that I 'start doing the will of the people.' ''Why do you think I don't or haven't started to? Do you know anything about me or what I do? Have you prejudged me out of some personal bias? ''How do you know what the will of the people is? Did they elect you to write to me representing them? Or are you some nut fortune teller who just knows instinctively what everybody else in this country wants? ''What are you a doctor of anyway, and why do you live in a box, instead of a house or apartment like normal people?'' The Congressman also reproduced the exchange of correspondence and sent it to all his colleagues. One experienced House aide called it ''unusual that a member would circulate his impudent answer to a nut letter.'' Etc., Etc., Etc. On the other hand, the bland noncommittal Congressional reply doesn't always work out either. The other day Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania got an information copy of a letter a constituent had written to Fidel Castro about Cuban military policy. For some reason, Senator Specter felt called upon to respond, and this is what he wrote: ''Thank you for your recent letter regarding Fidel Castro's proposal to stop arms transfers and to pull out military advisers. I understand the concern that prompted you to write. ''As your Senator from Pennsylvania, I am committed to serving the people I was chosen to represent. ''Just as I must be kept informed on how you feel about the issues that come before Congress, so, too, should you be able to learn about the issues I am involved with and the work I have done on their behalf. It is only through this kind of communication that a representative democracy can function. I appreciate having had your views on this matter and hope that you will contact me again regarding issues of mutual concern.'' In fairness, big-state Senators receive a lot of mail, and trying to answer it all often leads them to use computer-driven typewriters that assemble prewritten paragraphs into letters that do not always make a great deal of sense. According to Irving Readers of John Irving's novels would be surprised if he was anything other than unorthodox. The author of ''The World According to Garp'' and ''The Hotel New Hampshire'' is coming to Washington this week to read from his work in progress, but he wants it understood that book promotion is not his motive. ''My reason for being here is political,'' said Mr. Irving, who will be the star attraction at a reception of the National Abortion Rights Action League at Mount Vernon College on Wednesday. ''I am very committed to preserving the access of all women to a safe legal abortion when that is the woman's choice.'' The new novel, which takes place in a Maine orphanage in the early 1900's, is a ''long, long way'' from completion, he says. Hunger in the Capital The Democrats are serving notice around the country that they plan to use hunger as an issue against President Reagan in 1984. The Democratic National Committee is circulating a fund-raising letter on what it calls ''Ronald Reagan's shocking insensitivity to hunger in America'' as shown by Administration budget cuts and tax policy. The mailing features a postcard addressed to the President, to be signed and mailed by the contributor. On the back is a map of part of the District of Columbia with 18 locations of ''soup kitchens, food distribution centers and food stamp offices'' within 18 blocks of the White House. ''Dear President Reagan,'' the postcard reads, ''if you want to see hunger in America, just take a walk around your own neighborhood.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Republicans now hold a 55-to-45 majority in the Senate, but more Republicans than Democrats face challenges in the 1984 elections, bolstering Democratic hopes. The races have narrowed to two candidates in each party who are well enough known to be serious contenders. Senator Daniel J. Evans, 57 years old, is seen by all the others as the candidate to be defeated. A Republican and former Governor who left office voluntarily in 1977 after three terms, he was appointed to the Senate seat Sept. 8, a week after Mr. Jackson's death, by Gov. John Spellman, also a Republican. Democratic Race Called Close Lloyd Cooney, 60, a broadcasting executive, is Senator Evans's major Republican opponent. Mr. Cooney, who ran a credible race in losing the Senate Republican nomination in 1980, describes himself as the only political conservative among the four leading contenders. The race for the Democratic nomination has tightened noticeably since early September, when Mayor Charles Royer of Seattle, 44, was believed to have a substantial lead over the other strong Democratic contender, Representative Michael E. Lowry, 44, also of Seattle. Political writers who have followed the campaigns say they expect Senator Evans to win the Republican nomination, but feel uncertain in predicting the Royer-Lowry race. Mr. Cooney has campaigned hard against Senator Evans. Mr. Cooney has been aided in his campaign for the Republican nomination by Dixy Lee Ray, a Democrat and former Governor. When she was Governor, she was critical of the actions of her predecessor, Mr. Evans. Labor Group Endorses Lowry Mr. Evans has spent $300,000 and Mr. Cooney $140,000, according to their campaign finance reports to state agencies. Mr. Cooney opposes the right to abortion and supports so-called right-to- work legislation, the opposite of Mr. Evans's views. Both Republicans support deployment of the cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe and the MX missile program; both the Democrats oppose. Representative Lowry, who likes to call himself ''a Democrat's Democrat,'' and Mayor Royer have avoided campaigning against each other while focusing their attacks on Senator Evans. Mr. Lowry won endorsement of the Washington State Labor Council, a branch of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that rejected the recommendation of its Committee on Political Education for a co- endorsement of both Mr. Lowry and Mr. Royer. A Continuing Campaign In spending, Mr. Lowry is ahead by $185,000 to the Mr. Royer's $125,000. In part this is because the Congressman could put into his Senate race $40,000 he was holding for next year's re-election campaign. Mr. Lowry has campaigned for office at two-year intervals since 1973, losing but once, and has a continuing campaign structure that merely goes into neutral between elections. Mr. Royer depends heavily on alliances he made during the past two years as he explored the possibility of running for Governor next year. The Democrats' positions seem close, but Mayor Royer tends to state his views in softer focus than does Representative Lowry, whose answers tend to be flat ''yes'' or ''no.'' For example, both support monetary reparations to Japanese relocated in 1942 and support the right to abortion. Both would cut military spending in favor of welfare programs. Mr. Lowry supports school busing for racial balance; Mr. Royer says it has been a failure. Democrats Demanded a Vote Only the question of Republican and Democatic Party nominations will be on the ballot. The problem of electing a successor to fill out Senator Jackson's term to January 1987 became a crisis because of the timing of his death. State law requires the office to be filled at the next general election, which means Nov. 8 this year. But the filing date for the regular primary, Sept. 20, had passed. The interim appointment would have given Senator Evans an advantage in a winner-take-all election Nov. 8, so the Democrats clamored for a special primary. Governor Spellman called a special legislative session, and the once- only primary date was set. This caused the White House to retreat from the warm endorsement President Reagan had given the Evans appointment; the President does not, as a rule, endorse one Republican over others in a primary. Turnout Could Be Important A low turnout Tuesday could benefit a candidate with a dedicated following. For the primary Sept. 20, when local officials and tax questions were at issue, just 25 percent of the 2.1 million registered voters turned out.Also, Washington primaries are open, so a voter is not restricted by party. The two nominees will be on the ballot Nov. 8 coincidental with the regular off-year Washington municipal elections. Dean Peoples, a striking shipyard worker, was nominated by convention of the Socialist Workers Party and will also be on the ballot in that election.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Abortion Foe Sentenced For Florida Clinic Fires,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/us/around-the-nation-abortion-foe-sentenced-for-florida-clinic-fires.html,"An opponent of abortion who abducted an Illinois doctor and his wife has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for setting fire to two abortion clinics here. Don Benny Anderson, 42 years old, of Pearland, Tex., pleaded no contest Monday to two counts of second-degree arson in Pinellas County Circuit Court. Judge Gerard O'Brien sentenced him to 15 years in prison on each count. The sentence was to be concurrent with the 30-year sentence he was given in the abduction of Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife, Rosalie, from their home in Edwardsville, Ill., in August 1982. An Assistant State Attorney, Tom Hogan, said Matthew M. Moore, 20, was being extradited to Florida to face arson charges in connection with the clinic fires. Mr. Moore was sentenced to eight years in prison after he pleaded guilty to Federal charges in the Zevallos case. The doctor and his wife were held in an abandoned ammunition bunker for eight days before they were released after the doctor pretended to agree to the men's demands that he stop performing abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Conatitutional Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-conatitutional-views.html,"Abortion should not have been made a constitutional question, Federal Judge Whitman Knapp said yesterday. It should have been legislated state by state, he said, but the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion had created ''polarization'' that was ''unhealthy for our country.'' A decade ago, Mr. Knapp headed a commission that investigated the New York City police. Yesterday, the judge was the first lecturer in a course on ethics at the New School. But not a single question was asked about the police after he brought up abortion. He suggested respect for differing opinions, whatever the topic. Why should people criticize religious leaders who seek to change the law to curb abortion? If a clergyman testified against the death penalty, he said, ''I don't suppose anyone would be upset.'' But his audience was upset with his analogy. Letting legislatures, not courts, decide on abortion, someone suggested, would polarize society even more. ''Why should you bring religion into a question when the Constitution rules against it?'' asked another. ''You and the Supreme Court feel one way,'' Judge Knapp said. ''I feel another.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TWO ENTER RUNOFF FOR BOSTON MAYOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/us/two-enter-runoff-for-boston-mayor.html,"Melvin H. King, a black former State Representative, and Raymond L. Flynn, a member of the City Council, won the mayoral primary today, marking a historic shift in Boston politics. They will meet in the November general election. With 60 percent of the 252 precincts counted, their major challenger, David I. Finnegan, a former School Committee president, conceded defeat. Mr. King had 32,595 votes, or 34 percent; Mr. Flynn had 24,441, or 25 percent, and Mr. Finnegan had 20,256, or 21 percent. Mr. King's success in the nonpartisan primary marked the first time in Boston's 350-year history that a black had won a spot in the mayoral runoff. It also represented a striking departure from Boston's recent legacy of racial strife, set off by court-ordered busing to achieve school desegregation in 1974. 'Rainbow Coalition' Cited In a victory speech tonight, Mr. King made reference to his support among black, Hispanic and white voters, a group he dubbed the ''rainbow coalition.'' ''We started out saying we may have come on different ships, but we are all in the same boat now,'' Mr. King said. ''We are here tonight to say the boat is changing its course. Welcome to the 'rainbow coalition.' '' Mayor Kevin H. White, who decided not to run this fall after 16 years in office, said Mr. King's triumph was also a victory for Boston. It meant, Mayor White said, that a large number of white voters had cast their ballots without regard to race. ''If I had to leave being Mayor, man, am I glad to see that, along with the tall skyscrapers,'' Mr. White said in a television interview this evening. He was referring to what is generally regarded as his most important contribution to Boston, the redevelopment of the downtown business district. Major Registration Effort Mr. King's aides said tonight that he had won up to 88 percent of the vote among black and Hispanic people, two groups that historically have not voted heavily here. Black community leaders, encouraged by the succees of black candidates elswhere in the country this year, like Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago, had organized a registration drive that added 20 percent to the voter rolls. The city's Election Department said it would not have final figures on the turnout until Wednesday morning. But a source close to City Hall said the figure was about 65 percent, or 160,000 people, a record for a non-Presidential election in recent years. Mr. Flynn's victory also represented a major change in Boston politics. Although he is of Irish Catholic ancestry, in a city dominated by Irish politicians for the past century, Mr. Flynn put together a coalition that included both liberals and conservatives. Disparate Group of Backers His supporters included conservative friends and relatives from his home section of South Boston, where Mr. Flynn was a leader in opposing school busing and abortion. But he was also backed by leftist activists, labor unions and organizations of tenants and the elderly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Sent a Letter I P o C,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/nyregion/president-sent-a-letter-i-p-o-c.html,"President Reagan's representative to the funeral of Terence Cardinal Cooke carried a letter of mourning that praised the Cardinal for his staunch stance against abortion, authorities said yesterday. William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, and Mr. Reagan's representative at Monday's funeral mass, delivered the letter, dated Oct. 6, to Bishop Joseph O'Keefe, the current administrator of the Archdiocese of New York, according to a spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling. Mr. Reagan, who visited Cardinal Cooke on his sickbed Sept. 26, wrote, ''Nancy and I share in the grief of the people and the clergy of the New York Archdiocese at the passing of His Eminence Terence Cardinal Cooke, and we extend to all of you our deepest sympathy.'' ''Cardinal Cooke will always be remembered for his tireless defense of the right to life,'' the letter said. ''And he deeply believed it was God's will that all human life, even in the womb, deserved respect and protection.'' Cardinal Cooke, an anti-abortion activist for 10 years, served as chairman of the Pro-Life Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The Cardinal, who suffered from leukemia, died last Thursday at the age of 62. He was buried in a crypt beneath the main altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIGNS OF CHANGE APPEARING IN BOSTON'S ELECTORATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/13/us/signs-of-change-appearing-in-boston-s-electorate.html,"The virtual tie in the mayoral primary Tuesday between Melvin H. King, a black neighborhood organizer, and Raymond L. Flynn, a self-styled populist, reflects the emergence of a more liberal electorate in Boston after a century of domination by conservative and Irish politicians. ''You are now looking at a city that is much more moderate,'' remarked John Marttila, one of the city's most respected political analysts who is a former campaign manager for Mayor Kevin H. White. He added that the election had helped put Boston in ''great spiritual shape.'' Kenneth R. Rossano, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and senior vice president of the Bank of Boston, generally agreed, describing the outcome of the election as ''an extremely healthy one.'' He added, ''One of the encouraging things is that all that racial divisiveness is over and done with.'' Their sentiments were echoed today by many, though hardly all, Bostonians in a series of interviews. The once-vocal opponents of court- ordered busing to achieve school integration and those who encouraged racial confrontation have become muted after a decade of divisiveness, and so far they have not campaigned against Mr. King. Though many people thought he would fail, Mr. King became the first black in Boston's 350-year history to make it to the mayoral runoff. To do so, he relied on what he called a ''rainbow coalition'' of black, Hispanic and white people. The 54-year-old Mr. King in some ways is an unlikely person to become the first black mayoral finalist. Long known as a militant, he offended even many blacks by continuing to wear a dashiki until earlier this year. Unlikely Coalitions Won But he has clearly won support among some working-class whites, liberals and women's and homosexual activist groups. Mr. Flynn's victory was equally remarkable. He put together an improbable coalition of what he termed the disenfranchised, including leftist activists, labor union leaders, advocates for the elderly and the poor, and working class residents of Mr. Flynn's home district in traditionally conservative South Boston. Mr. Flynn, a former All-American basketball star and son of a longshoreman, is, like many populists, liberal on economic issues but conservative on others. Hence, while he favors tighter rent control and requiring real estate developers to contribute to rebuilding housing in the neighborhoods, he has opposed abortion as well as busing for school desegregation. Nearly Identical Statements Moreover, Mr. King and Mr. Flynn preached almost identical messages. In victory statements last night, they both pledged to move beyond the divisive strains of racism and concentrate on rebuilding the city's decaying neighborhoods by improving jobs, schools and housing. Both had argued throughout the campaign that Mayor White, who was not running after 16 years in office, had neglected the neighborhoods in favor of developing Boston's prosperous business district. At a personal level, too, both men were almost the reverse of Mayor White, suggesting that voters wanted a change. Where he is glib, their speech was slow; where he has become almost imperious, they seemed humble. The result was a virtual tie in the final results, with Mr. Flynn winning one more vote than Mr. King, 47,432 to 47,431, according to the City Election Commission. That gave them each a 29 percent share, compared with 41,308 votes or 25 percent for their closest competitor, David I. Finnegan. The top two vote- getters in the nonpartisan election face each other in November. Many New Voters Found More than 63 percent of the city's registered voters turned out, the highest vote in a preliminary election in more than two decades. Both candidates were encouraged by the large number of new voters this year, including members of minority groups and young professionals who have recently moved into Boston. Surveys of people leaving polling places showed new voters made up almost 20 percent of those voting. An analysis of the returns showed that Mr. King, a former State Representative, had rolled up enormous margins in predominantly black wards, up to 95 percent in one ward in Dorchester, for example. Many blacks were galvanized by the success of black politicians elsewhere in the country this year, like the election of Mayor Harold Washington in Chicago. But Mr. King also won in the liberal white Back Bay area and in the district around Boston University. Although no precise figures were available on how many votes he received from whites, Mr. King won half of the city's 22 wards, and some exit polls suggested he took 10 to 15 percent of the white vote. King's 'Time Has Come' At Mr. King's victory party last night, in the Parker House, long a headquarters for Irish-American politicians, Donald P. Batchelder, a white carpenter, exclaimed: ''Mel King is more than a person. He is an idea, and he's an idea whose time has come.'' The major question now is whether Mr. King can continue to expand his appeal to whites, who make up roughly 70 percent of the city's 260,000 voters. Mr. Marttila estimated that Mr. King will have to win 35 to 40 percent of the white vote to triumph in the general election on Nov. 15. That, he suggested, will be difficult, because ''there is generally a ceiling on the amount of white votes a first-time black candidate can achieve.'' The highest in a mayoral race so far was 19 percent, won by Ernest N. Dutch Morial in New Orleans, he said. ''So Mel King is really contending with American history as much as the city of Boston,'' Mr. Marttila said. Most See a Flynn Victory Most analysts therefore believe Mr. Flynn will triumph. ''It's hard to see how Ray will lose it,'' said Robert R. Kiley, who was one of the nine candidates before dropping out three weeks ago and being nominated for the chairmanship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York. Mr. Kiley and others believe most supporters of Tuesday's losing candidates will turn to Mr. Flynn, providing him with a comfortable margin. Indeed, a campaign adviser to Mr. Flynn said today that his phone had not stopped ringing with calls from businessmen and members of Mayor White's once-powerful political organization offering their help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRITISH CABINET MEMBER RESIGNS IN SCANDAL OVER HIS EX-SECRETARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/15/world/british-cabinet-member-resigns-in-scandal-over-his-ex-secretary.html,"Cecil Parkinson, who managed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's re-election campaign last summer, resigned in a scandal today from his senior post in her Government. Mr. Parkinson stepped down as Minister for Trade and Industry less than 12 hours after his former secretary, Sara Keays, who is expecting their baby in January, issued a statement saying he had twice asked her to marry him and had twice changed his mind. She said the most recent proposal was on June 9, election day, when he already knew she was pregnant. By resigning, Mr. Parkinson spared his mentor and leader further embarrassment, but Conservative members of Parliament said tonight that Mrs. Thatcher's judgment in keeping him on for three months after learning about the impending birth was questionable. In her statement, Miss Keays reacted angrily to an editorial last Monday in The Daily Telegraph. It asserted that ''the moral logic is that a quiet abortion is greatly to be preferred to a scandal.'' 2 Choices Rejected What the paper meant, Miss Keays said, was that ''I should have sacrificed my baby's life for Mr. Parkinson's career and the Government's reputation.'' She said she had never considered having an abortion; nor, she added, was she willing to ''declare on the baby's birth certificate 'father unknown,' so casting further doubt on my reputation and denying the child his fundamental right to know the identity of his father.'' Mr. Parkinson announced eight days ago that he had had a long affair with Miss Keays and said he was the father of the child she was expecting. He said he intended to continue as a Cabinet member, and Mrs. Thatcher firmly backed him. But the scandal overshadowed this week's Conservative Party conference here and threatened to continue for weeks if not for months. Late Thursday night, after Mr. Parkinson had made a successful speech to the conference and had won its plaudits, Miss Keays handed her statement to reporters for The Times of London at her father's home near Bath. She denied that she had tried to trap Mr. Parkinson into marriage and asserted that the baby ''was conceived in a longstanding, loving relationship.'' He first proposed marriage to her, she said, in 1979 and reneged on their most recent wedding plans after returning from vacation on Sept. 1. She said she pressed him to make a statement last week after Private Eye, a satirical magazine, printed what she said was a garbled account of the affair. Resignation Comes Quickly Mrs. Thatcher heard of her statement about 2 A.M. today and immediately summoned Mr. Parkinson to her suite at the Imperial Hotel in this faded resort town on the Irish Sea. At 8 A.M. he resigned, and at 9:45 the Prime Minister's office announced tersely that the resignation had been accepted ''with regret.'' Mr. Parkinson, who is 51 years old, was the Prime Minister's protege and had been mentioned as a successor. She plucked him from obscurity to make him the chairman of the Tory party, then involved him deeply in the conduct of the Falkland war. She had planned to make him Foreign Secretary after the election but apparently decided, when he told her of the affair on election day, that he would be too much of a liability in that post. Instead, in an effort to limit the damage, Mrs. Thatcher named him Minister for Trade and Industry. After a discreet interval, she replaced him as party chairman with John Selwyn Gummer. But when the scandal broke last week, she stood by him and said resignation was not an issue. By keeping Mr. Parkinson on, and apparently rejecting an earlier resignation offer, Mrs. Thatcher earned credit in the party for loyalty. But some senior politicians and nearly all commentators said today that the episode had robbed her Government of credibility at the start of her second term. ''It obviously hasn't helped,'' Transportation Minister Tom King said. For the moment, Paul Channon, Mr. Parkinson's deputy, will oversee his ministry. Mrs. Thatcher Alludes to Him When she delivered the traditional closing speech to the conference this afternoon, Mrs. Thatcher thanked all who had helped the party to victory last summer. She added, ''We do not forget today the man who so brilliantly organized the campaign.'' She did not mention his name, as if hoping to bury the scandal that blighted this conference. Her speech was greeted with an eight-minute standing ovation. Mr. Parkinson returned during the day to his home north of London, which was besieged by journalists. He made no comment except to complain that ''some people'' - presumably meaning Miss Keays - had gone back on an agreement to say nothing. His political career is widely believed to be ruined, with no prospect of his ever returning to the Cabinet. Although he made no move to resign as a member of Parliament, many of his colleagues expect him to do so soon. Had Miss Keays said nothing, Mr. Parkinson might have hung on, Cabinet ministers said, at least until the birth of the baby. He clearly had the backing of the conference, which cheered and applauded his appearance on the platform on Thursday. At the beginning of his speech, he thanked his wife, Ann, who was sitting behind him, for her help during the campaign. Tears gleamed in her eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRASSROOTS ARE BECOMING A TRICKY POLITICAL THICKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/weekinreview/grassroots-are-becoming-a-tricky-political-thicket.html,"Every four years, as part of the Presidential campaign ritual, political candidates and reporters begin scouring grassroots America, that land of part myth and part reality, part clover and part briarpatch, for those issues that boil up from the people. More often than not public opinion polls show that when asked to name their major concerns about the future, grassrooters tick off most of the issues on the Washington agenda - the nuclear arms race, the staying power of the economic recovery, the prospect of military entanglement in Central America and unemployment. But underlying these broad concerns are issues, some local or regional, that have direct effects on the lives of many voters. Toxic waste is no small matter in dioxin-scared Missouri. In New England and other affected areas, acid rain is a major concern. The expected increase in local telephone bills, the result of the Federal Government's breakup of A.T.&T., has upset city dwellers and farmers alike. Workers in the steel and automobile industries are demanding protectionist trade policies to preserve jobs. Education is caught up in Presidential politics, but there are signs that this issue may be defined more by teachers and parents than by the candidates. These are the kind of issues that rarely determine the outcome of a Presidential election, and it is too early to say how they may figure in the political chemistry of 1984. But they do tend to influence the basic political outlook and disposition of voters, and it usually takes a Presidential campaign to relate them to the policies and philosophy dominating Washington. Deregulation, for example, was mostly an abstraction in the 1980 Presidential campaign, but in 1984 it will have taken on real meaning for those who believe their lives have been affected for better or worse by the Reagan Administration's deregulation efforts. Unemployed and threatened airline workers are being told their troubles stem in large measure from the economic havoc wreaked on the industry by deregulation. For many other Americans, the deregulation of the communications industry, which has been sped along by the Federal Communications Commission and by Congressional legislation, means higher local telephone bills. Congress, which was eager to strip Ma Bell of her regulated monoply advantages and force her into the marketplace, now has a bad case of political jitters. A number of bills are pending to block the F.C.C.'s decision to slap a monthy access fee, $2 for residential customers and $6 for business, on telephone bills. ''This can be, will be and is a political issue,'' says Jerry Kovach, staff director of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. ''The ramifications of not doing anything would be widespread, for voters are going to be lashing out at candidates at every level.'' Shrinking Big Government and shifting power back to the states and local communities is the kind of political rhetoric that sounds good to many voters. But if shrinkage in Washington translates, as it often does, into higher local and state taxes, reductions in services and other hardships, that issue can cut a different way politically. There also is growing anxiety about the adequacy of health care programs. Thirty states took some action last year to reduce Medicaid benefits, limit eligibility or cut payments to the providers of health services. ''Hospital costs are going to emerge as a grassroots political issue,'' said Bernie Aronson, who monitors issues for the Democratic National Committee, ''because Medicaid and Medicare are the next big bankruptcy questions facing the Federal Government.'' Unpredictable Voters One problem for candidates is to keep their pursuit of grassroots issues from becoming perceived as special-interest politics. Patrick Caddell, who was President Carter's poll-taker, is one of those who believe the grassroots are dimly seen. The trouble is, he says, that Washington tends to view that part of the country beyond the Capital Beltway as a land of predictable voting groups. The perception of Moral Majority, a political spinoff of the Rev. Jerry Falwell's evangelical movement, is an example. ''Moral Majority people are not just a bunch of right-wing nut groups as some people in Washington think,'' Mr. Caddell said. ''I believe they are closer to the mainstream than they are given credit for. You can't have such a large percentage of the American people in favor of a nuclear freeze and not have some born-again Christians in that category.'' Mr. Caddell's theory is supported by the results of a recent poll of fundamentalist Christians paid for by The Free Congress Research & Education Foundation, a Washington-based conservative group headed by Paul W. Weyrich. Last week Mr. Weyrich held a news conference to warn President Reagan that the poll results show that he cannot take this voting group for granted in 1984. The poll, conducted by Lance Tarrance Jr. of Houston, shows that in a national sample of 1,000 registered voters who identified themselves as evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, Mr. Reagan held a narrow lead, 41 to 37, over Democratic Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Mr. Reagn led Walter F. Mondale 47 to 34. The same poll seems to undercut the notion that this voting group is of like mind on many of the issues on the agenda of the religious right. It found, for example, that while 53 percent of the poll's respondents favored tuition tax credits, 37 percent opposed them. On military spending, 39 percent supported an increase, but 33 percent thought the military budget could be reduced. Even on the question of abortion, the poll found a significant division of opinion. Asked if abortion should be legally available to any adult woman who desired it, 39 percent said yes, 53 percent said no. Perhaps this helps explain the surprisingly friendly welcome Senator Edward M. Kennedy received recently in Lynchburg, Va., from Mr. Falwell and his Moral Majority followers. The Massachusetts Democrat's speech on political and religious tolerance was interrupted 16 times by applause, for points including his praise of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his support of the nuclear freeze movement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A FIRM VOICE IN ITALIAN POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/style/a-firm-voice-in-italian-politics.html,"In the early 1970's Susanna Agnelli, Suni to her friends, lived in New York, leading the kind of glamorous, fast- paced life that one might associate with a very wealthy woman who is a granddaughter of the founder of Fiat. Miss Agnelli, now 61 years old, was in New York again recently, but this time her visit was an official one. She is now an Italian Senator who on Aug. 13 was named Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A tall, strong-faced, no-nonsense woman, she is the divorced mother of six and grandmother of nine. She is also the Mayor of Monte Argentario, a coastal resort region north of Rome, a job she has held since 1974; a past member of the European Parliament, and the author of a popular weekly advice column in the magazine Oggi. In the Italian national election last June she was also elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where she has sat since 1976, by three constituencies, but she now sits only in the Senate. 'No, It Is Not I' All this has helped to make her what many people describe as the best-known female politician in Italy. Such a suggestion makes her shake her head and say, in her blunt style: ''No, it is not I. It is Mme. Iotti.'' She was referring to Leonilde Iotti, a Communist Party member who is President of the Chamber of Deputies. Then she certainly must be the second best-known female politician in Italy? She replied softly: ''I would say I am, yes.'' Miss Agnelli, who uses her maiden name - she was divorced in 1971 from a lawyer, Count Urbano Rattazzi - was sitting in an office of the Italian Consulate General at 690 Park Avenue. She was wearing a red silk dress, a strand of knotted pearls and a Bulgari watch, and strapped to her left wrist was a small leather case that looked as if it could hold a pack of cigarettes and that has become one of her trademarks. ''Everybody asks what it is,'' she said in flawless English. ''I carry my spectacles in it so I know I'll always have them with me. In Italy people think it is an antikidnapping device that can beep the police or something.'' She is security- conscious in a country that has seen much terrorism directed against officials: She said she employed a bodyguard and traveled in an armored Fiat. As Under Secretary Miss Agnelli has been assigned responsibilty for two areas: relations with North and South America, and cultural affairs. She is the first in the post to be given this dual responsibility, she said. Affiliated with the small, centrist Republican Party, she is one of 10 female members in the 315-seat Senate (there are 40 among the 630 deputies). According to Miss Agnelli, more Italian women would be elected to office if they were not so aggressive. ''I think people tend to get a bit frightened by an aggressive woman,'' she explained. ''I think the best way of asserting personal opinions is to be unobtrusive. Speak very little, and possibly in a low voice, and people will listen to you more.'' Does she consider herself a feminist? ''No,'' she replied. ''I think feminists always have an aggressive attitude and never have a balanced vision of things. They always get furious at things like President Reagan's comment about how men would still be living in caves if it weren't for women. I think that was probably a compliment on Reagan's part. It was no reason to get furious. You should get furious when people are demeaning or saying nasty things.'' Still, Miss Agnelli believes that many high-ranking men in Italian politics view her as ''something of a joke.'' ''I sometimes get the feeling that they think, 'Why the hell have they sent this woman here to discuss this important business?' '' she said. ''In my own party they like me to run for office because I get a lot of votes. But when it comes time for something important, like making an important political speech, they're not about to let a woman do it.'' But she thinks that men in Italy, especially the younger ones, are becoming ''much less macho.'' There is evidence of this, she said, in a number of new movies in which young men ask their female lovers if they have been faithful to them and the women tell them no. ''Italian men know they have to be careful today,'' she said with a smile. ''I think it's good that they understand the suffering that women have always felt when vice versa happens.'' Discussing the status of Italian women, Miss Agnelli, a Roman Catholic, said she thought that legalized abortion would not be overturned. She also predicted that Pope John Paul II would not change his conservative stands on women's issues and that women would never become priests. The idea of a career in national politics came to Miss Agnelli after Marion Javits, wife of former Senator Jacob K. Javits, suggested it a number of times while she was living in New York. ''Suni never really was a part of fashionable New York,'' Mrs. Javits said the other day. ''She entertained it, but she never really felt it. Once I got to know her I felt she had layers of depths and understanding about life and people and their needs that should be used intelligently. Somewhere deep down, she felt she needed to serve.'' Miss Agnelli was reluctant to talk about her motivations for going into politics. She would say only that her first involvement came in 1970 after she had complained to the City Council in Monte Argentario about illegal housing construction that she considered ugly besides. She said she was told that instead of grumbling she should run for office. She did, and was elected to the Council. At the time she was considered something of a controversial figure in Italy because of a magazine article she wrote in 1969 predicting that the United States would lose the war in Vietnam. A one- time medical and nursing student, she had visited Vietnam on a nursing mission for the Red Cross. Things Still to Be Done Mayoral business is conducted in Monte Argentario on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, and Miss Agnelli has no plans to give up the post now that she is an Under Secretary. ''I would not want to leave now,'' she said, ''because there are number of important questions I've been working on.'' They include curbing those ugly, illegal houses, building a new sewage system and trying to persuade women to send their children to a new kindergarten rather than to the old, dilapidated one. Asked about her relationship with her brother Gianni, who heads Fiat, she smiled and said, ''We are great friends and always have been.'' She said that he had supported her in all of her political endeavors and that when she was elected to the Senate he said he was very proud. Miss Agnelli wrote about him and her five other brothers and sisters in her 1975 autobiography, ''We Always Wore Sailor Suits,'' a best seller in Italy. In her spare time she raises bonsai trees and visits her children, who range in age from 27 to 37, and her grandchildren. One daughter, Priscilla, is a photographer in New York. Miss Agnelli has no plans to marry again, she said, ''because marriage is a very, very difficult thing, something you do only once in life.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPAIN'S SOCIALISTS BEGIN FEELING THE NUDGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/weekinreview/spain-s-socialists-begin-feeling-the-nudges.html,"Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has been in office 10 months and for the most part Spain's love affair with its handsome young Socialist leader continues unabated. But there are signs the honeymoon may soon be over. Mr. Gonzalez has run into difficulty in recent weeks in dealing with three important power centers - the unions, the military and the Roman Catholic Church. None of the problems appear insurmountable, but they chip away at the remarkable consensus he has enjoyed so far and serve as a reminder that Spain can be a hard country to govern. Last week the Government and unions opened bargaining sessions that will affect contracts for 1984 and beyond. It will be a critical round because the Government wants to hold wage increases to 6.5 percent, one and a half points below its projected figure for inflation next year. The talks are haunted by the prospect of widespread layoffs, a particularly sensitive issue for the Socialists, who came into power partly on a promise to bring down unemployment. Spain's jobless rate is 16.5 percent, one of the highest in Europe. An effort is under way to streamline state-run industries that have grown fat, lazy, unproductive and debt- ridden under decades of protectionism. The overhauling is essential if Spanish industries are to become competitive enough to survive when Spain enters the European Economic Community in a few years. But with the prospect of a loss of perhaps 60,000 jobs, according to officials, the overhaul could be political dynamite as a recent dispute over plans to cut back the operations of a state-owned steel mill showed. Rebellious workers refused to abandon part of the plant and were dismissed. They were reinstated when they ended their protest. The Government is also contemplating legislation to make it easier for private companies to hire and fire. Laws dating to the rule of Francisco Franco and intended to discourage independent unions provide for hefty severence payments, and many businesses think twice before letting a worker go. Flexibility, the employers argue, would help them respond to market conditions. The unions see this as a ploy likely to mean further layoffs. The Workers' Commissions, the Communist-led labor force, opposes the measure. So does the General Union of Workers, the other principal labor grouping, which is Socialist and has cooperated with the Government. Military Also a Worry While the dispute with the unions was brewing, the armed forces also got into the headlines. The Government last month dismissed a top-ranking officer, Lieut. Gen. Fernando Soteras Casamayor, the commander of one of the country's nine military regions, after he made statements in a magazine interview praising the imprisoned ringleaders of the failed coup attempt of February 1981 when Parliament was seized. General Soteras upset the Government and other well-wishers of Spanish democracy by referring to the coup-makers as ''gentlemen'' and by laying out a rationale for army intervention - in cases, he said, where there is a ''vacuum'' of leadership by elected civilians. He sought to justify such takeovers by citing an article of the Constitution that describes the armed forces as the defenders of Spain's territorial integrity and the upholders of constitutional order. Against the background of two and possibly three coup attempts since the death of Franco in 1975, such views resurrected fears that the 250,000-member army - conservative and isolated from much of society, imbued with a sense of mission to guard against internal enemies and deployed in brigades encircling the main cities - was still a power with questionable loyalties to parliamentary rule. Articles appeared attributing the unrest in the military partly to continuing terrorist violence in the Basque region, where 27 people have died this year, and to separatist demonstrators burning the Spanish flag. ''The inevitable conclusion is that the military problem remains with us, and it does not at all help to silence or minimize the threat this implies to the constitutional system,'' the respected daily El Pais warned. No one thought another coup attempt was imminent and the calm with which the army received General Soteras's dismissal bolstered this view. But the incident made clear that the military hierarchy remains a powerful presence. It can exert pressure even without stirring from the barracks. The Roman Catholic Church is a third power center and it, too, was dueling with the Government. The issues were abortion and state control over private religious schools that receive Government subsidies. Both issues arose in new legislation that went before Parliament. One bill legalized abortions in restricted cases, such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or in which the fetus is malformed. Another set a variety of standards in administering the private schools, which teach almost a third of all Spanish pupils. Both bills are strongly opposed by the church and are being challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds by the rightist opposition. During a two-day trip to Rome last week, Mr. Gonzalez met with Pope John Paul II. It was described as a courtesy visit, but most observers believed the mission was to repair relations strained over the past few weeks. The Socialists, in power for the first time since the 1936-1939 civil war, have a comfortable working majority in Parliament - 202 out of 350 seats. But recent events have shown that pressures from power centers outside Parliament can be intense. The Socialists' self-confidence does not appear to have been diminished nor their popularity undermined, but the lesson has been an important one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IRELAND DOESN'T WONT THE ULSTER PROBLEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/opinion/l-ireland-doesn-t-wont-the-ulster-problem-233803.html,"To the Editor: Wherever does Jon Nordheimer or the editors of Week in Review (''Politics in Ulster,'' Oct. 2) get the idea that there is any ''progress toward the reunification of Ireland through peaceful and constitutional means'' which the I.R.A./Sinn Fein might have to spend any effort in ''crippling''? The majority of those electors in the Irish Republic who bothered to turn out last month decided to amend their constitution to ''elevate'' the merely legal ban on abortion into a Constitutional prohibition. Divorce is already proscribed in the Republic's Constitution. Does this sound like an electorate which is ready to accommodate a British Protestant population that would be 20 percent or more of an all-Ireland state and that is geographically concentrated in one corner of the island that these two nationalities share? When are you going to put someone in Ireland long enough to realize that public opinion in the Republic, at elite or mass levels, does not want the responsibility of the Ulster problem, not militarily, economically or culturally. The reunification of Ireland is no more likely than the reunification of Iberia or Scandinavia. London may eventually sicken of the Ulster morass and withdraw its responsibility, but that will lead to a ''Lebanon scenario'' - not at all like the limited violence so far - in which Dublin might be forced to annex the border districts to prevent the establishment of an I.R.A. ''mini-state'' (like Syria and Israel in Lebanon), but that would not, of itself, bring substantive Irish unity one step closer.

FETAL DEFECTS DISCOVERED EARLY BY NEW METHOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/18/science/fetal-defects-discovered-early-by-new-method.html,"DETECTION of many fetal defects as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may soon become practicle because of a new technique that some experts expect to replace most uses of amniocentesis, currently the standard test for such conditions, within the next several years. The new method is called chorionic villus biopsy. Unlike amniocentesis, which relies on fetal cells found in samples of amniotic fluid taken with a needle through the abdominal wall, chorionic villus biopsy samples fetal tissue directly through the cervix. It is now being tested at several medical centers in the United States and Europe almost a decade after a primitive version of the technique was first tried in China. A small group of experts will meet today at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., to discuss the technique. Experts have high hopes for it, but the method has not yet been used widely enough for its safety and efficacy to be evaluated thoroughly. Dr. George G. Rhoads of the institute said the group would discuss optimum ways of answering these questions. Chorionic villus biopsy can provide a larger sample of fetal tissues than amniocentesis, gives results faster and can be done much earlier in a pregnancy, specialists say. Coupled with new techniques for analyzing the human genetic material through recombinant DNA methods, chorionic villus biopsy may someday make it possible to detect early in pregnancy almost any of 3,800 different genetic disorders for which a faulty gene is known to exist. In the relatively near future, some scientists say, such biopsies in conjunction with DNA probes may become standard screening procedures for most pregnant women, providing tests for several important disorders at the same time. Coupled with use of DNA probes to analyze the tissue samples, said Dr. Laird G. Jackson, of Thomas Jefferson University, the method may come into extremely broad use for fetal diagnosis. Dr. Jackson is one of the leaders in applying the technique in this country. He said he expected the technique to largely replace amniocentesis before the end of this decade. Other specialists called that prediction conservative. As an example of the future possibilities, said Dr. George H. Sack Jr. of Johns Hopkins University, there might someday be a panel of simultaneous tests for cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria and galactosemia, three of the most important genetic disorders among white Americans. Sickle cell anemia and the various forms of the blood disease thalassemia might be added for appropriate population groups. Sickle cell anemia is common among blacks while various forms of thalassemia, sometimes called Cooley's anemia, are common in people of Mediterranean ancestry. The possibility of doing such multiple tests from the same tissue sample is a realistic goal today because of the sweeping advances that are being made in understanding the messages of the human genes encoded in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic material of all living things. The genetic message of any gene is embodied in the specific sequence of subunits in a piece of DNA. A disease- causing mutation may be only a single erroneous subunit among thousands that will make up a gene. Artificially constructed pieces of DNA that are only about 19 subunits long are being produced to serve as probes for the detection of such so- called ''point'' mutations. The pieces of DNA are called oligonucleotide probes. It is probes of this kind that could be used in a battery of tests of fetal cells collected through chorionic villus biopsy. A biopsy is the removal of a small sample of tissue for testing. Chorionic villi are protrusions, shaped somewhat like tiny fronds of coral, that protrude from portions of a membrane called the chorion, which surrounds the developing fetus and becomes part of the placenta. Although the chorion is never an anatomical part of the fetus itself, it is fetal rather than maternal in origin. Thus, the material in a sample of chorionic villous tissue is actually fetal tissue and can be used to test for genetic disorders in the fetus. Procedure Used in Biopsy The sample is taken by inserting a thin hollow tube, called a catheter, through the vagina and cervix into the uterus under direct observation with the aid of high resolution ultrasound. The use of sophisticated ultrasound, which can give remarkably detailed views of the fetus and its surroundings without invasion of the body or use of radiation, is considered indispensable to the chorion biopsy technique. The tissue is taken either by snipping off a sample of villous tissue or simply by suction. The method has already been used successfully to test for a particular enzyme that is missing in the tragic genetic disorder Tay-Sachs disease. Biopsies of chorionic villi have also been used to test for thalassemia, sickle-cell anemia and the chromosome abnormalities characteristic of Down's syndrome as well as other, even more severe forms of physical and mental impairment. The risk of having a baby afflicted with such a chromosomal disorder is highest among women in the older childbearing years. Eugene Pergament of Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago said about half the women on whom his group had used the new technique were tested because of their age. The group totals 34 patients to date, he said, making it one of the largest series of patients ever tested with the technique. Almost all of their fetuses were shown to be free of the defects for which they were tested, Dr. Pergament said, and the pregnancies have progressed without problem. The prenatal diagnostic test used most widely and successfully today is amniocentesis, in which fetal cells from the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus are sampled through a needle that pierces the mother's abdomen and uterus. Amniocentesis is commonly done after the 16th week of pregnancy. Earlier than that there is not enough amniotic fluid to test safely. The cells taken from the fluid usually have to be grown for three to four weeks in laboratory tissue cultures to provide enough material for testing. The results of the tests are therefore often not known until after the 20th week. Because it comes so late in pregnancy, the timing of such tests can often present serious psychological as well as medical problems for the pregnant woman whose baby is shown to have a serious genetic disorder. By then, the fetus has grown to a relatively large size and and may be making detectable movements. Chorion villus biopsies, on the other hand, can be performed between the eighth and 12th weeks, with the optimum time being the 10th week, when the fetus is only about the size of an apricot. This allows detection of genetic disorders, and abortion, if the woman chooses, within the first three months of pregnancy. ''This would not only allow very much safer methods for termination, but would also be far more acceptable to mothers at risk of having severely handicapped children and to the community,'' said a report in The Lancet, a British medical journal, by a group led by Dr. Robert Williamson and Dr. B. M. Modell, both of London. A Traumatic Situation Several experts in this country echoed that statement, noting that the need to make a decision on abortion late in a pregnancy can be psychologically traumatic for the woman involved. Dr. Jackson said chorion villus biopsy had been considered many years ago in the Scandinavian countries, but was eclipsed by the early successes of amniocentesis. Chorionic villus biopsy was again tried in China in the middle 1970's. A report in 1975 in an English-language Chinese medical journal said it had been used successfully to determine the sex of fetuses. The biopsies were done blind, however, without the use of ultrasound to guide the catheters. The method was next taken up in the Soviet Union and, in the last few years, in Europe and the United States. The early efforts, attempting to demonstrate both the safety and the efficacy of the method, were done on fetuses already scheduled for abortion. Among the earliest to demonstrate that useful tissue samples could be obtained by such biopsies was Dr. R. H. T. Ward, a gynecological surgeon at University College in London. In a recent issue of the British Medical Journal, his group described the use of the technique to obtain tissue samples from the fetuses of 47 pregnant women. American specialists expect that the method will prove safe because the tissues taken are not part of the fetus itself, and are destined to disappear naturally as the placenta matures. But no one can be certain of the safety without considerable experience. A few cases of fetal death after the chorionic villus tests have been reported, but in general those fetuses were found to have had serious disorders, such as chromosome aberrations, which were probably responsible for the outcome rather than anything related to the biopsy itself. At present the main reasons for doing diagnostic tests of fetuses are to assure that no genetic disorder is present, or to permit an abortion if such a defect is found. But doctors doing clinical research on the new technique see another, and more hopeful, prospect for the future. The earlier a genetic problem is found in a fetus, the greater the possibility that it might someday be corrected by some form of treatment in the womb. For example, phenylketonuria, which carries serious danger of mental retardation, is now treated by a drastically restricted diet from infancy onward. Specialists say it is a logical possibility that starting such a diet early in pregnancy, by having the pregnant woman follow it, might improve the baby's chances for a normal life. A substantial number of other genetic disorders work their damage through the baby's lack of some enzyme or other important substance, or through the abnormal accumulation of something else. Early warning that a fetus faces such a problem might, in the future, be followed by treatment in the womb that could compensate for the dangerous excess or deficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BROOKLYN BISHOP WILL HEAD DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/19/us/brooklyn-bishop-will-head-diocese-of-pittsburgh.html,"Pope John Paul II has named Auxiliary Bishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Brooklyn to head the diocese of Pittsburgh and appointed two other bishops in the Middle West, the United States Catholic conference announced yesterday. Bishop Bevilacqua, 60 years old, who has been Auxiliary Bishop in Brooklyn since 1980, succeeds Bishop Vincent M. Leonard as the 10th Bishop of the Pittsburgh Roman Catholic Diocese. Bishop Leonard will reach the mandatory retirement age of 75 on Dec. 11. The Pope also named Bishop John J. Paul, an Auxiliary Bishop in LaCrosse, as Bishop of the Wisconsin diocese, and appointed Msgr. Alexander Quinn of Cleveland as an Auxiliary Bishop in the Cleveland diocese. Bishop Bevilacqua, long active in church projects involving migrants and immigrants, is a civil lawyer as well as an expert in church law. He has been head of the Committee on Migration and Tourism for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and was named last fall to a special papal commission on the pastoral care of immigrants. Aided Brooklyn Immigrants The office he heads in the Brooklyn diocese now has a staff of 72 people who provide assistance on legal problems, aid refugees, conduct language courses and offer pastoral care to the growing number of immigrants in the Brooklyn diocese. This spring the Brooklyn Bishop acted as a special representative of the Pope in the case of Sister Agnes Mansour, who had requested a leave of absence from her religious order to serve as Director of the Michigan Department of Social Services. The nun had been under fire from the church for taking the job because it involved carrying out policies allowing state-financed abortions. Bishop Bevilacqua told the nun in May that the leave would not be granted, and she resigned from her order. Bishop Bevilacqua will head a diocese with 911,421 Catholics in 321 parishes. The Pittsburgh diocese has 928 priests and 46,753 students enrolled in 167 elementary secondary schools. It is the third largest Roman Catholic diocese in the country, after Brooklyn and Rockville Centre, though seven archdioceses of the church are larger. Bishop Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, grew up in Queens and graduated from Cathedral College in Brooklyn and Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington, L.I. After ordination in 1949, he was assigned to parishes in South Brooklyn and Long Island City. He later taught history at Cathedral College until he was selected to study canon law at Gregorian University in Rome, where he received a doctorate in 1956. After earning a master's degree in history from Columbia University, he entered St. John's University Law School and earned a doctorate in 1976. He was named Vice Chancellor of the Brooklyn diocese in 1965 and became Chancellor in 1976. In LaCrosse, Bishop Paul, 65, will succeed Bishop Frederick W. Freking. A graduate of Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, Bishop Paul became Vicar General of the diocese in 1965 and was named auxiliary bishop in 1977. The new Bishop in Cleveland is a graduate of the Lateran University in Rome. Bishop-elect Quinn, 53, was ordained in 1958 and was Assistant Chancellor and Chancellor of the diocese from 1962 to 1973. He is now pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TEXTS OF POPE AND COOKE'S LETTERS REFLECT A MUTUAL ESTEEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/nyregion/texts-of-pope-and-cooke-s-letters-reflect-a-mutual-esteem.html,"The final exchange of letters between Pope John Paul II and the dying Archbishop of New York, Terence Cardinal Cooke, was published in full for the first time today by the official Vatican newspaper. Cardinal Cooke died of leukemia Oct. 6, only weeks after informing the archdiocese that he was terminally ill. The letters, two from Cardinal Cooke and one from the Pope, reflect the close friendship and bond of faith between the two church leaders. Though relatively brief, the letters convey the deep sense of esteem between them and reflect the Cardinal's gratitude for the Pope's words of consolation. The full texts were published in L'Osservatore Romano. 8 Years of Treatment On Aug. 25, Cardinal Cooke wrote to tell the Pope of his worsening health. Addressing the Pontiff as ''Most Holy Father,'' Cardinal Cooke said that the Pope had communicated the love of Christ to him ''in a special way'' and that it ''has been a privilege to respond to the Christ-like love of Your Holiness.'' ''For the past eight years, I have received medical treatment for lymphonia condition,'' the Cardinal said. ''Thank God, this illness did not prevent me from fulfilling my responsibilities. ''However, recently I have suffered from an infection of the urinary tract, which has had many side effects. Now, in addition to the controlled lymphoma, an acute leukemia has developed.'' Cardinal Cooke clearly indicated his willingness to step down as Archbishop if the Pope so desired. ''Since I now suffer from limitations,'' the Cardinal said, ''I write to Your Holiness, knowing that the pastoral care of the people of the archdiocese and the military vicariate will be provided by my collaborators with my encouragement. However, I shall be guided by the wishes of Your Holiness with regard to the future.'' 'Personal Friendship' Noted The Pope responded Sept. 1, assuring the Cardinal at the outset of ''my spiritual closeness to you at this time'' and thanking him ''for the offering that you are making of your life for His holy Catholic Church and for me, whom God's providence has chosen to be the servant and pastor of all.'' John Paul also thanked the Cardinal for his ''personal friendship'' and for his leadership of the archdiocese and the military vicariate, the church's ministry to Catholics in the United States armed forces. Alluding to the Cardinal's sustained opposition to abortion, the Pope wrote: ''I am sure that your brothers and sisters and fellow citizens in America will never forget all your efforts on behalf of life, the right to life, everyone's right to life. Your generous services to the Holy See have been deeply appreciated by me, as they were by my predecessors.'' 'Special Apostolic Blessing' The Pope continued, ''I ask the Lord Jesus, High Priest of our salvation, to sustain you in whatever you will be called to endure.'' In closing, the Pope expressed his ''fraternal love'' and imparted his ''special apostolic blessing.'' Nothing in the Pope's letter suggested that the Cardinal should resign. Eleven days later, on Sept. 12, Cardinal Cooke completed the exchange in a buoyant letter of thanksgiving. The Cardinal offered the Pope the ''loyalty and obedience, the love and lasting affection of myself and of all the people of God, the Archdiocese of New York and the military vicariate.'' Theme of Sanctity of Life ''Your words give me comfort and consolation,'' the Cardinal wrote. ''This strengthens me in faith and in the realization that at this and all moments of life, we are with Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit on our journey to the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.'' Picking up the theme of the ''sanctity of human life,'' the Cardinal reiterated his emphasis on defending ''all human beings, especially innocent unborn children, at every moment from conception until death.'' ''I, too, thank God for my remembrance of you, for your loving pastoral leadership and for the fraternal friendship which we share,'' he wrote. Cardinal Cooke closed with an affirmation that he was ''devotedly and faithfully yours in Christ.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The music will include three selections especially for children: Jan Sibelius' almost unknown chamber piece in three movements titled ''Suite Mignonne'' (''Tiny Suite''); Robert McBride's ''Pumpkin Eater's Little Fugue'' based on the rhyme ''Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater''; and Charles Ives' ''Halloween,'' written for piano and strings in 1911. Tedd Joselson will be the piano soloist. Commenting on the Ives piece, Richard Kapp, director of the Philharmonia Virtuosi, said that ''all of Ives is a little spooky - this is macabre. It is simply a 45-second theme that is repeated several times at increasing speeds.'' Mr. Joselson will also be featured as the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto in A, K.414. The closing selection will be Haydn's ''Farewell Symphony,'' following which the musicians will extinguish their pumpkins and depart. Tickets are $8, $11 and $13. Children, who will receive packets of Halloween candy, and students, pay half- price. Call 693-1224 for reservations. WOMEN'S RIGHTS Karen Burstein, president of the state's Civil Service Commission, former state senator and former head of the state's Consumer Protection Board, will be the keynote speaker at a conference on women's rights to be held from 12:30 to 5 P.M. Saturday at the Pace Law School in White Plains. Co-sponsored by the Women's Association of Law Students of Pace Law School and the Westchester Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, the conference will consist of four panel discussions on financial and economic rights with respect to insurance, pensions and credit; ''reproductive rights'' concerning parental involvement in the sexual activity of minors, and a proposed human life amendment; women and violence, and women in the workplace, covering the issues of sexual harassment, sex discrimination, battered women and the cycle of family violence. Other speakers include Jeremiah Gutman, president of the New York Civil Liberties Union, and Barbara Shack, acting director. Members of the panels include Gara LaMarche, associate director of the New York Civil Liberties Union; Bonnie Silverd, an author and former columnist for Working Women magazine; Polly Rothstein, director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion; Judith Brown, director of the Yonker's Women's Shelter; Sheila Ortega of the state division of human rights; and Joan Vermeulen, Correctional Association of New York. The conference will be held in the Moot Court at 78 North Broadway. Those who cannot afford the $5 registration fee will be admitted free. For advance reservations and more information, call 997-7479 or 997-2936. ACHIEVEMENT MARKED Ruth Westheimer, adjunct professor in a human-sexuality program at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, has been named 1983 Jewish Woman of Achievement by a consortium of organizations connected with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in New York. Dr. Westheimer, who has become familiar to the public through her television appearances and her weekly radio program titled ''Sexually Speaking,'' will be honored during a conference and exhibition celebrating the diversity of women, to be held at the Midchester Jewish Center, one of the consortium, at 236 Grand Boulevard in Yonkers, from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. today. Dr. Westheimer will autograph copies of her latest book, ''Dr. Ruth's Guide to Good Sex.'' Visitors will be offered demonstrations of challah baking, computer operation, silk screening and body language. Career counseling and advice on resume writing and interviewing techniques will also be available. A $12 registration charge includes a kosher lunch. Phone 423-5009 or 963- 8457. FOCUS ON PRISONS For the last 25 years, the Westchester Citizens Committee of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency has dedicated itself to informing the public of conditions and issues in county prisons. The committee's current focus, to be discussed in a public forum and luncheon from noon to 2 P.M. Thursday in the White Plains Library, Martine Aevnue, is the education and redirection of incarcerated young people between the ages of 7 and 21. Last year, according to figures from the Commissioner of Corrections office, 3,215 people from 16 to 21 were held in the county penitentiary, the County Jail and the women's correctional center at Valhalla - or about 23 percent of the total population of the facility. Another 142 children under the age of 16 were held at Woodfield Detention Cottage pending court proceedings and 228 were held in the county's network of group homes. Six panel members will speak on the educational aspects of imprisonment for minors, and they will be available for a question and answer period. ''Some of these children have never learned to read,'' said Jean Fink, chairman of the committee. ''Others may spend up to a year awaiting trial and they may not get credit for work completed in detention when they re- enter school. The handicapped, some of whom got into trouble in the first place by dropping out of school because of learning disabilities, may require more help than they are receiving.'' According to Mrs. Fink, the state mandates that children in correctional facilities must be educated up to the age of 16. They're entitled to continued study up to the age of 21 if they request it, or if they are unable to read and write. Appearing on the panel will be Marie Cianca of the state's Department of Education, office for education of handicapped children; Petrita Hernandez-Rojas, director of education of the State Department of Corrections; Dr. Richard Lerer, Superintendent of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services; Theodore L. Salem, director of detention services of the county's Department of Social Services; and Lois Sweeney, director of education of the county's Department of Correction. Les Fernandez, the executive director of the Cage Teen Center, will serve as moderator. Co-sponsoring the program with the committee is the Westchester Alliance for Juvenile and Criminal Justice, and the Westchester Student Advocacy Coalition. Reservations cost $6, including lunch.

A LIFE AHEAD OF ITS TIME,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/books/a-life-ahead-of-its-time.html,"LAURA Z  By Laura Z. Hobson. Illustrated. 410 pp. New York: Arbor House. $17.95.  THE 20th century seems to have held special gifts for those born at its inception. Laura Z. Hobson was born Laura Zametkin in New York in 1900, a daughter of immigrant Russian Jewish socialists. ''Laura Z,'' the first volume of her autobiography, which ends in 1947 with the publication of her well-known best seller, ''Gentleman's Agreement,'' is yet another chatty chronicle of newspaper/literary New York in the 20's, the socially conscious 30's and World War II. While working as an advertising copywriter, she met her longtime lover, Tom Mount (whose story closely resembles that of her novel, ''Untold Millions''). Her subsequent marriage to the publisher Francis Thayer Hobson, as well as her long liaison with the Time Inc. editor and writer Ralph M. Ingersoll, involved her in stylish Manhattan life. Because of the size and cohesiveness - even coziness - of the literary community at that time, giants such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis and Lillian Hellman cast their shadows across her path, sometimes lingering to become close friends. Besides managing a jammed social calendar, she wrote promotional copy for Henry Luce of Time, high fashion copy for B. Altman, stories for popular magazines and, to make extra money, collaborated with Hobson on westerns. She was, besides, involved with the various liberal groups and causes that abounded just before the war. She was certainly where the action was. Unable to conceive a child, Mrs. Hobson adopted a son after her divorce from Thayer Hobson, noting that in the mid-30's single-parent adoption was almost unheard of. Though Ralph Ingersoll was fond enough of young Mickey, he broke the engagement when Mrs. Hobson became pregnant - finally - by him, saying he had to devote his life entirely to his new newspaper, PM. A miscarriage followed, then psychoanalysis with Dr. Raymond Gosselin, then hope in the form of a contract to write a novel from Richard Simon of Simon & Schuster. When she found she was pregnant again (by a casual lover she gives the pseudonym Hugh) she decided to have the child; a long-past abortion had decided her never to ''void my body again, never.'' This time she planned an elaborate ruse, hiding during her pregnancy and formally adopting her own child, because she felt that 5-year-old Mike would feel rejected knowing his new brother was not adopted as he had been. So, besides the interesting people Mrs. Hobson knew, and her work and her political causes (as well as the growing awareness of anti-Semitism that led to ''Gentleman's Agreement''), she was noteworthy as a woman ''generations ahead of her time,'' as the book jacket of ''Laura Z'' says; professional success, analysand and single mother. But, though the events of her life are interesting enough, they are neither edited nor analyzed, sorted out or evaluated. Mrs. Hobson thinks that everything that happened to her is worth putting down. She appears to have saved everything. Never once, it seems, was she afflicted by the panic that causes writers to Nora Johnson's novel ''The Two of Us'' will be published in January. throw out embarrassing diaries and early fragments they are suddenly afraid might be dug out of closets after their deaths by some overzealous child or biographer. It's hard to believe anybody will care about the endless excerpts from Mrs. Hobson's very ordinary diaries and journals, or the series of cute telegrams sent by the nanny on the subject of the baby's infection, or the results of Mrs. Hobson's basal metabolism test. She treats us to large amounts of the ad copy she wrote for Time and B. Altman as well as a 1932 New Yorker story (fortunately short) in its entirety. There are letters, notes, her jammed engagement calendar, her mother's obituary and even a message of thanks to the boy who asked her to dance when she was 15: ''If Kenneth should, by happy chance, read this book. . . .'' Mrs. Hobson has been a competent commercial writer, with the copywriter's sense of timing that produced ''Gentleman's Agreement'' at just the right moment. She can tell an anecdote. But she has not managed to extract any meaning from her life beyond her discovery, on the couch, that she has always been attracted to men who ultimately treat her badly, an insight that has been the apocalyptic revelation at the end of so many recent books that I should think by now any writer would blush to say it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NATIVITY SCENE BEGETS A CONSTITIUTIONAL DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/weekinreview/nativity-scene-begets-a-constitiutional-debate.html,"Among the items on the Reagan Administration's ''social issues'' agenda only one, the effort to promote religion in American life, has made headway at the Supreme Court. The Court has been cool to the Administration's views on civil rights and abortion, but more receptive to arguments for lowering the constitutional barriers between church and state. In decisions last term, it agreed with Government lawyers that neither Nebraska's salaried legislative chaplain nor Minnesota's tuition tax deductions, which benefit mainly parochial schools, violated the First Amendment's prohibition against the establishment of religion. Now the Administration has asked the Justices to take a giant step across the line dividing church and state and let Pawtucket, R. I., continue its 40-year-old practice of including a nativity scene in an official Christmas display. That the Justice Department decided to join a local dispute, which the High Court heard earlier this month and apparently hopes to decide before Christmas, is a measure of this Government's determination to restore a religious fiber to American life. Last year, the Administration pushed cases involving religious observance of a general nature; Nebraska's chaplain, for example, offered nondenominational prayers that avoided references to Christ. This time, the Administration is asking the Court to endorse the governmental display of a fundamental symbol of a particular religion, Christianity. In his argument, Solicitor General Rex E. Lee did not rely on the analysis put forward by Pawtucket's lawyer - that Christmas nowadays is a ''secular folk festival'' so removed from its religious roots as to barely raise a constitutional question. Rather, Mr. Lee told the Justices that Christmas is rooted in religion as ''a matter of undeniable historical fact,'' and that to read the Constitution as requiring the exclusion of that fact ''from our national consciousness is nothing less than intellectual and historical dishonesty.'' It would be, he said ''cultural censorship.'' (That view is not shared by the National Council of Churches, the one mainstream Christian organization to file a friend of the court brief. The council contended that government sponsorship ''degrades and secularizes a sacred symbol of Christianity.'') The Administration went to some length to put its position before the Court, since the rules require every ''friend of the court'' to identify its ''interest'' in a case and the Government's stake in Pawtucket's cr eche was not obvious. Thus, the Administration's brief opened with an essay about how the Government ''from the earliest days of the Republic to the present'' has felt free to ''recognize that religion is a part of our heritage and should continue to be an element in our public life and public occasions.'' The Three-Part Test The issue, then, goes beyond the content of a Christmas display. It is the Reagan challenge to the way the Supreme Court has analyzed the First Amendment's prohibition against the establishment of religion. Beginning with Lemon v. Kurtzman, a 1971 opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger striking down a state parochial aid plan, the Court has applied a three-part test to laws challenged under the establishment clause. A law will be upheld only if it: (1) reflects a clearly secular legislative purpose; (2) neither advances nor inhibits religion as its primary effect; and (3) avoids excessive governmental entanglement with religion. In the Pawtucket case, which was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, both the Federal District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that the cr eche lacked a secular purpose and so failed the test. On appeal, the Government is arguing that the test ''imparts a kind of artificial objectivity'' to establishment clause inquiries of this sort. Solicitor General Lee asked the Court to set aside the test in this case and take a fresh look at the cr eche as one of many symbols of a recognized national holiday. That approach may be welcomed by Justices who are restive with the three-part test: They applied it only half-heartedly in upholding Minnesota's tuition tax deduction, and not at all in upholding the Nebraska legislative chaplain. In that case, the Court ruled that since the same Congress that adopted the First Amendment also hired a chaplain, the Founding Fathers could not possibly have meant to prohibit legislative prayer. No such historical escape hatch is available this time, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor found when she pressed the city's lawyer, William F. McMahon, for evidence that official nativity scenes date back to the early days of the Republic. He could offer none. If a majority agrees the test has outlived its usefulness, the cr eche dispute gives the Court the chance to announce a new approach. It will not be the only chance. Alabama will soon appeal a Federal appeals court decision that struck down a state law permitting public school teachers to lead their classes in prayer. The law is obviously unconstitutional, as long as the Court adheres to its school prayer decisions of the early 1960's. The Solicitor General is now deciding whether the Reagan Administration should join Alabama's appeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BATTLE FOR 'BABY DOE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/25/nyregion/battle-for-baby-doe.html,"News Analysis Tomorrow the New York State Court of Appeals will consider a question that should be, at least on its surface, more the province of doctors than lawyers: the adequacy of the treatment being administered to a 2-week-old Long Island girl with an array of crippling birth defects. The case of ''Baby Jane Doe,'' as the unidentified child has been dubbed, goes far beyond the issue of proper treatment, however. Involved as well are questions of parental autonomy, the obligations of the state, the legal rights of handicapped infants and the value of even the most debilitated form of human life. The baby was born Oct. 11 with a variety of disorders, including spina bifida - a failure of the spinal column to close properly - and excess fluid in the brain. Without surgery, doctors say, she will die within two years; with it, she could survive into her 20's but would be severely retarded and bedridden. After talks with doctors and clergy, the baby's parents said they would not agree to any corrective operation. Last Friday an appellate court in Brooklyn upheld their decision, ruling that it was ''well within accepted medical standards.'' Few Cases Reach Courts With theologians, doctors and philosophers unable to agree on fundamental questions of the quality of life, it is not surprising that the legal rights of children with debilitating birth defects remain unsettled. Though such life-and-death decisions may be commonplace to doctors, few have reached the courts, and those that have often become moot before they are decided. This is a subject, however, in which personal predilection and passion seem to rule as much as precedent. Some legal scholars say with absolute conviction that even the most badly impaired children are entitled to the full panoply of constitutional rights. Others argue, with equal intensity, that the parents' fundamental rights to privacy should prevail. ''Where there is no consensus on whether, even after an operation, there is a life worth living, it's a problem for parents to resolve themselves,'' said Joseph Goldstein, a professor at the Yale Law School. ''We're safest, as individuals and as a society, if we let individuals rather than the state make these judgments.'' The conflicting rights of parents and child were alluded to by William E. Weber, the baby's court-appointed guardian, who will argue the case tomorrow before the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. Parents' Rights Called Limited ''Parents do have a constitutional right to familial privacy tending to the care and custody of their children,'' he wrote in court papers. ''But that right is not so broad that it gives them the freedom to bring about their children's death by deliberate medical neglect. Parents may not rely on the Constitution to inflict serious harm on their children.'' In upholding the rights of the parents of Baby Doe, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn cited the 1978 opinion in Matter of Hofbauer. In that case, the State Court of Appeals ruled that when parents elected to forgo conventional chemotherapy for their 8-year-old son who suffered from Hodgkin's disease, treating him with laetrile and a special diet instead, the courts would not interefere. Mr. Weber, Baby Doe's guardian, has disputed the applicability of the Hofbauer case, in part because Baby Doe's treatment, he claimed, ''amounted to changing bandages, cleansing the spinal sack and hoping for the worst - death.'' At the same time, he has argued that whatever her handicaps, the baby is protected by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the ''due process'' and ''equal protection'' of the law. Traditional Adversaries Join They are arguments often raised in civil-liberties cases, and, indeed, the right of the physically impaired is an issue that brings together such traditional adversaries as right-to-life advocates and some civil-libertarians. To some scholars, like Prof. Victor G. Rosenblum of Northwestern University Law School, the rights of deformed children are absolute and unwavering and require that all measures should be taken to save lives under all circumstances. ''I know of nothing in the law that authorizes a 'quality of life' minimum as a prerequisite for constitutional protection,'' he said. ''Our legal protections are tied to personhood, and unlike the abortion cases, there's no question when personhood begins.'' Professor Rosenblum, - an officer in Americans United for Life, an organization opposed to abortion - is among those seeking to convince the United States Supreme Court to overturn a decision issued last year by the Indiana Supreme Court. That case upheld the right of parents to withold corrective surgery, food or water from their infant son. The boy, who had both a malformed esophogus and Down's syndrome, eventually died. 'A Useful, Fulfilling Life' ''How is one to determine at birth whether or not you have a Helen Keller?'' Mr. Rosenblum said. Mr. Weber has taken a less-absolute position, conceding that in some cases ''life is so full of pain and suffering'' that continued life ''is not in a patient's interest.'' But he argues that Baby Doe could lead ''a useful, fulfilling life,'' and cites two cases to suggest that, at least in New York, the courts have accorded broad protections to those in equally difficult straits. In the first, the 1979 case of In re Cicero, Justice Martin B. Stecher of State Supreme Court in the Bronx overruled the parents' wish to ''let God decide'' the fate of their infant daughter, who also had spina bifida, and ordered corrective surgery. More recently, in a case called Matter of Storar, the State Court of Appeals ordered blood transfusions for a profoundly retarded 52-year- old man with terminal bladder cancer. ''A court should not allow an incompetent patient to bleed to death because someone, even someone as close as a parent or sibling, feels that this is best for one with an incurable disease,'' Judge Sol M.Wachtler wrote in the case. Could Recognize People Mr. Weber argues that while Baby Doe is likely to be both incontinent and unable to walk, she would not need to be institutionalized and could come to recognize friends and relatives. ''Baby Jane Doe has a prognosis equal to, if not greater than, John Storar,'' he said. The Storar decision, according to John A. Robertson, a professor at the University of Texas Law School, may be the best clue to how the Court of Appeals will handle the Baby Doe case. ''In light of the court's attitude toward the severely retarded adult, I would think that it would be very protective toward a defective newborn,'' said Professor Robertson, author of ''The Rights of the Critically Ill.'' ''In some ways,'' he added, ''an infant who hasn't had a chance to live yet has an even stronger claim.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
House Votes Curb on DrugsAnd Federal Aid to Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/28/us/house-votes-curb-on-drugsand-federal-aid-to-abortion.html,"The House, by voice vote, today passed and sent to the Senate an $11.9 billion appropriation bill to ''stem the tide'' of illegal drugs from abroad and restrict abortion coverage under Federal employee health plans. The legislation would cost $299.7 million more than the Reagan Administration requested to pay the bills for the fiscal year 1984 for the President's office, the Treasury Department, the Postal Service, the Customs Service and other agencies. The legislation was defeated June 8 after the House adopted an amendment to prohibit Federal employee health plans from financing abortions except when the mother's life is endangered. The chief floor managers from both parties, Representatives Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, and Clarence E. Miller, Republican of Ohio, appealed to colleagues to reverse the earlier vote. The measure still has the abortion language adopted June 8, a provision similar to the antiabortion restriction in the Medicaid program for low-income Americans. The antidrug drive would be bolstered by restoration of $52.7 million and 1,775 positions the Reagan Administration wants to cut from the Customs Service. Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said the customs employees would be used ''to stem the tide of drugs coming in our borders.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'NO NEED FOR FEMINISM IN THE TRUE CHURCH',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/opinion/l-no-need-for-feminism-in-the-true-church-260052.html,"To the Editor: Your Oct. 20 editorial on the National Council of Churches' effort to rewrite God's word in order to combat ''sexism in the Bible'' is a classic example of Paul's comment in Romans: ''Thinking themselves wise, they become fools.'' The Bible, unlike any other book, requires more than mere literacy or intellect to grasp its meaning. It is a book of revelation. Intellectual understanding is only the lowest rung of biblical knowledge. Required is spiritual discernment which, under God's new covenant, is offered to all but received only by those who, with repentant hearts, submit to the Lordship of Christ. No Christian can agree that the council's effort is ''welcome.'' Millions of churchgoers - including millions who claim to be born again - are products of a quasi-Christian religiosity and do not fit the biblical definition of Christians. But by their fruits we know Christians, clearly defined in Acts as disciples of Christ, devoted servants, whose ears have been placed on the doorposts and pierced by God's awl. The present wave of feminist worldliness in the church is type and shadow of Eve's rebellion, aided by spiritually immature males who have abdicated their God-given roles as rulers, husbands, stewards, managers and lovers (''as Christ loved the church''). There is no feminism in the true church, the body of Christ, because there is no need for it. Women press hard for ''rights'' and ''fulfillment'' because men refuse to shoulder their responsibilities as lovers, providers, companions, disciplinarians, law-abiders and spiritual fathers to their families. ''After all,'' our pastor said one day, ''what choice do millions of women have but to grab the reins dropped by renegade males too drugged by careers, voyeurism, Monday-night football and the spirit of 'macho' to lovingly but firmly manage their families?'' You are utterly wrong to think that God wants to tap ''the spirit of every potential member'' of His church. He clearly states He wants to break the will of every potential member so he or she might be released from bondage to the spirit of this world, to walk humbly and in obedience to every word of Scripture. God is into making disciples and into radically changing lives, not recruiting members for human institutions by using the latest psychosocial manipulations. The effort to ''modernize'' Scripture is simply the effort to reject it. Revelation of God's character (His father nature) is central to Christ's teachings and to true Christianity. The scuttling of God's self-characterization is in harmony with efforts to reject His word on marriage, fatherhood, motherhood, adultery, premarital sex, homosexuality, child training, abortion and countless other areas of life. All Scripture is inspired by God. The move to tamper with His word is not of Him. Women are wrong to seek fulfillment in rewriting the Bible to attain un-scriptural social goals. Their reason for being - and therefore their fulfillment - is Christ. COURT NEWTON JR.

WAS LIFE BETTER BEFORE MAO'S REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/books/was-life-better-before-mao-s-revolution.html,"BROKEN EARTH The Rural Chinese. By Steven W. Mosher.317 pp. New York: The Free Press/Macmillan. $17.95. IN a famous study of the Chinese economy, ''Land and Labor in China,'' published in 1932, R. H. Tawney likened the rural Chinese to a man standing up to his neck in water and leading a life so precarious ''that even a single ripple is sufficient to drown him.'' In recent years few foreigners have had Tawney's opportunity to observe rural China personally at any length. Steven W. Mosher, a Sinologist and anthropologist, fluent in two dialects of Chinese, is one of the rare ones. In ''Broken Earth,'' a tough-minded account of rural China, the result of more than a year of field research in southern Guangdong Province, Mr. Mosher portrays a peasantry hardly better off than that described by Tawney. Mr. Mosher's book belongs to a growing body of literature on contemporary China that, reversing favorable portrayals written in the early and mid- 1970's, places the People's Republic squarely in the 20th-century totalitarian mainstream. But, while others have stressed urban life, the havoc of such mass campaigns as the cultural revolution and the absence of political freedoms in Maoist and post-Maoist China, Mr. Mosher's emphasis is on the hardness and brutality of everyday life. In describing the countryside, he is more critical of the effects of the Communist revolution than other recent writers. He concludes that for the Chinese peasantry - at least the 400 million peasants in the southern part of the country where he did his studies - life was better during periods before the revolution of 1949 than after the country's new rulers began to overhaul age-old patterns of everyday life. That conclusion is striking if only because, as Mr. Mosher observes, it is ''the paramount myth of the Chinese revolution'' that Communist rule, whatever it has done in other areas of life, has produced great strides in the countryside where 80 percent of China's one billion people live. Mr. Mosher writes that well into his stay in China, he too believed in this ''paramount myth.'' On his second night in the village where he stayed, he was visited by Lao Baixing, an elderly village official, who enumerated the elements in the alleged transformation of rural life by the revolution: station, guaranteed rice rations, elimination of the exploiting landlord class, among other things. Toward the end of his time in China, after he had interviewed dozens of peasants and seen numerous villages and observed the life and work habits of the people, Mr. Mosher developed a more complex picture of the putatively scourge-ridden past, and he had an appreciation for the hardships of the present. The lives Richard Bernstein , the United Nations correspondent of The New York Times, is the author of ''From the Center of the Earth: The Search for Truth About China.'' of the peasants are more controlled by party leaders now than they were by the landholders in the past; goods are scarcer and more shoddy; locally grown products, such as silk, are taken away by the state to satisfy the current national plan. Mr. Mosher cites an article in China's official press reporting that only recently has per capita grain consumption equaled the levels of the years just after the revolution. In the end, Mr. Mosher's challenge to the conventional assumption that rural life in China has greatly improved since 1949 is not definitive; there is no systematic weighing of the factors that make up the quality of life. Nonetheless, Mr. Mosher provides a good deal of persuasive evidence that the vast Chinese peasantry has fared far worse than was commonly believed. Mr. Mosher's activities in China, and possibly the information he gathered there, have put him at the center of a controversy involving the Government in Peking and Americans responsible for academic exchanges with the People's Republic. Chinese officials, some time after Mr. Mosher left China in 1981, charged him with having committed various offenses during his stay in the country, including bribing local officials, dealing in contraband and acquiring secret data. Stanford University, where Mr. Mosher was a candidate for a Ph.D., launched its own investigation of the charges. The investigation resulted in a 47-page report that has not been made public, but Stanford did announce that Mr. Mosher had engaged in ''illegal and seriously unethical'' acts. The anthropology department at the university unanimously voted to terminate his candidacy for the Ph.D. and, when Mr. Mosher appealed that decision, it was upheld by a special three-member committee appointed by Stanford's president last spring to review the case. Since the records of the investigation have not been made public, some people still suspect that, whether Mr. Mosher violated the professional ethics of anthropology or not, part of his trouble sprang from the fact that he was simply a dogged and resourceful researcher who earned the animosity of the Chinese authorities by uncovering material they preferred to keep secret. After Mr. Mosher left China, he went to Taiwan for further academic research; there he published an article, complete with dramatic photographs, describing abuses in China's ambitious population control program, including the forced abortions of women in advanced stages of pregnancy. What he has to say about the birth control program in ''Broken Earth'' is indicated by the title of his chapter on it: ''Birth Control: A Grim Game of Numbers.'' Mr. Mosher describes China's Malthusian dilemma. In the Sandhead Production Brigade, where he lived, there had been a population increase of 130 percent in 27 years and the land under cultivation amounted to only one-sixth of an acre per person. Yet the population control program, as it was implemented there, seemed to contain many of the excesses and abuses of earlier mass campaigns in China. Zealous local leaders, eager to show success to their superiors, bludgeoned local resistance out of existence. Mr. Mosher describes a visit he made to an abortion clinic during one of the ''high tides,'' during which women who have become pregnant in defiance of state plans are encouraged to have abortions. The women in the clinic, Mr. Mosher says, were in ''physical and mental anguish.'' He reports on a meeting between pregnant women and party leaders who, cajoling and threatening, told the women that they really have no choice about having an abortion. THE Chinese countryside described by Mr. Mosher is dominated by surviving traditions - bride prices, rural superstitions and ancestor worship - along with the plain hardships of rural life. He recounts a typical day of a peasant woman, Gin Sau, describing in vivid detail how, particularly for women, collectivism has increased rather than decreased the amount of labor that needs to be performed. Gin Sau, who also takes part in collective labor, has to run out to forage for grass for fuel while her husband takes a noonday nap. She gathers mulberry leaves to feed the collective's silkworms; she washes, sews and mends the family's clothes, and she cooks three meals a day in a convenience-free econ omy where, as Mr. Mosher puts it, ''all food preparation starts from a gastronomical ground zero.'' She bathes the children, cares for the family's private chickens and hauls water from the village well - all in a traditional rural society that, contrary to China's propaganda claims about equality for women, really has little esteem for what it clearly regards as the second sex. One of the most dramatic moments in this account of rural life comes when Mr. Mosher describes a husband brutally beating his wife, while villagers looked on, for having quarreled with his mother. ''When it was over, not a single person moved to console the woman,'' Mr. Mosher writes. ''She was left sobbing alone as they murmured approval of the man's actions.'' THESE penetrating glimpses into real life are among the most vivid in the literature on contemporary China. Yet Mr. Mosher's account, valuable as it is, is marred by a relative scarcity of concrete description and a surplus of generality. It is not that his generalities are erroneous; Mr. Mosher is well informed about such subjects as the Chinese bureaucracy, corruption and the social costs of mass campaigns. But these matters have been well covered in other recent books and they divert our attention from what he is trying to write about. And Mr. Mosher surprisingly seems to miss numerous opportunities to bring the rural Chinese to life for his readers. There is not even a good physical description of the village where he lived. His own life as a foreigner in China is mentioned only tangentially. Characters from the village appear briefly and then pass from sight so that no rural personalities take on shape or substance. Mr. Mosher tells us of the persistence of tradition, but, except for one good account of a reburial ceremony in which the bones of a departed ancestor are disinterred and placed in an urn, very little of this tradition materializes. Indeed, he whets the appetite for sights, sounds, smells and anecdotes but he does not often satisfy it. At the end of the book, Mr. Mosher says that, as he was concluding his stay in China, the village official, Lao Baixing, who had proclaimed to Mr. Mosher early in his stay the progress made under the Communists in China's countryside, returned to visit him. This time, Lao Baixing (which is a Chinese term for the common people and thus seems to be a pseudonym) admitted he had been instructed to make that first visit. Now he tells Mr. Mosher the truth. Life in the old days really wasn't bad compared to the present when there are shortages of everything and the party cadres have more arbitrary power than the old landlords used to. Perhaps Lao Baixing exaggerates. Yet, the story illustrates just how elusive the truth is; like rice, it is rationed carefully by the political authorities. Mr. Mosher found out a good deal about the real situation, and his book considerably advances our understanding of what China's 34 years of revolution have wrought in the country's vast hinterland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A BITTER PEACE LIFE IN VIETNAM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/magazine/a-bitter-peace-life-in-vietnam.html,"Craig R. Whitney, an assistant managing editor of The New York Times, was a foreign correspondent from 1971 to 1980, stationed in Saigon, Bonn and Moscow. He was in Vietnam from 1971 to 1973. S OUR THAI AIRWAYS jet came in for a landing at Hanoi, skimming bomb craters that had become circular rice paddies, I felt again the cold fear that had been a fairly constant companion during my two years as a war correspondent in Vietnam. Now, it was not so much fear of danger as fear of the unknown, of what I might learn about the fate of the people since American troops left after the defeat of South Vietnam almost 10 years ago and the country was reunified under Communist rule. This was my first trip to Hanoi, and I had no idea how I would be received. My discomfort rose at the airport's passport-control booth, where uniformed guards eyed my American passport with what seemed to be special suspicion and hostility. But I was wrong. I was just another foreigner. And, as I was vividly reminded a few days later during a tour of the military museum in Hanoi, the Vietnamese are wary of foreigners. The museum's display begins with ancient Vietnamese insurrections against China - the Trung sisters' rebellion in the first century A.D. is not even the earliest - and continues through several rooms filled with pictures of French colonizers and the battles that defeated them in 1954, through the struggles with Ngo Dinh Diem and Lyndon Johnson and a succession of American generals in charge of the American war effort, up to one of the museum's most popular photos - a massive American pilot being taken prisoner by a tiny Vietnamese militiawoman. But the museum display does not end with the diorama showing the evacuation of the American Embassy on the last day of April 1975. An entire hall is devoted to the attacks by Pol Pot's forces along the Cambodian border with Vietnam in late l978, the subsequent invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam that resulted in the overthrow of Pol Pot, followed by the invasion of Vietnam by the Chinese in 1979, which was intended to punish the Vietnamese for their invasion of Cambodia. Here was graphic evidence that the American war, the defeat we are now finally examining in an outpouring of books and television documentaries, re-experiencing in movies, novels and memoirs, is an interlude in Vietnamese history, an epic, tragic interlude that cost more than a million Vietnamese lives and 58,000 American ones, but an interlude nonetheless. The Vietnam War is over for us; it continues, for the Vietnamese, with China. My fear of being singled out was thus unfounded, and I encountered not hostility but wary curiosity in Hanoi as well as in the cities and battlefields I had lived in and covered during the war - Quang Tri, Hue, Dong Ha, Da Nang, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City). What I found was a country with all the trappings and restrictive laws of a Communist police state, but without its ruthless efficiency. Vietnam is a backward, contradictory, impoverished country that is 30 years behind the economic boom and the traffic jams of Hong Kong and Bangkok, exhausted not so much by the war as by the problems caused by peace. Its leaders seem overwhelmed by problems of feeding 54 million people without the war's great infusions of foreign aid and sup Page 26 plies; problems of developing a peacetime economy when the per capita income is only $150 a year; problems of dealing with social and political gaps that had grown up between North and South during more than 20 years of partition, from 1954 to 1976; problems of continuing dependence on foreigners - now the Russians. According to Western diplomats in Hanoi, there are about 6,000 Russians scattered around the country, supervising projects and advising on an estimated $1 billion in aid. I was often mistaken for a Russian in the north, where this usually meant a reserved smile and a salutation; this mistake was made less often in the south, where being misidentified as a Russian sometimes meant being spat upon. Whatever nationality I was taken for, however, I was officially off-limits for the Vietnamese. The people are forbidden to talk to any foreigner, and so I could not visit personal friends, as I had hoped to do - indeed, as I had hoped beyond all else to do when I first applied to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry to make the trip in April. When my visa was finally granted, toward the end of August, it was understood that I would put myself in the hands of the Communist authorities, who would provide drivers and a translator for my two-week stay. I could ask to see war veterans, village chiefs, hospitals, schools, churches and temples. I could ask to see ordinary people, scholars and high-ranking officials: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, the Defense Minister, Van Tien Dung; of these, only Mr. Thach acceded to my wish, promising to see me in New York when he came for the United Nations General Assembly. I could ask how the people who had suffered from the American bombing felt about us now; I could ask people who had been on the losing side how they were being treated by the Communists now and hope to know whether they were telling me the truth. I Page 27 could ask to visit one of the ''re-education camps,'' where some 10,000 former South Vietnamese officials are still held (a request not granted) and one of the new economic zones created to provide jobs in the countryside. And I could ask to talk to people who were trying to leave the country in order to find out why so many had already left or wanted to. I could try, in other words, to answer those questions which had gnawed at me since Vietnam was lost to us in 1975: to see what had become of the country and the people I had come to know so well but lost touch with, as all Americans had. HE ROAD TO HANOI FROM THE AIRport crosses the Red River on what the French called the Paul Doumer Bridge - a bottleneck rail and road span whose black iron girders, cast in Paris between 1899 and 1902, kept supplies coming in from China through all the years of the war despite countless American bomb attacks. The bridge became a kind of monument to Vietnamese persistence against all odds. It is now so overwhelmed by traffic that it lists to one side, and trucks are permitted to use it only at night, when it is less traveled. The rest of Hanoi looks as listless as the bridge, as if the city had been in a time capsule since the French left in 1954 - a sleepy, backward colonial town of low yellow stucco buildings; narrow streets overarched by the lacy green leaves of tamarind trees. Water buffaloes plod slowly along the streets, pulling carts of night soil through silent crowds of cyclists. Only a few automobiles - Russian Volgas and Zhigulis - honk their way through the bicycles. The bar at the Thong Nhat hotel, frequented mainly by foreigners, stocks Vietnamese vodka, apparently for the benefit of the Russian diplomats and advisers, who appear on the streets mostly on Sundays, looking flushed and uncomfortable in synthetic clothes not designed for the summer heat and humidity. I got occasional hints of uneasiness about these benefactors from the Vietnamese I talked to. ''Some people think the longer we receive aid from the Soviet Union, the more difficult it will be to preserve our independence,'' said Do-Xuan Oanh, a songwriter in his 50's, who said he learned English by listening to the Voice of America and now heads the Vietnamese-American Friendship Society, an organization whose sole function is to receive the few Americans who turn up in Hanoi. A high-ranking official, who said he could speak more freely if I agreed not to use his name, argued that Vietnam had nowhere else to turn except to the Russians for its most basic needs, but he said the leaders would not refuse an opening from a Western country if one materialized. He said that up to now Vietnam had not granted the Soviet Union any permanent military bases on its territory, but, he added, ''if a Soviet base constituted a necessity for our independence, then we would not refuse.'' The Soviets do use the port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay to stock and fuel their Far Eastern Fleet. Though three years of military service is compulsory for all Vietnamese men from age 18 to 35, uniforms do not proliferate in the streets of Hanoi today. The army probably has its hands full with several hundred thousand troops fending off attacks from the remaining Pol Pot forces in Cambodia and occasionally exchanging fire with the Chinese along the northern border. A few steps from the Government-run Thong Nhat hotel, where the amenities in my dingy room included a small Russian air-conditioner and a Chinese thermos bottle, was the state bank of Vietnam. The foreign-exchange department was in an annex, where I was the only customer. While I waited for my $300 to be converted into dong, I counted 18 people involved in the transaction, writing down serial numbers, filling out forms, examining my passport and counting and recounting both the dollars and the dong. The official conversion rate was 9.954 dong to the dollar. Outside, on the black market that flourishes in cafes and small shops, the dollar brings 16 times as much. The Government obliquely recognizes that the currency is overvalued: Even the hotels it runs convert dong at a rate five or six times the bank's. In the shops, quite unlike the Soviet Union, where there are no private stores anymore, people were selling jewelry, Ming and Ching treasures sold off by ethnic Chinese and others who fled the country during the worst years of economic deprivation in 1978 and 1979, clothing, cigarettes and lottery tickets for private profit. There were a few cafes where young people gathered to drink coffee, talk and listen to Western rock music. There didn't seem to be much else to do; the movie theaters advertised old films from Rumania and the Soviet Union, but were as dark as the streets much of the time because of power cuts. Some people seemed to be living on the sidewalks, begging for food, as streams of pedestrians dressed in drab cotton pants and jackets passed by. I wondered how this could be the same country that had sent, with iron discipline, hundreds of thousands of its sons and daughters in their rubber sandals down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to their deaths. And, in a sense it wasn't. Ho had inspired the people to those sacrifices while he lived, but now all that remained of that inspiration were slogans on banners and posters. The objective was to reunite the country. With that accomplished, Ho's successors seem to be unable to ignite enthusiasm for any other goal. They were faced immediately with the problem of feeding the country, and they failed. After a series of droughts and typhoons in the late l970's, and after the failure of a drive to collectivize the rice farmers of the Mekong Delta, the country came close to famine in 1978 and 1979. At the end of that year, socialism had been undone to the extent of encouraging small private-sector businesses and letting peasants grow crops for their own use and sale, even on Government-owned land, an accommodation unthinkable in the Soviet Union. Thanks to this concession to economic reality, last year the country was able to do without imported rice for the first time since the war ended. ''We can feed ourselves now, but at a level you in the West would consider only the bare minimum for subsistence,'' the high-ranking official told me. ''We hope that in 15 years, we may be able to reach a minimally adequate level.'' Because of the shortage, rice and other foods are rationed, and, this being a Marxist-Leninist state, apportioned according to need as defined by the Communist authorities. Laborers in the fields or in the coal mines of northern Vietnam get rice rations of 26 kilograms a month; office workers in the Government bureaucracies in Hanoi get 12 kilograms. The mandates of the class struggle also determine who gets an education: If your grandfather was a mandarin or an official of the French colonial administration, you don't get ahead. One young man, a 24-year-old Vietnam 1st JUMP Page 54 & 56 said the Government wouldn't let him study foreign languages (apparently a sought-after field because it provides an opportunity to go abroad, if only to other Communist countries), taught himself rudimentary French and, with it, pleaded with me to take a letter out to an uncle he thought was living in the United States. ''I am always hungry,'' he said. The Government gives students an allowance of 36 dong a month. The iced coffee we drank cost 25; a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pork costs 110. The average civil servant, I was told, makes 200 dong a month. Le Mai, a Foreign Ministry official, warned me that I would not find much in the stores for people to buy, even if they had money. ''You will see we are selling goods of very poor quality, but we are trying to produce all basic commodities by ourselves, and you have to start somewhere,'' he said. The main department store in Hanoi offered a pathetic collection of sprockets, chains, nuts and bolts for bicycles. A few garishly colored plastic sandals were displayed on unfinished wooden shelves; they cost 180 dong, or nearly $20. Tin cooking pots cost 350 dong, more than a month's salary. Do-Xuan Oanh told me that, because of the continuing pressure from the Chinese, ''it may take a century for us to restore our economy. I do not share the view that life is only meaningful if it is accompanied by pain and hardship.'' He made it sound like a dissenting view. Though I was surprised by how little evidence of damage there was from the American bombing in the city of Hanoi itself, I asked to meet Vietnamese who had been through the Christmas 1972 bombing, the heaviest of the war, which President Nixon had ordered to force Hanoi to accept the terms of a cease- fire. I was taken to Kham Thien Street, close to the railroad station, and all but destroyed in a B-52 raid apparently targeted on the station at 10:30 the night of Dec. 26. The raid killed 283 people and wounded 266. There is a monument to the victims of the Christmas bombing on the site of a ruined house. A statue of a woman holding a dead child, it bears the inscription, ''Indignation at the American aggressors.'' Page 56 Nguyen Van The, a 46-year-old veteran of the North Vietnamese campaigns around Quang Tri in the South in 1972, was now the Communist Party ward committee chairman for Kham Thien. He told me how the neighborhood had been rebuilt, despite the unexploded bombs still beneath the rubble. He took me to meet Nguyen Thi Mao, widow of a militiaman she said was killed by the American bombs. She had taken her three children out of the city to safety. Now tears came to her eyes as she talked, but, she said, ''the war is receding into the past. Because my husband was a war hero, the Government gave me food. I could feed my children and they got a good education.'' As we talked on a low wooden bench behind the bright cotton shirts and dresses she sold to help make a living, I asked her how she felt about having an American visit her in her home. ''You look very kind,'' she said. ''I was once very angry at the Americans, but now I hope they do not launch any more wars against us.'' When my Foreign Ministry interpreter and I flew from Hanoi to Da Nang, in what had been South Vietnam, it was almost like crossing into a foreign country, with border guards examining my passport and the interpreter's identity papers at both airports. We were to go in a Volga sedan up the coast to Hue and stay overnight before continuing north the next morning. I wanted to go back to Quang Tri City, which I had last seen on the day of the cease-fire of Jan. 28, 1973. Then, it was a ruined expanse of bomb craters, shattered bricks and pieces of metal, and dead bodies. Ten years later, riding up the beautiful coastal highway from Da Nang, I wondered what, if anything, would be left of the most devastated city in the south. On the surface, the reconstruction and rehabilitation in the port city of Da Nang and in the fishing hamlets along the way to the former Imperial capital at Hue had been impressive. Peasants were planting and harvesting rice in fields irrigated by newly built canals. The narrow-gauge railroad had been rebuilt and was now transporting passengers and freight behind Czech-built diesel locomotives, a sight I had never seen during the war. New homes, even new Buddhist temples, had been built along the road. Only stones were left where American bases had stood - Camp Eagle, home of the 101st Airborne Division; the military airfield at Phu Bai, just south of Hue; the former Marine and Army base outside Quang Tri. We turned down a dirt road that led to Quang Tri City. Somehow, that bleak moonscape of rubble had been resettled and rebuilt with cement and brick houses. A theater was under construction as well as a district bank. Only a small area was empty, where there were still too many unexploded bombs in the ground to make habitation possible, the officials said. It was hardly grand, but it was life in a place from which I thought human beings had been driven forever. After the decay and paralysis of Hanoi, this reconstruction was amazing. We crossed a new bridge to the other side of the river, where I had watched the North Vietnamese raise their flags on the cease-fire day a decade ago, and continued north to the village of Dong Ha. My first visit to Dong Ha was in 1968. I was in the Navy, writing press releases about coastal bombardment by the ships of the Seventh Fleet, then including the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, whose 16-inch guns fired 2,700-pound projectiles. The Marine base I had visited in my Navy days was gone, but there was a brand-new railroad depot and a comfortable Government guest house, where I was received by Duong Tu Anh, like me, a 40-year-old veteran of the war. Mr. Anh remembered the Seventh Fleet with horror. ''I saw that bombardment with my own eyes,'' he said, ''and that was the worst year.'' I decided to keep quiet. After the Americans were gone, the Vietnam 2nd Jump North Vietnamese swept south and seized Dong Ha in 1972, and they held it despite attacks from B-52's at least as severe as those at Quang Tri. ''The South Vietnamese generals said the land was 200 percent destroyed,'' Mr. Anh said, ''on top and underground.'' Mr. Anh said that more than 2,000 people had been injured or killed by buried bombs in his district since 1975. For all of the surrounding province, which has a population of 1.8 million, there had been 5,000 such casualties, according to the authorities. I was later taken to a pepper farm established in the mountains to the west of Dong Ha, on the site of an American artillery position known as Hill 241. It was a collective, like most of the rice and vegetable farms set up in central Vietnam since reunification; the people here were less resistant to the idea of collectivization than the farmers farther south in the Mekong Delta, where even today only 20 percent belong to collectives, according to officials in Hanoi. On this pepper farm, one woman carrying fertilizer to the plants asked my interpreter where I came from and laughed when she found out. ''VC!'' she exclaimed, pointing to herself. Other members of the collective were former South Vietnamese Army soldiers. The enterprise sells peppercorns to a state-owned export firm to earn foreign currency. The vice director of the farm showed me around and, in response to my question, said, yes, someone had recently been killed by a mine in the ground - the 4-year-old son of the chairman, who, on the way to a swimming hole, had tripped over a stone and detonated an antipersonnel mine. And there is more death in the ground. Defoliants, including Agent Orange, whose contaminants include dioxin, which is dangerous even in trace amounts, were sprayed over the entire country from 1962 to 1971. According to Pentagon figures, the total amount of dioxin dumped on Vietnam may have been at least 375 pounds. An international conference in Ho Chi Minh City last January, which included Western doctors, agreed on this figure despite some feeling among the Vietnamese that it should have been much higher. The A Luoi Valley, which begins at Dong Ha and extends into the mountain ranges to the southwest, was reduced from triple-canopy jungle to grassland by the spraying. It is one of the sites where the Vietnamese suspect dioxin and other chemical poisons to be the cause of an increase in birth deformities in children of people exposed to the chemicals. In one sprayed village in the Mekong Delta, Vietnamese researchers have determined that, among exposed subjects, the number of pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortions was 47.03 percent of the total. ''There are many deformed children here,'' Mr. Anh said, ''but I cannot say how many.'' Returning to Hue that afternoon, I talked to Nguyen Van Luong, the highest official of Binh Tri Thien province and one of the rare Southern guerrillas in a position of authority I was to meet during my brief stay; most of the others were North Vietnamese. He had been the chairman of the Vietcong organization in the Dong Ha district in the early 1960's. ''During the war,'' he said, ''I took the name Le Viet Huong. I understand the Americans promised the people of Dong Ha a five-million-piaster reward for my head when I was there. I lived underground, in a shelter. Sometimes I would hear noises above during the day. And at night, when I came out, I would ask my friends who had been up there. 'Green Berets,' they said. They used long sticks to probe the shelter, but they never found me.'' (The Phoenix program, run under American auspices during the war, specifically targeted Vietcong leaders for assassination.) Luong waxed nostalgic about the war years, though he was wounded three times: ''When I was in the jungle, I used to go fishing, and we'd have picnics. I had all my belongings in a backpack. I could go anywhere. When the Americans launched sweeps to find us, we'd just withdraw and return after they'd gone. ''The Americans who were against the war in Vietnam share in our victory,'' he went on. ''We have suffered the worst war in modern history, from 1941 to 1975. Now we are at peace, despite the war on our northern border with China. Let the Americans know: We defeated the Mongols. We defeated the French. We defeated the Chinese reactionaries, supported by the Americans. But we know how to distinguish between the Chinese people and the Chinese leaders, between the American people and the American authorities.'' As we drove back to Da Nang, I was struck by how quiet the countryside was now. There was not much traffic, and the pavement was being used by the local farmers to dry manioc and cassava and even to thresh rice. Military patrols controlled the entrances to the Hai Van pass, apparently to guard against an invasion from the sea by the Chinese, who hold the Paracel Islands offshore. In Da Nang itself, the air bases formerly used by the Americans are now used by the Vietnamese Air Force. I saw a battery of surface-to- air missiles in an emplacement near the base I had remembered as Marble Mountain. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told me later that they were there primarily to repel any possible Chinese air attack. Three Communist journalists I was taken to meet in Da Nang told me there were 110,000 former South Vietnamese soldiers and their families living among them - like equals, they claimed; no grudges held, no scores settled, no second-class status. On my last day in Da Nang, one of my escorts took me aside and revealed that he had been in the South Vietnamese Army, and that he would leave the country and move to the United States if he could. His background limited him to a low-paying job here and would as long as he lived. ''Not enough to eat here,'' he said. We flew to Ho Chi Minh City - Saigon - on a Soviet-built Antonov turboprop plane. If Hanoi had been untouched for 30 or 40 years, Ho Chi Minh City looked precisely the way it had in 1973, when I was last there, except that the streets were far less congested. The Majestic Hotel on the riverfront had the same fly- specked 1950's-vintage Pan American World Airways pictures on its walls, though the hotel was now called the Cuu Long and was state owned. Many of the restaurants I had remembered from the past were still functioning. Givral's, the French patisserie, was still baking croissants. The bars that had lined the downtown streets when the Americans were there had been shut or converted into antique shops. On Dong Khoi (General Uprising) Street (Tu Do to the Americans, Rue Catinat to the French), beggar urchins were selling peanuts and yelling, ''Hey, you!'' just as they used to when the Americans were there. But now these were not Vietnamese beggars. I saw with stunned sorrow that many of them had strikingly American faces - the young Amerasians whose situation in the country is so desperate. I was surprised in Ho Chi Minh City, as I had been in Hanoi, by what the authorities allowed to go on under their noses. The first few times I left the hotel alone and tried to make my way up the street, I was attacked by money changers offering 170, 180 dong to the dollar, about 20 times the official rate, and the Amerasian children followed me all the way to the cathedral, asking for handouts. Other days, the sidewalk was completely clear, the street people eyeing me nervously from across the road, apparently after a police sweep; a few hours later, the parasites and black marketeers were back at their usual positions. Only once was I made aware of being followed by a plainclothes policeman. He gave a dirty look to a small Amerasian boy who had been pestering me to buy him a shirt; the kid then whispered to me, ''C.I.D.,'' the American G.I.'s code for Military Police narcotics detectives. I felt, and was warned, that the only possible purpose he could have in following me was to report on any Vietnamese I spoke with. Vietnam 3rd JUMP I tried to challenge this prohibition twice. The first man I visited, a person with relatives in the United States who had applied for permission to leave Vietnam to join them, welcomed me to his house in a rainstorm, but nervously looked out the door and after 10 minutes asked me to please leave before the police came. Apparently he feared a search and interrogation about my presence. I went next door to a restaurant, and two plainclothes agents were pointed out to me. When I left, at the nervous urging of the restaurant owner, they did not follow me and I assumed my host was getting the questioning he feared. He wrote later to his family through the censored mail that he was grateful for my visit. The second time, visiting a widow whose husband had been the night watchman in The Times's office, my presence caused such a sensation among the hordes of excited children in the neighborhood that I left her after only a few minutes, hoping to avoid the arrival of the police. She, too, hoped somehow to emigrate to the United States. Ho Chi Minh City, I felt at moments like this, was still an occupied city, occupied by the Communist Northerners who run the country and still don't trust the Southern Vietnamese for collaborating with us. But, according to Nguyen Co Thach, the Foreign Minister, ''there was no bloodbath. We had 1.5 million people in re-education camps, and 10,000 of them are still there now. But not one of them was killed in capital punishment. That's no good.'' Perhaps he and Pham Van Dong and Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander who won the war, and the others had seen enough blood and death to reject the idea of a purge. Stalin would have known how to re-educate these people, and no one would ever have come back. He would have known how to stop the black market and how to get the jobless off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, too. Pol Pot, in Cambodia, and not Ho Chi Minh's successors in Vietnam, had turned out to be the last true Stalinist in Asia, contrary to all American expectations during the war. True, the bloodbath never came. But another kind of death - of any hope of a decent life here under the new regime - does drive many of the Vietnamese to try to leave. When or whether those who apply will get exit visas is hard to tell. Through the Orderly Departure Program, set up under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1979, Vietnamese who can get permission from their Government to leave, and from some other country to let them in, are allowed to leave. Mr. Tuyen told me that so far the Vietnamese had granted 18,000 exit visas to people wanting to go to the United States under the program, but up to the time I talked to him in September, only 12,200, according to American officials, had been given permission to enter the country. Mr. Tuyen acknowledged that his office had received 32,500 applications from Ho Chi Minh City alone - equal to the total number of people who have been allowed out under the program since it began. There has been a gradual and steady decline in illegal departures, which have totaled about one million since 1975, apparently because refugees have been refused entry in many places. For example, ''boat people'' arriving in Hong Kong now must choose between moving on to another port or spending the rest of their lives in a closed refugee camp. The Communists explain that these people want to leave because they grew accustomed to artificially high living standards during the American occupation. But I suspect the real reason is that in Vietnam they simply have no future. Take the case of a young man who had been studying medicine in Saigon when he was drafted into the South Vietnamese Army in the early 1970's. After the defeat, he was no longer eligible to continue his medical studies, because he had been drafted into the wrong army. His mother was killed in the war with the French in 195l; his father was killed in fighting with the United States Marines in 1967; but for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he was now consigned to a life as a tour-bus driver at 130 dong a month. Ly Cong Chanh, a former official of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who is now vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, told me that there were still more than 200,000 people without jobs. I met one foreign resident of the city who thought the real figure was much higher, as much as 60 percent of the work force. Mr. Chanh sounded resigned. ''More than 700,000 people left the city for new economic zones, or for their native villages, after liberation,'' he said, ''but about 10,000 of them couldn't survive in the zones and came back. We tell them that if they stay here, they'll get no house and no job, but we don't move them out to the countryside by force. If we did, they'd just come back again. It's no use,'' he said. I asked to see one of the new economic zones and was taken to a sugarcane farm called Nhi Xuan not far from Ho Chi Minh City in what used to be an artillery free- fire zone during the war. It was obviously meant to be a showcase; the guest book showed a parade of foreign dignitaries, including a number of predictably enthusiastic Russians. Still, it was very poor: a line of tin-roofed wooden shacks along an irrigation canal, packed earth floors, no electricity or potable water except rainwater from earthenware cisterns. The people grew their own food, and collected rations - a pound of meat and a pound of fish per month, per family; some people raised chickens or geese. This was a model zone built by ''youth volunteers,'' who dug the canals, turned the sod and built the houses for the refugees who came later. I gathered from various conversations that many of these volunteers were renegades or former soldiers or drug addicts given a chance to atone for their misdeeds and find a better life after two or three years of hard work. The families who came to live and work on the farm, I was told, got their houses free and an allowance of 20,000 dong to get started. Mr. Chanh, talking to me later in the ornate 19th-century city hall in Ho Chi Minh City, told me the authorities hoped gradually to solve the problem of unemployment there by putting people to work on the few nearby industrial development projects - a rubber plantation, a hydroelectric dam, the oil exploration project being worked on with Russian help at the former beach resort of Vung Tau. But for the most part, the economy of Ho Chi Minh City is still based on small- scale trading and commerce, a service economy built up during the boom years whe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

500,000 G.I.'s were there - 200,000 households in Saigon still earn their living this way today, according to official Vietnamese statistics. ''We're trying to reduce them little by little and transform them from trading to production,'' Mr. Chanh said. ''We have to do this step by step.'' Fits and starts might be a more accurate description of Vietnamese economic policy since 1975. At first, pledging a gradual transition to socialism, the new Communist rulers left the farmers and merchants of the South alone. Then, in March 1978, the bigger trading firms, many owned by Chinese businessmen from Cholon, were closed and nationalized. The course was partly reversed again in late 1979 to avert a complete economic collapse. The latest measures, instituted last May, penalize small businesses with heavy taxes. ''We have had a lot of experience in war,'' Mr. Chanh said, ''but not in administering the affairs of a big city like this. We have made many mistakes. I am 59, and Mai Chi Tho, the chairman of the city committee, is 60. We have to train our successors, so they won't make the mistakes we made.'' The mistakes have alienated many South Vietnamese who welcomed the Communist victory in 1975. A few, like Ngo Ba Thanh, a professor educated in Paris and New York who spent years in jail during the rule of President Nguyen Van Thieu, try to bridge the gaps in understanding. ''Most of the mistakes that have been made are the result of trying to move too fast,'' she said, speaking in a rush of fluent English. ''And there are great differences between the North and the South. I tell the people in the party that the revolution would not have been won with the party alone. The people played a great role and must be allowed to continue to play a great role. The party authorities sometimes claim that they can do anything they want, even if it violates the laws on the books, because in our system the party plays the leading role. But it's more complicated than that.'' ''Pham Van Dong told me that I had to be very patient,'' she said. ''He pointed out to me this Cabinet minister who was a rice farmer 40 years ago, and that one who had been illiterate, and said I should give these people a chance, should be tolerant of their mistakes.'' She also said she did not agree with many of her friends in the South who complained about not having a big enough role in the Government. ''We in the South have lots of experience in overthrowing governments,'' she said with a laugh, ''not in making them run better.'' Other people in the South Vietnamese educated class aren't as optimistic as Mrs. Thanh, or as well treated, and many who hated the Thieu regime now say they were wrong to think that nothing could be worse than the corruption and repression of that period. ''The Thieu Government collapsed because its leaders were unworthy of the name,'' a former student told me. ''But now many people who were glad to see it go feel that the new Government isn't so gay, either. They've lost their illusions. They don't like having to apply to the ward committee and pay a bribe even to get permission to go visit their relatives in the Mekong Delta for a week. But they still delude themselves. A lot of them talk about how the Americans are going to land with helicopters and sweep the Communists away. The Americans - imagine!'' I asked if people blamed the United States for the defeat - as some Americans blame themselves for not providing Thieu with enough military aid to fight off the Communist advances. ''I don't blame the Americans at all,'' he said. ''They gave plenty of money and help, and it wasn't their fault that our generals and leaders couldn't put it to proper use. It is our country. It was ours to defend - we should have defended it ourselves.'' That is precisely why the Communists won, I said - they really believed it. He shrugged. ''It's true,'' he said. Ho Chi Minh's saying, ''There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom,'' now stands above nearly every door in Vietnam. Many people in the South put it there in the last days of April 1975, hoping to show the Communists their hearts were in the right place. Even with all the help they have from the Russians, I concluded, the Vietnamese have independence, but freedom, no, not now. Many of the Communist war veterans I had met in my two-week trip had emotionally expressed their wishes for peace, for their children, my children, all our children together. We were veterans of the same war, and we felt, strange as it may seem, a sense of shared responsibility for what we had done to each other. Perhaps, eventually, passions will cool and we will, like the French before us, extend the hand of aid and conciliation to this fiercely independent, xenophobic people. The only flight out of Saigon to the West is an Air France jumbo jet that arrives practically empty from Paris via Bangkok every Thursday and goes back full of refugees. For the first time in my experience in Communist countries, my Vietnamese hosts let me take pictures in the airport as I interviewed those who were leaving. Finally, when the shuttle bus pulled out, their relatives shrieked their names desperately from the observation platform. There was nervous tension among these people as we went through yet another ticket check on the gangway; they would not believe they were really leaving until the plane started rolling down the runway. But as the doors were sealed and the engines began turning, I looked back into the cabin and saw that it would be impossible to continue interviewing them. Their native land was rushing past the windows, and tears were streaming down their faces," and so there was no need to ask any more questions.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/31/opinion/no-headline-008452.html,"The Real Shame in Foreign Aid Something remarkable is going on in Washington. Congress will probably finish 12 of its 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1984 before this year's session ends. Compare that with the customary budget logjams, which in the last two years required dumping most funding into one big ''continuing resolution'' so the members could go home. But if they can pass 12 bills this year, why not 13? Because the 13th is foreign aid. And thereby hangs a disgraceful tale. In four of the last five years, one or both houses have avoided putting the aid programs to a separate vote. Aid is unpopular and burying it in a continuing resolution provides cover for the supporters. Little noticed, the essential work on aid is still being done by Senate and House committees. The effect this year will be a package of some $14 billion in grants and loans - about a third of it being economic and military aid for Egypt and Israel. But the total is no triumph. It's less than last year, and has been ever less each year. But $14 billion is a lot better than nothing, which might be the result of an open vote by the full Congress. What's happened to America? Where is the spirit of enlightened self-interest found in the Marshall Plan? A survey by the Chicago Council on For- eign Relations last year found that the public's desire to reduce foreign aid outranked the fear of nuclear war. The broad coalition that recognized the importance of aid is no more. Clashing factions still struggle over how to divide the aid or whether to support abortion for population control plans. But all the while, total assistance is reduced. Why? One reason is the difficulty of defining its benefits. Literacy has been raised dramatically, and infant mortality reduced, but few Americans are aware of it. The slow development of India's economy is far less obvious than Europe's dramatic recovery after World War II. Another reason is that more and more third- world countries have become competitors of American industry. Finally, it's hard to support aid for suffering foreigners when aid for suffering Americans is being cut. An advisory commission chaired by Frank Carlucci, the former Deputy Defense Secretary, is about to report on the inadequacy of this country's aid effort. Its steady erosion flies in the face of the world leadership role that conservatives and liberals alike would have America play. That's the real shame in American foreign aid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POPE TELLS U.S. BISHOPS: FIGHT DISSENT ON SEXUALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/31/world/pope-tells-us-bishops-fight-dissent-on-sexuality.html,"Pope John Paul II has been talking to a steady stream of Roman Catholic bishops from the United States since late summer, and his principal message has been unmistakable: The bishops must more effectively proclaim church teachings on sexuality that American Catholics have increasingly rejected. The bishops, paying their periodic calls at the Vatican, have met with the Pope in groups, over meals in the papal apartments and in private audiences. Much of what they have heard from John Paul is about instilling greater loyalty to Catholic moral doctrine. While some bishops welcomed the reminder, others are chafing at it. Most bishops regard the experience, along with other recent moves to examine sections of the American church, as indicating heightened strain between the Vatican and a vigorous American Catholicism that has shown growing signs of dissent. These impressions are gained from interviews with more than a dozen key bishops in the last month. They are among the approximately 300 American bishops, almost all of whom are expected to visit the Pope this year. John Paul, like some popes before him, has worried about the impact of a democratic society on a church that claims hierarchical authority. Issues Seen as Testing Ground In many respects, American Catholics' attitudes on issues related to sexuality have become the testing ground for a struggle by the Pope to keep the country's 50 million laymen and laywomen firmly in the fold. The alternative seen by many Vatican officials is that American Catholicism will attain even more of a character of its own, becoming semiautonomous. The Pope has addressed several groups of bishops on their duty, as teachers, to clearly expound the church's opposition to artificial birth control, abortion, divorce and remarriage, and premarital sex. He has also emphatically told them not to encourage advocates of ordaining women. The Vatican decreed in 1976 that women could never be priests. American Catholics have expressed rising disagreement regarding every subject on that list. Polls show consistently that an overwhelming majority of Catholics approve of artificial contraception. They increasingly divorce and remarry outside the church and believe in large numbers that abortion should be left to personal decision. Archbishop John R. Roach of Minneapolis, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, reads the Pope's message as a helpful challenge. ''It is wrong to think that rambunctious American bishops are getting slapped down by a stern Pope,'' Archbishop Roach said during the World Synod of Bishops, which ended Saturday. ''He is saying that there are issues he deeply cares about and he wants to work with us on them.'' Many bishops believe that the Pope especially wants the American church to become a model of fidelity to authority because of its strategic position within an international superpower and its financial strength. Ample evidence indicates that John Paul believes the American branch of the church has failed to set a proper example. In his visit to the United States in 1979, a year after he became Pope, he was already expressing deep misgivings about the moral freedom fostered by American affluence and permissiveness. Calling for a return to moral discipline, the Pope took material from the bishops' own statements to buttress his appeal. Orders Inquiry Into Seminaries In addition to repeating these themes to the bishops visiting him here, the Pope has recently approved other actions that many American Catholics regard as corrective and possibly punitive. This year the Vatican announced that American seminaries and religious orders would be examined to determine their soundness. Some seminary officials believe the study is aimed partly at excluding the growing number of women among seminary teachers and students. Many nuns reacted with similar anxiety to the directive to investigate religious orders. The Pope has indicated he is dissatisfied with some of the liberalization in women's orders. Most bishops have tried to assuage these fears by saying the Vatican is only trying to be helpful. But many bishops themselves are uneasy over the Pope's insistence on orthodoxy. Stoking that anxiety was the news last week that the Pope had sent Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, D.C., to look into criticism of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, an outspoken opponent of nuclear arms who has withheld part of his income tax in protest. Sending one bishop to report on another is unusual and, for some bishops, chilling. 2 Archbishoprics Vacant The extent of the Pope's disapproval of what he considers liberal tendencies in the American hierarchy could be indicated in his coming appointments to key posts. The deaths of Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston and Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York leave vacancies in powerful archdioceses. In addition, John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia and Timothy Cardinal Manning of Los Angeles are expected to retire within the next year or two. American bishops often find themselves caught between their flocks, which exhibit vibrant, if unconventional, ways of adapting Catholicism to American experience, and a Pope whose demands for conformity grow out of his years in a besieged Polish church that relied on a united front. Many bishops say the Vatican does not understand their problems or their responses to them. Most of the problems are regarded as resulting from basic demographic and social changes among American Roman Catholics. A few decades ago, American Catholicism was largely an immigrant church, dependent on the Vatican and highly disposed to do its bidding. Since then, Catholics in America have entered the mainstream of economic and social life, acquiring more of American pluralism and freedom of thought. The Rev. Carl Peter, the head of the Department of Religious Studies at Catholic University in Washington, says these changes have brought about ''an awkward period right now on both sides of the Atlantic.'' He says Catholic leaders are ''in that difficult position of trying to bring as much unity as they can, not compromising Catholic doctrine but taking a pastoral attitude of taking people where they are.'' Avoiding Antagonism Stressed Many priests, faced with parishioners who disregard some of the church's moral stands, have avoided further antagonism by playing these issues down or trying to present them in a more palatable manner. Some bishops have taken the Pope's recent counsel as an incentive to try harder to underscore Catholic morality without generating hostility. ''He is saying basically that we must fulfill our roles with integrity,'' said Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago. ''In the most credible way we can, we must try to elicit assent, not dissent. ''Has he lost confidence in us?'' Cardinal Bernardin asks. ''I think not. Rather, he has taken a real interest in us because of the importance of the church in the United States.'' Archbishop Roach said: ''We've got to face the fact that we are at a new point in history - good but painful. It is one in which the Holy Father is literally testing the collegiality of our episcopal conference. He's saying, 'You're a big, powerful church, and you have influence far beyond the point you realize.' He is calling us to the high road, to be the best kind of bishops we can be in our time.'' The present stress between the Pope and the Americans stems in part from new definitions of church power introduced by the Second Vatican Council, held from 1962 to 1965. From the council emerged the concept of regional conferences of bishops that would meet regularly and make pronouncements on problems within their jurisdiction. As the conferences have grown, they have inevitably weakened the Vatican's strength somewhat. Letter on Atom Arms Cited In the United States, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has become a sounding board for the aspirations and strains of the church in America. Its most far-reaching venture was the drafting of a pastoral letter on war and peace that condemned nuclear arms but accepted the concept of a limited nuclear deterrent. The Vatican raised questions about drafts of the letter, and the bishops responded satisfactorily. But the letter was clearly the creation of the bishops and, according to Archbishop Roach, raised their confidence in their ability to handle delicate issues. In their visits to Rome, the Pope has indicated his approval of the final letter, one sign that his criticism is limited. The Pope's challenge on other issues has presented the Americans with either an opportunity or a threat, depending on the particular viewpoint of the bishops and students of American Catholicism. ''We are in the United States a very distinct, truly Roman Catholic Church, not like any other because our country is unique,'' Father Peter said. ''We are distinctive just as the U.S. experience is distinctive.'' How Much Special Character? The exchanges with the bishops are a key element in testing how much special character the Pope can accept in the American church. Cardinal Bernardin is among those who think both sides stand to gain from a frank discussion of the differences. Some bishops said their visits with the Pope were like ''talks at a retreat'' and ''a real shot in the arm,'' as Archbishop Patrick F. Flores of San Antonio put it. Others voiced frustration. One bishop who asked that he not be identified recalled a visit that he and some colleagues made to Silvio Cardinal Oddi, prefect for the Sacred Congregation of Clergy. One of the bishops raised the issue of a ban against the use of altar girls, explaining that it was painful for him to tell a 9-year-old girl that she could not serve while a boy the same age could. The bishop said this was an agonizing situation faced by many pastors. Cardinal Oddi reached behind his chair for a book of canon law. Pointing to the appropriate article, he replied, ''Just show them that it's impossible.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SOCIAL SPENDING BILL IS SIGNED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/us/social-spending-bill-is-signed.html,"President Reagan signed a huge money bill today for social programs that exceeds his requests by more than $9 billion. The President invited key members of Congress to witness his signing of a $104.4 billion appropriations bill that is a landmark not so much for what it does, but because it passed. Its passage 11 days ago marked the first time in five years that Congress has been able to send the President a formal appropriations bill for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Labor, The measure provides an increase of $477.9 million in overall program financing from the fiscal year 1983, which ended Sept. 30. Previous efforts to pass an appropriations measure have been frustrated by fights such as over Federal financing of abortions for women on welfare. Programs covered by the bill have operated under temporary stopgap financing bills since 1978. Among the newest provisions of the bill is the addition of $41 million for research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the disease known as AIDS. The measure contains what has become an accepted ban on the use of Federal money to pay for abortions, except where a woman's life is in danger. The bill also prohibits the withholding of any Federal funds for use in the court-ordered desegregation of Chicago's public schools and bars the use of Federal money to block school prayer or periods of meditation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic Scene; Silly Season Is Longer Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/02/business/economic-scene-silly-season-is-longer-now.html,"THESE are days when great financial institutions, developing countries, the International Monetary Fund and even the United States Treasury are digging deep into their pockets and coming up with nothing much besides a few paper clips and old subway tokens. The Treasury, which still has a little real money hidden away in pots and under the carpet, is desperately waiting for Congress to raise the ceiling on the national debt to $1,614 billion so that it can borrow a lot more money. The House of Representatives has passed the debt-limit bill, but the Senate is in no particular hurry. Some Senators are holding the debt-limit bill for ransom by attaching amendments on everything from national defense to abortion while others are delaying action to remind the country of the depth of President Reagan's deficits. The Government has just run a record deficit of $195 billion in the fiscal year 1983 and is likely to run another of $200 billion in the fiscal year 1984. As military expenditures rise faster than expected and Congress fails to enact tax increases in line with its own budget resolution - with President Reagan holding out for no tax increases at all - deficits in excess of $200 billion loom for 1985 and 1986. That Congress has essentially gone along with the President's spending and tax programs, making the deficits inevitable, does not deter those legislators who are balking at raising the debt ceiling as an exercise in anti-Administration propaganda. But this is rather expensive propaganda. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan told Congress yesterday that trying to discipline the Administration this way was a bad idea because it was forcing the Government to live on a ''hand-to- mouth basis.'' To stay within the current debt ceiling of $1,389 billion, Secretary Regan has already suspended sales of United States Savings Bonds, put off sales of special nonmarketable Treasury securities, invested only $4 billion of a scheduled $13 billion of Social Security trust funds, postponed issuance of three-year Treasury notes, rescheduled 52-week Treasury bills, and is getting ready to cancel or delay other debt flotations until he runs out of strategems and money. Once the disarray created by a failure of Congress to raise the debt ceiling would have been over in a matter of hours. For, until last May, there was a so-called permanent debt ceiling of $400 billion, and every ''temporary'' increase above that had an expiration date, after which the ceiling reverted to the permanent level. Thus, at the end of the fiscal year 1981, when the gross Federal debt reached $1,004 billion, if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling, it would have reverted to $400 billion and the United States Government would have had to default almost immediately on more than $600 billion of its debt. Since Congress obviously could not let that happen, it would promptly, after a small number of excoriating speeches, vote an increase in the debt limit before the Government went broke. But now the Government can refinance outstanding debt as it comes due up to the current limit of $1,389 billion. And, with some $25 billion in cash still lying around the house - despite the huge projected fiscal year 1984 deficit - the Treasury can keep paying the bills for G.I.'s in Grenada or Social Security benefits and other things for another couple of weeks or so before it bumps up against the debt limit. That creates the opportunity to keep the securities markets in a state of utter confusion for at least two weeks longer. Secretary Regan would like to end the confusion now. Yesterday, in addition to telling Congress that the Government was living on a hand-to- mouth basis, he scolded the legislators for creating uncertainty in the financial markets. He said those who thought refusing to raise the debt limit would contribute to ''fiscal responsibility'' were not solving a problem but creating one. Indeed, the uncertainty is driving down prices of Government securities and driving up interest rates. This not only increases the cost of financing the deficit and the deficit itself - interest on the debt already exceeds $100 billion a year - but, by pushing up interest rates, may slow the recovery in the United States, increase the value of the dollar, hurt exports, and aggravate the economic and debt-repayment problems of countries abroad. Meanwhile, Congress is still holding up the $8.4 billion authorization for the International Monetary Fund, intensifying the problems of the developing countries and the banks. President Reagan has written a letter praising the Democrats for supporting his I.M.F. legislation - appeasing them for a Republican attack on 20 Democrats as ''friends of Communism'' - and a compromise appears to be in the works on a housing and community development bill demanded by some Democrats to clear the way for the I.M.F. bill. But this, too, will pass. The silly season just seems to be lasting longer than it used to. It could well last until November 1984.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: SCIENCE'S 'INNOVATION' RETURNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/03/arts/tv-science-s-innovation-returns.html,"''INNOVATION,'' which begins its second season tonight, opens with a picture of a 5-week-old fetus. Ever so slightly, its hand moves. The fetus ''is a patient even before it has an identity,'' we are told, and ''Innovation'' is off on an intelligent essay about the time between conception and birth. The program will be seen on Channel 13 at 9 o'clock tonight. ''Innovation,'' produced for public television by Channel 13, is a science series for viewers who do not necessarily like science, or pretend to understand it. Each half-hour program opens with the main story. Then there is a short sequence about the new technology that is applicable to the subject of the story. This is followed by an interview, with Jim Hartz questioning an expert in the field that is being examined. Mr. Hartz is an admirable interviewer, particularly because he does not pretend to know any more than viewers do, either. Thus, tonight's episode starts by exploring in-vitro fertilization, the so- called test-tube babies. Doctors surgically remove the egg from a woman's body. The egg, placed in a petri dish, is fertilized with sperm. Conception takes place on television. Then, the newly conceived life, after being incubated, is placed in a woman's uterus. In its simplicity, the process is awesome. There is also an exploration of new procedures in fetal surgery. Diagnosis is done with ultrasound technology, the soundwaves echoing off the bones of the fetus. Doctors may now correct as many as 100 fetal disorders, among them Down's syndrome, which afflicts children born to older women more often than it does those born to young women. The new surgical technique, removing the threat of Down's syndrome, is likely to increase the number of women willing to risk pregnancies in their 30's and 40's. Meanwhile, advances in science often raise attendant ethical questions, and advances in the science of nurturing and sustaining life probably raise as many questions as any area of science. Fetal diagnosis, for example, has been characterized as ''search and destroy'' missions. A woman may choose an abortion because the fetus is diagnosed as unhealthy. Parents may also choose an abortion if they hope to have, say, a blue-eyed baby with blond hair, and the fetus is perceived to have dark eyes and brown hair. People who wear designer jeans may want designer children. In the interview segment, Mr. Hartz explores this and other matters with Dr. John C. Hobbins of Yale New Haven Hospital, a pioneer in prenatal diagnostics. Mr. Hartz asks, for instance, if the new diagnostic techniques will lead to an increase in abortions. Dr. Hobbins says thoughtfully that, if anything, the new techniques lead to ''an advocacy for the fetus.'' The discussion is reasoned throughout, and it is particularly nice to see Mr. Hartz once again, now that ''Over Easy,'' public television's series on the elderly, is temporarily absent, even in reruns. ''Innovation'' is worthwhile television.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/04/opinion/no-headline-018939.html,"Civil Rights: The Movement Moves In barely 24 hours, America has witnessed a pivotal transition. On Wednesday President Reagan signed the law establishing a Federal holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., thus fixing the highest seal of public approval on the long first- stage struggle, the achievement of civil rights. Yesterday brought a welcome milestone in the second stage, the exercise of those rights. The Rev. Jesse Jackson came to political maturity in the same years that black elective power did. The effect of that power is evident in one city hall after another. By declaring his candidacy for President, Mr. Jackson demonstrates a rising black capacity to claim a higher place on the national political agenda. Some people fret about his candidacy because they sense in him a weakness for personal publicity. Some black political figures prefer the experience and records of, say, Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta or Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary. But those are not disabling objections. Besides, Jackson supporters acknowledge that he can't win the Democratic nomination, which makes his appeal and fitness a less pressing matter. His candidacy deserves welcome for broad social reasons. For one thing, it is likely to inspire black citizens to register and vote, and black candidates to run for state and local office. Second, Mr. Jackson now has a dramatic opportunity to put social issues on the national bulletin board. The N.A.A.C.P. and Urban League are already focusing on the family questions that are the nation's most important and tormenting: hopelessly poor single-parent households, alarmingly high teen-age pregnancy, abortion, youth crime. Mr. Jackson promises to go beyond colorful slogans (black youth needs a better choice than to ''explode with rage or implode on drugs'') by issuing position papers on such issues. What would be even more welcome, from him and the other candidates, is political strategies. To offer black Americans a political voice is one thing. To help persuade all Americans to face up to dependency, delinquency and despair is a yet worthier challenge for a time when civil rights, once secured, can be exercised. Freedom, as Matthew Arnold once wrote, is a good horse, but a horse to ride somewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KEEPING UP WITH THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/keeping-up-with-the-genetic-revolution.html,"THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL Laboratory in New Mexico, biophysicist Walter Goad punches a few keys on a computer terminal. Moments later, glowing green type illuminates the monitor in front of him. ''ATGGCTACAGGTAAG . . . '' begins the message, which goes on and on for almost 2,000 repetitions of A, T, C and G. Dr. Goad, director of the Government-sponsored Genetic Sequence Data Bank, known as GenBank, can read the cryptic language easily. It is an example of the genetic code, this particular procession of characters being the recipe for making a specific protein, the hormone that controls human growth. It will probably take more than three billion characters to encode in this way all the chemicals in the body. One day, Dr. Goad hopes, the complete recipe for a human being will be revealed. ''Man's entire hereditary code should fit on 30 high- density magnetic tapes, taking up less than a four-foot bookshelf.'' Equipped with the tools of molecular biology, scientists like Dr. Goad are participating in an intense study of the genetic basis of human life, racing to unscramble the detailed structure and position of all the genes on man's 46 chromosomes. The major aims are to uncover how these genes are ''switched on and off'' to promote normal development and to learn just what goes wrong when disease ensues. In one experiment, for example, researchers are trying to understand the functions of human genes by implanting them in the nucleus of a mouse embryo. (See the photograph on the cover.) By studying how these genes alter the characteristics of the newborn animal, they hope to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of genetic control. OF THE ESTIMATED 100,000 GENES found tucked up inside a human cell, some 800 have now been tracked to their chromosomal locations, with new genes being mapped at a rate of 200 per year. According to Dr. Frank Ruddle, professor of biology and human genetics at Yale University, this rate will accelerate exponentially over the next few years so that ''by the turn of the century, the major outline of the human gene map should be known.'' It will probably take several decades more before Walter Goad's genetic bookshelf is realized, but already the molecular cartography of animal and human genes heralds startling advances in health care: Vaccines. Last month, scientists of the New York State Health Department announced they had used the manipulation of genetic material - genetic engineering, as it is commonly called - to develop vaccines that protect rabbits against hepatitis and mice against a type of herpes. They held out hope that tests could begin in three years or so on similar vaccines that might protect humans from the same afflictions. In the same week, a New York City team announced it had isolated the gene for a substance that may cause toxic shock syndrome. A vaccine to guard against that condition, too, might possibly result. Early warning for adult diseases. In the brief interim since the genetic origins of many cancers first came to light, scientists have succeeded in isolating specific snippets of genetic material that may predispose individuals to heart disease and emphysema. Medical sleuths are now hot on the trail of genes that have emerged as likely culprits in diabetes, allergies, peptic ulcers and other common diseases of midlife, a trend that may shift the central thrust of medicine from treatment to prevention. Understanding the basis of inherited diseases. The blood disorders sickle-cell anemia and beta thalassemia, and over a dozen other hereditary diseases have now been traced to specific ''spelling errors'' in the genetic code, shedding new light on the underlying causes of hereditary afflictions. Prenatal screening. Old limitations of prenatal diagnosis are being overcome by new techniques that enable clinicians to analyze directly the genetic makeup of developing fetuses. By the late l980's, experts predict, these methods will permit fetuses to be screened early in pregnancy for such lethal hereditary diseases as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and Huntington's chorea. Therapy. Within the last year, doctors at the National Institutes of Health in Washington reported using a revolutionary gene therapy to ease the effects of two hereditary blood disorders, a historical first that suggests that the power to alter our biological destinies may be fast approaching. Natural drugs. Genetic formulas are being used increasingly by the pharmaceutical industry to prepare potent natuPage 45 ral medicines never before available for routine clinical use. Along with the anticipated benefits, however, has come a barrage of worries and uncertainties, including the familiar questions about just where all the ground-breaking research is leading. Of all the ethical dilemmas raised by genetic science, none is more pervasive than the public's fear that we may soon be tempted to ''play God.'' Last June, a group of 64 religious leaders and several prominent scientists asked Congress to ban experiments that could alter man's inheritable traits. The question of when, or if, it is morally acceptable to modify human genes is certain to remain the focus of debate well into the next century. Within medical circles, meanwhile, there is concern that people may come to expect too much too soon. Specialists point out that the age of genetic discovery is still in its infancy; major obstacles will have to be overcome before our newfound knowledge is translated into treatments and other useful applications. Others observe that advances in genetic science may tend to confirm belief in man's fate and lack of free will. THE CENTER OF ALL THESE advances and concerns is, of course, the long, chainlike molecule known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), found bundled up inside each cell's chromosomes. The DNA chain is made up of chemical subunits, groups of atoms known as nucleotide bases. (See illustration on page 42.) A string of thousands or more of these comprises a gene. What matters about these nucleotide bases, it turns out, is their exact sequence along the ''backbone'' of the DNA molecule. The chemicals' arrangement can be likened to a genetic Morse code that uses four nucleotide bases - denoted by the letters A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine) - in place of dots and dashes. This simple alphabet spells out all the instructions the body needs for manufacturing proteins, the key administrators of the processes of life. Genes, by providing a blueprint for protein production, ultimately determine why a man is unlike a mouse or a moose or any other species on earth - and why an individual man or woman is unlike any other man or woman on earth. Not long ago, the messages encoded in DNA were considered inscrutable. But the picture changed drastically when genetic engineering provided the instruments to dissect man's DNA. Using chemical catalysts known as enzymes to break molecular bonds and thereby cut the DNA into gene- sized segments, molecular biologists could begin to ascertain the order of the A's, T's, C's and G's - a process known as sequencing. And once deciphered, the formulas could be used to reconstruct genes synthetically in the laboratory from organic chemicals. From GenBank and other DNA repositories around the globe, researchers can now call up the recipes for dozens of vital body proteins. Then, by manufacturing the genes synthetically and splicing them into fast-growing bacteria cells, the scientists can induce the cells to churn out prodigious amounts of human chemicals. The first genetically engineered protein, or natural drug, to reach the marketplace was Eli Lilly's human insulin, Humulin, introduced earlier this year. It will soon be followed by Genentech's human growth hormone for the treatment of hypopituitary dwarfism. In the next two years, still other drug manufacturers plan to market a blood-clotting factor for the treatment of hemophilia and the antiviral compound interferon, which may also be applied to certain cancers. Data banks also list the genetic codes for many other intriguing body and animal substances that may soon be targeted for commercial production. These include a dozen variants of interferon; encephalins, the brain's natural painkillers; key components of the body's immune system, and protein components of microorganisms that may be used in the manufacture of vaccines against hepatitis B, genital herpes, toxic shock syndrome and other microbial infections. But as Dr. Goad likes to point out, today's computerized catalogues offer only a glimpse of what is to come. Of the 50,000 proteins (exclusive of antibodies) synthesized by the body, less than 2 percent have been identified. As the sequencing of human genes progresses, it should be possible to grow many more rare proteins outside of the body and for the first time obtain large enough quantities to test their medical properties. DNA SEQUENCING IS ALSO HELPING TO UNCOVER the underlying causes of many disorders, including diseases not normally thought of as hereditary because of their late onset. In this way, genetic data can enable doctors to identify individuals who are most likely to succumb to specific ailments. For example, a team at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recently uncovered a mutation that can dramatically increase susceptibility to emphysema in adults. What prompted their search was an earlier epidemiological study that showed that people who develop emphysema often have insufficient amounts of a lung-protecting protein. Using radioactive probes, they were able to extract some of this protein from a patient's cell at a stage when it was still attached to the gene that controlled its production. Once the key gene was isolated, the sequence of its nucleotide bases could be determined, and, surprisingly, the patient's gene was found to differ from a normal one by only a single changed letter in the hereditary code. This abnormality, known as a point mutation, turns out to be most prevalent among people of Northern European ancestry. In this population, it is estimated that one out of every 2,000 persons will be afflicted with emphysema, often dying within a few years after the first symptoms appear. An individual who knows he has the genetic abnormality can be extra cautious. The Baylor team leader, Savio Woo, says, ''The onset of emphysema can be delayed by as much as 30 years if the person's condition is not irritated by cigarette smoke or polluted air.'' More recently, Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, geneticists at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas, used a similar approach to pinpoint several mutations that underlie one of the leading killers in the United States - hardening of the arteries, also known as arteriosclerosis. ''It's an insidious disease that begins in the teen-age years,'' says Dr. Brown, ''but usually causes no symptoms until middle age, when heart attacks begin to occur.'' The faulty gene, present in one out of every 500 people, interferes with the normal cellular function of absorbing and breaking down excess cholesterol. In affected individuals, this substance builds up, clogging arteries and leading to premature death. When scientists learn how various mutations cause the malfunction, Dr. Brown is confident that much better treatments for arteriosclerosis will follow. ''In fact,'' he says, ''a drug is already being clinically tested.'' Armed with genetic-engineering technology, medical researchers are also gaining insights into the deep-rooted causes of cancer. The kernels of the disease appear to lurk within us all, and normal cellular genes can quickly be changed into cancer-causing agents known as oncogenes (from the Greek word onkos , meaning mass). At least 18 oncogenes have already been discovered, but experts estimate that as many as 50 may underlie all the different forms of cancer. Oncogenes are the result of alterations in DNA caused by radiation, chemicals, certain viruses and other poorly understood factors. British and American studies published in the last few months suggest that at least two distinct oncogenes must become activated if cancer is to occur. Dr. Robert A. Weinberg at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology speculates that one oncogene stimulates a cell to grow indefinitely. A second acts to allow growth even though the cell's normal growth stimulus is lacking. Exposure to chemicals or radiation is not, however, the whole story of cancer-producing genetic change. Dr. Jorge J. Yunis, a geneticist at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis who has introduced innovative techniques for studying the detailed structure of chromosomes, reports that some individuals are born with ''brittle'' DNA. The molecules contain regions that are unstable and prone to breakage. If the fragile site is in the neighborhood of an oncogene, the person's risk of contracting cancer is probably heightened. Dr. Yunis has positively linked at least eight leukemias and non- Hodgkins lymphomas to brittle DNA. ''In all likelihood,'' he says, ''a combination of internal and external factors sets the stage for tumor formation. For example, the chemicals in tobacco frequently do damage to the short arm of chromosome number 3, so anyone with an inborn weakness in this area should stay away from cigarettes if they don't want to get lung cancer.'' Along with academic institutions, many pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms are launching major research projects to pursue these findings. A common aim is to silence oncogenes by drugs or other means, or at least to deactivate the genes' protein products. Although no one expects to find any cures in the near future, there is widespread optimism that these quantum jumps in understanding the disease will speed progress toward the goal. ''The discovery of oncogenes,'' declares Frank J. Rauscher Jr., senior vice president for research at the American Cancer Society, ''is unquestionably the single greatest breakthrough in all our years of cancer research.'' There is another group of genes that can bode ill. Found on chromosome number 6, these genes determine the precise configuration of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system - a chemical ''fingerprint'' etched on the outside of all the cells in the body. This molecular monogram permits the immune system to distinguish ''self'' from all foreign matter and was initially of greatest interest to transplant surgeons seeking to match the tissues of an organ donor with a recipient. But in recent years, immunologists have begun to discern a statistical correlation between genes in the HLA system and certain illnesses. For reasons that are still not entirely clear, the genes can sometimes be prognosticators of disease. Take, for example, the HLA gene referred to as B-27. It is present in 95 percent of all people with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic arthritis of the lower spine common in adult men. Roughly one in every four males with B-27 eventually develops back problems, ranging from minor aches and pains to full- blown symptoms of arthritis. Or consider the HLA D-7 gene. While it is represented in 15 percent of the normal population, it is found in almost 75 percent of the victims of multiple sclerosis. In addition, HLA genes have been more loosely associated with some 75 other disorders, including hay fever, lupus, juvenile onset diabetes and chronic active hepatitis. Researchers stress that most of these correlations are too low to be of much predictive value. But as HLA data is added to our increasing knowledge of oncogenes, brittle DNA and other genetic abnormalities, science's ability to forecast the future may be greatly enhanced. It is likely that many more diseases will be detected earlier - or before they even arise. In fact, there no longer seem to be any insurmountable obstacles to screening fetuses for predilections of diseases that strike in early adulthood, or even later in life. The ability to spot health risks far in advance of symptoms represents the latest advance in genetic screening, a practice that got its biggest boost in the early 1970's with the introduction of amniocentesis. This technique, usually carried out in the fifth month of pregnancy, entails inserting a syringe into the mother's womb to withdraw fetal cells that have been shed into the amniotic fluid. These are then subjected to a battery of tests. Today, amniocentesis is frequently done in conjunction with ultrasonagraphy - a method of acquiring a description of the developing embryo by using sound waves. Together, these two approaches permit the detection of more than 190 chromosomal aberrations and hereditary disorders within the first 20 weeks of life. As impressive as these advances have been, countless mutations continue to go undiagnosed in fetuses because they can be revealed only through a careful analysis of the finer structure of genes. In these cases it is not enough to run tests on the biochemical products manufactured by human cells, or to examine their chromosomes under a microscope - the standard procedures for detecting trouble. The majority of defects, in fact, are difficult or impossible to uncover unless the DNA itself is analyzed directly. It is in this area that recombinant DNA technology promises to make its greatest contribution to genetic screening. At the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., a research team is creating radioactive probes made of synthetic DNA. These can bind themselves in a complementary fashion to DNA extracted from a donor's cells. If there is a point mutation in the donor's DNA (point mutations are those instances when only one letter of the genetic code has been altered), the radioactive probe will indicate an area of instability at that location. The researchers can then be certain that the mutation exists. (See the illustration on page 43.) Some half-dozen probes are now being applied in the prenatal diagnosis of sickle-cell anemia (a blood disorder that affects many blacks) and other inherited blood diseases, but this number is expected to double over the coming year. ''As new genes are sequenced,'' says Dr. Brenda Conner, one of the scientists heading the hospital's new clinical program, ''we can plug the information right in and use it to develop new screening tests.'' Not surprisingly, the investigators have recently made oncogenes the target of their probes. Will it soon become commonplace to run everyone through a battery of these genetic tests? ''No,'' says Dr. Conner. ''Because only a small percentage of the population is at risk for any given disease, it just wouldn't be a cost-effective form of preventive medicine. But if familial history suggests that the illness could occur, then it is certainly worth the time and expense.'' The tests are currently available on an experimental basis. The price is about $1,050, or $300 on top of the $750 usually charged for amniocentesis. Still other researchers are working on an alternative method of screening in families with a history of hereditary problems. When enzymes cut DNA into pieces, fragments called ''variants'' are often produced. These have been found to indicate the proximity of a defective gene and can be thought of as red flags, markers that signify trouble nearby. Within three to five years, authorities predict, they may be able to test for these markers and make prenatal diagnoses of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (a wasting disease that afflicts thousands of American males), cystic fibrosis (the most common lethal hereditary disease), Huntington's chorea (a debilitating neurological syndrome) and hemophilia (the hereditary blood-clotting disorder). ''To detect every genetic disease known to mankind,'' says Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, director of the Center for Inherited Diseases at the University of Washington in Seattle, ''it has been estimated that you would need around 400 variants randomly distributed throughout our chromosomes. The beauty of this strategy is that you don't have to know the nucleotide sequence of the defective gene. Once a marker is identified in an affected family, you should theoretically be able to diagnose the genetic disease, regardless of whether or not you understand what's gone awry in the hereditary code. That's a big leap forward.'' Dr. Motulsky and others stress that research in this area is still at a preliminary stage; no one is about to go into a doctor's office for a complete genetic physical. Nonetheless, a Presidential ethics commission concluded last February that ''genetic screening and counseling are certain to become major components in both public health and individual medical care'' by the end of the century. In its report, the commission noted that a time ''can already be envisioned'' when all information about an individual's genetic constitution would be readily accessible. The report also urged the medical profession to get ready for a ''huge demand'' for screening tests to determine the future health of unborn children and to identify adults who are susceptible to disease or whose offspring may be. Dr. Motulsky says, ''Diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies, peptic ulcers - these and many other diseases of middle life are now being found to have genetic determinants. By finding out what these are, we can begin to identify populations at much higher risk for various disorders, and then direct preventive measures at these people in a more concentrated way.'' Progress is inevitably accompanied by growing pains - and the development of genetic science is no exception. Because of our new- found ability to spot disease susceptibilities, screening has entered a murky realm governed by statistical probabilities. Not surprisingly, genetic counselors worry that their warnings of possible future diseases could be misconstrued as inevitable outcomes. If so, couples might perceive relatively minor risks to the fetus as grounds for abortion. Similarly, dietary changes, exercise and other preventive measures might be abandoned on the assumption that it is futile to fight what is in the genetic cards, so to speak. The very latest scientific advances could be used to revive the ancient idea of inexorable human destiny. Even more troublesome is the potential for outsiders to misuse genetic data. It is not inconceivable that insurance companies could demand such information in fixing a customer's premium rate. Likewise, prospective employers could use genetic screening as one means of selecting job applicants. According to a survey conducted in 1982 by the Government's Office of Technology Assessment (O.T.A.), half-a-dozen major corporations in the United States employ genetic testing to spot employees who are likely to react adversely to toxic substances in the work environment. In addition, another 59 companies report that they are considering adopting such a policy within the next five years. Although this practice is still very limited, it has already engendered enormous controversy on two main battlefronts. First, the validity of the tests has been disputed, and, in fact, none evaluated by the O.T.A. meet established scientific criteria for routine use. Secondly, labor unions have voiced concern that industry, in the name of protecting the worker, will only succeed in creating a group of ''genetically unemployed.'' They fear that corporations, rather than cleaning up the work place, will be able to shift the burden of blame and responsibility onto the worker by labeling him or her unfit. Blue-collar laborers are not the only group who could find themselves denied work as a result of screening technology. The up-and-coming executive in a high-pressure business could be passed over for promotion if identified as someone likely to fall prey to coronary attacks at a young age. Because genes are unevenly distributed among people of different sex and ethnic origin, there is the additional worry that genetic testing could be used to discriminate against minorities. Although it appears that companies have so far tried to offer alternative work to those deemed at risk, there have been a few documented cases of women and blacks being refused jobs because of current thinking about hypersusceptibility. ''Unless applied with great care and sensitivity, genetic screening could be perceived as a threat to the egalitarian ideals we cherish in a democracy,'' cautions Dr. Thomas H. Murray of the Hastings Center Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences. ''Until now, it has been widely assumed that ability, effort and ambition are the three key ingredients for getting ahead in this country. So it's threatening to think that jobs and other rewards in society might depend on one's genetic fitness. After all, the one thing we can't alter about ourselves is our genes. If you're overweight you can diet. If you're a slow reader you can go to Evelyn Wood. But if you're genetically unqualified, effort can't make up the difference. Genetic screening types you in a way that is utterly outside your control. For that reason alone, it would be wise to proceed cautiously in this area.'' At Yale University, Dr. Ruddle underscores still another reason to proceed with care. ''Right now,'' he notes, ''our diagnostic ability is outpacing our capacity to treat a whole range of conditions. So what good does it do to tell someone that they're susceptible to a serious disease that can neither be prevented nor cured? One might even argue that you were doing that individual more harm than good. Of course, this line of research should eventually lead to improved therapy, but until such time, there's apt to be an uncomfortable hiatus.'' Ironically, the much more futuristic technology of gene therapy poses, by comparison, only minor ethical dilemmas. Banner headlines notwithstanding, the first attempts at transplanting healthy genes to impaired human cells do not represent a radical departure from other therapeutic modalities. As Dr. Motulsky in Seattle points out: ''So long as the patient's sex cells - eggs and sperm - are not modified, gene therapy is conceptually no different from other forms of medical intervention such as surgery or drugs, where the aim is simply to repair an abnormality. Only the individual being treated is actually affected by the manipulation - the genetic alteration will not be passed on to the next generation.'' To date, corrective measures have been directed only at hereditary disorders that result from a defect in a single gene. This is as far as technical skills have progressed, and, even in this limited realm, immense obstacles remain to be hurdled. The first clinical trials were undertaken in the summer of 1980 by Dr. Martin J. Cline, then head of the hematology and oncology division of the department of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles. This early research was a failure on two counts: The patients showed no signs of improvement, and Dr. Cline was heavily censured for failing to get proper authorization for the experiment. Dr. Cline's general research strategy, however, illustrates one approach to gene therapy that many scientists believe could eventually come into use. In Israel, Dr. Cline attempted to replace the defective genes carried by two victims of beta thalassemia, a painful and deforming hereditary blood disorder that usually kills its victims by early adulthood. Because red blood cells are manufactured in the bone marrow, his strategy was to remove this tissue from the patients' thighbones and treat the marrow cells in such a way as to induce them to incorporate copies of the normal gene for hemoglobin. This step completed, he reimplanted the marrow into the thighbones, where he hoped the healthy cells would replicate and replenish the blood supply. By the following autumn, when the research was heavily publicized, it was clear that neither patient had been helped by the operation. Investigating the matter, both Dr. Cline's home institution and the National Institutes of Health (N.I.H.), the major funding body for biomedical research, deemed the trial premature in light of insufficient animal studies. Dr. Cline's punishment for his offense was severe: He remained at U.C.L.A., but lost his chairmanship and close to $200,000 in Federal research funding. Even if Dr. Cline's approach eventually becomes successful, it will only be applicable to tissues that normally regenerate themselves - such as skin, blood and the lining of the intestinal tract. Otherwise, the genetically engineered cell will not be able to multiply within the body to supplant defective cells with healthy ones. The brain, for example, does not grow after birth, so this method offers little hope for victims of such neurological syndromes as Tay-Sachs disease and Huntington's chorea. Ever since Dr. Cline was formally censured, no other medical researchers have attempted human experiments that pick up where he left off. But that is not to imply that gene therapy has come to a standstill. In one recent clinical trial, a brand-new approach to the treatment of blood disorders yielded exciting results, demonstrating that genetic engineering has reached the bedside. This latest effort marks a major divergence from treatments based on gene replacement. The strategy was inspired by the observation that the body carries a gene that triggers the production of fetal hemoglobin. The gene becomes dormant slightly before birth, when a second gene for the adult form of hemoglobin takes over its function. If the adult hemoglobin gene is faulty, it was reasoned, perhaps the fetal gene could be reactivated. In the last few years, research has hinted that a drug called 5-azacytidine might be the secret to reawakening the long-dormant gene. The compound seems to keep DNA free of certain chemical groups that bind to the genetic material and prohibit gene expression. At N.I.H., a team of researchers led by Timothy J. Ley and Arthur W. Nienhuis decided to put the compound to the test, selecting three people with beta thalassemia and two with sickle-cell anemia for the first trial. The result: The blood of all five patients showed a striking improvement over the course of the one-week therapy, with the beneficial effects sometimes lasting for up to a month. By stirring the fetal hemoglobin genes into action, red-blood-cell formation was enhanced and anemia reduced. It is still too soon to say whether this simple, straightforward technique of gene manipulation will live up to its initial promise. Although none of the patients developed adverse side effects from the chemotherapy, researchers fear that prolonged treatment might heighten the risk of contracting cancer. While the ultimate value of this approach can only be ascertained with further tests, the preliminary results have been enthusiastically received by the medical profession. Almost everyone agrees that genetic surgery remains a distant prospect. Yet to a large number of clerical leaders and a handful of scientists, the possibility looms large enough on the horizon to pose a serious threat. Their fears about the present direction in which gene therapy is headed prompted them to endorse a recent resolution that calls upon Congress to prohibit changes in reproductive cells that control inheritance. The rationale behind this action stems from the belief that gene therapy will ultimately lead to gene enhancement if the Government ever tolerates the modification of human eggs, sperm or embryos. The distinction between the correction and perfection of genetic traits can sometimes blur. Seeking the humane goal of eliminating disease and suffering, the argument goes, we nevertheless may soon find ourselves embarking on a eugenics program and irreversibly altering the human germline for generations to come. Moreover, the outcome of all this tinkering could be the transformation of man into an entirely new species, which may be - to quote the theological letter accompanying the resolution - ''as different from Homo sapiens as we are to the higher apes.'' Truth to tell, the rudimentary state of human gene therapy today could scarcely have inspired such a frightening scenario. A much more likely impetus behind the current movement for restrictive legislation is a series of trailblazing animal experiments. Late last year, in one of the most spectacular demonstrations to date, scientists succeeded in creating a group of giant animals. The ''Mighty Mouse'' experiment, as it was dubbed by the media, involved the injection of multiple copies of a rat growth-hormone gene into mouse embryos. Six of the resulting animals eventually grew into extreme",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

y large adults - some close to twice the size of a normal mouse. Furthermore, many of their descendants also grew into giants, showing that the foreign genes had been passed on. At about the same time, another breakthrough was announced. By introducing new genetic information into insect embryos, a mutant population of adult fruit flies achieved the status of normality within a single generation. In this case, their eye color changed from abnormal brown to healthy red. It is worth observing that the scientists who carried out these experiments were not attempting to lay the groundwork for gene therapy in man. Rather, they were interested in studying basic problems in biology. To the public, however, these genetic engineering feats are perceived as transferable to the human germline. If scientists can manufacture Mighty Mouse today, then why not Super Man tomorrow? According to Yale's Dr. Ruddle, whose laboratory remains at the vanguard of gene-transfer research, the modification of animal embryos is far from a refined, carefully modulated process. Mice, for example, normally manufacture growth hormone in their pituitary gland. But in the genetically altered strain, the liver became the chief production site for the chemical. In addition, the gene implants are only successful in about one in every 20 embryos treated; the rest usually do not survive the microinjection. ''I can't see gene therapy being administered to human germ cells in the foreseeable future,'' says Dr. Ruddle. ''For one thing, you'd have to select diseases which are sufficiently serious to warrant that kind of intervention. And probably the best way of handling those conditions would be to screen for the defect at the fetal stage and allow for elective abortion. So prenatal diagnosis will probably be the solution to those types of problems, especially when we have no guarantee that genetic therapy would actually succeed in correcting the abnormality.'' As for going beyond gene therapy to the remodeling of man, most of the characteristics likely to be targeted for improvement - health, intelligence, longevity - are not controlled by a single gene. They result from the cumulative effect of dozens, hundreds or even thousands of genes interacting with the outside environment. The manipulation of such complex and poorly understood systems has yet to be broached in animal research, and may not be unraveled for many years to come. Will we ever reach that level of technical expertise? And if so, will we seek to apply the technology to man? It is already clear that with every new insight into how we came to be, the skills for predicting and even altering certain aspects of our futures are likely to follow. As to the second question, that is more difficult to foresee. But as Dr. Ruddle and other scientists acknowledge," ''Morality changes as the times change. What we deem unacceptable today could be embraced by generations in the future.''""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"photos of Mata Layne Collins, Jim Bunning; KENTUCKIANS EXPECT A NEW LOOK IN POLITICS, WHOEVER WINS GOVERNORSHIP",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/us/photos-mata-layne-collins-jim-bunning-kentuckians-expect-new-look-politics.html,"Voters here expect Kentucky politics to have a much different look over the next four years no matter who is elected Governor Tuesday. The Democratic candidate is Lieut. Gov. Martha Layne Collins, 47 years old, a former schoolteacher. If elected, she would be the first woman to be the state's Governor. Her opponent is State Senator Jim Bunning, 52, a former Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies star player, one of four men to pitch no- hit games in both the National and American Leagues. It is not only Mr. Bunning's background in professional sports that would make him an unusual Governor; he is also a Republican. In the past half-century, two Republicans have been elected Governor of Kentucky. Few Sharp Differences The state's electorate is 71 percent Democratic, an advantage that has made Mrs. Collins the acknowledged front-runner to succeed Gov. John Y. Brown, a Democrat, who is barred by law from succeeding himself. The campaign has been less than electric. There have been few sharp differences between the candidates on the issues, and the debate between them, when it has occurred at all, has been lackluster. If this race produces a victory for Mrs. Collins, she would become not only the nation's sole woman Governor but also the highest-ranking elected woman of her party. That could add her name to the roster of possible candidates for the Democratic Vice-Presidential nomination, next year or in 1988. In an interview, Mrs. Collins said she was aware that a victory would make her prominent. ''It's a real honor to know people are thinking of you in that way,'' said Mrs. Collins. ''But right now, I'm just trying to take one day at a time. You know, I grew up in a funeral home, and I know how uncertain life can be.'' Standing in Polls Rises Some who meet her are less reticent. An investment banker introduced to Mrs. Collins at a reception here this week said he could now tell his wife he had met ''the first woman President of the United States.'' Recent polls indicate that Mrs. Collins has overcome the fears of some people in her party that her sex would be a liability in a state with very conservative political traditions. In last spring's primary race, at least a quarter of those polled admitted they would have difficulty voting for a woman for Governor. The Democrats have also managed to close ranks after Mrs. Collins eked out a narrow victory margin of 5,000 votes in the primary over the popular Harvey I. Sloane, the Mayor of Louisville, and Dr. Grady Stumbo, a state official backed by Governor Brown. Mr. Bunning, the minority leader in the Kentucky Senate, has generally been seen as facing an uphill battle against Mrs. Collins, but even his opponents say he has closed the gap since last summer. Mr. Bunning returned to his native Kentucky in 1971 after retiring from 17 years in major league baseball. He worked in Cincinnati, across the Ohio River from his hometown, Fort Thomas, Ky., as a stockbroker and agent for professional baseball players. In 1977 he was elected to the Fort Thomas City Council. In 1979 he ran for the Kentucky Senate and defeated a 16-year incumbent. Some Conditions for Victory Mr. Bunning's celebrity as a ballplayer has burnished a campaign in which he occasionally gives away autographed baseballs. Lonnie Smith, an outfielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, has campaigned in his behalf, as have President Reagan and Vice President Bush. Although Ronald Reagan won a narrow victory in Kentucky in 1980, people who follow politics say Mr. Bunning must win big in the northern Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati, close to his home, and in such traditional Republican strongholds as the Louisville and Lexington areas and the hill country of southeastern Kentucky. At the same time, the voter turnout in the state's rural Democatic strongholds will have to be lower than usual. The state has 1.8 million registered voters. So far, Mrs. Collins has raised more than $2 million in campaign contributions, twice as much as the Bunning camp. Crit Luallen, an aide to Mrs. Collins, says she is spending nearly $180,000 on television advertising alone this last week of the campaign, as against $80,000 by Mr. Bunning. Mrs. Collins, the daughter of a funeral director, a home economist by training and the wife of a banker, is conservative in style and politics. She began working in politics in 1971 and won her first statewide post, clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, in 1975. Protecting Her Lead in Polls Although Mrs. Collins has been endorsed by feminists, she opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest and seldom publicly voices her support for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN AND THE CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/women-and-the-church.html,"Kenneth A. Briggs is the religion editor of The New York Times. GNES MARY MANSOUR LISTENED intently as the Vatican's ultimatum was read to her at the Sisters of Mercy provincial house in Detroit: resign her post as director of social services for the State of Michigan or become subject to a canonical process that would lead to an imposed dismissal from the religious order she had been a member of for 30 years. At issue was her position on abortion. Although she had personally disavowed the practice before her appointment, she had indicated that she would ''tolerate the use of Federal funds for abortion'' in the performance of her secular duties. Such an action, she said, would be ''a vote for the poor rather than a vote for abortions.'' The demand to make a choice was delivered by an emissary from the Pope, Bishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Brooklyn, an expert in canon law. The 52-year-old nun, who was permitted to have two members of her order present as auditors at the late afternoon meeting, was told she had until that evening to decide. Dispiritedly, she asked Bishop Bevilacqua for dispensation from her vows. That confrontation last May 9 sent shock waves among American Roman Catholics and put advocates of women's rights in the church on the alert. Quite apart from the morality of abortion or the soundness of Agnes Mary Mansour's position, about which protesters themselves disagreed, was the question of whether she had been allowed due process according to the spirit of the Second Vatican Council. The Sisters of Mercy charged that the Vatican had not properly utilized the appropriate channels, including the order itself. Several American bishops agreed that the matter had been decided high-handedly. INCE THEN, TENSIONS OVER A cluster of related issues - from complaints by Pope John Paul II that American nuns had become too lax in their conformity to conventional vows to local church squabbles over the question of altar girls - signal that Roman Catholicism in the United States is on the threshold of a historic period of controversy and confrontation over the role of women in the church. ''It's the issue of our time,'' says Bishop Matthew H. Clark of Rochester, N.Y., one of several prelates who have written pastoral letters on the subject, ''and it won't go away. We have to explore it as much as possible.'' Discussion of the status of religious and lay women, spurred by feminism and a critical look at centuries of tradition, is now a front-burner issue in the American branch of the church. Next weekend in Washington, the subject is expected to reach a new level of public debate when American bishops sit down with lay Catholic women and those from religious communities for a frank and direct exchange of views. In advance of these discussions, women in religious communities who had been set far apart from their secular sisters are now reaching across once- wide gaps to join forces with them in an assault on the all-male ruling ethos of the church. Religious communities are also becoming open to lay associate members and large national organizations once reserved to nuns have opened their membership to lay women. Catholic women in the thousands are being educated in professionalschools of theology, many of them going on to crack the previously all-male staffs of parish councils. For some, the clear-cut goal is women's ordination. Others aim at a totaly new mentality in Catholicism that topples what they see as the damaging effects of patriarchy. As bishops run low on available male priests, some of them are calling on women to serve as ''parish administrators,'' pastors in all but name, though somewhat limited in function. Despite strict rules on these matters, women are breaking new ground on their own, often inadvertently, as they strive to minister in new ways. Some church analysts believe that the alarming shortage of priests, more than any single issue, will advance the role of women. But there are real fears that a papal crackdown will result from a study of American religious communities recently ordered by Pope John Paul II. A special committee of prelates has planned a landmark session on women and the church for the two days prior to the opening of the annual American bishops' meeting on Nov. 14 in Washington. Though the workshop, designed to be the first official colloquy of its kind on the subject is optional, about 50 of the 285 bishops have signified they will attend. A number of national Catholic women's USE THIS ONE!!! 1st after 121 groups have been invited to send delegates to speak on their behalf. Surrounding the workshop agenda are a host of issues that challenge present church practices: Has the church violated its scriptural basis by denying to women certain practices such as service as permanent deacons and preaching at the mass? Have culturally bound male patterns of dominance distorted the innate message of the Gospels regarding women? Has the church through the centuries defined itself in such a way that the spiritual gifts and experiences of women were ignored? ''Things once understood as fixed since the time of Christ actually developed later in the tradition of the church,'' says Auxiliary Bishop Amedee W. Proulx of Portland, Me. ''As we study history, I believe we'll see more clearly the impact of patriarchy on the lives of women.'' In the view of many Catholics, the results could sharply alter the church's understanding of its mission. For that reason, some conservatives fear the implications as an attack on valid tradition. The bishops' committee, headed by Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., decided to proceed with the workshop despite an ominous message from the Pope in September to a group of American bishops at the Vatican: While women must be granted dignity and freedom from discrimination, the question of women's ordination does not fit that category of justice. While ordination is a powerful symbol of injustice to many women, for most it is but one of a long list of grievances. Far more pervasive are matters that relate to equal treatment and readiness to accept the contributions women have been making to the reformulation of the post-Vatican II church. Among the aims are a larger voice in key decisions regarding the wider range of the lay ministries they are fulfilling, participation in parish programs and financial decisions and broader recognition of and respect for their ability to adapt practices to local conditions. Women involved in these endeavors accuse pastors and hierarchy of too frequently taking their ideas and experiences lightly and keeping them far from the centers of power. ''The church is afraid of sexuality and afraid of women,'' says Sidney Callahan, a psychology professor at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She says she knows of many of her generation who have left the church. Many were driven away,'' she says, by ''crass antifeminism.'' Sister Lillanna Audrey Kopp, president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, predicts there will be a mass exodus from established orders if there is an attempt to force nuns back into their traditional roles as nurses or teachers and require them to wear the habits many of them discarded following the liberalizing tone of Vatican II. ''We are going to go the route of Agnes Mary Mansour,'' says Sister Kopp, who is a member of the Sisters for a Christian Community, one of a growing number of religious groups that do not seek formal status as an order sanctioned by canon law. The goal, she says, is to gain secular power so as to aid the impoverished and oppressed, and they are determined to do it whether within or outside the framework of Catholic institutions. The storm swirling about the church has altered the lives of many women, among them Dianna Trebbi, who until 1978 was a Sister of the Holy Child. Years of wrestling with women's role in the church brought her to a moment of decision, she says. ''It was when I realized my spiritual path wouldn't change whether or not I was in a religious community. I've had nothing but peace ever since.'' In many respects, she has written off the institutional church, but another part of her, aching for a better day, keeps a close watch on the Catholic Church. Ruefully, she awaits a time when ''women will be treated like first-class citizens.'' Barbara Ann Budde, who has a master's degree in theology, has faced her own difficulties as a lay woman employed on the staff of St. Thomas Aquinas University parish in Boulder, Colo. Her title, on a staff which includes two priests, a nun and herself, is that of pastoral associate and parish liturgist. Out of necessity, she has acquired some duties once reserved only for male clerics. In her normal routine, she is responsible for parish liturgy, the training of parents preparing children for receiving the sacraments, coordinating parish music and holding liturgy conferences. But she says she faces problems of credibility as a lay woman. ''There is no expectation that my ministerial commitment to the church has the same weight as that of a priest or a religious woman,'' she declares. Asked what problem most troubles women like herself who are breaking the mold and experimenting with new roles, she unhesitatingly replies, ''The male hierarchy of the church. The maleness of the church is overpowering in general. As women increasingly become professionals, this grinds away at their sense of ministry and their sense of themselves.'' As a lay woman working as a pastoral associate at a church in an East Coast inner-city parish, Carol Anne (not her real name because she agreed to speak only on condition that she remain anonymous) says she lives in continual limbo. As the number of priests on the staff has steadily dropped from four to one, Carol Anne has, by talent and default, assumed more and more duties. Having learned Spanish, she moves easily among her parishioners, most of them Hispanics struggling to eke out an existence, organizing community groups, counseling young people and paying pastoral visits to apartments, hospitals and old-age homes. The rewards from serving people are often fulfilling, but she says there is a void inside because she does not know where she belongs in the diocese's scheme of things. ''There is just no recognition given a person like me,'' she says. ''We need to know we matter, that the church acknowledges us as valid ministers. Priests get that kind of recognition, and nuns do to a certain extent, but lay women do not.'' Sister Madonna Kolbenschlag, a Sister of the Humility of Mary and a senior fellow on the staff of Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University in Washington, says that nuns are no longer content to be treated arbitrarily by pastors of parishes who may or may not appreciate their special talents. Of women who find themselves suddenly dismissed by pastors, she says: ''Ten years ago, they would have packed their bags and left quietly. Now the response is that we are not going to allow any sister to be demeaned or tyrannized by this sort of thing.'' In a growing number of cases, women have left religious communities to enter new lives as active Catholic feminists. Some who have believe they can help forge the alliance between sisters and lay women because they better understand the problems of each group. Roddy O'Neil Cleary was a member of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary until 1969. Since then, she has married, given birth to two children and fostered two others and is now an interfaith campus minister at the University of Vermont. In terms of her relation to the Catholic Church, Mrs. Cleary is divided, regarding herself very much a Catholic but, for the most part, steering around the church. On a recent Sunday morning, for example, she preached in the university's Presbyterian church. ''While I was standing there in the pulpit,'' she says, ''I realized, painfully, that I could not go next door to the Newman Center chapel and preach there.'' USE THIS ONE!!! 2nd after 121 The attitudes of altar girls and college-age women in the church have not been studied, but impressions come from a variety of sources. The general picture points to a high level of indifference to the church as it now exists. Mature women say their daughters keep a tangential relationship with the church and attribute much of the trend to dissatisfaction growing out of sexism. Those who stay can reasonably expect a church influenced by women to a much greater extent. But a bulwark of tradition stands very much against it. When the Second Vatican Council rewrote the basic definition of the Roman Catholic Church from primary emphasis on the hierarchy to the concept of the ''people of God,'' nuns took that as a cue to strive for forms that would reflect that reality. The democratization of women's religious communities contrasts sharply with the traditional top-down style of the Roman church. It also provides the most striking illustration of American Catholicism absorbing the egalitarian ethos embedded in the founding documents of the United States. For decades, the Vatican has viewed such a progression warily, repeatedly insisting that the church is not ''a democracy.'' But American political and social values have left their mark, nowhere more deeply, and in some respects surpisingly, than among nuns. ''We took the Vatican Council seriously,'' says Sister Catherine Pinkerton, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. ''We found in our governance of religious congregations a great movement toward interdependence and collaboration, more shared than linear authority. Each of us changed our style of leadership to reflect that.'' At the same time, nuns began taking an expanded interest in social justice, involving themselves in projects relating to the impoverished. A recent study conducted by Sister Marie Augusta Neal, a sociology professor at Emmanuel College in Boston, showed a 27 percent decline in the number of American nuns working in classrooms. Politics has become a primary outlet for women in religious orders who feel frustrated by the limits placed upon them by the church. With the permission of their bishops, nuns have increasingly sought political office. Hundreds of them, like Sister Mary Madonna Ashton, the Minnesota Commissioner of Health, and Sister Ardeth Platte, a city councilwoman in Saginaw, Mich., now serve in elected and appointed positions in state and local governments. Momentum in such directions has not slowed, but both nuns and lay women have been shaken by events of the past months. ''It strikes me,'' says Sister Mary Collins, director of liturgical studies at Catholic University, that ''there is a strong attempt by the Pope to control the place of women in the church. Something has triggered a lot of fear of women and the direction they are taking. ''I think this will be a critical pastoral challenge for bishops,'' she continues. ''On the one hand, they are trying to maintain equilibrium with Rome. On the other hand, they have a pastoral responsibility to women in their dioceses and they cannot avoid this as an issue.'' A month after the action taken against Agnes Mary Mansour, another bolt of lightning struck: The Vatican announced a study to review the reforms implemented by religious orders and to determine causes of the steep drop- off in candidates for religious life. An accompanying document concentrated heavily on obedience to authority and recommended ''religious garb,'' a statement that brought a storm of adverse reaction. Though the study is directed to both men's and women's communities, the Pope clearly implied that the women's orders were his main concern. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco has indicated that fears of a ''crackdown'' are ''not necessarily justified,'' but the disclaimer has apparently done little to assuage suspicions. The more optimistic among women religious believe the study, aimed only at America, can provide an opportunity to ''educate'' clergy, hierarchy and laity about their enlightened findings. ''We're operating out of one model; the hierarchical church, out of another,'' says Sister Nancy Sylvester, of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, national coordinator of Network, a Washington-based Catholic social-justice lobby. ''Often we're just not respected or appreciated for what we have done,'' she says. Those most concerned about reforming the church acknowledge they are a minority of the more than 25 million Catholic women in the United States. But, as in other movements, the more activist elements among them are setting the tone and themes of the longer, tougher campaign to come. Among advocates of change, there are a wide variety of perspectives and goals. Because the lives of nuns are most intimately linked with the institutional church, they have often taken the lead. But increasingly their lay sisters offer support from the sidelines. In the past, nuns' vows to their communities have set them apart from lay women, who have been inclined to regard them as a privileged group. But in the post-Vatican II church, these differences have been fading. Over the last decade, lay women have been welcomed as co- or associate members of dozens of women's religious communities. Under such arrangements, they often take part in much of the community's activity and deliberations without taking vows of communal life. In some cases, single and divorced women live in communities on such a basis for varying lengths of time. For lay women, the relationship affords an opportunity to be part of a larger ministry without having to permanently leave their families or completely sever themselves from their professions. The religious communities say they benefit by the emotional support and creative thinking they receive from the outside. Similarly important is the trend by large Catholic women's organizations to pull together around some shared aspirations. Of these groups, the National Assembly of Religious Women and the National Coalition of American Nuns take the most activist and liberal stance, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, comprising the heads of religious communities, represents a more midstream position and the National Council of Catholic Women, by far the largest, with 8,000 separate lay groups from altar societies to the Daughters of Isabella, has been relatively conservative. USE THIS ONE!!!! 3rd after 121 A recent positon paper by the National Council of Catholic Women calls for a means of giving formal status to ''ministries for women,'' suggesting that women could be commissioned for such work in a public manner. In addition, the lay group has joined the call for a study into the possibility that women could be ordained as permanent deacons. In many parishes, women function as lectors who read portions of Scripture during the mass and serve as extraordinary ministers of the eucharist, distributing communion in its wafer and bread and wine forms. Many hold seats on parish councils and participate on diocesan-wide pastoral councils. Increasingly, women are serving with priests on pastoral teams, responsible for an area of parish ministry such as education or visitation of the sick. Furthermore, some bishops have begun appointing members of women's religious communities as parish administrators where priests are not available. These women function as priests in all respects except two: They may not consecrate the bread and wine in the eucharist or hear confessions. Otherwise, they lead liturgical services, baptize babies, bury the dead and umpire at the parish softball games. Striking as these shifts may be to many of the 51 million American Catholics, many women activists mix modest hopes with a large dose of wariness. Centuries of male control still militate against women, they say, and that legacy dies hard. Jacqueline Grennan Wexler, president of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, who was formerly a nun and president of Catholic-run Webster College in St. Louis, calls herself ''skeptical and reverent.'' Among the sources of distrust, she says, is that a ''male celibate clergy'' promulgated the rules on sexual morality, including birth control, without consulting women. ''People who knew the most were simply not involved in discussions or deliberations.'' The conventional male image of God likewise prompts objections. As a substantial body of feminist theology has built up, the criticism of the traditional modes of talking about God has grown louder. ''We had grown up with a male image, a judgmental powerful God,'' says Mrs. O'Neil Cleary, who holds a Doctor of Ministry degree. ''The feminine side of God is not always in control. Pain and suffering is a dilemma that finds God not in control. But God is connected to this all by being all-nurturing, all- caring.'' Prof. Rosemary Ruether, one of the most widely read Catholic theologians, thinks feminist theology is gaining much greater acceptance. ''People come up to me and say they heard me speak on these matters 10 years ago and that I'd scared them to death. Now it seems reasonable to them,'' says Professor Ruether, who teaches at the Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Ill. Evidence of this widening acceptance of feminist theology and deepening sympathy for women's causes within the church could set the stage for further assaults against liberalism by the Vatican and bring bishops to loggerheads with officials of the sacred congregations which handle the business of the church. Many of the American bishops who have carried on discussions with Catholic women on various points though their special committee say that in the process they have undergone a conversion. ''I learned a lot about the patriarchy of the church,'' says Bishop Michael F. McAuliffe of Jefferson City, Mo. ''The dominance of the male in society, and all the affects that has had, were the patterns the church adopted. In terms of women's gifts and the ways in which we have used them, we have wronged women terribly by not allowing them to use their ministry in the church.'' Like some other prelates, Bishop McAuliffe sees the Vatican as the source of much of the present difficulty. ''There is some misunderstanding on the part of the Vatican about things that happen in the United States,'' he says. ''The Mansour case is an example. It should have been handled in the United States, not by the Vatican.'' In their ad limina (routine) visits to the Pope this autumn, several bishops registered their concerns and spoke on behalf of American women. Bishop Imesch, who will lead next weekend's workshop, said he asked the Pope about allowing altar girls, a subject of some confusion and much debate among Catholics inasmuch as the revised code of canon law, due to be implemented at the end of this month, has no precise directions. The Pontiff did not reply, Bishop Imesch says, but ''in my interpretation of his facial expression, I wouldn't say I got a 'No,' or a frown or a shake of the head. I'd say he either accepts it or is indifferent.'' Did the response surprise him? ''It was very interesting to me,'' Bishop Imesch says. ''I expected to get blown away.'' In the near future, the Catholic bishops of the United States are expected to begin writing a pastoral letter on women's role in the church. The process toward reaching agreement could likely be as rigorous and heated as the prolonged and anguished debate that preceded the issuance earlier this year of their pastoral letter on nuclear arms. Already under way is a look at the possibility that women could be ordained to the permanent diaconate. For more than 10 years, the church has been ordaining men to this office, a role that had been neglected for centuries. Roman Catholic deacons, who may be married, do not generally go on to become priests, but their work as parish assistants has become invaluable in many situations. They are entitled to perform all the work of priests except the sacrament of penance and the celebration of mass. Proponents of women deacons believe that there is a precedent for the role in the annals of early church history. But others, such as Bishop Bevilacqua, now Bishop of Pittsburgh, think the search for such authentic examples is likely to prove fruitless. The idea of opening the office to them has been greeted with mixed responses from women. Some believe such a step would be a foot in the door to the eventual ordination of women as priests, while others view the move as a sop to placate women's demands for a greater place in the ecclesiastical order. Hundreds of Catholic women are already theologically prepared to step into any clerical role. A recent survey of 27 Catholic seminaries by the Women's Ordination Conference found that 634 women were studying for Master of Theology degrees, the general equivalent of a male seminarian's preparation in theology but far more than expected of men preparing to be permanent deacons. Women are not allowed to pursue these studies in the Master of Divinity program required of seminarians at Catholic institutions, but hundreds of them are acquiring Master of Divinity degrees at non-Catholic theological schools. Many voice hurt and defiance, but none of those interviewed suggested that women are about to renounce what they have achieved. Sister Madonna Kolbenschlag reflects this determination when she asserts that the church cannot ''put the toothpaste back in the tube'' or ''make us caterpillars after we have become butterflies.'' Mrs. Wexler underscores the same point in a more impassioned manner. ''They'll never own our souls again. We'll make up our own minds.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDENTS' VIEWS ON CHEATING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/style/students-views-on-cheating.html,"A survey of 2,000 teen-age achievers has found that nearly a third of them said that at times they cheated in school. A majority said parents, teachers and religious leaders should share the responsibility for teaching children not to cheat. Thirty-two percent of the 2,000 students surveyed said they cheated. But almost as many, 28 percent, said they had never done so, while 38 percent said they had cheated but no longer made a practice of it. The recently released survey, the 14th in annual succession, involved student leaders listed in the new edition of Who's Who Among American High School Students and was conducted last summer by the book's publisher, Educational Communications of Lake Forest, which made the results public. Seventy-three percent of the students said that teen-agers are not as bad as adults think they are and that adults tend to pay attention to troublemakers. Three-fourths of the respondents reported that they never have had sexual intercourse. Fifty percent of those who said they had engaged in sexual relations acknowledged that they did not use birth control every time and 26 percent said they took no precautions. Half the girls surveyed said they would want to get married if they became pregnant while 33 percent said they would not because they were too young. Thirty-three percent said they would have the baby and raise it alone if necessary; 25 percent said they would have an abortion. More than 90 percent of the students said they had never tried cocaine, angel dust (PCP) and other hallucinogenic drugs, amphetamines or barbiturates. Eighty-three percent said the same about marijuana, while 12 percent had tried it but said they no longer used it. Thirty-four percent said they occasionally drank hard liquor and 32 percent had an occasional beer; a third said they had never drunk liquor and 22 percent said they had never tasted it. The survey included these results: - Fifty-five percent of those polled said they knew how to use computers. - Sixty-nine percent think mathematics and science education should be upgraded. - Thirty-nine percent think the Federal Government should set high- school graduation requirements. - Eighty-two percent said the reason some teen-agers graduated from high school without basic skills was that they could choose easy courses. - A majority said they thought President Reagan was doing a good job politically and in economic and domestic policy, but 47 percent said they thought he was not doing as well in foreign affairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLERIC'S TEACHING ON MEDICINE IS CITED IN 57 INDIANA DEATHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/us/cleric-s-teaching-on-medicine-is-cited-in-57-indiana-deaths.html,"The founder and leader of a religious group with members so faithful to his teachings that they allow spouses and children to die rather than seek medical help preaches that medicine is evil and doctors are little better than magicians. The clergyman is 63-year-old Hobart Freeman, the head of the Faith Assembly, which has been in the limelight in recent months because of reports that dozens of followers have died from untreated illnesses. Yet John J. Davis, a seminary professor, describes Mr. Freeman as ''brilliant'' and ''a good theologian.'' Mr. Freeman does not grant interviews and has not spoken to the press since the deaths among members of the Faith Assembly, which have been put at 57 by The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, came into the news. But Mr. Davis, a former student of Mr. Freeman at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Ind., persuaded Mr. Freeman to talk with him. Mr. Davis shared his insights in an interview and in recent articles in The Warsaw Times-Union. Grace Seminary is associated with the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, a fundamentalist Protestant group that had a national membership of 41,000 in 1982. He Became More Withdrawn The image of Mr. Freeman that emerged through Mr. Davis is one of a man who has grown more withdrawn and more narrow in his beliefs. Mr. Freeman earned degrees in divinity and theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. He later broke with the Baptist Church, charging, among other things, that Christmas and Easter were pagan celebrations. By 1959, he had switched to the Brethren Church and earned his doctorate at Grace Seminary. Again, however, he began to criticize his church. Four years later, he was excommunicated and dismissed from his teaching post at Grace. Mr. Freeman, who had polio as a child and has had several heart attacks, teaches that supernatural healing based on faith is the only acceptable treatment for illness and injury, Mr. Davis said. Mr. Freeman underwent kidney surgery before founding the Faith Assembly, according to Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis noted that the application of Mr. Freeman's doctrine on the ''historic connection between witchcraft and medicine'' resulted in a distortion of one's sense of reality, which allowed parents and spouses to ignore the suffering of their loved ones. ''There's an incredible intensity of dedication,'' Mr. Davis said of the Faith Assembly members. ''It is a faith with no compromises, and that seclusion coupled with very dogmatic demands have resulted in personal tragedy for several people.'' The Appearance of Faith Mr. Davis said members of the Faith Assembly, based in the tiny northern Indiana community of Wilmot, shun smoking, drinking, drugs, abortion and the theater. Mr. Davis said he saw people remove their eyeglasses before entering the church and then squint at their Bibles rather than be labeled faithless for wearing corrective lenses. Other demands by Mr. Freeman that were listed by Mr. Davis included giving up insurance policies, refusing immunizations and medication of any kind, removing seat belts from cars, destroying credit cards and never borrowing money. The idea is that God will protect, Mr. Davis said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SPAIN GROWS LESS PRUDISH, BUT NOT YET LIBERTINE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/world/spain-grows-less-prudish-but-not-yet-libertine.html,"A bent, elderly woman dressed entirely in black, from her stockings to her head scarf, was moving slowly down the street when she came upon a piece of paper on the sidewalk. It was a page from a popular magazine, a photo of a naked couple in amorous embrace. The woman looked around slowly, stooped to pick it up and stared at it. Then she marched to a wastebasket, ripped the picture about eight times and dropped it in. In this brief encounter, the two Spains met. One, old-fashioned, churchgoing, morally upright. The other, modern, hedonistic and, so it seems, increasingly assertive. The Changes Come Fast Back in the Franco years, Spain was the Victorian spinster of Europe. Now this has changed. Spain is not exactly a Babylon, but it has caught up with the rest of the Continent, and the changes in moral behavior and permissiveness seem doubly striking because they have occurred so fast. ''When I was my daughter's age, my father wouldn't let me go out of the house without a chaperon,'' said Teresa Gonzalez, a Madrid hairdresser. ''Even so, I had to be in by 11 o'clock. My daughter goes out to some place - The Joy Esclava - and I'm lucky if she comes back by dawn.'' The Joy Esclava is a discoth eque, one of dozens with elaborate lighting displays and high-tech sound systems that have made Madrid's night life suddenly famous among young Europeans. After all, where else these days are the streets crowded at 2 in the morning? ''In Paris, the cops are all over you,'' said a young Englishwoman, her hair dyed blue and red, puffing on a marijuana joint at a recent concert of Police, the rock group. ''London's too expensive and you never see the sun. Rome, well, it's O.K. but a lot of crime. Spain's the place to be.'' No Kissing in Public In the old days, the power of the Roman Catholic Church and the state's anti-Communist crusade drew the limits. Crime was low but widely defined. It was illegal for a boy and girl to be seen kissing in public. Spanish jails were filled with would-be drug smugglers trying to bring hashish from Morocco to the lucrative market of northern Europe. Movies were so heavily censored for sex and politics that the plot sometimes ended up on the cutting room floor. A famous example was the film ''Mogambo''; wanting to avoid any suggestion of adultery between Clark Gable and Ava Gardner, the censor transformed them into brother and sister, thereby arousing Spanish audiences with the spicy theme of incest. Now hard-core pornography plays in movie houses and soft-core sells at newsstands. Prostitutes are commonplace and visible - American tourists eating at McDonald's on the Gran Via can watch them solicit across a small square - and one member of Parliament suggested setting up an official red light district to control the trade. Transvestites are featured attractions in the floor shows of expensive nightclubs, lending a certain prewar Berlin atmosphere of decadence to the place, and they also tend to congregate on a particular corner of the central Castellana Boulevard past midnight. If a car stops, one is liable to get in. Beaches Are Now Topless In contrast to the rigorous dress codes enforced decades ago, Spanish beaches are now topless and some are bottomless as well, which often shocks American bathers. Exceptions still exist in conservative areas such as Galicia in the northwest. Foreigners held a demonstration in the town of Puerto del Son there this summer to agitate for a nudist beach, braving the anger of local women who, dressed in black, turned out with sticks and threatened to burn them. Some of the changes have been ushered in by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Filipe Gonzalez, voted into office a year ago. Convinced that Spain's moral code was anachronistic in imposing heavy penalties for crimes not recognized as crimes elsewhere, the Government has passed legislation to liberalize the penal code. The liberalization began with an earlier regime, which legalized divorce. But the Socialists speeded up the process considerably. Among other things, Parliament has enacted bills to legalize sex changes, permit sterilization and, most significantly, to legalize abortion in therapeutic cases. Most striking of all was a bill approved last April that legalized the possession of drugs, even hard drugs, including heroin, as long as they were held in small quantities and for personal consumption. In effect, Spain went in a single stroke from having one of the harshest drug laws in Europe to one of the most liberal. Trafficking Still a Crime Penalties remain for people trafficking in drugs - up to six months for soft drugs and from six years to 12 years for hard drugs. But some international drug experts believe these will not prove a sufficient deterrent to major dealers. They predict a shift in the pattern of European drug traffic, with Spain replacing the Netherlands as a prime distribution center. In addition, changes in the criminal justice laws aimed at reducing extremely long delays for people awaiting trial have led to the release of thousands of prisoners. This has combined with a widespread perception that crime is on the rise to make safety in the streets something of a potential issue for the right-wing opposition. The issue dovetails with that of morality, since the right views this as its special preserve and believes that the moral fiber of the country is disintegrating. The Socialists answer that they are not sponsoring a change in the moral standards of the country but simply recognizing that one has already occurred. ''I myself am not in favor of abortion,'' said a Cabinet minister, speaking privately. ''But in the 20th century, people are going to go out and get abortions, and it's absurb to send them to jail for doing so.'' Fame for 'The Foxes' The morality issue culminated six months ago in a fuss that arose when a female punk rock group called the Foxes, appearing on a television show watched by young people, sang a pornographic song titled ''I Want to Be a Whore.'' A tape of the show was played for legislators, the state prosecutor began an investigation and the Foxes became famous all over the country. But the controversy died down, and recently Spaniards seem to have adjusted to a lower threshold of moral respectability. Recently, for example, many were puzzled over the scandal in Britain in which a married Cabinet minister, Cecil Parkinson, was forced to resign because of disclosures that his secretary and mistress had become pregnant. A similiar experience happened to the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister, Alfonso Guerra, who is also married. The episode was publicized in the papers but did not really set tongues wagging and in no way diminished his effectiveness as a public figure.

HOUSE AGAIN GETS SPENDING MEASURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/10/us/house-again-gets-spending-measure.html,"After a startling defeat Tuesday night, House Democrats scrambled today to salvage a stop-gap appropriation bill that would keep sizable segments of the Government running after their spending authority runs out Thursday night. Party leaders said they would bring the legislation back to the floor on Thursday, and they predicted its passage. Meanwhile, Senator Bob Dole acknowledged today that time was running out on his attempt to fashion a package of deficit-reducing measures before Congress adjourns. The Kansas Republican said that while he was still trying to work something out this year, he might wait until Congress reconvened in January before bringing the bill to the Senate floor. In the House, many of the freshman Democrats who voted against the stop- gap bill Tuesday night as a way of protesting Congressional inaction on budget deficits said they would now reverse themselves and support the appropriations measure. ''Yesterday's vote was intended to call attention to Reagan's budget deficits,'' Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, told the Rules Committee today. ''Many members feel they've made their point and would like to have another chance.'' Senate Considers Bill Meanwhile, the Senate took up the temporary spending bill, officially known as a continuing resolution, and quickly bogged down. When the lawmakers failed to kill an amendment by Senator Jeremiah Denton, Republican of Alabama, which would ban the use of Federal funds to finance virtually all abortions, Senator Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, started to filibuster. Senate leaders then pulled the bill off the floor. Despite the protest vote by first-year House Democrats, chances seemed to be fading today that Congress would make a major effort to reduce budget deficits before the lawmakers quit work for the year, perhaps at the end of next week. Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. severely criticized the deficit reduction package worth about $150 billion now being drawn up by Senator Dole, who heads the Finance Committee. ''No way is the Dole bill going through the House,'' said Mr. O'Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat. The Democratic leader was particularly critical of suggestions that the Dole package would reduce cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients, and explained, ''That's not the Democratic philosophy.'' Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican who opposes the Dole proposal, said, ''I think it's dead''. Senator Dole said in an interview that a new version of his proposal would try to cool down some of the ''hot buttons,'' such as Social Security reductions. Freshmen Defend Action In the House, the 26 freshmen who helped scuttle the temporary spending bill Tuesday night defended their action as an act of frustration and principle. Many had campaigned last year against rising budget deficits, and they feel that Congressional leaders are not taking the problem seriously enough. Referring to Speaker O'Neill, Representative Jim Bates, Democrat of California, said: ''He listens, but he's not doing anything.'' ''I want a tax bill,'' added Mr. Bates, a leader of the freshman rebellion. ''If we spend money we should pay for it.'' But many fellow Democrats excoriated the freshmen for what they felt was an ''act of folly,'' in the words of Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader. ''They meant well,'' Mr. Wright said, ''but often one can be so clever that he's downright stupid.'' Most Democratic leaders in the House believe that it is political suicide for them to vote for the sort of major tax increase favored by the freshmen, or Senator Dole, unless President Reagan backs it first. If the President does not support the tax increase, they say, he will turn the issue against the Democrats in next year's campaign. ''I don't see any reason to get our head cut off again on that,'' said one senior Democrat. Appropriation Bills Remain The stop-gap spending bill is necessary because Congress has passed only eight of the 13 appropriation bills that annually allot money to different parts of the Federal Government. Theoretically, the five other sectors will run out of money Thursday night and have to shut down, unless new spending authority is adopted. Realistically, the disruption caused by a failure to meet the deadline is not very great, particularly inasmuch as Friday, Veterans Day, is a Federal holiday. But Congress still feels an urgency to pass a bill. When the legislation reaches the House floor on Thursday, Democratic leaders will offer one grab-bag amendment that would increase education spending by almost $1 billion and increase foreign aid by almost $400 million, mostly for Israel and Egypt. The House leaders believe that the Senate version will include funds for the International Monetary Fund, which are ardently desired by the President. Accordingly, they hope to arrange a trade. Democrats would approve the money for the International Monetary Fund, which has been stalled for months, and Republicans would accept the increased spending for domestic programs and foreign aid. Their hope is that Mr. Reagan will find that to be a package he cannot refuse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/11/opinion/no-headline-035886.html,"Baby Jane's 'Defender' When Dr. C. Everett Koop was named Surgeon General in 1981 he was, under the law, seven months too old for the job and had virtually no experience in public health. These barriers, however, soon collapsed because it was not Dr. Koop's qualifications that made him so attractive to the Reagan Administration. It was his opinions. In 1979 Dr. Koop went on tour with a film whose message was that abortion leads inexorably to euthanasia for the elderly. He has described amniocentesis, a procedure used to detect disorders in fetuses, as ''a search-and-destroy mission.'' Now, by championing a cruel intrusion into the case of Baby Jane Doe, he shows who he thinks should head the American family: the Federal Government. Baby Jane is one month old. She suffers from spina bifida and its concomitant, hydrocephalus. She also has an abnormally small skull, indicating a diminished brain mass. Her life expectancy is two years. With spinal surgery it might be 20. Her parents, after considerable consultation, opted for conservative care and no heroic measures. ''We know,'' her mother said, ''that as she grew older, she would always be an infant. She would never know love. And while she might feel sorrow and joy, her overall condition would be pain.'' Dr. Koop thinks he knows better. Besides, it isn't really the bedridden, severely retarded Baby Jane he's concerned about; it's the idea of her: ''We're not fighting for this baby. We're fighting for the principle of this country that every life is individually and uniquely sacred.'' To serve that principle, Dr. Koop would sacrifice patient-doctor confidentiality and a family's right to privacy. After reading medical records that are not only incomplete but confidential until a Federal judge decides otherwise, he declared Baby Jane's parents, doctors, clergy and social workers wrong. Also the New York State Court of Appeals, which supported her parents' decision. Dr. Koop has it almost right when he says, ''If we do not intrude into the life of a child such as this, whose civil rights may be abrogated? The next person may be you.'' Just delete the ''not.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE JOINS ANTIABORTION MOVE IN LATE NIGHT ON MONEY BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/11/us/senate-joins-antiabortion-move-in-late-night-on-money-bill.html,"The Senate struggled beyond a midnight deadline this morning in efforts to complete action on a stopgap spending measure that, in addition to financing a sizable part of the Government, would broaden the ban on the use of Federal funds for abortion. The House of Representatives, which rejected the emergency money bill Tuesday, reversed itself Thursday and sent the bill to the Senate by a 224-to-189 vote after a group of freshman Democrats who had voted against the measure, angering their party's leadership, switched positions. The Senate, in its consideration of the House bill, narrowly approved the antiabortion provision, which would prevent Federal employees from using their medical benefits to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother. But senators stripped the bill of a Democratic-sponsored $1 billion increase in money for education and health services. A number of amendments were still to be considered by the Senate this morning, and after final action in that chamber a conference committee will have to resolve differences in the two versions before final passage. Little Impact on Holiday The delay technically left a number of Government agencies without the authority to spend money, but since today is a Federal holiday, Veterans Day, the expiration of funds was expected to have little effect other than to disrupt legislators plans for a long weekend. The stopgap action is necessary because, though the fiscal year began Oct. 1, Congress has not yet passed individual appropriation bills allocating funds for foreign aid, the Postal Service, the Treasury and the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, Justice and State. Absent such a stopgap measure, the agencies without appropriations are no longer authorized to spend money. In the past, however, agencies have continued to operate for more than a week after the expiration of spending deadlines. Since the fiscal year began, those programs have been financed by a similar stopgap measure, which expired at midnight. The spending resolution now under consideration would continue funds for the affected programs at the current level until Feb. 29. As separate funding bills are adopted, they will supersede the stopgap measure. Reversal on Abortion The provision removing abortions from Federal employees' health coverage, long sought by antiabortion forces, has passed the House frequently in the past three years, but it had always been rejected in the Senate. Opponents of the measure argue that Federal employees should be able to use their medical benefits as they wish. Thursday night, however, the Senate voted 44 to 43 to keep the antiabortion language in the spending bill. The House approved the ban by voice vote Oct. 27 in an appropriation bill for the Treasury and Postal Service, and that bill, still pending in the Senate, was incorporated into the stopgap measure. Current law restricts the use of Federal funds such as Medicaid for abortions, but does not forbid the Government to offer Federal employees health insurance plans that cover abortions. The Reagan Administration has favored the broader restrictions on abortions. The Government-subsidized health insurance plans cover 10 million Government employees, retirees and their dependents. The Office of Personnel Management has reported that 17,000 abortions were financed last year through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Freshmen Sent a Message The House approved the spending resolution after first-term Democrats who voted against the identical measure Tuesday night reversed themselves, explaining that they had merely intended to send a message to the leadership and the White House. ''We voted against passage to make a single statement: that the budget deficit has got to be addresseed and addressed soon,'' said Representative Jim Moody, Democrat of Wisconsin. The freshman Democrats were assailed by Republican leaders, including Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority whip, who wondered aloud how the freshmen would explain their vote switch. ''Are they going to switch around and say, 'We were worried about deficits two days ago, but we're not worried about deficits now'?'' he asked. Tax Bill Held Unlikely Despite fears in both chambers about a deficit approaching $200 billion, a deficit-reduction program was interred, at least temporarily, by both Senate and House tax writers Thursday. The chairmen of the two tax-writing committees acknowledged that it was unlikely that any tax bill, even a modest one, would be approved this year. The House approved the $1 billion increase in funds for education, child nutrition programs, and other social programs by 235 to 181, over Republican objections. Representative Silvio O. Conte, Republican of Massachusetts, said the Democrats' education proposal was ''nothing but a blatant political issue.'' ''The true intent is to give the Democrats an issue in November to provoke a veto, so they can say 'we tried,' '' Mr. Conte said. But Representative Jim Wright, the Texas Democrat who is majority leader, countered, ''We do not seek a confrontation with the President, but to give him an opportunity to balance his priorities a bit more fairly.'' 'Democracy in Inaction' Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, called the proceedings ''democracy in inaction.'' ''While the majority rails against deficits,'' he said, ''they intend to add to them.'' Mr. Wright replied that the Democrats wanted to reduce deficits by reducing programs that aided the rich, not the poor. The amendment, which the Senate rejected later by a vote of 53 to 36, would have allocated funds for 15 social and education programs, including vocational education, adult education, community service block grants, low-income energy assistance, education for the handicapped, and emergency shelters for the homeless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOUSE AND SENATE AGREE ON SPENDING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/12/us/house-and-senate-agree-on-spending.html,"House and Senate negotiators agreed today on a catch-all spending bill that is needed to keep parts of the Federal Government operating through Sept. 30. The compromise bill included an additional $100 million for education programs promoted by House Democrats, far below their original proposal of almost $1 billion. The White House had threatened to veto the bill if it included sizable amounts for extra domestic spending, but Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, expressed confidence today that President Reagan would sign the bill. The compromise clears away one of the major obstacles Congress must overcome as it tries to meet its goal of adjourning next Friday. However, the Senate remains snarled in a bitter dispute over a bill raising the national debt ceiling, and a resolution of that issue is still far away. In the other major conflict resolved today, the negotiators agreed to spend $11.5 billion on foreign aid, $170 million less than the Reagan Administration had requested. One provision of the bill would bar El Salvador from using 30 percent of its $64.8 million aid package until verdicts are returned in connection with the killing of four American churchwomen there. Officially, several major areas of the Government lost their authority to spend money this morning, when an earlier temporary spending bill expired. But since today was a national holiday, the cutoff had little meaning, and both houses of Congress are expected to approve the compromise with little dissent on Saturday. Today's bill is necessary because Congress, though the fiscal year began Oct. 1, has passed 8 of the 13 appropriation bills that are annually needed to finance the Government. Temporary catch-all measures like this one generally continue funds at previous or tentatively approved levels until individual spending bills are adopted, replacing the continuing resolution as the spending guideline for the covered departments. Agreement between the two houses came relatively quickly, as lawmakers in both parties seemed exhausted and eager to finish their work. The House passed its version of the bill Thursday evening, but a marathon Senate session did not end until 3:40 this morning. The main reason for the lengthy session was a proposal to prohibit Federal workers from using their health benefits to finance abortions, except when the life of the mother is in danger. This provision has long been sought by opponents of abortion, and resisted by those who favor a woman's right to choose abortion. Opponents of abortion won a series of test votes in the Senate over the last several days, and eventually the abortion rights forces gave in rather than delay passage of the entire bill. As a result, this is the first major Federal spending bill to contain such a ban. For several years, recipients of Medicaid have not been allowed to use their benefits to pay for abortions, and there now seems a clear decision in Congress to eliminate all cases in which Federal funds are used to finance the procedure. But Congress has rejected all attempts to restrict the right of women to choose privately financed operations. Compromise on Education House Democrats had promoted their $1 billion education package as a way of dramatizing their differences with the Reagan Administration and forcing the Republicans to make a potentially damaging vote against a popular set of programs. Early today, the Democrats proposed to trim their package to $250 million, but that was rejected by Senate and House Republicans who argued that the Administration had threatened ''flat out'' to veto even that amount. The standoff stood for several hours, but nobody had the stomach for a prolonged battle. ''The House has made its point,'' said Representative William R. Ratchford, Democrat of Connecticut. ''Eventually,'' said Representative W. G. Hefner, a North Carolina Democrat, ''We have to face up to what we can get through here.'' Eventually the Democrats did face up to that reality and offered their scaled-down package, which included $25 million to educate the handicapped, $10 million for vocational education, $30 million for the teaching of immigrant children, and a variety of smaller amounts. The Republicans, realizing that the Democrats needed something to save face, went along. On foreign aid, Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, called the agreement ''a true compromise.'' One problem was the military assistance program, which aids such countries as Turkey and Portugal. The final total of $510 million was about halfway between the House figure and a higher Senate figure. The compromise also included sizable aid increases for Israel and Egypt, as part of efforts to reward countries that aid in American Middle East peacekeeping efforts. The sectors of Government included in today's legislation include the military, which should have its own appropriation by the end of next week, foreign aid, the Treasury, the Postal Service, and the Departments of Agriculture, State, Justice and Commerce. Only foreign aid, and perhaps Treasury and post office, are expected to spend the entire fiscal year under the bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STAMPS;
NEW ISSUES STIR A NATIONWIDE CONTROVERSY",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/arts/stamps-new-issues-stir-a-nationwide-controversy.html,"Is religion increasingly making its  way onto the stamps of this nation, which was founded on the separation of church and state? Is this a marked break with the past - and if so, does anyone really care? These questions arise as a result of the controversy that has accompanied the newly-issued Martin Luther commemorative. It was preceded by last year's commemorative for St. Francis of Assisi. There is no doubt that the Luther stamp pleased millions of Lutherans and the stamp for St. Francis pleased not only Catholics, but also many others because he seems to be, in our day, the one saint most non-Catholics also admire.  The political climate has been right for the stamps. The record of the Reagan Administration on support for school prayers, for Bob Jones University's racial policies, on anti-abortion and a score of other issues in which religion is a factor is well known. The Moral Majority is closely allied with the President. There was even an implied White House endorsement of the Luther stamp through the support of Edwin Meese, the President's Councilor and a Lutheran. There are some Americans, however, who raise the question of whether a secular state should honor any sectarian figure. They maintain that an agency of the United States government has no business paying tribute to religious figures on its stamps. As the Postal Service well knows, stamps inform, educate and influence. Maybe not the regular issues, which tend to go unnoticed, but the commemoratives do get attention. It has put out stamps urging people to register and vote, to support youth, for law and order, and a variety of other causes the government endorses. The stamp becomes a medium of endorsement. This year the Postal Service has put out stamps for causes dear to the heart of President Reagan, for volunteerism and for physical fitness. These stamps are obviously intended to make an impression on the user. President Reagan recently is reported to have asked the Postmaster General for a commemorative for Hispanic-American servicemen. Soon from the White House came indications such a commemorative would be issued in 1984. Another concern was voiced at the time of the St. Francis stamp by Edd Doerr, director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. He said: ''St. Francis was known primarily as a religious figure. If he is honored by the Postal Service, then there will surely be floods of demands that we honor other religious figures in the Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Mormon and other religious denominations. It is a trend in the wrong direction and certainly violates the spirit if not the letter of the First Amendment.'' Then there are some philatelic strict constructionists who maintain it is right for the Germans to honor a native son and the Latins, predominantly Catholic rather than secular nations, to honor St. Francis. But they note that neither has direct links to the United States except in the stream of religious thought and philosophy. So they ask, why not Buddha, Confucius, Plato, Aristotle and many others? The pattern of buildup for the issuance of the two stamps is similar, and could serve as a blueprint for similar new commemoratives now being worked on. A petition for the issuance of the stamp for St. Francis from Rep. Peter W. Rodino of New Jersey bore more than 100,000 signatures, including 40 Senators, 71 Representatives and 45 governors. In addition to obvious Roman Catholic backing, there was support from such Protestant groups as the United Churches of Christ, the United Presbyterian Church and the American Lutheran Church. Rep. William Dannemeyer of California, a Lutheran, led the political endorsement campaign for the Martin Luther stamp. Again it was backed by Senators and Representatives in Congress, as well as national, state and local leaders, many of them Lutherans. Again, there were enough non-Lutheran endorsements to indicate broader support. In both instances the patterns of political pressure on the Postal Service were identical - and effective. There was one important difference in the two stamps. The stamp for St. Francis had the endorsement of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee. This is a panel of distinguished collectors, artists and other persons of note that examines subjects for forthcoming stamps and later the designs for them and makes recommendations to the Postmaster General. Its role is advisory. But the panel, on at least two occasions, balked at recommending the Luther stamp, a decision that in a sense points up the controversial nature of the issue. The final decision has always been the Postmaster General's. Using this authority, the Postmaster General authorized the Luther stamp. The Postal Service, a veteran of the religious wars, has been careful to protect its flanks in both issues. There is no identification of either figure, not even a ''St.'' with Francis. In brief announcements, Luther was an advocate of universal education; Francis a humanitarian. It appears that the Postal Service had better be prepared to do more walking on eggs because the floodgates appear to have been opened. The United Methodist Church is reported to be seeking a 1984 commemorative for the 200th anniversary of Methodism in America. Followers of another religious leader, Emanuel Swedenborg are working for a commemorative in 1988. The gates have been opened and the waters are beginning to pour in. In the present climate the Postal Service may even welcome the waters, but there is always the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice who was unable to stem the rising waters. In fact, the opposition to the two stamps for St. Francis and Luther also wants a commemorative, as explained in an editorial in Church and State, the publication of the organization mentioned above. It says in part: ''Soon the Postal Service will have an opportunity to demonstrate that it is sensitive to the principle of church- state separation. It will have an opportunity to approve the issuance of a commemorative in honor of the 200th anniversary of one of the greatest documents in the history of the American republic, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. ''Written by Thomas Jefferson in 1777, the statute became the pattern for the First Amendment. Without it America would not be the free nation it is today. . . . By issuing a stamp in 1986, precisely 200 years after the Virginia legislature endorsed the statute, the Postal Service would not only commemorate a great piece of legislation, it would remind Americans of one of the nation's enduring principles, particularly at a time when that principle is taken for granted by some and denied by others.'' The Postal Service's earlier religious wars began in 1962 when the United States put out its first Christmas stamp, a wreath with candles, followed in 1963 by the National Christmas Tree at the White House and in 1964 by a block of four with holly, mistletoe, poinsettia and a sprig of conifer. In response to those who wanted to put Christ into Christmas, the next two years brought stamps with religious symbolism and touched off a counter reaction. The compromise of 1979 brought a truce to the battle: users were offered a choice of a religious issue or a secular issue. The compromise was reinforced in the 1980's when the Postal Service began referring to its religious stamps as ''art masterpiece'' issues. This year's Madonna and Child by Raphael is called a ''traditional'' issue. In addition, ''Season's Greetings'' has replaced ''Christmas'' on the secular stamp, also known as the contemporary Christmas issue. The problem of religion and stamps is not simple, for the foundations of American history are rooted in religion. The Pilgrims are on American stamps; they were a religious group. Roger Williams, another stamp subject, founded Rhode Island in pursuit of religious freedom. Father Jacques Marquette, who explored the Mississippi appears on two issues - but sans the word ''Father'' and with emphasis on his explorations. Washington at prayer at Valley Forge on a Christmas stamp; Washington taking the oath of office with his hand on a Bible or in other circumstances with a suggestion of religion disturb no one. The circumstances are true and the emphasis is not on religion. More recently, in 1979, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. appeared on a commemorative. To be sure, the ''Rev.'' is omitted though he appears in a minister's robe, but more important he appears as a civil rights leader who helped bring great changes in America. There has been a commemorative for the historic Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island that goes back to Colonial days. There have been various churches in the Architecture Series. The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City has appeared on a postal card in the Historic Preservation Series. Anyone who views these landmarks as religious has to be straining. All these stamps and others deal with American history and the American heritage. Is this true of St. Francis and Luther? The Postal Service seems to be going farther afield, on a course that could be increasingly controversial. The United States noted that it was in the good company of West Germany, which has put out a commemorative for a native son that shows Luther pointing to a passage in the Bible. More surprising is that it is in the company of Communist East Germany, which, after many years of bad-mouthing, has decided that Luther had many qualities that make him worthy of commemoration. Another Communist nation, Czechoslovakia, has also issued a portrait commemorative for him. So has Communist Hungary, which places him against a background of church spires. France has issued a vertical showing Luther in his priestly robes. Brazil has also put a vertical that shows Luther clasping the Bible. It also shows the family's coat of arms, the so-called Lutheran rose carved in a stone wall of the house where Luther lived and still distinctly visible even today. A stamp from the Netherlands shows a torn sheet symbolizing the break with the Roman Catholic Church and Luther's signature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WMCA IS A RADIO STATION ATTUNED TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/arts/wmca-is-a-radio-station-attuned-to-making-a-difference.html,"Tomorrow morning, people who listen to WMCA will hear this voice, recorded in the upstate New York women's prison known as the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility: ''There are a lot of strangers in here. That's one thing I had to learn when I came in. I was sure everyone knew one another except me. I was the one outsider. And, of course, we're all strangers in here.'' It is the voice of Jean S. Harris, convicted of the March 1980 fatal shooting of Dr. Herman Tarnower, the so-called ''Scarsdale Diet'' doctor and serving a 15-years-to-life sentence. ''It seems so unfair,'' Jean Harris's voice goes on. ''I see women in here and I think if you had lived or gone to the schools my children went to, there's no way in the world you'd be in prison today. Which really isn't very fair, is it?'' It will be the first of five days of extended interviews with Mrs. Harris conducted by Ellen Sulzberger Straus, president of WMCA, as part of a series, ''Women Behind Bars,'' to be broadcast every morning this week by the station from 8 to 10 A.M. In addition to the Harris interviews, the series will focus on other women in prison, on corrections officers, prison officials and volunteer workers. But it is the Harris interviews, arranged by Mrs. Straus with Mrs. Harris's attorney, Michael Kennedy, that have already caused a bit of a stir. (Unlike the practice prevalent elsewhere of paying for exclusive interviews, WMCA did not pay for these interviews.) ''It's controversial. We're hearing that she's up there for murder, and why are we putting her on the air. There's lots of antagonism,'' says Mrs. Straus. ''Our view is that Jean Harris is an amazing educator, that she is contributing to the process of education in prison. She is working in a nursery. Her contribution is 10 hours a day, educating, because she is worried about children. Since all prisoners come out sometime and because there's a possibility of rehabilitation, re-education, what she has to say is valuable.'' According to R. Peter Straus, her husband and chairman of Straus Communications Inc., which owns WMCA, it just isn't enough for a radio station to simply play music, send out news broadcasts, respond to listeners or even to be benignly relevant. ''You have to take a stand,'' he says. And for 40 years WMCA, an independent station that bills itself both as ''Good Guy Radio'' and, because of its call-in format, ''The Conversation Station'' has been taking stands. The only non- publicly owned family radio station in the country, it looks for different ways to do things, inserts itself with some force into the city's fabric, from time to time makes waves. ''We like to think occasionally we give voice to the voiceless,'' says Mr. Straus, who is not only chairman of WMCA but also of WFTR/WIXV-FM in Front Royal, Va. ''We want to be broadcasters, but we want to make a difference,'' adds Mrs. Straus. Nor would the Straus family at WMCA, which now includes Jeanne, the youngest of the couples' three daughters, as vice president and programming director, and their son Eric, as local sales manager, have it any other way. Over the years, WMCA was the first station in the country to editorialize on political and civic issues; the first to endorse a national Presidential candidate when it announced support for John F. Kennedy in 1960; the first radio station to ''throw cigarette advertising off the air, and that was before the Congressional mandate,'' according to Mr. Straus; the first to take so-called ''issue advertising,'' from pro-abortion groups and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, for example, and the first station in the city to accept advertisements for contraceptives. Lest it be thought the Strauses have been giving all of their time to the Jean Harris tapes, it should be noted that the station has been about other business as well, business that for broadcasters is quite novel. Less than a month ago the station began a series of ''Conversations With . . .,'' which places two prominent people together in free discussion. The first participants were David Rockefeller and Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. That two public figures conversed is not notable. What makes ''Conversations With . . .'' different is that it is not for broadcast. Instead, the Strauses invite a group of people they usually refer to as community leaders to listen to the conversation, then ask members of that group to comment on the conversation, to argue, differ, take stands. ''What we're trying to do is bring together leaders of groups in the city who do not ordinarily see each other,'' says Mrs. Straus. ''What we're doing is focusing on groupings within the city, because there is not as much interaction as there once was,'' adds Mr. Straus. ''This bodes ill for the city. It's nice to see ourselves as a group of villages, but we can't be a Lebanon.'' The broadcasts that arise out of these conversations - arranged by Isabelle Leeds, the station's director of public affairs - are called ''My Point of View'' and are being used as inserts throughout WMCA's broadcasting day. WMCA's current format is talk - talk from its on-the-air people and feed back from its listeners - and it is successful. In the morning, two network veterans, Bill Ryan, formerly one of NBC's star anchors, and Ralph Howard, a former CBS reporter, sit in a studio cluttered with newspapers, books, scribbled notes, half-empty coffee containers, their headphones draped over their ears, talking about the news, interviewing people in the news, commenting, reading commercials, giving the weather, skewering the Jets and Giants in collaboration with the station's sportscaster, Bill Daughtry, all the while seemingly having a good, spontaneous time with each other. Other regulars include a resident psychologist, Dr. Elise Goldstein; a family finance counselor, John Scheuer; interviewers Sally Jessy Raphael, Barry Farber and Bruce Williams; Danny Meenan, one of the best street reporters in radio; Robert Lowe, who has made a neat switch from lawyer and city official to food commentator; the quite abrasive yet quite popular Bob Grant, and the man who seems to evoke either admiration or active dislike, Barry Gray, who has been broadcasting on WMCA for more than 30 years. These days, Mr. Gray has sort of returned in time to conversing with guests in restaurants, much as he did years ago with daily broadcasts from Chandler's. These days it is Tuesdays at Elaine's. WMCA was not always talk. When it was bought by Mr. Straus's father, Nathan Straus Jr., in 1943, it was a middle-of-the-road station with music, news and features, among them a live 30-piece symphony orchestra, broadcasts from Lindy's, and each night ''Five Star Final,'' dramatic re-creations of the day's news. R. Peter Straus joined the family business in 1946 after a tour of duty in the Air Force just as the station changed to a popular-music format. From 1950, the year the Strauses were married, until 1958 Mr. Straus served with the International Labor Organization in Geneva, rising to director of the U. S. office there. The couple returned to the station in 1958, he as president of the broadcasting group, she as director of public affairs. The station was a popular- music station throughout the 1960's, but changed to ''talk radio'' in the next decade, the course it has followed since. During that period, Mr. Straus served as assistant administrator for Africa for the Agency for International Development and then, from 1977 to 1980, as director of the Voice of America. Mrs. Straus was an editor and columnist at McCall's during that period; in 1977, when Mr. Straus became chairman of WMCA and the broadcasting group, she was appointed president, and manager, of WMCA. The station has grown to include 75 employees and reaches an estimated audience of one million people a week. The Strauses have initiated ''Call for Action,'' an on-the-air ombudsman service that has become a national organization, and ''Crime Stoppers,'' a cooperative effort with police departments that is designed to help solve cases still considered ''open.'' It, too, has become a national program. Just recently, the station became even more of a family affair when daughter Jeanne, 26, a Darmouth graduate who had worked for the Associated Press and the White House News Agency, joined the station as vice president and programming director, followed soon after by her brother Eric, 24, who after graduating from Yale and working in sales at other stations became WMCA's local sales manager. The Straus's two older daughters, Diane Straus Tucker, 32, a caterer, helps do station parties, and Katherine, 30, director of special projects for Boston University, ''constantly helps us with special events,'' says Mr. Straus. Jeanne Straus says she finds it difficult to call her bosses Ellen and Peter, because ''I keep slipping into 'Mom' and 'Dad,' '' but that is the only bother in a job she enjoys. She ''brainstorms with the producers over who we should be putting on the air, who we should be interviewing, and rarely does a day go by when the four of us, Mom and Dad, and Eric, all of us don't end up in one office chatting, perhaps discussing what we should do as a station to resolve some of the city's problems.'' Adds Ellen Straus: ''When we can't resolve them, we editorialize.'' Eric says that his job at the family station ''is very much a question of proving yourself. If they think, or I think, I'm getting bored, they throw me an assignment. Here it's always a challenge, you're always working up to, even beyond what you think is your capacity.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE NATION; RITE OF PASSAGE, RIGHT ON CUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/weekinreview/the-nation-rite-of-passage-right-on-cue.html,"On Capitol Hill, tradition can often be all. Last week, it almost was. Arguments over token deficit-reduction schemes continued long past a midnight deadline, complete with passionate debate over Federal workers using their health benefits for abortions. Eventually, pro-choice forces gave in, but not before a stopgap spending bill to fund agencies and departments lacking regular appropriations expired and the Government was pushed into technical shutdown for a couple of days. As he regularly has, President Reagan won on his defense build-up. As it regularly does, the dairy lobby triumphed. Only in the matters of telephone deregulation and fees (see box at right) and the composition and independence of the Civil Rights Commission was there some stab at honoring the new. Under an agreement reached near midnight Thursday, a new eight- member rights commission - half appointed by the President, half by Congress - would replace the six- commissioner White House-appointed agency created by the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The President's authority to remove commissioners would be limited. The White House rejected a similar proposal a month ago. It agreed this time around because civil rights lobbyists, armed by anger at President Reagan's firing of commissioners critical of his policies, had rounded up enough votes for a panel over which Congress alone would have authority. The dairy lobby expressed its clout in the House. A bill that would not only not reduce milk price supports, as Administration budget cutters wanted, but would for the first time pay dairies for not producing milk, passed, 325 to 91. The Senate approved production funds for the MX missile, 56 to 37, then moved on to the new nerve gas weapons the President wants. For the second time, Vice President Bush cast the deciding vote, after an assist from New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato, who switched his vote to enable the tie that Mr. Bush broke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPENDING MEASURE PASSED IN CAPITOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/us/spending-measure-passed-in-capitol.html,"Both houses of Congress today quickly adopted legislation needed to finance some Federal Government operations when they open for business Monday morning. Congressional leaders said President Reagan would sign the bill, assuring no disruption of Government services. The vote was 173 to 136 in the House, but the Senate approved the bill by voice vote. Senate leaders admitted that most members had left town for the weekend and that the Senate could not have mustered a quorum if it had been forced to pass the bill by recorded vote. The main item in dispute was an amendment pushed by House Democrats adding almost $1 billion in spending for various educational programs. The compromise reached Friday cut that money to less than $100 million, and today Democratic leaders admitted that they had been bested by the Republican-controlled Senate and the veto threat of the White House. ''This is the best we can get at this particular time,'' Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader, told the House. But Democrats feel that by forcing Republicans to oppose their rider they have made a political point that could be used in next year's campaign. ''We've drawn the line one more time on the Administration's attitudes on social and educational funding,'' said Representative Vic Fazio of California, a Democratic member of the Appropriations Committee. Republicans, however, believe that the Democrats have opened themselves to the charge that they have not reformed their big-spending ways. The legislation, known technically as a continuing resolution, is needed because Congress has adopted only eight of the 13 appropriations bills that annually provide money for Government operations. The foreign aid section of the bill appropriates a total of $11.5 billion, about $170 million below what President Reagan requested. The measures includes a significant increase in aid for Israel, including $550 million for development of a new Israeli fighter, the Lavi. Egypt also received a big boost in aid, but help for Syria was virtually eliminated. El Salvador would get $64.8 billion, well below the Administration request and subject to some conditions. For the first time, the bill also contains language banning the use of Federal health insurance for abortions. For several years, recipients of Medicaid have not been able to use public funds to finance abortions, and the extension of the ban has been ardently sought by anti-abortion activists. Bill Has 'Some Piglets' The debate on the House floor today also touched on an inevitable part of all spending bills: pork barrel projects that benefit particularly powerful or persuasive lawmakers. When challenged on this issue, Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, answered, ''There are some piglets in here, but not any pork.'' One juicy piglet was a provision allowing Lykes Brothers, a steamship company based in New Orleans, to purchase four used ships from Japan and then fly them under the American flag. Flying the flag entitles a ship to operating subsidies, so by law, the privilege is reserved for American-made vessels. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said the deal would save 1,200 jobs in his state, but other lawmakers worried that it would cost jobs in theirs. As a compromise, Mr. Johnston accepted a requirement that two of the ships be refurbished in American ports. Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, played a little pork barrel politics as well, winning $7.4 million for the Tennessee Valley Authority, money he said was needed to keep the Ocoee River an attraction for white-water rafting. He also had to swallow an alteration. Another legislator to bring home the bacon was Representative James J. Howard of New Jersey, chairman of the Public Works Committee, who acquired $9 million for a new Federal courthouse in Newark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INITIATOR OF 'BABY DOE' CASE UNSHAKEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/nyregion/initiator-of-baby-doe-case-unshaken.html,"Lawrence Washburn Jr., the lawyer who began the court fight to force surgery on a severely deformed Long Island infant, says that despite legal setbacks he still believes that the parents of the baby girl do not have the right to block the operations. Mr. Washburn, a 48-year-old municipal-bonds lawyer by profession, has for the past 13 years pressed ''right to life'' lawsuits in many states on behalf of unborn fetuses, handicapped minors and severely ill patients. Despite a ruling by the New York State's highest court upholding the right of the parents to withhold the surgery for ''Baby Jane Doe,'' as she is known in court papers, Mr. Washburn says of his effort that he would ''of course, do it again.'' In an interview from Vermont, where he lives, Mr. Washburn said: ''Strictly speaking, the parents don't have the right to refuse life-preserving surgery. What the Court of Appeals said was that this is not life-preserving surgery. I think they are wrong on the facts.'' Child Now a Month Old Mr. Washburn has never seen the child, now a month old and under care at University Hospital at Stony Brook. Nor has he met her parents. The child suffers from spina bifida, an opening in the spine; hydrocephaly, a build-up of fluid in the skull, and microcephaly, an abnormally small head. Her parents say physicians have told them that part of her cerebral cortex is missing, a condition that cannot be corrected. Without surgery, the infant may live from six weeks to two years. With it, she may survive until she is 20, but her doctors say she will be severely retarded, epileptic, bed-ridden and paralyzed from her waist down. Three days after the birth of Baby Jane Doe on Oct. 11, Mr. Washburn said, he received a confidential tip that she was being denied ''life preserving surgery.'' He sued, and a State Supreme Court justice ordered the surgery. The ruling was overturned by the Appellate Division in Brooklyn. 'Distressing and Offensive' The case reached the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, in two weeks, and on Oct. 28, the court said the young couple had the right to withhold surgery. In a unanimous opinion, the court called the suit ''distressing and offensive.'' The court said the parents should not have been subjected to the stress and expense of litigating the case, particularly since Mr. Washburn ''had no disclosed relationship with the child, her parents, her family or those treating her illnesses.' The court chastised both Mr. Washburn and the State Supreme Court justice, Melvyn Tannenbaum of Suffolk County, for failing to call in the state's Department of Social Services, which has jurisdiction over child-neglect cases. ''I accept their criticism,'' Mr. Washburn said in the interview. ''I used a procedure I thought they had accepted in the past. I have to do some soul-searching now. I could have handled it differently, with a bit more compassion for the parents.'' Religion Basis for Beliefs A Roman Catholic, Mr. Washburn said his religious beliefs had a strong bearing on his decision in 1970 to challenge a New York abortion law. This was the so-called friend of the fetus case, the first suit in which Mr. Washburn brought a suit on behalf of an unborn child. Since that time, Mr. Washburn, whose father, Arthur Lawrence Washburn Sr., was a well-known New York City physician, has been a dogged anti- abortionist lawyer, tracking cases across the country. For three years he led the fight, along with the America United for Life Legal Defense Fund, to defend the Hyde Amendment, which limited Federal funds for abortion for poor women. Mr. Washburn knows well the argument that he is without authority or standing to enter a case in which he suffers no direct harm. In the ''Baby Jane Doe'' case, he faced that issue and agreed to withdraw once a guardian was appointed to represent the infant's interests, he said. Court Fight Succeeds In the Hyde Amendment case, he represented a physician who said she was seeking to protect all the unborn in the nation. The Supreme Court upheld the Hyde Amendment in 1980. Mr. Washburn maintains that the decision by the parents of ''Baby Jane Doe'' to choose a conservative course of medical treatment is not valid. Along with Dr. C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States, who was instrumental in bringing a pending Federal suit for the infant's medical records, he says he believes that every life is sacred and that ''Baby Jane Doe'' should be saved. He said the risk in these types of cases is that parents will refuse surgery to corrct a physical defect because they do not want to raise a mentally retarded child. The parents of the infant, who are also Roman Catholic, said in an interview that Mr. Washburn was entitled to his views, ''but to push those views upon ourselves,'' the father said, ''was unacceptable.'' 'The Best Professional Help' ''We had the best professional help sitting in with us,'' the father continued. The parents said their daughter will not have any awareness of life. ''As for profoundly retarded children,'' Mr. Washburn said, ''well they are here to protect, they are also 'l'enfants bon Dieu,' the children of the good God, they are given to us because it is our call to heroism, to greatness, to have a child like this.'' Mr. Washburn is affiliated with general practice law firms in Albany and on Long Island. He is also associated with a ''pro-life public interest law firm'' in Huntington, L.I. Mostly, he said, he volunteers his services for cases involving individual children. In the big cases, he said, the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund in Chicago absorbs much of the cost. Meanwhile, the parents have run up $6,000 in legal fees. The father said yesterday that this fee was only for state court costs. ''And it continues to grow,'' he said, referring to the suit filed by the Federal Justice Department to get the infant's medical records. That suit is now on the trial level, but could go higher, said the father, a building contractor who described himself as ''lower-middle class.'' David D. Siegel, professor of law at Albany Law School and an expert in New York practice and procedure, said ''there is nothing clearly applicable in New York law'' that would allow the couple to recover legal fees in the state case. ''What parents in this situation need is some legislative help,'' he said. Mr. Washburn said the Federal case is ''taking too long.'' ''I lost a baby once because I stopped to type papers,'' he said. ''I am concerned that the law is not able to respond to life-threatening situations such as this.'' Consequently, he said he might be forced to enter the Long Island case again. ''I am considering an approach to the U.S. Supreme Court,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEVOTED AND MISERABLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/books/devoted-and-miserable.html,"THE LETTERS OF JOHN MIDDLETON MURRY TO KATHERINE MANSFIELD   Selected and Edited by C. A. Hankin. 394 pp. New York: Franklin Watts. $18.95.   THESE are letters, never before published, that the critic and editor John Middleton Murry wrote to Katherine Mansfield during his 11 years with her as lover and husband. Though he wrote nearly every day during their long separations in her search for health, this collection includes a little more than half the letters, partly because of repetitiveness, partly because their relations were at times so unbearably strained that Mansfield may have destroyed the evidence. After her death in 1923, along with her stories and journal Murry published her letters in two volumes, from which he removed some as too painful for publication. He wrote a confessional autobiography, ''Between Two Worlds,'' to perfect her image and improve his own, gave public lectures about her and in general bared his soul to the extent that he was accused of exploiting his dead wife. He came to be known as ''the best-hated man of letters in the country,'' at one time or another mocked by almost everybody - Bertrand Russell, who found him ''beastly''; D. H. Lawrence, who called him a ''coward,'' an ''obscene bug'' and a ''mud-worm''; Virginia Woolf, who thought him a ''posturing Byronic little man,'' an egoist bleating his confessions to absolve himself of blame. One wonders whether these letters, appearing 60 years after Katherine Mansfield's death, can in any way alter the concept of Murry as the villain of the piece. It seems to me they go far to do so, to even things out between two miserable people, badly mated, destined to hurt each other through a profound difference in their natures, one of them desperately fighting for her life and making a frantic cry for the help the other couldn't give. The fact that their love remained constant gives their helplessness the more poignancy. Five months before she died, Mansfield wrote in a letter to be read after her death, ''In spite of everything - how happy we have been! I feel no other lovers have walked the earth together more joyfully - in spite of all.'' When they first met in December 1911, Murry was a small, nervous, shy Oxford undergraduate of 22, the editor of a short-lived periodical, Rhythm, for which he had accepted one of her early stories. Mansfield, 10 months older, filled Murry with awe at her obvious sophistication, beauty and caustic wit. She was already married to George Bowden (whom she had left after their wedding night), she had had several love affairs, a miscarriage and an abortion, and she was suffering from the tuberculosis that eventually killed her. By his fifth respectful letter, Murry had begun the apologies typical of him: ''Sorry I was so boring - can't be helped.'' At her urging, he moved to London to share her flat at 69 Clovelly Mansions, where after a few weeks she, always the aggressor, asked, ''Why Helen Bevington's most recent book is ''The Journey Is Everything: A Journal of the Seventies.'' don't you make me your mistress?'' to which, waving his legs in the air, Murry replied, ''I feel it would spoil - everything.'' When he did become her lover (an inept one) and the landlord, discovering they weren't married, evicted them, they moved from one squalid flat to another, to Buckinghamshire, even to Paris to escape their creditors. It was always the same, an odd, insecure, teetering relationship from which neither could withdraw. In February 1915, Mansfield decided to leave Murry to join a new lover, Murry's Parisian poet friend Francis Carco, in the war zone in France, and Murry saw her off at the boat train. ''I'm not sad, or miserable, darling - only just vaguely uncomfortable,'' he wrote that night, adding he was coming down with a cold. When she returned 10 days later, disillusioned by the adventure, Murry was busy buying furniture for a flat and putting up shelves in the kitchen. ''Oh, Tiggle,'' he wrote, ''we are the lovers of the world. We are the lovers that were dreamed by God.'' MANSFIELD'S fatal illness, not diagnosed till December 1917, marked the real start of the nightmare. It lasted with little respite for either of them for the next five years, keeping them apart while she sought a cure away from England and grew steadily worse, more lonely, more terrified, more demanding of his love. The happy times were spent when he was able to join her briefly in the south of France, Italy, Switzerland. After George Bowden finally divorced her in 1918, Mansfield returned to London seriously ill, where on May 3 she and Murry were married, though, as she wrote from Cornwall, to which she fled six weeks later, it was only part of the nightmare after all: ''You never once held me in your arms and called me your wife.'' Murry replied, ''My soul was struck dumb with terror at your illness.'' In her devouring need of him, she bitterly resented his ability to live without her, his passivity, his unwillingness to touch her. She accused him of wanting to be rid of her. He could only protest, ''When I see you sick & ailing, I die.'' Close to nervous collapse himself, he wrote, ''I'm a mean little sneak; but it can't be helped.'' Early in 1919, Murry became editor of the literary review The Athenaeum and prospered in his work while Mansfield went to stay on the Italian Riviera, not alone but accompanied by her faithful companion, Ida Baker. His letters enraged her by their hurried tone, obtuseness, self- absorption, self-pity. She wrote of spitting blood, and he wrote of being terribly constipated - ''No figs that's what it is.'' He sent her a spoon for her porridge, called her ''old girl,'' issued daily bulletins about their cats. Yet at the same time, he was hunting for a dream house to buy for her, finding one in Sussex, where he promised they might some day settle down in peace and love and have babies. They never lived there. AFTER reunions and separations and as her ''new husband,'' death, beckoned and Murry's anguish mounted with a sense of guilt at having failed her, in October 1922 Mansfield suddenly went to the Gurdjieff Institute at Fontainebleau and wired her farewell to Murry. She sought now the spiritual salvation offered by the mystic George Gurdjieff, a step that Murry couldn't understand or condone. Communication nearly ceased between them. When Mansfield sent for him on Jan. 5, 1923 (''I hope you will decide to come, my dearest''), Murry, overjoyed to be asked, arrived four days later at Fontainebleau. They spent a happy afternoon, about which Murry recorded, ''She told me she had felt that her love for me had had to die . . . but now at last, she said, 'My love for you has all come back to me, greater than ever.' '' At 10 o'clock that night, while climbing the stairs with him to her room, she had a violent hemmorrhage and died. Murry's letters in this volume, beautifully edited by C. A. Hankin, must be read entirely for what the reader sees in them, either to deplore or condone. Placed beside hers, they become an eloquent presentation of his side of the story. By their admissions, they portray a weak man, indecisive and afraid, who might have given more of himself, might possibly have prolonged Mansfield's doomed life by staying at her side. But he wasn't like that. In his way, he was loyal and persistently loving, with an unfailing belief in her as a writer of genius, encouraging her till she cried, ''Do not overpraise me.'' After the six troubled, often tormented, years as her lover, he chose to marry her when, had he been the coward he was called, he might have refused. Mansfield, for her part, chose him again and again, the only one, and always for love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JOHN GLENN: THE HERO AS CANDIDATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/magazine/john-glenn-the-hero-as-candidate.html,"Howell Raines is national political correspondent in The Times's Washington bureau. IN SMALL TOWNS, ROUND-BELLIED legionnaires snap to attention, salute and rush to tell Senator John Glenn the name of the atoll they helped defend in World War II. Babies are thrust at him. He is asked to autograph $20 bills or shirt cuffs or, at a country airport in Iowa, the cover of a 1962 issue of Life magazine that bears his photograph over the worshipful caption ''The Making of a Brave Man.'' At a meeting in Washington, the state and local officials of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. industrial unions dutifully applaud former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the 100 percent union man they will later endorse. But when John Glenn comes in, they line up with their cameras to snap his picture. That's what happens when celebrity achieved outside the political arena is introduced into an election contest. Star appeal worked well for Ronald Reagan in 1980, and it has enabled John Glenn to move from a back-of-the-pack post in the Democratic Presidential sweepstakes to challenge Mondale for the lead. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows Democratic voters narrowly split between the two leading candidates, with 49 percent for Mondale and 41 percent for Glenn. The newly released film, ''The Right Stuff,'' with its portrayal of Glenn as an astronaut hero, has given his campaign a publicity send-off unlike any in the annals of Presidential politics. And he is ideally positioned to take advantage of the kind of pratfalls to which front-runners like Mondale are historically susceptible. Yet Glenn has a long way to go. He is still struggling to fashion a political persona and a cogent platform of ideas upon which to campaign. And for all his nine years in Washington, the Senator is still better known as an icon of the Space Age than as a compelling leader whose speeches and legislation shape public and Congressional opinion. In fact, many Democratic leaders insist that unless Glenn can lift himself to that higher plane occupied by such masterful campaigners as John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, he will be unable to convert his celebrity into enough votes to win the nomination. Moreover, in a two-man contest with Mondale, Glenn gives away huge advantages in money, organization and endorsements from powerful constituency groups and political leaders. Even Glenn's own strategists maintain that they do not expect him to finish the primary season with a majority of the delegates. Indeed, they say that if he cannot knock the wheels off the Mondale bandwagon on March 13 - the date of the ''Super Tuesday'' primaries - Glenn may be out of the running. Victories in the South on Super Tuesday, however, could start him on a roll. Such a result would have an impact far beyond the nomination battle itself. For one thing, it might resolve the identity crisis within the Democratic Party, torn today between loyalty to the ideas and political coalitions of the New Deal and the need for fresh policies and a broader appeal to mainstream voters. A Glenn nomination could also influence how Americans will select their Presidential candidates in the years ahead. The role of party leaders in that process, already weakened by the rise of Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980, may never be the same if John Glenn takes the nomination. For some time, political experts assumed that President Reagan would probably win re-election. But his economic and social policies have shredded the grass-roots electoral coalition he built in 1980, and in the past few months Reagan has become entangled in foreign crises. The death of more than 200 Marines in Beirut and the commitment of American troops to the invasion of the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada have led Democrats to revive the old charges that Reagan is reckless and warlike. The President's potential vulnerability could strengthen the hand of John Glenn, whom the polls identify as Reagan's strongest Democratic adversary. But first Glenn must get the nomination. He has only a few months in which to sell his proposition that he is the most electable candidate of a party that is not yet sure what to make of him. T WAS EARLY MORNING, AND THE candidate had settled back for the flight to Mississippi. He would have preferred to be in the pilot's seat of this small jet instead of in the passenger section, just as he would have preferred to be reading a flight plan rather than the black-bound briefing book that his secretary, Mary Jane Veno, had dropped into his lap. As he read, he also kept an eye out for unusual cloud formations to point out to Annie, his wife of 40 years. The man who has spent thousands of hours squinting into the sky cannot resist watching it. Everyone who knows John Glenn well talks about him as ''a natural aviator.'' Not even his most worshipful aides call him ''a natural politician.'' For Glenn, elective politics is an add-on interest that came fairly late in life, and not an original, ruling passion. But if this sturdy man who looks younger than his 62 years is not a ''natural,'' he is nonetheless a raw political talent of great potential. He is also facing, in Mondale, one of the most deeply experienced, best-organized and well- financed candidates to seek the Presidency in this era. What is being tested is whether John Glenn's raw talent can be brought to a state of refinement equal to the task before him. In fact, the learn-as-you-go Presidential candidate has changed in the last year. Two illuminating points in that process: A midsummer visit to central Mississippi and a fall forum in New York City. On the runway apron in Meridian on that sleepy July morning, a welcoming committee pressed forward to meet the Glenn plane as it rolled to a stop. ''Annie, get your fanny out there,'' said the candidate as he scrambled out of the jet. A tall, ruddy-faced stranger approached Glenn and introduced himself. He was Maurice Dantin, the man in charge of the Glenn campaign in Mississippi. ''I'm your state chairman here,'' he said. ''Nice to have you.'' It was a telling scene. Mondale knows the Maurice Dantins of America - in many cases, he knows their wives and law partners and staff aides - on a first-name basis. John Glenn had to spend the first half of 1983 meeting such people for the first time. He does better with crowds, such as the hundreds of families at the Neshoba County Fair down the road in Philadelphia, Miss. In a dusty, tree-shaded campground, Glenn was virtually mobbed by autograph seekers. This John Glenn - in shirt sleeves, sweat beaded on his balding pate - was in his element. He is one of the rare politicians who makes firm eye contact and asks people's names as he works a crowd. Other celebrity politicians hand out printed signature cards; Glenn still signs autographs. Even in such hectic scenes, Glenn, who was known in the space program for his preternaturally slow pulse beat, seems unhurried and accessible. But then it was time for him to speak. As usual, Glenn's oratory failed to sustain the excitement created by his arrival. His voice skewed upward toward a pipsqueaky tenor on his punch lines. His main gesture was the stiff, double-handed chop of a man trying to show how long a fish he had caught. Glenn's basic speech - outlined on a stack of intricately notated index cards - was a blend of prairie populism and civics-book patriotism. ''Everywhere that Americans spread off the Eastern seaboard, heading west across this country, they put up the schoolhouse first, hired a schoolteacher and put all the kids in school,'' Glenn said. ''That was something new in our society, new in the whole history of the world, that all the kids would be in school, that education was not just for the wealthy and just for what would have been the kids from the castle in Europe.'' As Glenn plowed ahead, it became clear that the speech was a battle map for claiming the broad central terrain between Reagan and Mondale. He depicted the President as a cranky ideologue who wanted to ''roll us back to days of yore.'' He warmly recalled the New Deal social reforms, but by adding a chastening word about programs that ''went too far,'' distanced himself from Mondale. When Glenn departed from his notecards, however, he ran into trouble. The Neshoba County Fair has the strongest segregationist identity of any major political event in the South. Glenn emphasized his strong record on civil rights, but he played to the white crowd by omitting his usual detailed criticism of Reagan for failing to enforce the civil-rights laws that are already on the books. Later, in television interviews that reached Mississippi's powerful black constituency, he compounded his political error by endorsing ''the old values, the old traditions that are epitomized by the fair.'' Glenn advisers later confirmed that the Neshoba example illustrated the candidate's problems with political sensitivity. Glenn did not realize that for many Americans the phrase ''traditional values'' means segregation or religious discrimination or denial of women's rights. Early in the campaign, an adviser commented that Glenn was simply ''not prepared for 90 percent of the groups he goes before - women, blacks, Democratic regulars.'' By October, Glenn's campaign skills had improved. The problems of political sensitivity still lingered - witness his suggestion at the annual convention of the National Organization for Women that proponents of the equal rights amendment had not worked hard enough for its passage. But there were incremental gains in his speaking ability. ''He just got tired of hearing he was a lousy speaker,'' said Robert J. Keefe, a Washington lobbyist who serves as a senior consultant to the Glenn campaign, ''and exerted his competitive nature against it.'' And the most striking development was the increase in Glenn's confidence level. There was a general assumption among his opponents that Glenn would be a pushover when it came time for debates with other candidates. In fact, in a series of joint appearances with the other candidates, Glenn held his own, demonstrating a well-developed ability as a rhetorical counterpuncher. The first time all seven candidates appeared together was at Town Hall in New York on Oct. 6. Glenn arrived eager to settle a score. Several days earlier, Governor Cuomo had been quoted as calling Glenn a ''celluloid'' candidate. Glenn, who had been courting the Governor in hopes of an endorsement, was angered at what he saw as an implied connection between President Reagan's film career and ''The Right Stuff.'' David Sawyer, Glenn's media consultant, and Greg Schneiders, his press secretary, urged him to answer the charge at the forum and offered to prepare a response. Both men recall that Glenn waved them off. ''No, don't bother,'' the candidate said. ''I know what I'll say on that one.'' What Glenn said won him what might have been the biggest ovation of the night. ''As far as the celluloid charge,'' he said, ''I wasn't doing 'Hellcats of the Navy' on a movie lot when I went through 149 missions. When I sat atop that booster, it wasn't 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars.' '' It was an important moment in the political development of John Glenn. The way in which he seized a chance to make his point showed some growth in his confidence as a speaker. The candidate who had stumbled in Mississippi when he strayed from his note cards could rise to an occasion. What's more, he went on that night to confound the predictions of Mondale aides that he would falter when the candidates started mixing it up. At the end of the program, he challenged Mondale, suggesting that his campaign was a captive of special interests - ''any group with a letterhead and a mailing list.'' In the following weeks, Mondale and the newly combative Glenn went at each other, and Glenn gave about as good as he got. He made some tactical errors - for example, attacking Carter Administration programs he himself had supported - but on balance, Glenn profited from the exchanges in several ways. Mondale and the press had started treating him as Mondale's equal in what was now clearly perceived to be a two-man race for the nomination. Glenn had cast doubt on Mondale's boast that he would be the automatic winner in the series of campaign debates scheduled to start early next year. In general, the learn-as-you-go candidate had showed that he was educable. But his speaking ability was still far from dazzling and the question of whether he could become a galvanizing television presence was still unanswered. The job of converting fame into political power was proving hard. Glenn was trying to accomplish on his first time out what had taken Ronald Reagan three tries - and Reagan was a ''natural.'' Sometimes, Glenn seemed to yearn for those simpler days when it did not matter what a man said so much as what he did. So, last summer, as John Glenn's campaign plane drifted across the moonlit Gulf from Mississippi to Florida, where the next day he would face a union audience that was not particularly eager to hear him, his thoughts turned to the things that truly stir him. And he spoke longingly of airplanes and rocket ships, of G-forces and of the unmatchable feeling of ''hanging in the straps'' as his body floated free from the gravity - and cares - of the world. OHN HERSCHEL GLENN JR. IS A man with three birthdays. The private citizen, World War II combat flier and career Marine officer was born on July 18, 1921. John Glenn, astronaut and national hero, was born on Feb. 20, 1962, when he became the first American to orbit the earth. And John Glenn, the politician, was born one night in December 1962, when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited John and Annie Glenn to dinner at Hickory Hill, the Kennedy estate in McLean, Va. Kennedy suggested that Glenn run for political office. The proposal, Glenn recalls, did not come as a complete surprise. Psychologists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had early on decided that among the seven original astronauts chosen in 1959, Glenn was the most eager and the best able to handle public life. In the period of wild adulation that followed his 81,000-mile space journey in Friendship 7, the sandy-haired Ohioan had rubbed shoulders with plenty of politicians, including President Kennedy, and he had formed some definite impressions. For one thing, he told friends, he was not interested in the House of Representatives. The publicity-hungry Congressmen, always shoving to get into a picture with the hero of the hour, had repelled him. But the Senate, that citadel of power and respectability, appealed to Glenn. And the Senate was what Bobby Kennedy had in mind. The Attorney General confided that his brother believed that Senator Stephen Young of Ohio would be a liability in the 1964 election, when Kennedy would be running for a second term. Robert Kennedy proposed that Glenn, with White House political support and, it was hinted, with financial and technical help from the powerful Kennedy campaign machine, return to his home state and run against Young in the Democratic primary. But Glenn held back, in part because of a feeling of loyalty to the space program. President Kennedy's assassination in 1963 prompted a period of reappraisal. Glenn began to think more seriously about the Ohio Senate race. But he worried about exposing himself and his family to the deal-making and trade-offs that he characterized to friends as the ''ugly side of politics.'' The question, Dr. Robert Voas, a former NASA psychologist, recalls, was whether Glenn could ''become comfortable with the kind of compromises that are the lifeblood of politics.'' Finally, while on a family vacation at Big Bear Lake in California, Glenn reached a compromise with himself. He would enter politics with the goal of reforming its ethical structure, rather than allowing politics to reshape his own idea of integrity. Such was the origin of one of the leitmotifs of Glenn's political career: the search for opportunities to stand up to political authority figures and to reject the politically expedient course as a means of proving to himself that he had not sold out. The roots of Glenn's rigid moral code lay in New Concord, Ohio, and his parents' example of Presbyterian rectitude. Glenn's apple-pie boyhood and his 23 years of military life also helped form the cluster of related characteristics that Glenn brought to politics. Ambition - quiet ambition, masked by Middle Western heartiness and chastened by a genuinely devout religious faith, but strong nonetheless - is one such trait. A kind of determination that lay on the border between fanatical and comical is another. For example, Tom Miller, a retired Marine Corps general, Glenn's close friend since they were rookie pilots together in World War II and a next-door neighbor for many years, recalls that Glenn even applied weight to his head to compress his height down to the 5-foot-11-inch maximum for astronauts. ''He wasn't going to miss a trick,'' said Miller. ''He'd be sitting down reading with a big bunch of books sitting on his head. In some cases, he'd put a belt kind of around his chin and hold them, or if he was sitting real still reading, he could balance them up and read.'' The Miller and Glenn children delighted in teasing the future astronaut about his height-reduction regimen, recalled Miller: ''Mine would come back over here and say, 'Uncle Johnny's over there with all them damn books on his head again.' '' Glenn, who has a finely tuned sense of personal dignity and is touchy about his public image, denies the scene so vividly described by Miller. But the anecdote is in keeping with the nothing-is-too-much approach he took to the punishing physical regimen required for selection as an astronaut. Linked to this determination is a competitiveness and perfectionist drive that makes any defeat or setback almost unbearable. The little- known private side to Glenn's sunny public personality is a tendency toward sulkiness and hurt feelings in the face of criticism or rejection. Miller recalled the funk that descended on Glenn when NASA selected Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom for the first, suborbital test flights. ''John was pretty hard to live with around here,'' Miller recalled. ''I jumped him one day out in the front yard. I said, 'You're making everybody miserable because your damn pride is so high.' He wouldn't go anywhere or anything. I kept telling him, 'I know they're saving you for the orbit.' '' The determination Glenn exhibited as an astronaut candidate came into play when Glenn's first two Senate campaigns ended badly. A serious head injury suffered in a bathroom fall forced him to withdraw in 1964. In 1970, Glenn ran a campaign that relied on his celebrity and patriotic image to draw crowds to his stump speeches. He lost the Democratic nomination to Howard M. Metzenbaum, who mounted a polished, expensive television campaign that made Glenn's effort look amateurish. The most important formative experience of John Glenn's political career, according to his close associates, came in 1974. Metzenbaum, who had lost the 1970 general election, had been appointed by Gov. John J. Gilligan to fill a vacant Senate seat. As another Senate election approached, the Governor wanted to avoid a divisive rematch between Glenn and Metzenbaum and decided that Glenn ought to run for Lieutenant Governor. For Gilligan, who had national aspirations, the plan had the extra benefit of boxing Glenn, a potential rival, into a secondary position. When Glenn balked, Gilligan lined up the major county chairmen to pressure him to run for Lieutenant Governor. He also arranged a private meeting where 33 members of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council told Glenn face to face that they backed Gilligan's plan. ''He was going to manage the state party against me, and labor would be against me, and everybody would be against me,'' Glenn recalls. ''Then push came to shove and I shoved back.'' Glenn's shove was a tell-it-all public speech to the state Democratic Committee executive meeting in September. He described Gilligan's plan for him, including the private session with the labor chiefs. Then he went on to announce his candidacy to oppose Metzenbaum, saying he would go over the heads of the labor and party leaders to the people. ''For about a week, it really played big in the press: David attacks Goliath,'' says William R. White, Glenn's campaign treasurer then and his campaign manager now. ''And it was a good move. It helped him raise money. It was perhaps the beginning of the building of his financial base with the business community.'' But more important, the experience provided a powerful learning experience that reinforced Glenn's deepest needs and instincts. The Gilligan pressure play provided an opportunity for him to publicly stand for principle over political expedience, proving to himself and the world that he had not been co-opted. His eventual victory over Metzenbaum, aided by pollsters, professional consultants and television commercials, demonstrated that he could not rely totally on the astronaut appeal. He also became convinced, in a campaign that would provide the model for his current Presidential effort, that he could run without the party professionals and labor and still win a Democratic primary. And Glenn got one more thing in 1974 - a divorce from his original political sponsors. He had campaigned for Bobby Kennedy in 1968, been with him in Los Angeles when he was shot and later had broken the news of their father's death to some of the Kennedy children. But in 1974, Kennedy's widow, Ethel, refused to campaign for Glenn. Glenn was wounded because he felt that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, had told her that it would be awkward for her to enter a Democratic primary contest against Metzenbaum, a Senate colleague. The breach between the Glenns and Ethel Kennedy was permanent. The incident also caused a chill between Glenn and Ted Kennedy that still exists. But in the end, it was fortunate politically. The voters have not been receptive to the kind of adopted Kennedys that Glenn started out to be. Now, he could be seen as a new, independent Senator rather than part of that sad, nostalgia-ravaged band trying to raise a patchwork new Camelot from the wreckage of the old. hold this space After winning the election in 1974, Glenn came to Washington for a new Senator's obligatory round of courtesy calls. When a friend asked about his visit with Robert Taft Jr., the Republican senior Senator from Ohio, Glenn said he had no plans to call on his new colleague. Informed that it was the expected thing to do under the unwritten rules of senatorial courtesy, Glenn replied incredulously, ''But he campaigned against me.'' It was a prophetic remark. Glenn, the competitor, did not understand that senators do not let election-year battles disrupt the clubby chumminess that prevails the rest of the time. As a member, he inhabited the borderland between ''loner'' and ''independent.'' His friendships - with younger Democratic Senators like Sam Nunn of Georgia and David L. Boren of Oklahoma or party old- timers like Edmund S. Muskie of Maine or the late Henry M. Jackson of Washington - were firm, but not close. Over the years, Glenn earned the respect of his colleagues as an upright and candid man. But he never joined any of the informal caucuses that coalesce around key issues or individuals in the Senate, and Glenn never bid for leadership of such groups himself. For one thing, his celebrity status set him apart. Rarely does a freshman Senator show up on the Vice-Presidential short list, as Glenn did in 1976, after less than two years in Washington. Also, instead of settling into the fellowship of the Senate, Glenn used it as a theater where he could act out his independent impulses. ''I've seen him in several situations where he was frank and candid at his own peril,'' said Senator Nunn. ''He had an option of remaining silent in a couple of places and not making anybody mad, when he came forth pretty strongly.'' Glenn's behavior followed the familiar pattern in which he seemed to be asserting his prickly sense of integrity as a means of proving that while John Glenn was now in politics, he was not of it. Glenn also became known for his slow-moving approach to decisions - Glenn's staff preferred the term ''deliberative'' to describe his exhaustive and, to some colleagues and staff, agonizingly slow review of all the facts. Then, once he had taken a stand, he was almost impossible to budge. In the Senate, the defining incident in this side of Glenn's character was his feud with President Carter in 1979 over the SALT II arms-control treaty with the Soviet Union. With the revolution in Iran, the United States had lost key observation posts that would have enabled Washington to verify Soviet compliance with the treaty. The Carter Administration assured doubtful senators that they would soon have observation bases in other countries and an enhanced ability to monitor the Soviet Union by satellite. Even such hawkish Senators as Nunn accepted these assurances on the verification issue as adequate, but Glenn could not be swayed. Hours of study of classified information in the high-security ''cage'' of the Foreign Relations Committee convinced him that Carter's promises were empty, because, Glenn said, the capabilities of the new bases and the satellites would not be known until they were in operation. Carter partisans suggested that Glenn had a rifle-shot mind that made it impossible for him to judge the treaty in its entirety once he became expert on the narrower issue of verification. This criticism, that he gets bogged down in details and cannot see the ''big picture,'' has haunted him ever since. ''I guess the idea was that I should be reasonable and just go along with this hope that we could get something worked out. I wasn't willing to do that,'' Glenn says. ''I wanted to know whether we had monitoring capability so we would know what they were doing. Fine, then I'll be for SALT. It was very simple.'' Finally, Carter, having seen an advance copy of a Glenn speech attacking the treaty, called the Glenns' home just as the Senator was leaving to give his speech. ''Fifteen seconds later and it wouldn't have happened,'' recalls a Glenn aide. What happened, despite what Glenn calls his ''near reverence'' for the Presidency, was a very heated exchange. ''It wasn't a yelling match on the telephone,'' Glenn insists, ''but it was the sternest talk I've ever had with a President in both directions, me to him and him to me, both of us.'' At Carter's insistence, Glenn agreed to drop a couple of paragraphs about SALT II from his speech, but he refused to drop his opposition to the treaty. Meanwhile, the text with the offending paragraphs had already been released to the press, and when reporters asked about them, Glenn said he left them out of his speech at the President's urging. Glenn came off looking responsible and candid. It was the old formula used a few years before against Gilligan: Stand your ground under pressure and then play the situation for maximum publicity. On other issues, Glenn, by following his instinct for independence, has created a Senate record that presents real difficulties when it comes to winning the support of Democratic Party constituencies and to presenting himself as a man of Presidential depth and range on the issues. No one questions that Glenn has a quick, fact-crunching intellect, but doubts about the breadth and formulative power of his intelligence persist. His boosters argue that centrist, pragmatic and nonideological candidates are always subject to the criticism that they are ''fuzzy on the issues.'' But those same advocates acknowledge that Glenn's big task as a Presidential candidate is to project an overarching grasp of policy that is not apparent in his Senate record. Economic policy has been a particularly troubling area for Glenn. His general approach to fiscal policy is moderate, but on a key issue, the Republicans' supply-side economic initiative, he has had trouble settling on a position. In 1981, for example, he voted for President Reagan's plan to cut income taxes by 25 percent over three years. Now, as a candidate, he is calling for tax increases, saying the Reagan tax cut for which he voted was a windfall for the rich and contributed to intolerably high deficits. In a recent interview in his office, Glenn settled into an easy chair and talked about his situational economics. While other Senators burrow into rooms where the paneled walls are hung with Presidential portraits, Glenn's office is furnished in the eclectic style of a suburban den. He has surrounded himself with model airplanes, space artifacts and, atop a bookshelf, a cast of D""urer's ''Praying Hands.'' Asked to explain his support of the Reagan tax cut, the most critical economic vote of his legislative career, Glenn chuckled. ''Oh,'' he said, ''I defend it just by what happened at that time.'' His vote was a speculative one, he explained, made after the Democrats failed to muster the votes for a more moderate tax reduction. ''We couldn't do what we wanted and there was always the chance the Reagan program might work as he claimed it would.'' He added, ''So I voted for it with the idea that if it did not work, if it did not work as advertised, then we would try to change it to tailor it to whatever was happening.'' On defense, Glenn's record is more consistent and accessible. He says he would now vote for the SALT II treaty because verfication is now adequate. Although he warns against promiscuous weapons buying, he is generally counted a friend of the Pentagon. He helped win approval for the B-1 bomber and recently voted in favor of a Reagan proposal to spend $130 million on a new type of nerve gas. On a number of issues, such as education, abortion rights for women, energy and environment, Glenn's record has been that of a solidly progressive Democrat. But in other cases, Glenn has refused to go along with other mainstream Democrats on key policy questions, and he has paid a political price. Three-quarters of the time, for example, Glenn voted with organized labor, but the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has never forgiven his single vote against a common situs picketing bill that would broaden the rights of construction unions to put up picket lines. Also, whereas Glenn presented himself as rigorously pro-Israel, he offended Jewish leaders by voting to sell F-15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia, by criticizing the Israeli raid on an Iraqi nuclear reactor and by speaking favorably of negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Whatever the merits or flaws of Glenn's Senate record, it has earned him no dependable base among the Democratic Party's constituent groups or its political professionals. As Glenn's advisers prepared to mount a Presidential campaign, they searched for a way of presenting John Glenn to the voters that would make a virtue of his independence of mind, his lack of party credentials, his generally centrist but politically flawed voting record and his refusal to tie himself to labor or other interest groups. Bill White, the loyal administrative assistant who guided the exploratory effort, kept in mind the ''well-remembered lesson'' of the disastrous 1970 primary campaign in Ohio. People would turn out to see John Glenn the astronaut, but they would not vote for him in the absence of a political theme that made sense. So, throughout 1982 and into early 1983, the fledgling Glenn campaign was a campaign in search of a context for its candidate. hold this space As the incident is depicted in the movie, ''The Right Stuff,'' John Glenn, whose space flight has just been scrubbed because of bad weather, is called to the telephone at Cape Canaveral. At the other end of the line is his wife, Annie, back home in Virginia. She is afflicted with a stammer so severe that she considers telephones ''an instrument of the devil.'' On this day, her stammer has turned into vocal gridlock because she is frightened. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson is demanding to be admitted to her home so the network news crews can film him comforting the wife of the astronaut over the cancellation of the flight. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration tell Glenn he must order his wife to admit Johnson to the Glenn home. Rebelliously, Glenn, portrayed by actor Ed Harris, seizes the telephone and orders his mute and terror- stricken wife to keep the door locked. Johnson is not to set so much as one toe in the Glenn home.

s the depiction was substantially correct. ''There were threats made back and forth,'' he recalls. ''They said word had been passed that it would be possible that I could be replaced on the flight, and that really teed me off. I said, 'If you want to call a press conference and announce that I've been scrubbed off this flight because of this, you call your press conference and I'll call mine right afterward, and we'll see who comes out the best.' '' It was a pivotal moment for Glenn and the space program. Through such experiences, according to the movie, Glenn and the other astronauts realized that their fame had become such that they could defy politicians and shape NASA policy. For Glenn, the incident also provided the tactical model for his later showdowns with Gilligan and Carter. Annie Glenn and ''The Right Stuff'' are the two wild cards in this campaign. Everyone who has been exposed to this remarkable woman and this unusual film agrees that they could have a strong impact on the 1984 campaign. But no one is precisely sure how to calibrate that impact. For months, Glenn fretted privately about the film. His staff sternly rejected invitations for him to attend the premiere in Washington on Oct. 16. They feared that he would be satirized or ridiculed as the zealous moralizer depicted in Tom Wolfe's book of the same title. When the first reviews made it clear that the movie depicted Glenn as more heroic than puritanical, however, Glenn's advisers immediately abandoned their strategy of downplaying the film's importance. ''Yes, it can have an impact,'' said William R. Hamilton, Glenn's pollster. But, he added, analysts are uncertain what it will be. For one thing, the film has gotten off to a slow start. What's more, the audience of most films today is mainly among 18-to 24-year-olds whose attendance at the polls is light. Yet many young people who do vote and upscale white professionals - already identified as key ''swing constituencies'' by Mondale strategists - may also get to see the film. In any case, the movie gave Glenn a burst of favorable publicity at a time when Mondale was piling up a series of union endorsements and straw-poll victories. The film also reaffirms the linkage between Glenn and President Kennedy, who, according to Hamilton's polls, is the most positively remembered former President, even in conservative states, such as Alabama, where Kennedy was very unpopular at the time of his death. The film may also make Annie Glenn, who is already a popular figure in Washington and a revered one among Glenn campaign workers, a celebrity in her own right. As the movie brutally but accurately shows, for the first 50 years of her life, while she was raising their two children, Carolyn and David, Annie Glenn was the virtual prisoner of a stammer so severe that people sometimes thought her retarded. But in 1972, she was one of the first patients in a pioneering speech therapy program at Hollins College in Virginia. Today, she still remembers the surprise telephone call that she placed to her husband and children from Hollins as one of the triumphant moments of her life. ''I could talk!'' Mrs. Glenn exclaimed in an interview. And on the other end of the line, she recalled, ''John cried.'' So, in a way, the mute and timorous woman portrayed by the actress Mary Jo Deschanel in ''The Right Stuff'' no longer exists. After a regimen of continued therapy and daily practice, Mrs. Glenn speaks with a sporadic stammer that is little inhibition to normal conversation. It becomes more noticeable when she is tense or speaking without notes, but she is capable of word-perfect recitations from a prepared text. It is one of the rules of the Glenn campaign that whenever possible this small, attractive woman with salt- and-pepper hair travels with the candidate. At all times, she radiates the joy of someone who has achieved a new life. By doing that, she has transformed herself from a ghost presence on the fringes of her husband's life into, as one aide puts it, ''the warmth, the heartbeat'' of the campaign. She is also being presented as a political asset in the Glenn campaign's first half-hour television program. Broadcast recently in Iowa, the program shows Mrs. Glenn, speaking more haltingly than she does when the camera is not on her, as she describes her husband's qualities of leadership. Finally, she says, she knows he cares for handicapped people ''because I am one.'' Annie Glenn's presence in the campaign suggests a depth to Glenn's personality that is otherwise hard to detect in a man whose history and conversation betray a strict zero-defects mentality. Even close friends speak of the humanizing ''mystery'' that Glenn would marry someone with so obvious a handicap. ''One of the reasons I like him so much is his relationship with Annie,'' says a longtime family friend. ''Here is this macho guy, a test pilot; his whole life was devoted to perfection, and sure, Annie was gorgeous - but she stuttered. It just wasn't important to him. He simply loved her.'' Some associates of John Glenn see another advantage that they are reluctant to discuss publicly. In a general election contest with Reagan, Annie Glenn's image as a plucky helpmate may be a much more comfortable fit with Middle America than Nancy Reagan's Rodeo Drive image of queenly indifference. hold this space Greg Schneiders had just arrived at his cluttered office in the Hart Senate Office Building when the telephone rang. Glenn was calling from his condominium in Vail, Colo. The Senator had earlier told an arms-control group in Iowa that if the Russians dropped a warning bomb in a remote area of the United States, he would not respond in kind. Then, a couple of weeks later, Glenn reversed himself. Now, he was calling Schneiders to ask how the newspapers were playing his change of position. ''It's not great, but it's no big problem,'' Schneiders told him, fingering a clipping. ''Whenever you have to make a decision on the spot like that,'' he added gently, ''you're probably better off using language that supports or amplifies the original statement, rather than saying, 'I shouldn't have said it.' '' It was, given John Glenn's history, a startling conversation. Throughout his public career, he had never admitted a press secretary to his confidence. Yet, since hiring Schneiders, a sharp-tongued 36-year-old with an erect, strutting walk, Glenn had come increasingly to rely on his advice. Regretfully, Mondale strategists concede that Schneiders has greatly reduced the chances that Glenn will ''pull a Romney'' - that is, destroy his candidacy with a blunder such as George Romney's admission that he had been ''brainwashed'' into supporting the Vietnam War. But in Greg Schneiders, Glenn had acquired more than a skilled press aide. In 1976, Schneiders had joined the Carter campaign, in short order became the candidate's traveling companion and close adviser and stayed on to join the Carter White House. He brought badly needed national political experience to Glenn's novice-laden staff. Like Glenn, Schneiders was a man of conservative instinct. Life in the Carter White House had left him with a deep distaste for the way in which organized labor and other interest groups tried to pressure elected officials into catering to them. To no small degree, he blamed the Democratic factions for crippling the Carter Presidency. So, in February 1983, shortly after he joined Glenn's staff, Schneiders wrote a lengthy memo arguing that Glenn could win the Democratic nomination by defying the conventional wisdom of the party. Instead of appealing to the various party constituencies and interest groups with a something-for-everyone approach, Schneiders argued, Glenn should pitch his campaign to the broader Democratic electorate, to the rank-and-file voters who make up a group Schneiders called the ''constituency of the whole.'' In his memo, Schneiders wrote that it was a false premise of conventional political analysis that leaders could deliver the votes of their members. For example, most polls found that almost half of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s members voted for Reagan. Further, Schneiders contended, a majority of interest- group members were more concerned with the general welfare of the nation than with the agenda of their specific group. In short order, Schneiders's ''constituency of the whole'' idea became the guiding gospel of the Glenn Presidential campaign. Of course, the idea of pitching a campaign toward the broad mass of voters, with television as the main vehicle of communication, is a conventional general-election strategy. But rarely, if ever, has a major candidate begun his primary campaign by adopting this approach. The phrase and the political theory it entailed fit perfectly with Glenn's own deepest inclinations. It made a virtue of Glenn's lack of rapport with Democratic professionals, activists and interest-group leaders - most of whom were already pre-empted in any case by Walter Mondale. It provided an elevated rationale for the Senate record that Glenn had built by following his instincts. In sum, Schneiders had come up with the context for which the campaign had been searching. Glenn was also charmed by the idea because it fit exactly with his experience in the 1974 Senate race when he won despite the open opposition of labor and the party leaders. ''That's what I did back home in Ohio when they said they were going to oppose me. I went to every union hall,'' he recalls. ''I went in and told the fellows what my views on things were, asked them to compare them with my opponent's. They didn't have to be led around. They were smart enough to vote their own consciences and what they thought was important to the future. That's what they did.'' Still, many politicians regard the ''constituency of the whole'' as a seriously flawed strategy for a primary campaign. Their opposition to the idea rests on the arithmetic of the delegate-selection process. Democratic leaders, still smarting over the nomination of political outsider Jimmy Carter in 1976, tailored those rules to make it harder for any candidate to win the nomination simply by building up broad public popularity. The new rules, shaped mainly by the political allies of Mondale and Ted Kennedy, give party leaders and Democratic elected officials a bigger say in naming the 1984 nominee. Thirty-one states and territories, five more than in 1980, will choose their delegates in party caucuses where highly disciplined cadres such as labor unions and feminist groups have a good record of delivering the vote for their candidates. Of the 3,931 delegates to the 1984 convention, 14 percent will be awarded seats by virtue of holding elective or party office. These unpledged delegates, plus the 31 percent chosen in the caucuses, are presumed to be friendly to a candidate like Mondale who stresses party loyalty. This means that Glenn must do extremely well in the 26 primaries that select 55 percent of the delegates to either win the nomination outright or deadlock the convention. That is why popular appeal is so essential to Glenn's strategy and why anything that enhances that appeal, such as the ''The Right Stuff,'' is an asset. It is known that John Glenn, in small crowds, can attract autograph seekers. But to win the nomination, he must turn the primaries into what his pollster, William Hamilton, calls ''broad participation events'' in which a surge of voters overwhelms the blocs lined up for Mondale by unions and similar groups. To get this kind of turnout, Glenn must carry his popular appeal to a new level. He must be able to generate the kind of crowd response that John Kennedy did in 1960 and that Ronald Reagan did in 1980, and like those two, he must prove to be electrifyingly effective on television. Those qualities Glenn has yet to demonstrate. As for the overall design of the strategy, Hamilton pronounces it risky but possible. ''John Glenn can win the nomination,'' he says. ''It's not going to be easy, but it can be done.'' From the outset, Hamilton, media consultant David Sawyer and field director Joe Grandmaison had doubts about the ''constituency of the whole'' strategy. Grandmaison insisted on the need for a basic grass-roots organization to supplement the media campaign by identifying Glenn voters and getting them to the polls. Sawyer warned Schneiders about ''going too far'' in demonstrating the campaign's independence. For Glenn, egged on by Schneiders, had seized the concept as a license to taunt the interest groups. Glenn had to be reined in and convinced, as one adviser carefully put it, that it was possible to approach some issues ''with a bit more political sophistication without giving up an inch of integrity.'' In other words, Glenn began speaking to union groups without reminding them that he had voted against the common situs bill that would have broadened their right to picket. And there were other concessions to political necessity. The United Automobile Workers, a power in Glenn's home state, favored the so-called ''domestic content'' bill that would require most foreign cars sold in this country to include some American parts and labor. Glenn pronounced himself opposed to the bill in principle, but signed on as a sponsor on the grounds that American automakers needed temporary protection. Finally, under intense pressure from campaign aides worried about Mondale's growing lead in gaining the political and financial support of Jewish Democrats, Glenn delivered a series of speeches designed to paper over his past criticisms of Israel. It was special-interest politics of a special kind. Glenn had no hope of winning over the leadership of labor or the major Jewish organizations. But his gestures were intended to block any effort on their part to portray him as a pariah to their members. Aside from this damping of Glenn's instinct to assert his political independence, the ''constituency of the whole'' theory has remained the campaign's main strategic dogma. Two weeks ago, Joe Grandmaison resigned in protest. It was a jarring reminder to Glenn and his staff of just how much of a gamble they are taking by staking so much on a macropolitical strategy against Mondale, the master of Democratic micropolitics. hold this space There is simply no comparison between the Mondale and Glenn organizations. In 1982, Mondale strategists decided that no candidate could build a personal organization big enough to handle the ''front-loaded'' primary schedule. In a period of about three weeks, set to begin in late February, there will be caucuses and primaries in 23 states. So Mondale sought to graft existing organizations, such as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Education Association, onto his campaign structure. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s endorsement of Mondale represents millions of dollars' worth of vital volunteer services. In the 1982 Congressional election, the unions mobilized 145,000 volunteers. The National Education Association, which has also endorsed Mondale, has promised to provide campaign workers in every Congressional district in the nation. Micropolitics - the taking of a political party's bits and pieces and arranging them into a coast-to-coast machine - is a process of addition, and Mondale has done it extremely well. He has a similar, if less commanding, advantage when it comes to money. He is expected to raise $9 million to Glenn's $6 million this year. For the first two months of the primaries, Mondale's aides project a $6 million war chest. Glenn's staff optimistically projects a $4 million fund for the same period - and Glenn adviser Robert Keefe warns that it may not be enough for a media candidacy. ''Money is terribly controlling in Presidential politics,'' he says. ''People don't lose; they run out of money. You're going to have to have $5 to $7 million to spend in the first 60 or 80 days of 1984 to be minimally competitive.'' Mondale believes he has other advantages. He has repeatedly stressed his years in the White House, a suggestion that Glenn lacks the depth of experience and seasoning needed for the Presidency. Also, Mondale likes to say that he is the quintessential ''real Democrat.'' As the campaign has heated up in recent weeks, he has forced a major confrontation over Glenn's party credentials, an area of real vulnerability for Glenn and one in which he has a record of less-than-sterling candor. At a Washington press conference in 1963, for example, Glenn said, ''I have no political affiliations and have always and do now consider myself an independent.'' Once he was quoted as classifying himself as a ''conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican.'' Before announcing for his first Senate race, Glenn met with the Republican national chairman and other G.O.P. officials and said he had given ''careful consideration'' to both parties before finally choosing to join the Democrats. He also said he sometimes voted Republican in state elections. Today, Glenn says that he ''was always'' a Democrat and consistently ''voted Democratic.'' Both his parents, he says, were active Democrats who sometimes held party meetings in their home. By flexing its organizational muscle, the Mondale campaign hopes to bulldoze its way through the primary season. Glenn's approach, by necessity, is more limited. Even though he has adopted a broad, national strategy, he must hit a very small, regional target of opportunity in order to stay in the running for the nomination. The contest opens with the Iowa caucuses late in February, followed by the first primary, in New Hampshire. Then come the primaries and caucuses set for March 13 including Glenn's big opportunities in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Says Bill White, speaking of the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, ''We can probably come in second in each of those states - if it's a good second - and be all right.'' But, he adds, ''Going South on March 13, we've got to win something, somewhere. We can't have Mo Udall's problem and always be second.'' Many analysts believe that Glenn actually needs to sweep the South on ''Super Tuesday.'' That would underscore his central contention that a traditional Democratic liberal like Mondale cannot take conservative Sun Belt states away from Reagan. Conversely, a Mondale victory in, say, Alabama would be a staggering blow to Glenn. For after the South comes a series of tests in states such as Illinois, where Mondale's standing with the Cook County Democratic machine makes him an early favorite. ''If we did not do well in the South on 'Super Tuesday,' I wouldn't say the race was over,'' said another Glenn adviser, ''but we would clearly have to rethink our position.'' In the days since Grandmaison's resignation, and the elevation of Keefe to a more powerful role, both the candidate and his senior advisers have shown a sharpened awarenesss of the need for a minimally competent grass-roots organization in the South and elsewhere. Regional popularity polls show Glenn either even with Mondale or slightly ahead. What would be the impact of a big Glenn victory in the South? Greg Schneiders believes that Glenn could use it to ''issue a populist call to arms to the mass of Democrats to take the party back'' from the party leaders who have endorsed Mondale. His theory: ''If people decide that Glenn would make a better leader for this country, then no other political force, regardless of being better organized or having the calendar in its favor, is going to prevail against them.'' Theoretically, that could carry Glenn to the nomination. Short of that, he could hope to arrive at San Francisco having proved that he is the popular favorite and hoping for a deadlocked convention. That would put the nomination in the hands of the 566 appointed and officially ''uncommitted'' delegates. Mondale is thought to have the larger following among them, but they also take their cues from popular sentiment in their home districts. ''It will be a long battle all the way to the convention,'' White predicts, ''unless one candidate collapses completely.'' Mondale and Glenn are not the only actors on the stage. The candidacy of the Rev. Jesse Jackson may greatly enhance Glenn's chances in the South by cutting into Mondale's support among blacks. Senators Alan Cranston and Gary Hart, along with former Senator George McGovern, are fragmenting the liberal vote in a way that hampers Mondale. On the other hand, former Florida Gov. Reubin Askew and Senator Ernest F. Hollings Jr. of South Carolina are a drag on Glenn, north and south. Some strategists predict Askew could get 10 percent to 15 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, luring conservatives who would otherwise probably go to Glenn. On balance, conventional political analysis points toward a Mondale nomination victory. But it is not that simple. First, the Mondale-Glenn match-up is a test of whether traditional Democratic campaigns are still viable in a media age. Like a man building the ultimate catapult just as gunpowder is invented, Mondale has constructed a wonderful political organization that may, in fact, be an anachronism, Second, pollsters on both sides have identified the ''leadership for the future'' issue as pivotal. Neither candidate has been able to put his stamp on it. Glenn strategists believe that Mondale has played into their hands by casting himself as the guardian of outworn Democratic policies. However, they acknowledge that Glenn is in a ''critical definition'' period in which he must transcend the image of the famous former astronaut and present himself as an ''integrative leadership figure.'' Says David Sawyer, ''As the movie comes out and public attention is focused on him, it is terribly important to fill in the gaps.'' Finally, the Mondale-Glenn contest is one between two public personalities, and it is this aspect of the contest that gives Glenn's promoters in the Washington political community the greatest hope. The tidal flow of the precampaign year, they point out, has been in Glenn's favor. He moved from a blip in the polls to a competitive position, profiting from the fact that Mondale's support seems driven more by duty than by burning commitment. Throughout his career, one Democratic Party official observes, Mondale has suffered from a ''passion gap.'' To such people, Mondale seems to offer the party the solid virtues of an arranged marriage whereas Glenn presents the possibilities - and risks - of a real romance. There is one part of John Glenn's basic speech for which he never consults his note cards. It is the part about war and peace. ''I believe we need a President,'' Glenn says, ''who understands what it takes to defend this country and what we must do to keep our country from stumbling into war.'' At this point, Glenn's voice often thickens a bit with emotion. He speaks of visiting the ''next of kin,'' and those who know Glenn know that he is probably thinking of Monte Goodman, a young pilot from Pennsylvania. Goodman was Glenn's wingman all the way through flight school, and he died in their first combat mission, knocked down by Japanese antiaircraft fire off Maloelap Island. After the battle, Glenn and Tom Miller refueled their fighters and searched for hours over the blue Pacific waters, hoping that Goodman had somehow survived. All they found was an oil slick. After the war, Glenn went to Harrisburg, Pa., to visit Monte Goodman's parents. ''I served 23 years in the Marine Corps,'' Glenn continues. ''I served in World War II and Korea. I don't take a back seat to anyone in my support for a strong defense. But I know something else out of that background. I do not have to watch late-night television, watch a movie, to find out what combat is like.'' This line has been in Glenn's speech for months. It is meant to remind audiences that while Glenn and thousands of other young Americans were at war, Ronald Reagan was making Army training movies in the safety of Culver City, Calif., and that in a Glenn-Reagan race, Americans would have a choice between an incumbent who made movies and a challenger about whom movies are made. As recently as a year ago, some political oddsmakers believed that Reagan, given a continued economic upturn, would be unbeatable in 1984. The economy has continued to improve, but Reagan seems suddenly vulnerable in the foreign-policy realm. Just as the President's aides launched his re-election campaign, two events - the Marine massacre in Beirut and the American invasion of Grenada - created a climate of military crisis that may strengthen Glenn's claim that he is the Democrats' strongest candidate against Reagan. Now, with flag-draped coffins being shipped home from foreign battles, Glenn's argument that a soldier- President would know how to be both firm and restrained has a new political sting. Glenn has acknowledged that the military action in Grenada was probably justified if American civilians on the island were in danger. ''But,'' he added, ''military force should be used only as a last resort and if the President is right so far on Grenada, he has been wrong on Lebanon for a long time.'' Reagan, he said, had put the Marines in jeopardy in Lebanon without defining either the nation's diplomatic goals or a military mission for the troops. Despite their differences in background and experience, Glenn and Reagan may go into history as playing very similar roles in the histories of their parties. So complete is Reagan's command of the Republican political structure that it is easy to forget that the party establishment fought doggedly to prevent his nomination, attempting as late as March 1980 to lure President Ford out of retirement to block Reagan's march to the nomination. But Reagan reached over the heads of the party leaders, using the medium of television as his main vehicle of communication. John Glenn, in his way, is following the same course. Today, the stage is set for a showdown of theories and personalities that may have a big impact on the future of American campaigns. For some time, the political parties have been in the twilight of their power as television challenged their role as main mediator between voters and Presidential candidates. Confronted by Glenn and his ''constituency of the whole'' candidacy," Walter Mondale has rallied the Democratic establishment. It is a defining moment. A Glenn victory in the primaries followed by a Glenn-Reagan general election contest would strongly suggest that the parties had all but lost their role as the instruments of candidate selection."""
ONCE-HOSTILE VATICAN FORGES CLOSE LINKS WITH SCIENTISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/14/world/once-hostile-vatican-forges-close-links-with-scientists.html,"Catholic women's representatives and bishops met to discuss women's role in the church. Page B7. ROME, Nov. 13 - The Roman Catholic Church, once a symbol of dogmatic opposition to modern science, is moving into its closest collaboration with scientists in at least a century. On issues ranging from nuclear war to test-tube babies to the evolution of human life, the Vatican is soliciting technical advice from hundreds of the world's leading scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, experts in esoteric fields and technical leaders from developing nations. Most of these experts are not Catholics, and many do not even believe in God or in organized religion. Pontifical Academy Meets The chief mechanism for this wide- ranging effort is the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which is now holding its biennial plenary session and three related scientific meetings at a magnificent Renaissance villa on the grounds of the Vatican. This is the group the Pope addressed Saturday when he called on scientists to shun ''laboratories and factories of death,'' apparently meaning military weapons projects. The Pope's address, a major discourse on science and peace, drew heavily from materials supplied by the academy in calling for an end to ''technological colonialism'' and wasteful military expenditures. But its major theme, that scientists should abandon research that can be used for war, seems to have been formulated by the Pope himself. Some 115 scientists are attending the Pontifical Academy's sessions to discuss four major topics: chemical events that threaten to disrupt the environment, interactions between complex biological molecules like proteins and nucleic acids, modern biological techniques for improving agriculture, and science in the service of peace. How profound the academy's influence on church thinking will ultimately be is open to question. One observer, Paul Abrecht, director of the World Council of Churches' department of church and society, notes that the academy has a very small staff and does little more than hold meetings. ''This looks like a priority, but I wonder,'' he says. ''The scientists are all enamored with the idea that somehow they will get a big platform if the Pope comes to speak to them and that suddenly the world is going to move in the right direction. I think it's an illusion.'' Moreover, other outside experts say the church will always be unswayed by scientific arguments that conflict with its moral positions, particularly those involving sexuality. Nevertheless, the sessions here now are no mere ceremonial gatherings. The scientists are putting in long days, virtually trapped deep inside the Vatican from 9 in the morning until 6 at night. The quality of discussion is often as sophisticated as that at conferences sponsored by leading scientific societies, according to many participants. ''I came here expecting nothing but a visit to the Vatican Museum and St. Peter's,'' said James G. Anderson, a geochemist at Harvard University who was invited to the academy's session on chemical threats to the environment. ''But it turned out to be much more than that. I was stunned at the quality of the presentations.'' Recalling one paper on the environmental consequences of nuclear war, Thomas F. Malone, a Butler University expert on climate and weather who was invited to the same session, called it ''one of the more impressive papers that I've heard in the last 43 years.'' The current sessions are part of a systematic and accelerating effort by the church to tap the vast range of knowledge generated by modern science. Unlike the theologians of the 17th century who refused even to look through Galileo's telescope lest they see something to upset their faith, today's church leaders appear determined to keep abreast of the latest advances in science, to avoid unnecessary conflicts between religion and science and to help guide science in directions beneficial to humanity. The Pontifical Academy is by far the most elaborate mechanism set up by any major church to interact with leading scientists. Although Protestant and Jewish organizations often consult with scientists on specific issues, no other church has established a permanent ''scientific senate,'' as the Vatican calls it, to provide continuing scientific oversight. Academy Founded in 1847 Although the intensity of the scientific effort is new, scientific consultation by the Vatican is not. The academy was begun with papal sponsorship in 1847 and was given a modern shape and title in 1936. But for most of its life it has been largely ceremonial. Only in the last 5 to 10 years, participants say, has it become vigorous. The number of scientific meetings and of the participants has quadrupled over the last eight years. The budget has correspondingly risen, to about $400,000 this year. ''The Vatican's interest in science has really increased,'' said Dr. Carlos Chagas, a 73-year-old Brazilian neurophysiologist who became president of the academy in 1972. ''Not since the days when many priests were scientists a century ago has the church been so closely involved with scientists.'' Part of the increased interest has to do with Dr. Chagas's energetic leadership. But observers also note that Pope John Paul II's intellectual interest in science and philosophy is a factor as well. In his address to the members of the academy Saturday, Pope John Paul declared: ''Today, more than ever, the Catholic Church is your ally, this church which loves true science and right thinking. Have courage and the boldness of reason that untiringly seeks the truth and you will find in the church and in this Apostolic See your most convinced ally.'' Some Strong Influence Seen The academy seems to have strongly influenced the hierarchy on some issues. Based on academy studies and recommendations, Pope John Paul endorsed nuclear power as a useful form of energy, approved most forms of genetic engineering except for research on human embryos and voiced greater concern over the dangers of nuclear war. At the academy's instigation, he sent scientists to four world capitals to warn heads of state of the devastating consequences of a nuclear war, and he approved the convoking of a conference of the heads of national scientific academies to draft principles for preventing nuclear war. The academy brings an unusual array of distinguished scientists into contact with the church. Alexander Rich, a biologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been a member for five years, once jotted down a list of the physicists elected to the academy in recent decades. ''It was absolutely overwhelming,'' he says. ''It read like a Who's Who of modern physics, people who have transformed the whole subject.'' The current roster has 71 scientists, all elected for life, of whom 26 are Nobel Prize winners. It has a decidedly Western flavor; the United States has 16 members, Italy 10 and France and Britain 8 each. Some two dozen other nations are represented, none with more than three members; the Soviet Union has none. The selection criteria, according to Dr. Chagas, require that members lead exemplary personal lives, be outstanding scientists and supply whatever disciplinary and geographical balance is needed in the academy. 25 of 71 Practicing Catholics Neither religion nor race is a factor in choosing members. Only about 25 of the current 71 members are practicing Catholics, according to Dr. Chagas, whereas more than a dozen, including some of the most active members, are Jews. No inquiries are made about the religious beliefs of the members, and the academy includes Anglicans, other Protestants, Moslems and possibly a Hindu, not to mention agnostics and others the church labels ''nonbelievers.'' The non-Catholics cite a variety of reasons for joining: the flattery of being wooed by the church, an opportunity to meet with famous colleagues, an all-expense-paid trip to Rome every two years (spouse included), the hope that the academy might prove influential. ''I don't have any strong brief for the Catholic Church in view of its past history,'' says Christian B. Anfinsen, a Nobel laureate from Johns Hopkins University. ''But I thought it would be interesting.'' Dr. Anfinsen was an agnostic all his life, but he converted to Judaism five years ago to marry an Orthodox Jew. Beyond the members themselves, the academy invites hundreds of experts from relevant fields to participate in its weeklong studies on specific topics ranging from energy to cancer to parisitic disease. More than 250 such outside experts have come to Rome over the last three years alone. PICK UP 1ST-LAST ADD VATICAN From the perspective of most of the scientists who attend, the proceedings are not much different from any other high-caliber scientific meeting. They present papers, argue about concepts and doze in their chairs after a heavy, wine-sweetened lunch. They seldom talk directly with anyone important in the Vatican hierarchy and have no specific idea what, if anything, the church does with their findings. Academy Fills Several Purposes But from the church's perspective, the academy serves several important purposes. It promotes progress in science, always bearing in mind, as Dr. Chagas puts it, that ''science has to be geared for human benefit and not for the benefit of the rich people or political classes.'' It allows the church to keep track of scientific advances that might pose ethical, moral or theological problems. It gives the Pope a forum for exhorting leading scientists to bring a moral dimension to their work. And it provides a pool of eminent scientists who can join with the church in pursuing mutual goals, such as controlling the nuclear arms race or improving the lot of the impoverished. In such cases, both the church and the scientists seem pleased with the opportunity to use the prestige and influence of the other. Whatever ideological conflicts may once have pitted religion against science seem to have dissipated for the most part. Two years ago, after an academy study week on astrophysical cosmology put man still further from the center of the universe than anything Galileo had ever proposed, Pope John Paul told the academicians ''how highly the church esteems pure science.'' He said their findings did not conflict with the Bible, ''which does not wish to teach how heaven was made but how to go to heaven.'' Evolution Largely Accepted Last year a meeting of 12 scholars convened by the academy concluded that ''masses of evidence'' from paleontology and molecular biology support ''beyond serious dispute'' the concept of human evolution, a theory that was opposed by Catholic theologians in the last century and that still sparks opposition from fundamentalists today. One of the participants, J. M. Lowenstein, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco, later called the meeting historic because ''the highest scientific body of the Catholic Church produced a strong statement'' supporting evolution ''just a few weeks after the 100th anniversary of Darwin's death.'' ''The view of the Vatican was much more liberal than I thought it would be,'' says Dr. Anfinsen. ''They said evolution is fine and we agree it happened that way, but we reserve the right to read a soul into developing animals when man comes along.'' Some members of the academy believe that certain subjects involving conflicts with church doctrine, such as the use of contraceptives to curb population growth, are taboo. ''We are neither asked, nor have we tried, to make a pronouncement on that question,'' says the Nobel laureate David Baltimore, an academy member from M.I.T. ''It's an embarrassment to all members of the academy who feel, as I do, that the lack of birth control is a big problem.'' And Dr. Abrecht of the World Council of Churches said ''one thing embitters the debate'' between Catholics and those of other faiths on scientific issues. This is the question of human reproductive biology, which he called ''forbidden territory'' that ''frightens the wits out of'' Catholic leaders. He said Pope John Paul had reaffirmed Catholic opposition to contraception and abortion ''in such a way as to make it even more difficult than it was before to discuss some of these questions of science and technology.'' Session on Contraception Seen But Dr. Chagas says the academy can consider the scientific aspects of virtually any issue, including contraception. He added that he plans to schedule a meeting on the technical aspects of different forms of contraception in the next year or two. ''The Pope has repeated many times that he is not afraid of what we call scientific truth,'' Dr. Chagas says. ''I have had no problem at all with the hierarchy here in any of my activities.'' The academy's biggest concern in recent years has been nuclear war and how to prevent it, an issue on which the hopes and fears of many scientists and religious leaders coincide. In 1981 the academy held a study of the medical consequences of nuclear war, after which the Pope sent small groups of academy members to carry the warning to government leaders in Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. The delegations said they had been received cordially and had engaged in substantive discussion by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and by Leonid I. Brezhnev, then the Soviet leader, but had been given only a 20-minute stand-up meeting with President Reagan. The Pope has used the academy's nuclear-policy statements in major speeches, but they seem to have had less political effect than the parallel move by American bishops on halting the nuclear arms race.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE APPROVES RIGHTS PANEL BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/us/senate-approves-rights-panel-bill.html,"The Senate today voted 78-3 to approve a restructured United States Commission on Civil Rights. Supporters said the bill, which divides appointment powers between the President and Congress, would assure the continued life and independence of the agency. Earlier, by a vote of 42 to 34, the Senate jettisoned an antiabortion rider that had evoked threats of a filibuster. The motion to shelve the rider came from Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the most conservative senators. ''We have worked too hard on this bill,'' said Mr. Thurmond, referring to the commission bill. ''We cannot afford to jeopardize it.'' The commission vote ratified a compromise reached Thursday between President Reagan, who had sought to install his own appointees, and senators advocating independence for the bipartisan advisory agency. Judge Bars Reagan Interference A Federal district judge today barred the President from ''preventing or interfering with'' the work of two commission members who had sued to block his attempt to dismiss them. Judge Norma Holloway Johnson granted a preliminary injunction to the two commission members, Mary Frances Berry and Blandina Cardenas Ramirez, both Democrats, on the ground that ''there is a substantial likelihood'' that the President lacked power to dismiss them. Judge Johnson said in a 14-page opinion that ''there is adequate evidence in the legislative record to support plaintiffs' contention that Congress intended the duties of the commission to be discharged free from any control or coercive influence by the President or Congress.'' Mr. Reagan, whose civil rights policies have been repeatedly assailed by the six-member commission, nominated three men to replace Miss Berry, Mrs. Cardenas Ramirez and Rabbi Murray Saltzman in June. Mr. Reagan's choices were Morris Abram, a civil rights lawyer; John Bunzel of the Hoover Institution, and Robert Destro, a Catholic University law professor. All shared the President's opposition to school busing and hiring quotas. After Senate confirmation proceedings became mired in controversy, Mr. Reagan notified the three commissioners on Oct. 24 that they were dismissed, effective immediately. Rabbi Saltzman is not a party to the lawsuit. The effect of today's decision will be limited if the bill passed today by the Senate becomes law. The current commission, whose members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is due to expire Nov. 29. House Approval Expected In the House, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. told reporters that the bill ''doesn't go far enough, in view of the President and his anti-civil-rights record.'' But Representative Don Edwards, chairman of the constitutional subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, said he expected that the House would adopt the measure this week. ''You'd always rather have things your own way, but it's a workable compromise,'' he said. The Senate-approved compromise provided that commissioners could be dismissed only for cause. The present six-member commission would be replaced by an eight-member body. The President and Congress would each name two Democrats and two Republicans. The President would appoint the staff director, chairman and vice chairman, with the concurrence of a majority on the commission. The measure provided for a six-year authorization, after which Congress again would have to act to preserve the commission. ''It's a tremendous victory for the civil rights community,'' Senator Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said after the voting. ''It means that neither this President nor any other President can fire a commission member because that member differs with his views. It means we'll have an independent commission from now on.'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''Once again, the Congress and the American people have joined to defeat a White House attempt to roll back, weaken and undermine Civil Rights protection for women and minorities.'' The Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, called the voting ''a major contribution'' to the welfare of the country. Three conservative Republicans cast the only dissenting votes. They were Jesse Helms and John East of North Carolina, and Steven D. Symms of Idaho. ''This bill is superfluous,'' Senator East told the Senate, noting the commission's $11.5 million budget. ''The cost cannot be justified in a period of attempting to cut deficits.'' The antiabortion rider to the commission was offered by Senator Roger W. Jepsen, Republican of Iowa, who said, ''The most fundamental civil right is the right to life; without it, no other right is secure.'' The rider would have declared a Congressional finding that life began at conception, prohibited the use of all Federal funds for abortions, and provided a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court in all cases deriving from a state's abortion laws. Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, said the proposed rider represented a major new inroad against a woman's freedom to have an abortion. ''I am not prepared to trade off one civil liberty for an extension of the civil rights commission,'' Senator Packwood said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'WONDER WOMEN' CITED FOR GIFTS TO AMERICAN LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/style/wonder-women-cited-for-gifts-to-american-life.html,"At the age of 16, Marie Balter was confined to a state mental hospital in Massachusetts. She spent most of the next 20 years in such institutions. She recovered, went on to receive a master's degree from Harvard University and now works full time helping mental patients. ''I made a commitment to God that if I got well I would dedicate my life to mental illness,'' Mrs. Balter, now 52, said yesterday. ''I want to spread my message of hope to these people.'' Mrs. Balter was one of 17 women from around the country who received $7,500 awards from the Wonder Woman Foundation, established in 1981 by Warner Communications Inc. to mark the 40th anniversary of the comic book heroine. The awards are given annually to women over 40 for outstanding contributions to American life. 'Not Stopped by Fear' John Chancellor of NBC News, who conducted the ceremony yesterday at the Harley Hotel, described the women as ''ordinary people who were not stopped by fear and because of that, became extraordinary people.'' Among the winners was Agnes Mary Mansour of Lansing, Mich., a nun who was forced to resign from her religious order because, as director of social services for the State of Michigan, she allowed poor women to seek abortions using Medicaid funds. Other winners included Shirley Christian of Miami, a Pulitzer Prize- winning foreign correspondent; Faith Ringgold of New York City, an artist; Dr. Davida Coady of El Cerrito, Calif., who treats victims of war and poverty in third world countries; Nicole Hollander of Chicago, creator of the feminist cartoon strip ''Sylvia,'' and Mary and Carrie Dann of Beowawe, Nev., Shoshone Indian sisters who are fighting for their ancestral lands. A special ''Woman of Courage'' award was given to Cicely Tyson, the actress. Mrs. Balter, of Beverly, Mass., a slender, dark-eyed woman with salt- and-pepper hair, told of her life in an interview after the awards were presented. She said she had been placed in an infant asylum immediately after her birth by her mother, who was alcoholic, and that she lived in foster homes before being adopted at 6 by an elderly Italian immigrant couple. She said the couple were ''rigid and unloving'' and that she began to plunge into deep depressions. ''I desperately needed to feel loved,'' she recalled. Diagnosed as suicidal at the age of 16, she entered Boston State Hospital, the first of a number of institutions where she was to spend most of the next 20 years. She said that much of her time there was spent in the notorious ''back wards,'' where the chronically ill and hopeless patients are kept. Says Attendants Beat Her ''For a year and a half I was catatonic,'' she said. ''I stayed in bed and didn't walk, didn't talk and didn't eat.'' She also recalled a period of ''psychedelic distortions'' when ''people's faces looked like monsters - including my own face in the mirror.'' Mrs. Balter said that once during a stay in a back ward, she sneaked into the bathroom in the middle of the night to smoke a cigarette - a violation of the rules - and was beaten by several attendants. She said her recovery began when she was 36 and recovering from a serious liver illness that had reduced her weight to 86 pounds. ''I just decided I wanted to get well,'' she said. A year later, she left the hospital, saying goodbye to nurses who placed bets that she would return within a month. She never did. Instead, she got a job, married an accountant named Joseph Balter and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1976 from Salem State College in Salem, Mass. But her tragedies were not over. While studying for her finals at Salem State, her husband died of a blood clot. She also learned she had bladder cancer, which required two painful operations. ''But now they've declared me cured,'' she said with a smile. In 1982, Mrs. Balter enrolled in Harvard's Graduate School of Education. She arrived with $75 in her pocket but was able to finance her year there by working full time and asking her employer for a year's advance on her salary. She graduated, she said, ''with all A's and two B's.'' Today Mrs. Balter manages five mental health programs for the Northeast Family Institute in Danvers, Mass., which operates community residences for disturbed adults. She frequently speaks in public and is working on an autobiography called ''Sing No Sad Songs.'' ''It's an appropriate title, don't you think?'' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. AMMENDMENT ON EQUAL RIGHTS BEATEN IN HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/us/us-ammendment-on-equal-rights-beaten-in-house.html,"Roll-call vote, page B5. WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 - After a bitter partisan debate, the House of Representatives today narrowly defeated a sudden move to revive the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. The amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women was scheduled for floor action by the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., after the Democrats acted Monday to suspend the normal rules and limit debate to 40 minutes and bar modification of the measure. The suspension of rules is normally reserved for noncontroversial legislation. Using the tactic for the proposed equal rights amendment, which has a long and tortuous history, infuriated the Republican minority in the House, many of whose members support the constitutional change. Six Votes Short The vote, 278 for passage and 147 against, was six votes short of the two- thirds majority needed to send proposed constitutional amendments to the states for ratification. The Democrats divided 225 to 38 in favor of the measure; Republicans opposed it by a margin of 109 to 53. Republicans denounced the tactics of the Democratic majority, saying they were acting ''despotically'' and cynically using the women's rights measure to churn up an election issue. The Democrats said that an equal rights amendment had been debated for 60 years and that the Republicans should vote on principle instead of casting a negative vote because they found the procedures offensive. 'Abuse of Power' ''Do you want to hide behind something?'' Mr. O'Neill asked in summing up the debate. ''You're not fooling anybody.'' The House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, said, ''Most of us have spent more time in line to see a movie than we have been given today to debate an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. ''The majority is engaging in an abuse of power that would bring a blush to the cheeks of the most absolute despot of antiquity,'' he said. A number of proposed amendments to the equal rights measure did not reach the floor because of the rules suspension. The wording changes dealt with such issues as abortion, the conscription of women in wartime, and the constitutionality and tax-exempt status of all-male and all- female institutions of learning. The resolution before the House was worded as follows: ''Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' An identically worded article was approved by both houses of Congress in 1972 and then went through laborious debates in the ensuing years in the legislatures of all 50 states. That proposal died when its time limit for ratification expired in June 1982, still three states short of the necessary approval of 38 legislatures. 'Classic, Lean Language' The move to revive the proposal began in January when Mr. O'Neill said its consideration ''would be one of the top priorities of the 98th Congress.'' At a briefing before the vote today, Mr. O'Neill said the suspension of the rules had been decided upon, at least in part, because he ''doubted very, very much'' whether some of the proposed amendments could have been defeated. In the debate, the Speaker said the resolution as drafted was ''in the classic, lean language that suits an amendment to the Constitution.'' The Democratic strategy enraged Representative Hamilton Fish Jr., Republican of New York, whose name is second among sponsors of the resolution after that of the Judiciary chairman, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. Mr. Fish said he had long supported the equal rights amendment but ''we face a cynical and partisan decision that undermines the bipartisan support'' the measure had had in the past. 'We'll Bring It Back Up' Mr. Fish said of the Democratic move, ''I suggest it is less a commitment to equal rights than it is more of what we have witnessed repeatedly this fall, partisan politics in search of a campaign issue. A 'no' vote is not a vote against E.R.A. but a vote for respect for the United States Constitution.'' Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said, ''There was a lot of opinion on our side of, 'To hell with it - vote it down and we'll bring it back up' '' later. Mr. Rodino, asked whether the negative Republican votes would be used by Democratic candidates in campaigning, smiled and shrugged. Christopher Matthews, a spokesman for Mr. O'Neill, said the roll-call could be ''the death knell'' for Republican Congressmen from suburban ''wine- and-cheese districts that go for Reaganomics'' but are strongly in favor of the amendment affecting women's rights. One aide to a top Democrat said that his party's leaders doubted they would win the vote today but that with the roster of Republican ''nays,'' Democratic campaign strategists were ''licking their chops.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DANCE: CELEBRATION FOR ELEO POMARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/17/arts/dance-celebration-for-eleo-pomare.html,"IT was Eleo Pomare's night at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, when the Eleo Pomare Dance Company began its weeklong celebration of his 25 years in dance. There are works by guest choreographers still to come in these wide-ranging programs. But the spotlight was on Mr. Pomare here, as dance after dance by him flowed by - new and old, lyrical and funny, abstract and dramatic - all informed by a passionate concern for the world around him. Mr. Pomare has long been known as the angry black man of American modern dance because of his often caustic examinations of society's inequities. But as the opening program suggested, he is as filled with compassion as he is with anger. His is a rage mediated by artistic skill and an eye for vivid, objectifying detail. Mr. Pomare has largely avoided the theatricalized jazz dance to which so many of his black colleagues have succumbed over the years. And his company has been a racially mixed one since early in his career as a choreographer and performer. The 16 dancers Mr. Pomare has gathered around him today are superlative dancer-actors, as much at ease in narrative works as in such pure dance pieces as the new ''Back to Bach.'' A playful, luminous celebration of the music of J. S. Bach, the three-part work opens with a serene company dance, filled with softly curving limbs rising, taut, into the air, and subtly juxtaposed groupings and paths that emerge with the sudden persistence of melodic line in music. Every so often there is a sudden, squiggling jump or spinoff that reminds one of Mr. Pomare's sly and quirky humor. But this is a dance of lyrical arms and open, surging torsos, in which the women's radiance is complemented by the men's great dignity. Those torsos look columnar in the second section. There, dancers in elegant apposition pivot in on themselves and bend to one another, like heavy-branched, resilient willows, with the lightness of a sigh. ''Back to Bach'' closes with an endearingly joyful men's dance. Luxurious turns and spectacular, curling leaps stand out in the intricate contrapuntal weave. One dancer, who inadvertently fell, made a beautifully choreographed recovery that was almost alone worth the price of admission. These are performers who seem to think for themselves. ''Local Stops on a Full Moon,'' the evening's other premiere, is the kind of dramatic dance for which Mr. Pomare is best known. Set to a jazz score as lilting, throbbing and teasing as the dance - and composed by Ray Leslee and played by Mr. Leslee, Jack Boshkow, Todd Roberto and Manolo Bodrena - ''Local Stops'' depicts the people who pass by one another on New York's 14th Street subway and bus lines, grim survivors of urban life. Among the characters are Andrea Borak's obsessive, paranoid bag lady, captured with compelling sympathy. Danced by Craig Moore and Leni Wylliams, a rawly erotic, sado-masochistic duet for male lovers is bittersweet and sensuous. So powerful are the performances of Roxane D'Orleans Juste and Monique Mannen, as two boozed-out but still dreaming beauties, that Lenni Schwendigger's handsome projections suddenly seem a distraction. Charles Grant and the sexily imperious Dyane Harvey are a pair of bored, combative lovers, and Erroll Simpson wanders by as a gorgeously goofy transvestite. Deborah Redd is harrowing as the childlike victim of Thomas Reid's quack abortionist. Gina Ellis and Robin Becker strut in and out of the piece, two nutty dancers bent on audition. Miss Ellis's moment of despair, in the abortion scene, stunningly registers the characters' common humanity. ''Lament for Visionaries'' is dedicated to three assassinated American leaders -- the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., President Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy. But it is, at heart, a showcase for the gifted Mr. Grant, a dancer of fine-drawn, eloquent strength. ''Orbweb'' is familiar Freudian entomology, with Mr. Moore and Robin Becker outstanding as the protagonists in this bug-eat- bug world. Colonizing missionaries are the target of the revived ''Missa Luba,'' as smooth a blending of disparate rituals as its score, a Latin Mass chanted by the Congolese Boys Choir. It also features brilliant-hued costumes by Esteban Chavao. In a revival of ''Radiance of the Dark,'' Mr. Pomare summons up Prophet Jones, an elegant snake of a 1950's Harlem storefront guru, in a showstopping performance by Mr. Wylliams. At their most handsome in this setting, the dancers are treasures and the dances are not to be missed. But don't waste a second getting to the Joyce. The season ends on Sunday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAN IN THE NEWS; NEW TYPE OF MAYOR-ELECT IN BOSTON: RAYMOND LEO FLYNN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/17/us/man-in-the-news-new-type-of-mayor-elect-in-boston-raymond-leo-flynn.html,"There have been mornings when Catherine Flynn has come downstairs in the shingled house on Flint Place in South Boston, and found a homeless man, a derelict, slumbering on the couch. Her husband, the Mayor-elect of Boston, had seen him slumped in some doorway as he returned from a meeting the night before, and had brought him home for a sandwich and a bed. Neighbors of Catherine and Raymond L. Flynn say that the six Flynn children keep the house full of friends and visitors, and that the oldest son has his father's habit of bringing hungry acquaintances of all races home for a sandwich or dinner. That is unusual in the poor, clannish, and heavily Irish Catholic enclave of South Boston, where black children are bused into school but do not linger to fraternize. And that is a lot of sandwiches for a City Councilman with a wife, six children, and a salary of only $32,500 a year. Modest Style of Living ''We don't live very lavishly,'' Mr. Flynn said today. ''We don't buy clothes, we don't buy cars, we don't go on trips on vacation, and we don't go to the country club.'' His supporters, the working-class and middle-class neighborhood people who helped elect him Mayor Tuesday by a vote margin of better than two to one in a nonpartisan runoff, laugh and call him ''Plain Ray.'' Charles E. Doyle, of Allston, joined the Flynn campaign last year after watching the mayoral candidates at a neighborhood association meeeting. ''Everyone else showed up in pinstriped suits with red ties,'' Mr. Doyle said Tuesday night at Mr. Flynn's victory celebration. ''Then came Flynn, an ordinary guy from the neighborhoods. He slouched in his chair. Then, when he took out his Blistex and put it on the cold sore on his lip, you knew he was one of us.'' Son of Longshoreman He is Raymond Leo Flynn, 44 years old, the son of an immigrant longshoreman, a native of South Boston, a famous high school ballplayer there, and the first of its sons ever to be elected Mayor of Boston. Today, by invitation of Mayor Kevin H. White, who did not run for re-election, Mr. Flynn had lunch at the Parkman House. Tonight, Mayor White, whom one Boston columnist dubbed ''Mayor Deluxe'' for his love of the finer things, leaves on a two-week, privately financed trip to France, Spain and Italy with a clutch of his appointees. And Mr. Flynn, after a few days of rest somewhere with his family, will start assembling the administration that promises to change the style and emphasis of city government here. He comes to office as a plain man of many, and changing, parts, appealing to both liberals and conservatives. Before the campaign cut his mileage down to zero, his idea of relaxation was running 12 or 13 miles a day. He works nights and weekends. In the last 10 years, as he moved from the State House of Representatives to the City Council, he was hospitalized twice for exhaustion as he opposed busing, abortion, homosexual rights and pistol controls, some of which he now supports. Past Legislative Battles But he worked hard for tenants' rights, rent control and assistance and welfare payments. And in the years of violent fighting in the desegregation of South Boston High School, he walked the hallways and sat the stairwells with white and black students alike to keep the peace. In years past, he favored the death penalty and opposed the equal rights amendment. Now he does the reverse. Rosemarie Sansone, a former City Council member and manager of the campaign in Massachusetts for the amendment, says Mr. Flynn began to broaden when he moved from representing South Boston in the State House to the whole city from an at- large seat on the council. ''There were a number of different constituencies he began to have to deal with - women, gays, blacks,'' she said. ''He grew to match the area he represented.'' An Astute Politician The high school athlete, the ''ordinary guy,'' was sophisticated enough politically to hire a polling and political analysis firm a year ago. But the campaign theme of appealing to the common human concerns of diverse neighborhoods, of returning political power and government services to them, was Mr. Flynn's. ''Ray Flynn had a much better vision of what this campaign was about than either we did or his opponents did,'' said Lawrence Rasky, his poll- taker. Today, Mr. Flynn went back to South Boston High School, which the Superintendant of Schools has said should be closed because he sees it as a waste of resources. Mr. Flynn, still a foe of busing but a supporter of his school, has pledged to sit as an ex-officio member of the Boston School Committee, the first Mayor to do so. In the school cafeteria this morning, the students - black and white, Cambodian and American Indian - cheered. ''One little black girl from Roxbury asked him,'' Headmaster Jerome Winegar said, '' 'Are you going to have some say in keeping South Boston open?' '' ''You'd better believe it,'' the Mayor-elect replied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BISHOPS TO DRAFT STATEMENT ON CATHOLIC WOMEN'S ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/18/us/bishops-to-draft-statement-on-catholic-women-s-role.html,"Buoyed by its recent success in hammering out a pastoral letter condemning nuclear arms, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops voted today to make a statement about the role of women in the church. Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., chairman of the committee on women in the church, said the statement, a pastoral letter that would take at least four years to write, would examine the possibility of wider roles for women within the boundaries of Roman Catholic Church law. Women may not now be ordained as priests nor may parishes use altar girls. Bishop Michael H. Kenny of Juneau, Alaska, told the bishops, ''Some of the injustices toward women are in our own house.'' In their final day of meetings, the bishops issued a pastoral letter on ministry to Hispanic people and affirmed Central American church hierarchies' opposition to the use of force to resolve the region's conflicts. They also endorsed a progress report by Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee on a pastoral letter on Catholic thought and the American economic system. Like the proposed statement on women, the document on the economy is expected to generate much debate when it is issued, probably by 1985. Pressure by Vatican In their four-day session, the bishops indicated in many ways their desire to continue to address difficult issues. They also showed signs of caution in the face of some Vatican pressures to better promote the church's teachings on sexuality. In the past few months, most American bishops have made their regular visits to Pope John Paul II. In those visits, the Pope and top Vatican officials expressed some unhappiness that large numbers of American Catholics were not heeding those teachings. Some of this unhappiness has been linked to the aspirations of American Catholic women for a much greater role in the church, including ordination. As the bishops voted without dissent to issue the pastoral letter on women, they insisted they would abide by the Vatican's flat rejection of women as priests. Some said privately, however, that the issue would be difficult to avoid. Archbishop John R. Roach of Minneapolis, the retiring president of the bishops' conference, said the present strains indicated a period of growing maturation in relations between the American hierarchy and the Vatican and represented a new test of collegiality. Many bishops said, however, that he was only putting the best face on a confusing and distressing situation. Officials of the conference agreed that certain tensions had complicated their relationship with the Vatican but denied that the Pope had been critical of them in his recent admonitions. Some bishops suggested that the Pope was actually talking more to the American laity than to the bishops in urging greater moral discipline. Issue Is 'Serious Matter' Bishop Imesch said the pastoral letter on women would include a look at their history and present status, explore ''ways that the talents of women could be better used in the service of the church'' and ''encourage and affirm'' the roles women are already fulfilling. Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, who was chairman of the war and peace committee, which produced the statement on that topic, said the issue of women was ''one more serious matter we face. It is not a passing phenomenon, and we cannot respond by ignoring it or treating it superficially.'' Some prelates, including Bishop Ernest L. Unterkoefler of Charleston, S.C., noted that some women had voiced objections to an all-male group writing about women. Bishop Unterkoefler said the issue of ''male dominance'' was important and should be addressed in the pastoral letter. A conference on women in the church was held for the two days before the bishops' meeting. More than 100 bishops joined 50 representatives from women's organizations to discuss the theological and historical factors that led to women's current status in the church. Reasons for Current Status A growing number of scholars believe women have been barred from the Catholic clergy for primarily secular rather than sacred reasons. Feminists see the chief problem as patriarchal structures that were absorbed into the church despite the tendency toward equality found in the earliest decades of the church and in the example of Jesus's treatment of women. As feminism has challenged church policy and women have become more opposed to the restrictions against them, many have left the church or exist at the fringe. Church leaders have become increasingly worried about this trend, and the pastoral letter is seen as a way to address it. Another matter of concern to women is how much communities of nuns have heeded the Second Vatican Council's call for renewal of religious structures in reference to the modern world. Nuns have gone to great lengths, often through painful testing, to adapt their lives and ministries to present-day needs. Many see the Vatican as fighting against their progress. Among the American bishops, a rising number see the need to reinforce the adaptations nuns have made in the past 15 years, Study of Religious Orders The pastoral letter on women's roles coincides with a study of American religious orders recently ordered by the Pope. Though Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, referred to the study as a ''pastoral service'' in remarks to the bishops, many nuns have expressed fears that the project may be a Vatican effort to root out dissent and nonconformity. By adopting the pastoral letter on Hispanic people, the bishops highlighted an area of the church that is burgeoning. Hispanic people make up a third of more of all Catholics in some parts of the country, including Miami, Los Angeles and New York. The bishops' document recognizes the place of Hispanic culture within the church and pledges resources to aid ministries to Hispanic people, including programs to fight injustice. Peace Theme Continues The bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace, completed last spring, remained very much on their minds this week. Bishop Kenny, for example, in responding to the view that male clerics should not write about women, said the bishops had encountered similar charges that they were ''out of their field of expertise'' in preparing the pastoral on nuclear war. Cardinal Bernardin, who has assumed the chairmanship of the Bishops' Pro-Life Committee in place of the late Terence Cardinal Cooke, vowed to tie the antinuclear theme to a renewed campaign against abortion. ''All life issues constitute a seamless garment,'' Cardinal Bernardin said. He said his committee would press the connection between the ''promotion of peace'' and the ''promotion of the life of the unborn'' more vigorously and extensively than had been possible in the war and peace document. Several bishops also urged their colleagues to continue to apply the principles of the pastoral letter on nuclear war to current developments in the arms race. Asserting that the arms race continued to escalate, Bishop Thomas A. Gumbleton of Detroit said, ''We as leaders need to be involved in that debate.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BABY JANE: A LINE THAT NEED NOT BE DRAWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/18/opinion/l-baby-jane-a-line-that-need-not-be-drawn-050387.html,"To the Editor: Your editorial ''Baby Jane's Big Brothers'' was quite a chilling experience on a number of counts. Your implication that the Albany lawyer who took Baby Jane's parents to court had no right to interfere because he was connected with neither the family nor the hospital is one that I would take issue with. Though I would not take a family to court for their decision not to continue investing in their ''hopelessly ill'' child, there certainly should be a forum for concerned members of the human race to express their interest in aiding those as voiceless as handicapped infants. I do not doubt the depth of the parents' own soul-searching in such a heartbreaking case before reaching their conclusion, arrived at with the advice of doctors, clergy and child- protection agencies, but I believe that the life of a helpless human being deserves at least as much meditation and discussion as has been given to the question of capital punishment. I also found your use of the term ''Big Brothers'' to attack the Federal Government for involving itself in the case offensive. Your attempt to ridicule the Government's decision to determine whether Baby Jane has been discriminated against because she is handicapped demeans the seriousness of this life-and-death issue. As one who agrees that the Federal Government should be true to its promise to ''get off people's backs,'' I think it also must in some instances come to the aid of its citizens. I therefore found this episode of concern rather heartwarming. We may still be living in a dark age spiritually, but let's be grateful for those protective meddlers who altered such horrors as the child-labor situation and the treatment of the mentally ill and elderly and other trapped people who were very much discriminated against because of their handicaps. Though we may never on such sensitive issues reach a conclusion that suits everyone's conscience, perhaps these concerned forces might discover a means to relieve the parents who, understandably, may have come to the end of their emotional and financial resources. Perhaps Mr. Washburn (the Albany lawyer) and the Government could come up with an adoption arrangement for such cases, just as the groups lobbying against abortion should devote their energies to caring for some of the world's unwanted children.

NEW JERSEYANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/nyregion/new-jerseyans.html,"-agers who have babies often choose to keep their children, childless couples who want to adopt an infant are ''going to have trouble,'' says Toni McHugh of the Morris County community of New Vernon, chairman of the National Committee for Adoption. However, Mrs. McHugh adds, the bright side of this picture for the thousands of waiting couples in New Jersey is that there are many ''special- needs'' children waiting for homes. Such children are those who are older or handicapped. But prospective adoptive couples - especially young ones - can be apprehensive about raising an older or handicapped child, Mrs. McHugh notes. They may need training and education before they assume the responsibilities of child rearing. To help adoptive couples by providing them with information and support, and to promote the awareness of children who are in need of parents, a number of adoption agencies and groups are holding an Adoption Fair at the Prudential Insurance Company in Holmdel from 2 to 5 P.M. today. In the adoption scene of today, change is true not only of the chlidren but also of the parents. Single-parent adoptions may be a ''wave'' of the future, Mrs. McHugh said, adding: ''If there's a person out there willing to take an older child in, that's great. What these kids need is a home. Someone to take them in and love them - forever.'' A Newark theater director has been taking youngsters off the streets and training them for professional dance careers. Several weeks ago, Marvin Felix Camillo , founder and director of The Family, a repertory theater, piled a bunch of ''breakers'' and ''wrappers'' into a van and headed them into New York City for a film audition. ''I found them dancing on cardboard on the streets,'' he said. ''Breakers'' is a term for those who do ''break-dancing,'' a street-dance combination of salsa, ballet, modern dance and acrobatics. ''Wrappers,'' Mr. Camillo said, are reciters of didactic song-poetry. The youngsters under his auspices hail from Newark and Irvington and have given themselves names such as ''Down to Break'' and ''The Dynamic Breakers.'' All the fledgling performers got ''call-backs,'' which means being asked back for a second round of auditions. Tomorrow, Mr. Camillo will pile them back into the van and the young hopefuls will do their routines again for the casting directors of ''Beach Street,'' a film being produced by Harry Belafonte and David Picker for Orion Studios. Two of the dancers shepherded by Mr. Camillo already have achieved a measure of acclaim: the dance team of Kelvin and Evelyn. Last year, this duo from the Dayton Street housing project in Newark placed second in the Harvest Moon Ball, an annual dance contest in New York City, and appeared on ''Dance Fever,'' a television dance program. ''They're an example of where you can go with dance,'' said Mr. Camillo. ''What's important is being able to channel what these kids do on the street, on cardboard, to a larger artistic forum.'' The sponsoring of young dancers is all part of the work of The Family, which has been performing and holding outreach workshops for school and community groups in Newark since the 1960's. But all of these efforts might soon be over because of the group's lack of funds. To try to keep afloat, it is holding a series of flea markets and holiday gift sales on Saturdays, through Dec. 10, at its headquarters, 34 Spruce Street. ''Unless we're able to generate support, it's questionable how long we can survive in Newark,'' Mr. Camillo said. ''Anti-Semitism in the Contemporary World,'' the first major international conference on the subject in the metropolitan area, began yesterday and will continue through tomorrow at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. ''Since the middle of 1982 - with political developments in Lebanon - it sometimes becomes difficult to differentiate between the attitude of people toward Israel and their attitude toward Jews,'' said Dr. Michael Curtis, professor of political science at Rutgers and convenor of the conference. Scholars from Israel, Canada, Britain, France and Ireland, as well as from this country, are examining modern-day anti-Semitism's tie-in with anti-Zionism and to what extent bias against Jews still exists. ''If a synagogue is bombed in Hartford or in Paris,'' said Dr. Curtis, an expert on the Middle East, ''it suggests that the virus of anti-Semitism is still alive.'' As to how to combat it, he says: ''The starting point is the recognition of the disease. The action is the treatment: how it can be cured. Or, if not cured, at least attended to.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BREAKUP OF BLACK FAMILY IMPERILS GAINS OF DECADES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/us/breakup-of-black-family-imperils-gains-of-decades.html,"At the height of the civil rights movement in 1965, when a quarter of black families with children were headed by women, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in a report to President Johnson that this growing matriarchy was an important cause of poverty among black Americans. Mr. Moynihan, then a White House aide, created a furor, accused by many of blaming the victims for their distress. Today, 18 years later, virtually half of black families are headed by single women, and 55 percent of black babies are born to unmarried mothers. Gun-shy from the Moynihan experience, authorities for years were reluctant to speak out about the problem. But now, politicians and scholars - black and white, liberal and conservative - openly agree that the situation has reached such proportions that it threatens to undo the black economic gains of the past three decades. Growing Alarm Among Blacks The breakdown of traditional family structure is, they say, one of the underlying causes of black poverty, not only because there is no man to provide family income but also because women on the average earn much less than men. Moreover, many black spokesmen are saying for the first time that this is one of the most serious problems facing their communities and that it may mean that larger and larger proportions of coming generations of blacks will grow up disadvantaged. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a law professor at Georgetown University who was chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Carter Administration, termed the family crisis ''a threat to the future of black people without equal.'' The problem must be resolved, the experts say, because otherwise society at large will have to pay the price, either in compensatory measures to prop up fractured lives or in strife and social conflict as the gap widens between the privileged and the excluded. An Unmistakable Correlation It is an open question which is more important: that breakdown in family structure causes poverty or that poverty is a cause of the breakdown. But the correlation between the two is unmistakable, and it is prompting a serious debate over the causes of the problem and a search for solutions. A study last summer by the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a nonpartisan research group, showed that in all races, families headed by women were twice as likely as two-parent families to be poor. Half of all families headed by black women have incomes below the poverty line, the study showed. The study noted that in 1981 the average income of black families with two working parents was 84 percent of the average for white families where both parents worked, an increase from 73 percent 13 years earlier. In contrast, a primary reason that the average income for all black families with children was just 56 percent of the average for whites, the study concluded, was that 47 percent of black families were headed by women, as against 14 percent of white ones. Losses Exceed Gains ''Since black, female-headed households are the most rapidly increasing proportion of all black families, the fact that they have not gained economic ground has more than offset the increases made by other types of black families,'' the report said. The principal author of the report was the director of the center, Tom Joe, who was a welfare official in the Nixon Administration. In one sense, according to some experts, single black mothers may represent a vanguard. These experts suggest that more and more white women will become single parents as they build a longer tradition of working and financial independence. But the far-reaching effects on the black community might be mitigated among whites, partly because white women tend to get divorced less often than blacks and tend more often to remarry. The problems of single mothers, black and white, are compounded by the fact that working women, on the average, earn much less than men. According to the Census Bureau, the median earnings of working black women last year were actually slightly higher than those of working white women, $7,802 as against $7,640. But the average working man earned about twice as much, $15,373. ''With the next generation,'' Mrs. Norton said, ''we could see proportionately greater numbers of disadvantaged people than in this generation, because of the proportion of children who got their start in life as the children of single girls and women.'' Experts Voice Disagreement While the politicians and social scientists agree that the dissolution of the black family structure has been a main cause of poverty among blacks, they disagree sharply over why such disintegration has occurred and over the possible remedies. One camp, which includes many members of the Reagan Administration, argues that the nation's welfare system has encouraged families to split up and has led to a state of welfare dependency for generation after generation of blacks. They would reduce Government social programs, require able individuals on welfare to work and place more emphasis on apprehending fathers and forcing them to support their children. Another camp, comprising many liberals and most, but not all, black scholars, believes that the causes are much more complex but center on the history of discrimination against blacks in this country and the inability of black men to find work to support their families. They say the situation would be much worse if not for Government welfare programs, and they would expand both those programs and various social services designed to counsel black families, discourage teen-age pregnancies and help single women with children to make it on their own. Here are the arguments advanced by the experts in both camps: Welfare For many years, the nation's primary welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, denied benefits to families if an adult male was in the house. That bar was stricken in 1968, and states were permitted, but not required, to cover two-parent families in which the would-be breadwinner was unemployed or underemployed. Some people believe that the man-in-the-house rule has contributed to family breakup by forcing fathers to leave the home. Others disagree. Mr. Joe, for example, noted that New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and 18 other states, which together account for 70 percent of the nation's families on welfare, offer aid that covers unemployed fathers in the home. Yet only about 300,000 such families are covered out of a national welfare caseload of 3.6 million families. War on Poverty Is Blamed The conservative economist George Gilder asserts that conservatives were right in their prediction that the income redistribution programs of President Johnson's ''war on poverty'' would result in ''destroying the incentives and families of the poor.'' In an attack this fall on what he termed ''the welfare state disaster,'' Mr. Gilder wrote, ''Current programs will continue to create a criminal underclass of unlisted male welfare beneficiaries who exploit the welfare trap by living off a series of female recipients - and extend it by violence ever deeper into the heart of our cities and our national consciousness.'' Mr. Joe, whose organization has been conducting a detailed study of the Reagan Administration's 1981 cuts in welfare programs, said a ''dual system of family law, one for the rich, the other for the poor'' was evolving. He cited as an example a new welfare regulation requiring, he said, that ''if a 'stepfather' enters the home, he's liable for not only the support of the mother but also all of the kids.'' He said this meant that a working man who wished to marry a woman on welfare would face the prospect of assuming responsibility for the support of children that were not his. Many states, New York among them, have had difficulty even defining what a stepfather is, Mr. Joe added. Poverty 'Culture' Disputed So-called ''culture of poverty'' theories have long held that dependence on welfare can become so entrenched that it creates its own subculture with values that encourage remaining in poverty and attitudes that discourage self-reliance. A pioneering study by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, one of the few research projects that followed welfare recipients for many years, disputes such theories. In a report released last month, the institute said that at least among blacks, long-term welfare dependency as a child does not necessarily lead to long-term welfare dependency as an adult. The Michigan study team, headed by Dr. Martha S. Hill, also found that ''while children from poor households are more likely to be poor as young adults,'' nevertheless ''parental attitudes and values, with few exceptions, did not make any difference in the economic well-being of the children after they left home.'' Teen-Age Pregnancy One reason more black children than white children live in single-parent families is the higher degree of teen-age pregnancies among blacks. Among all unmarried women 15 to 19 years old in 1979, blacks were 50 percent more likely than whites to have had sexual intercourse, according to a survey published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the National Institutes of Health. More than one in four blacks was born to a teen-age mother in 1979, according to figures compiled by the Children's Defense Fund, a child advocacy group based in Washington. The comparable figure for whites was one in seven. The group found that the birth rate declined among single black teen-agers in the 1970's, but it dropped even faster among older and married black women. Studies show these groups are more likely to use contraception or have abortions than unmarried black teen-agers. Thus, the proportion of young, single mothers among blacks rose. In addition, sexual activity among blacks in this age group appeared not to be increasing, while such activity among white teen-agers was growing rapidly, the Guttmacher study found. Conservatives Cite Welfare Some authorities think the Government encourages teen-age pregnancy by providing a haven for young mothers and by creating a dependency in people who otherwise would have to find some way to survive on their own. ''If you look at the data,'' said Robert B. Carleson, President Reagan's adviser for social policy development, ''as the welfare system has gotten more expansive, there is a correlation between the growth of programs and the explosion of families in the teen-age group.'' He said the failure to form families in the first place was regarded by the Administration as an even greater problem than family breakup. ''This is probably the toughest welfare problem there is,'' Mr. Carleson said. ''Because the welfare system provides money, free medical care, food stamps and other things to a woman who has a child if she's single, the question is, does that encourage or induce or in any other way cause the problem of teen-age pregnancy.'' Media Pressures Blamed Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, blamed the relaxed sexual mores that have evolved in American society in the last 20 or so years, particularly the sexually charged messages of contemporary entertainment: motion pictures, television and popular music. ''The message they convey to children is 'anything goes,' '' she asserted. Some scholars assert that the poor economic prospects of black teen-agers may have wrought a fundamental change of mores in the black community. Dr. Harriett Pipes McAdoo, a sociologist at Howard University who has specialized in the study of disadvantaged women and children, said: ''The tradition used to be that if a woman got pregnant, they were expected to get married, if not forced to get married, to supply income and a name for the child. But if the man has no job, there's no impetus for them to get married. Her parents would have three people to support instead of just two. The boy would become an additional burden on the family. Parents feel: 'Why should I force her to marry him? He'll be a drain.' '' Whites More Often Marry A study by the National Center for Health Statistics, the only available research on the subject, found that in 1972, 49.5 percent of white women who conceived out of wedlock married before their babies were born. For black women, the figure was 11.7 percent. The figures were not broken down by age. The Children's Defense Fund also cites limited research, based on reports from eight states in 1979, showing that among all pregnant teen-agers, 41 percent of whites had abortions while only 26 percent of blacks did. But among pregnant older and married women, blacks are almost twice as likely to have an abortion as whites, the research showed. Unemployed Men A number of policy analysts believe that the underlying cause of the increase in black families headed by women is the sharp increase in the joblessness of black men. ''The name of this game is not marriage - the name of this game is income,'' said Mr. Joe, author of the recent study that addressed black poverty. The joblessness is reflected not simply in the unemployment recorded in monthly government figures, which is nevertheless higher for blacks than for other major ethnic groups. It also includes the growing numbers of discouraged workers who have given up looking for jobs and the many black men in America's cities and rural areas who, lacking jobs and permanent addresses, are not counted by census- takers. Among black teen-agers, the official unemployment rate hovers around 50 percent, but according to Sar A. Levitan, an employment analyst, ''only one-sixth of them have jobs'' because so many have dropped out of or never joined the labor force. Women as Breadwinners From 1960 to 1982, families headed by black women as a percentage of all black households with children rose to 47 percent from 21 percent. Over the same span, the percentage of employed adult black men plunged to 55 percent from 74 percent. Some studies suggest that if the black men who cannot be enumerated by census-takers were added to the total, the result would show that fewer than half of adult black men in the country have jobs. Even those black men who do work earn significantly less than white men, an average of $10,510 last year, against $15,964 for white men. Conservative theorists, including many in the Reagan Administration, argue that the main cause of the high joblessness is not discrimination but rather the absence among many blacks of basic working skills. Administration officials say blacks should emulate the experience of those aliens in this country illegally who started in the lowest- level jobs and worked their way up through the system. But many who have studied the problems of the black family say historic and continuing discrimination against black men robs many of the ability to function as the family breadwinner. Scholars Cite Racism ''The present black family crisis, characterized chiefly by the precipitous growth of poor, female-headed households, can be traced almost directly to American racism,'' said a report by 30 black scholars who met in Tarrytown, N.Y., earlier this year. The group ranked the issue of the black family equally with the economy and education as the critical concerns of the black community. Among dozens of black women heading families who were interviewed in several cities by The New York Times, there were many who observed, like Miriam, a Harlem resident who did not want her last name used, that while they were able to make a living, their men were not. ''He used to say, 'You're going here, there and everywhere, and I'm going nowhere,' '' Miriam, an executive secretary, said of her former husband. ''He just didn't have any drive. I was moving ahead and he was moving backwards. After a while he just couldn't take being bested by a woman. He started to hate me, but most of all he hated himself.'' Frustration Among Men Some psychiatrists regard such a reaction as the classic response to a sense of futility that grows within many black men and boys when they believe the cards are stacked against them. Dr. James Comer, the Maurice Falk Professor of Child Psychiatry at Yale University's Child Study Center in New Haven, said many black men came to feel that, instead of trying against high odds and failing, it was better not to try. ''In a society where the male is supposed to be the breadwinner,'' he said, ''something that's still deep in our psychology, it's a tremendous psychological burden when you know you don't have a snowball's chance in hell of taking care of your family. One of the defenses is not to care, to not do, not try.'' Dr. Comer said the American system, to justify itself, had to rationalize its abuses of blacks. Therefore, he said, ''it has to not only deny the black male but it has to destroy him, put him down, make him look stupid, inadequate and weak.'' Moreover, he maintained, ''Men who see no opportunities for making it in the job market and of establishing themselves, and seeing themselves as inadequate, often seek adequacy and adulthood as males by producing a baby.'' ''Females also often seek to prove that they are someone of worth and value by producing a child,'' he added. Mr. Carleson, President Reagan's assistant, said the Administration was concerned with avoiding ''writing off'' persistently jobless black men ''as the hard-core unemployed.'' ''But the fact of the matter is that they're not going to be able to get any jobs that are there because of these basic skills'' that they lack, he said, adding, ''The fact that so many illegal aliens are coming in, and on the bottom rung, and going up the ladder, that's evidence you've got to have those basic skills.'' Women as Vanguard Black women have been in the work force in large numbers for much longer than white women. After World War II, millions of blacks left Southern farms, the women often recruited to work as maids for Northern whites, the men to work in factories. Mechanization began to eliminate sharecropping, the economic system that replaced slavery in the South. The consequences were widespread. Black families and communities that had functioned as economic and social units for decades on the farm were cut adrift and scattered. An extended family structure surviving from African traditions and its attendant values largely succumbed to the impersonal isolation of the cities. Getting Out of the Home Even among the middle class, which for white women has customarily meant staying home to care for the family, black women's income has usually been needed to keep the family at middle-income level. As a result, black women, earlier than other women, have made the next step of having and supporting children independently. Over the past 20 years, white women's participation in the labor force has been catching up and has now passed that of black women. In 1960, 43.6 percent of black women were employed, as against 34.6 percent of whites. In 1970, it was 44.9 percent of black women against 40.3 percent of whites, and last year the proportion of black women working leveled off at 44.8 percent, while the figure for white women jumped to 48.4 percent. As white women have entered the labor force, the percentage of female-headed households among whites, while much smaller than among blacks, has risen, and at a rate almost as rapid. Among white families, 2.8 percent were headed by women in 1950, 6 percent in 1960, and 13.9 percent in 1982, compared with 8.3 percent, 20.7 percent and 47.1 percent for blacks in those years. Declining Stigma for Whites Less of a social stigma has been attached to a woman as a single parent in the black community than in the white one. Mrs. Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund said, ''It's more acceptable to have a baby than to have an abortion,'' in part because of strong religious views among many blacks. Now, there are signs that the stigma is declining in the white community, as more middle-class white women choose openly to have babies without husbands. Also, the white divorce rate has risen in step with women's financial independence, with the result that more white women, too, are single parents as a result of divorce. But white women more often remarry than black women do, and the percentage of divorced black women is double that of whites. A publication released in August by the Rand Corporation, the California research company, noted that in 1982 ''fully 21 percent of all families with children'' were one-parent families. Rand cited research showing that ''demographers estimate that 46 percent of children born in the late 1970's will spend some part of their youth in one-parent families.'' Remedies Controversy is growing about potential remedies to the breakdown in the traditional black family structure. Some analysts, primarily but not exclusively political conservatives, argue that governmental programs have undermined the nuclear family structure. They say poor people generally and blacks in particular would be better off without such intervention. Mr. Gilder, the conservative economist, maintains, for example: ''Illegitimacy means that the sons will be brought up in homes where money is seen as an always-inadequate entitlement to women from the state. Many of these youths express no comprehension of the requirements of a job; most have hardly ever met a working man who supports his children. They will find their manhood not by emulating adults but by fierce street rivalries with their peers.'' ''But,'' he continues, ''any girl is offered an irresistible solution by the U.S. Government. It presents her, at age 16, a chance for independence in an apartment of her own; free housing, medicine, legal assistance, and a combination of payments and food stamps worth several hundred dollars a month. There is only one crucial condition. She must bear an illegitimate child.'' Others, including civil rights groups and most political liberals, argue that without the existing income, educational and social supports, flawed though they are, the situation would be much worse, and that such assistance must be strengthened rather than abandoned. 'Workfare' Plan Debated The Reagan Administration is promoting its community work experience program, or ''workfare,'' as a federally financed program to put the unemployed to work for local public agencies in return for their income payments. Mr. Carleson, the Presidential aide, said low-skill jobs, in parks departments, for example, would equip the jobless with the work habits they need to make them employable by private industry. Others argue, however, that black workers have once again been disproportionately displaced by major structural changes in the employment market, similar to the demise of the Southern agricultural economy, and that it is inequitable to advance as the solution that they start again on the bottom rung. John Jacob, president of the National Urban League, observed that important sources of jobs for blacks were lost in the decline of the automobile, steel and rubber industries and said these would require a national industrial policy to replace. ''To develop a work force that won't be outpaced by the high rate of technological development requires a strategy in which we are continually retraining our work force for the new jobs constantly coming on stream,'' he said. The Tarrytown group, which included Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the sociologist; Dr. Bernard Anderson, director of social services for the Rockefeller Foundation, and Patricia Roberts Harris, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and of Health and Human Services, said governmental assistance programs for poor mothers, in particular, ''need to be completely reconceptualized and redesigned.'' Special Programs Endorsed Mrs. Norton, the former Carter Administration jobs official, and other black spokesmen including officials of the Urban League are endorsing a concept of incorporating job training into the welfare system so that women can ''graduate'' into self-supporting work. In addition, a few private institutions have started experimental programs working with teen-age mothers, teen- age fathers and older women who head families. The Ford Foundation, for example, operates a trial program in Harlem in which young women with babies are assigned older, more experienced women to teach them not only practical skills but also maturity and responsibility. Mrs. Edelman has begun calling on black community organizations, starting with churches, fraternal groups and women's professional groups, to provide support, guidance, counseling and role models to poor black families. Such efforts would be particularly directed at teen-agers, similar to the Big Brother and Big Sister programs. The Need for Opportunity But Mrs. Edelman said there would never be a solution to problems like teen-age pregnancy until black youngsters, male and female, are able to see brighter futures, in the form of demonstrable economic opportunity for black people. ''Opportunity means hope,'' she said. ''The bottom line is that too few black parents have been able to show children that if you are upright, you will do well in this society.'' Franklin Thomas, president of the Ford Foundation, said: ''For years you would have thought there was a taboo in even discussing the problem. But that's clearly gone. It's a recognition of how serious the problem is.''

LEGISLATORS DOUBTFUL OF DEALING WITH BUDGET BEFORE '84 ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/us/legislators-doubtful-of-dealing-with-budget-before-84-election.html,"As members of Congress scattered for home today for a two-month vacation, they left behind a $200 billion budget deficit and expressed little confidence that they would deal with the problem before the 1984 election. Early in the year, cooperation between the Republican leadership of the Senate and the Democratic leadership of the House produced some major legislation, particularly a plan to rescue the troubled Social Security System. The lawmakers also took pride in passing 10 of the 13 appropriation bills needed annually to finance the Government, the most to clear Congress in recent years. Not a Dollar on Deficit But by fall, political calculations so pervaded Capitol Hill that the lawmakers failed to make any significant impact on the budget deficit. Congress promised in its budget resolution to trim $85 billion from the deficit over three years, but when the adjournment bell rang at 10:04 P.M. Friday, not one dollar of reductions had actually been approved. At one late-night session this week, Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee, accused his colleagues of ''copping out'' on the deficit problem and added, ''We need the significant support of the President to do anything, and if you're asking me whether the President will change his mind, I don't think so.'' From Reagan, Praise and Blame Even though the economic recovery seems to be holding, the lawmakers left town with voices of doom echoing in their ears. One was that of Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California. He told the House Friday, ''The budget process, the deficit, and the economy are in deep trouble.'' President Reagan, who came into office promising to balance the Federal budget, has repeatedly blamed Congress for rising deficits, and he did so today in his weekly radio broadcast, although he also had praise for the year's legislative accomplishments. Many members of Congress in both parties say one major reason for the deficit is President Reagan's adamant insistence on higher military spending and lower taxes. They agree with Senator Domenici that Congress will not act to close that gap until Mr. Reagan takes the lead and provides political cover for the unpopular decisions that will be required. ''This is President Reagan's deficit,'' Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican, told the Senate this week, ''but from the Administration we have heard nothing but silence.'' The lawmakers did display considerable restraint in adopting appropriation bills. All 10 that went to the White House stayed within spending targets set by the budget last spring, and so while President Reagan threatened to veto any bills that went too far, he never got the chance. The War Powers Resolution In foreign affairs, Congress's most notable achievement was probably passage of legislation declaring that the War Powers Resolution applies to Lebanon and limiting deployment of the Marines there to 18 months. President Reagan expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the act, but he signed the bill, becoming the first President in the 10-year history of the act to effectively acknowledge its validity. The year was marked by frequent tension between Congress and the White House on issues ranging from the MX missile to the secret war in Nicaragua to nuclear arms negotiations. As James M. Cannon, chief of staff for Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader, put it, ''One of the things we do in this city is constantly define and redefine the relation of the Congress to the President on foreign policy.'' Mr. Reagan won most of the battles, mainly because there is a lingering presumption in Congress that the President is ultimately responsible for foreign policy. But the lawmakers expressed determination to keep a careful eye on the Administration's policies abroad, particularly where they might lead to armed conflict. 'Watch, Watch, Watch' ''This comes from the indelible etch of Vietnam,'' asserted Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican. ''We've got to watch, watch, watch.'' In the first two years of the Reagan Administration, Republicans used the support of conservative Democrats in the House and the political popularity of the President to dominate the agenda on Capitol Hill. But as the economy failed to revive, last November's election swept in a net increase of 26 House Democrats and sent shock waves through Republican ranks. ''The tone for this Congress was set by the 1982 elections,'' said an aide to the Senate Republican leadership. ''We had several members scared for their political life, and Speaker O'Neill was dealing from a much stronger hand.'' The Baker-O'Neill Cooperation This new power balance started having an impact in the post-election session of the last Congress, when Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the leading Democrat in Congress, and Senator Baker, the chief Republican, worked together to pass an increase in the gasoline tax and provide funds for new public works projects. When the lawmakers returned to Washington last January to begin the 98th Congress, concern was still high about the sluggish economy and persistent unemployment. Mr. Baker and Mr. O'Neill again cooperated to push through a $4.6 billion package of job- creation programs and emergency aid for victims of the recession. The two leaders also recognized that no changes could be made in the politically sensitive Social Security program unless the two parties called a truce on the issue. A bipartisan commission appointed by President Reagan proposed a package of changes that would increase payroll taxes and gradually raise the retirement age, and the deal breezed through Congress. Compromise on Military Spending This spirit of accommodation continued through the drafting of the annual budget, when House Democrats and Senate Republicans brushed aside Administration proposals and compromised on a plan that increased military spending by 5 percent, half the rise the White House wanted, and allotted $21.5 billion for domestic spending above Mr. Reagan's request. Bipartisan cooperation began to erode, however, when the economy sputtered to life and Republicans started to regain confidence in the President's economic program. Moreover, as the year went on, partisan interests began to diverge sharply. By the end of the session, Senator Simpson was saying that partisanship had reached an ''appalling and stifling level'' in the corridors of the capitol. In essence, the Democrats repeated their charges that the Reagan program was unfair to average American voters and pushed a string of measures through the House to demonstrate the point, including help for homeowners with mortgages and aid for jobless workers who had lost their health benefits. The Republicans were generally gambling that the economy would continue to stay healthy through the election, and that they could sucessfully brand the Democrats ''big spenders.'' Accordingly, all additional Democratic proposals to aid the unemployed were buried in the Senate. In a similar face-off, the House passed legislation to limit the third year of the tax cut that was due to take effect last July. But Mr. Reagan opposed any change in his tax-reduction program, and the Senate killed the measure. The domestic legislative struggle lapsed into a standoff. By the end of the session, Republicans were saying that a major accomplishment was preventing the Democrats from adding to social spending programs. ''Maybe one of the better things we did was not to do very much,'' said one Republican staff aide. Democrats Claim a Reversal And the Democrats were arguing that they had reversed the trend of the previous two years and blocked the Republicans from making further cuts in domestic programs. ''That was the main thing we did this year,'' Mr. O'Neill said. But Congress was able to agree on a number of significant measures toward the end of the year that transcended partisanship. By large margins, the lawmakers approved a bill for a Federal holiday in honor of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and a bill that extended the life of the Civil Rights Commission and shielded it from attempts by the Reagan Administration to undercut its independence. Congress also voted to extend unemployment benefits for 18 months and loosen the criteria to make workers in more states eligible for maximum help. Thanks to some legislative legerdemain by House Democrats, Republicans were forced to accept a housing authorization, the first in almost three years, that created a small program to build rental units for poor tenants. I.M.F. Support and Debt Limit Mr. Reagan had to use his leverage to swing conservative Republicans into line behind an increase of $8.4 billion in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund and an increase in the national debt ceiling to $1.49 billion. This would allow the Treasury to continue borrowing money through April. Congress approved two programs to reward farmers for limiting production. One distributes Government- owned commodities as payment in kind to farmers who curtail surplus crops. Another bill, cleared Friday night, would pay dairy farmers for the first time for reducing their milk production. But the list of unpassed bills was probably even longer in this session. The Senate passed a comprehensive alteration of the immigration laws, but action was blocked in the House by the objections of Hispanic members. The House rejected the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution and the Senate buried a proposal to provide tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools. Foreign Cars and Phone Use The House passed a bill that would require foreign car makers to use more American parts and labor in vehicles sold here, but the Senate took no action and shows little interest in the bill. The Democrats also pushed through the House a bill to bar new fees for phone users, and that bill should receive prompt Senate attention in January. After promises last year to conservative Republicans, the Senate debated a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would overturn Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortions, but it was defeated. Congress did approve a rule that would ban Federal workers from using their health benefits to finance abortions. Among proposals that never came to a floor vote were a package of revisions to make various criminal laws tougher on defendants; revisions of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and deregulation of natural gas, which was pulled from the Senate floor on Friday.

THE LEGACY OF RHODES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/magazine/the-legacy-of-rhodes.html,"-McQuade, a former television correspondent and producer for ABC News and CBS News, is director of programs for the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.   INNING A RHODES scholarship is one of the few things you can do at 22 they will chisel on your tombstone,'' says Lester Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''No matter what else you do in life, that will be remembered.''  He is right. To be named a Rhodes scholar is to be recognized as one of the intellectual elite. Since 1903, more than 2,000 Americans have been so honored and educated at England's ancient and prestigious Oxford University because of the vision and legacy of Cecil John Rhodes. At a recent and rare reunion, Rhodes scholars returned to Oxford to remember shared experience and to take the measure of the legacy and of one another. Reminiscing today about his experience as a Rhodes scholar from 1911 to 1914, 91- year-old Philip W. Whitcomb, a former journalist, says he and his classmates were aware they were ''part of Rhodes's great idea'' that the world should be ''dominated and protected and guided by the British Empire, the United States and Germany.'' When he returned home in 1914, the world was at war, and Rhodes's vision of benevolent domination was shattered. Since then, Mr. Whitcomb asserts, Rhodes scholars have been preoccupied ''each about his own pre-eminence'' rather than with any grand design of the founder. Mr. Whitcomb may be right that, over the years, scholarship recipients have rhodes 1st jump   been increasingly less concerned about how they might fulfill Rhodes's vision and more concerned with how they might use the scholarship to fulfill their own personal objectives. In choosing American candidates like Mr. Whitcomb, the trustees of the will originally assumed that Rhodes would have wanted men who might eventually become President. Sir George Parkin, who translated Rhodes's will into a working system, told a convention of university and college presidents in Chicago that they should select men most likely to become President, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or Ambassador to Britain.  In the 80-year history of the program, no Rhodes scholar has as yet achieved these positions. (Former President Carter, who did achieve political success, vividly recalls his disappointment at not being chosen for a Rhodes.) Many scholars, however, have served at other levels of government, including Byron R. White and John Marshall Harlan, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; Walt Whitman Rostow, national security adviser and Presidential assistant; Stansfield Turner, a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and J. William Fulbright, the Senator who modeled the American international scholarship program after the Rhodes. The largest number of American scholars have pursued careers in law or academia. But the scholars have achieved prominence in all disciplines - the authors Robert Penn Warren and Robert K. Massie, for example, both Pulitizer Prize winners.  This scholarship of scholarships is the legacy of one man with an extraordinary idea and the wealth and perseverance to make it a reality. Rhodes was a 19th-century Englishman who changed forever the face of southern Africa. He was a sickly man who led a vigorous life, a cynical man who was committed to a vision of a more idyllic future.  Rhodes, a clergyman's son who went to South Africa for his health, was always singular in his desire to extend the British Empire and the way of life of his beloved England. He sought ''the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire'' and the ''foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity.'' Before he could make his idea work, however, he would need vast wealth and power.  The source for both was South Africa, where Rhodes was a member of Parliament in Cape Colony and its Prime Minister. He was a shrewd, self-made businessman who merged the giant mining companies of Kimberley and De Beers, an adventurer who trekked throughout southern Africa, opening up for development a region that would later be called Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.  To secure a place for his ideas in the future, Rhodes originally envisioned a secret society, not unlike the Jesuits' Society of Jesus. At 24, he wrote his ideas into his first will. He would write a total of seven wills over a period of 22 years, ultimately committing his fortune of $:3.3 million to educating ''the best men for the world's fight'' at Oxford University, his alma mater.  When Rhodes died in 1902, it was left to his trustees to interpret and develop his idea. Rhodes described the men he wanted as good students but not bookworms; good athletes but not necessarily stars; wellversed in the classics, but able to mold the future; dedicated to public service - and, lest they be distracted from their three years of study, unmarried.  Candidates were to be chosen from the British Dominions, Germany and the United States. The Americans had the largest single block of scholars with two chosen from each state. But the distribution of population made this system unworkable, and it was revised in 1929 by an act of Parliament, which amended the will to allow regional selection of 32 candidates yearly. This is one of a number of examples of how the trustees bent the words of the will to meet practical considerations. As Walter B. Slocombe, a Rhodes scholar and Washington lawyer, put it, the work of the trustees is ''the greatest systematic subversion of the designer's intent wrapped up in good will.''  When Parliament passed a law forbidding sexual discrimination in 1975, the trustees asked it to amend Rhodes's will again to permit women. To date, nearly 80 American women have entered the program.  While women were clearly excluded from the founder's great design from the start, the issue of race was less clear. The will states that ''no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions,'' but Rhodes was understood to be referring only to the British and Dutch ''races.'' Although the first black, an American, went up to Oxford in 1907, participation by blacks in significant numbers has been recent. Whatever paths their lives do take, the American Rhodes scholars traditionally have started their journey together. Until last year, when the Queen Elizabeth 2 was pressed into service in the Falklands War, the 32 scholars have sailed across the Atlantic, using the week- long cruise to become acquainted, an easier task than getting to know Oxford and the English. At Oxford, each scholar must apply and be accepted at one of the more than two dozen colleges within the university. Hamilton Richardson, a New York investment banker and 1958 doubles champion in the United States Championships, was in a tennis tournament in Australia when he heard he had won a scholarship. He sought out an Englishman in the tournament and asked for guidance in choosing a good college. ''I don't know much about it,'' the fellow replied, ''except I do know Trinity College is supposed to have the best food.'' Mr. Richardson went to Trinity. He found the colleges more than a place to eat; they are places to live, play sports, study and develop fierce loyalties.  The university's tutorial system contrasts sharply with the American method of large lectures and frequent examinations. Lectures are available but not required. Instead, a student ''reads'' a subject, meets weekly with a tutor to discuss and defend his essay on a given topic and takes final examinations, called ''schools,'' during a one-week period at the conclusion of two or three years of study. For some American students, this freedom and responsibility to decide when and what to study is a maturing and intellectually satisfying experience. Others are frustrated by the unfamiliar structure and the absence of grades to let them know regularly how they are doing. The physical beauty of Oxford is easy to love. Spires soar above some of the finest surviving medieval architecture. Bountiful gardens border ancient walls. Every college encloses orderly, distinctive quadrangles. There is a changelessness about the place - a charm as well as a challenging reminder of all the men who have studied there over the centuries and gone on to prominence. rhodes 2nd jump  What most Americans have not found so charming are English weather, food, plumbing and heating. When Mr. Whitcomb arrived in 1911, there was no running water. Pitchers of cold water and basins were provided, and water closets were ''down an alley in the back,'' he says. There have been few improvements. Hamilton Richardson, a Southerner, found the damp, cold climate particularly hard to adjust to without central heating. He told his college bursar that he could not survive without a proper heater. He received special permission to get an electrical variety. Permission granted, Mr. Richardson plugged it in, and the lights went out all over Trinity College. Undaunted, he paid a princely sum to rewire his room. Twenty years later, while showing his family around his old college, Mr. Richardson went back to his room and discovered the occupants using the outlet he had installed - and his old heater. When he told them that he had arranged for the warmth they were now enjoying, they looked up in alarm and asked, ''You haven't come to take it away, have you, sir?'' Americans also tend to encounter a lack of warmth in their relationships with the English. Friendships seem easier with their counterparts from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada. Hedley Donovan, former editor in chief of Time magazine, likes the ''civility and graceful difference'' of the English, but ''found it disquieting to talk to someone at a sherry party one evening and have him ignore you the next day.'' Nevertheless, he persevered and has made lasting friends. While Lawrence McQuade, executive vice president of W. R. Grace and my husband, also made enduring friendships, he did so after some vivid lessons in English manners and the art of understatement. On one such occasion, Mr. McQuade, only the fifth American to play rugby for Oxford University, was walking to the showers with a teammate after a game. The fellow said, ''You know, McQuade, the custom here when a player makes an error is to say, 'Bad luck, old chap.' Not 'Gee, what a lousy play!' '' Perhaps the American scholars most alienated from the English during their Oxford experience were those who went up during the Vietnam War. Unlike the World Wars, essentially shared experiences for Americans and the English, Vietnam was a period of deep divisions and violent debate in the United States, confusion and distress in England.  ''A lot of us felt a little strange to jump on a boat and go to idyllic Oxford and escape,'' remembers William J. Clinton, Governor of Arkansas. When he arrived in 1968, he found that ''the emotional conflict because of the war put a cloud over it all. It wasn't bad, but it was always there. As a result, we Americans probably clustered in groups more than was usual before or after.'' Mr. Clinton is an example of what some people believe Rhodes meant when he wrote that a Rhodes scholar should ''esteem the performance of public duties as his highest aim.'' On his return to Arkansas, Mr. Clinton became Attorney General before winning the governorship. The American Rhodes scholars who have served in elected public office have mixed views as to how their experience affected their political careers. Carl B. Albert, former Representative from Oklahoma and Speaker of the House, recalls his first opponent attacking him for having been educated in England. Mr. Albert lost that election. The next time, his supporters successfully used the same fact to prove he was ''competent to do the job,'' he says. John Brademas, former Representative from Indiana and Majority Whip, took a more philosophical view. Mr. Brademas, now president of New York University, says he ''was much the most politicized'' in his class at Oxford in 1950. He feels he is ''probably the kind of person Cecil Rhodes described'' because of his ''zeal for political combat.''  In fact, Mr. Brademas was so intrigued by political figures that he spent most of his ''vacs'' tracking down Spanish anarchists in preparation for his doctoral thesis. (The scholarship cash stipend, now $5,400 a year, provides for travel.) He discovered Manuel Salgado, an anarchist leader during the Spanish Civil War, in a restaurant in London's West End. Mr. Salgado referred him to another anarchist, a tailor in Bordeaux, who, in turn, referred him to another, a barber in Toulouse. Mr. Brademas continued doing his research, seeing Europe and not returning to United States during the entire three years at Oxford. But when he did return home and ran for Congress, Mr. Brademas like Mr. Albert found being a Rhodes scholar ''a minus in northern Indiana.''  ''Some people might not think politics is a public service,'' explains Sir Edgar Williams, warden of the Rhodes scholars for 28 years. However, he says, a man ''makes a positive contribution to public service if he improves his surroundings, if he does something for the common cause without pay.'' By that definition, Sir Edgar believes the scholars ''have done quite well.'' No one knows precisely what Rhodes intended. If the intention was for the Rhodes scholarships to train future Presidents, then it has failed. If the intention was to make very able men reach higher and contribute more to society than they otherwise would have, then it has succeeded. ''These are just ordinary people, no geniuses, but people who are good citizens,'' says George C. McGhee, an American diplomat and a Rhodes scholar, ''and you look at where they ended up. Few are world figures, but most are good substantial people.'' Last spring, the Rhodes scholars each received a simple invitation announcing plans for a reunion in June. Though it was only the third time in 80 years that the scholars would gather, there was no fanfare, no engraved card, no elaborately detailed program, no literature encouraging participation and no solicitation. Nonetheless, 800 scholars, from 14 countries, returned.  It was a nostalgia binge. Most of the returning scholars stayed in rooms at their old colleges. Herman H. Hamilton, an Alabama lawyer, headed first for The Trout, a favorite country pub along the river where American members of his class, who went up in 1950, were gathering for lunch. James H. Billington, director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, showed up with his daughter Susan, who is currently a scholar, making them the first father-daughter combination. Dennis C. Stanfill was there, too, although he is no longer the young Annapolis graduate Mr. Hamilton remembered, but a venture capitalist and former head of 20th Century-Fox. Mr. Stanfill, like singer Kris Kristofferson, who did not attend the reunion, is one of the few scholars to work in the entertainment industry.  This small, informal lunch with American friends was followed by tea with the Queen for all the scholars, and their spouses, in the garden of Rhodes House. Unlike a Rose Garden reception at the White House, there was no visible security, no crush of photographers, no sense of urgency. Rather, there was curiosity, civility, conviviality. Everything was very genteel and very English. Not one of the five Rhodes scholars who are currently serving in the United States Senate was present. ''At the moment of the Queen's garden party, I was sipping instant coffee and presiding over the Senate,'' says Senator Larry L. Pressler of South Dakota. He and the other Senators - David L. Boren of Oklahoma, William W. Bradley of New Jersey, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland - had stayed behind to vote on abortion and the budget. ''Cecil Rhodes would have wanted us to stay here,'' Senator Pressler says. Some returning scholars visited college libraries like Oriel's, where treasures ranging from Cardinal Wolsey's hat to the original manuscript of Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'' were on display. Some went punting on the river, remembering, perhaps, romantic interludes of earlier years. Others visited Blackwell's to browse, and perhaps buy a book from the bookseller of Oxford who may be as appreciated for extending credit to needy students as for his extensive inventory.  The highlight of the reunion for many was the remarkable performance of Harold Macmillan, a former Prime Minister of Britain and chancellor of Oxford University for 23 years. Almost blind, he stood with stooped frame and spoke with a voice amazingly strong for his 89 years. Mr. Macmillan noted he had come up to Oxford himself 71 years ago and had witnessed almost the entire history of the Rhodes scholarships in his lifetime. He paid extraordinary tribute to the founder, noting that ''from the monks in the Abbeys of 1112, we have moved from the Age of Faith to the Age of Credulity. In that period, the most imaginative concept or grand design was that of Cecil Rhodes.''  The favorable reaction to Mr. Macmillan's words contrasted with the response of many to the remarks of J. Ogilvie Thompson, a South African invited to speak on behalf of the scholars. An official of De Beers, the mining company of which Cecil Rhodes was a director during his life and which supplied the bulk of the wealth for his legacy, Mr. Thompson gave what many felt might have been the annual report of the company, coupled with an apologia for the current political situation in his country. For some, it was a moment of discomfort that would be exacerbated the following day.  The Sheldonian, a theater- in-the-round commissioned in the 17th century by Archbishop Sheldon and built by Christopher Wren, was the scene of a gathering to discuss ''The Rhodes Sholarships: Past, Present and Future.'' After the formal presentations, H. J. Bremer Hofmeyr of South Africa, now working with Moral Rearmament, took the floor and made a quiet but firm plea. ''We owe, to some extent, our Rhodes scholarships to the labor of blacks, and we owe them 'a dit,' '' he said. ''I doubt Rhodes had any idea that the situation would be what it is'' in South Africa today. Mr. Hofmeyr proposed that the scholars do ''something enduring which would benefit the less privileged people of the country where Rhodes's fortune was amassed.''  Speaking after Mr. Hofmeyr, George R. Keyes, a Washington lawyer, recommended that the trust be used to improve educational possibilities for young blacks in South Africa so they might be better able to compete for a scholarship. Mr. Keyes, who is black, feels the Rhodes trustees have long dodged the issue. ''A line has to be drawn or a decision made to make an alteration in the will,'' he told the gathering. ''We are the living legacy, and we define this legacy.'' Many applauded. But Michael Smuts, a descendant of former South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, asked that the group be understanding and patience with people who ''are doing our best.''  There was support for both points of view. Like the seven wills and the legacy itself, the solution to the South African question will have to evolve through the trustees, who have tried to adhere to the will yet be relevant to the times.  One of the remarkable discoveries that emerged from interviews with numerous Rhodes scholars here and at the reunion was the absence of cynicism or disappointment about the program. Some scholars expressed some complaints: The tutorial system is not as good for the sciences as it is for the humanities; there ought to be more scholars from a larger cross section of the South African population; the bulk of the Rhodes trust is still based on the fortunes of South Africa. But most scholars feel the Oxford experience has proved to be one of the extraordinary opportunities of their lives and often the critical factor in determining a course thereafter. The letter and the rhetoric of the Rhodes will have been abridged with time, but the idea of making good men better by educating them well and by setting high standards of excellence and public service has survived. According to John Brademas, the legacy is ''the best use to which diamonds have ever been put.'' Perhaps Rhodes knew that when he told a Capetown audience almost a century ago, ''I have found out one thing and that is, if you have an idea, and it is a good idea, if you only stick to it you will come out all right.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hyde Sees Rights Measure's Defeat as an '84 Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/us/hyde-sees-rights-measure-s-defeat-as-an-84-issue.html,"Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, one of 109 House Republicans who helped defeat the proposed Federal tuition last week, charged today that Democrats sacrificed the measure to gain a campaign issue for 1984. ""They were willing to burden the E.R.A. with this defeat to get a political issue,"" Representative Hyde said. ""They knew it wasn't going to pass."" An E.R.A. supporter, Representative Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, appearing with Mr. Hyde on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation,"" rejected the view that election strategy was all that was on the minds of Democratic leaders when they brought the proposal to a vote last week before Congress adjourned for the year. ""Ronald Reagan gives us a campaign issue every day,"" she said. ""It's not only the E.R.A."" But she said women's groups would use the voting record to defeat Congressional opponents of the measure. 147 Voted Against Proposal Supporters and opponents are scrambling to make the most of the House vote, in which the proposed amendment failed by six votes to gain the two-thirds majority needed for passage. Voting against passage were 109 Republicans and 38 Democrats. The House leadership brought up the amendment under hotly criticized rules prohibiting any amendments and allowing only 40 minutes of debate. Phyllis Schlafly, also appearing on the program, said the vote shows the amendment will never pass unless it is changed to neutralize its effects on abortion, military duty for women and private schools. Judy Goldsmith, president of the National Organization for Women, argued that the measure would help women who need to work to support their families. 'Fundamental Economic Issue' Mrs. Goldsmith said ""the support is still there"" for passage and ratification by 38 states. She also insisted the proposal is a ""fundamental economic issue"" and accused opponents such as Mrs. Schlafly of clouding the debate with social issues, like abortion. Mrs. Schlafly, however, disputed the power of the ""women's rights movement"" to push through a new equal rights amendment with the same wording as the measure that died in 1982, three states short of the 38 needed for ratification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A FAMILY: STORIES OF 7 BLACK WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/us/a-family-stories-of-7-black-women.html,"When Angela Jones was born in the 1950's, the vast majority of black children were raised, as she was, in two-parent families. She is 31 years old now and divorced, the mother of a 3-year-old girl she is rearing in the Bronx under two difficult conditions: without a father and in poverty. Mrs. Jones, whose sweet expression hints of a gentler Virginia childhood, is part of a profound tide of change that has swept black America since she was a child. Last year, 47 percent of all black households with children were composed, like hers, of a woman and her children, a rise from 21 percent in 1960 and only 8 percent in 1960. Among blacks, the absence of a father at home has virtually become the norm. Among whites, only 15 percent of families with children were headed by women last year. Black leaders and social scientists now agree that the tide threatens to undo the black economic gains of decades. Already more than half the black babies born each year have unmarried mothers. Statistics show that these children are much more likely than others to spend their lives in poverty. Interviews with three dozen black women heading households across the country shed some light on the causes and effects of the breakdown in black families. Each woman's story was different, but clear patterns emerged. The most common thread, one that ran through the lives of most of the women, was the inability of the fathers of their children to hold steady jobs. Many also spoke of disregard or ignorance of contraception and aversion to abortion, of having been reared themselves by single mothers or by parents who did not get along, of family ties weakened by the mass migration of rural blacks to the cities, of marital tension aggravated by economic hardship, of broken dreams and lingering ambitions and, most of all, of the desire to provide their children with a life better than their own. The stories of these seven women are representative: Angela Jones 'The way men are these days,' Angela Jones said, 'too many people give their daughters toy stoves and doll-babies. I'm going to give mine a typewriter and a computer.' Mrs. Jones and her 3-year-old daughter, Mica, live in a city-owned building in the South Bronx. They have lived on welfare for the past two years, since Mrs. Jones and her husband broke up. She has brightened Mica's bedroom with shelf after shelf of children's books and a collection of hand-me-down dollhouses, restored to usefulness. 'It's important to take care of a child's personal needs, tend to her confidence,' Mrs. Jones said. 'That's the problem with so many black children: Their parents don't motivate them, tell them that even if they fail, to just get up and try again.' 'Hung Up on Discrimination' Mrs. Jones and her husband spent their childhoods in Newport News, Va., where her father was a shipyard worker and her mother reared three daughters. After her parents were divorced, she said, her father remained close to them. She and her husband-to-be came to New York, were married at City Hall and began living with his relatives. He did construction work, but mostly, she said, they lived off his unemployment payments. 'He'd say, 'It's just rough out there,'' Mrs. Jones said. 'Too many poor black men are hung up on discrimination and prejudice. They should take jobs mopping floors, whatever, and show them that Father's trying, he's working. That he may not put the best food on the table, but it's a balanced meal.' Surveying the streets of her neighborhood, girls with baby strollers, young men in a hurry, others not going anyplace, Mrs. Jones maintained: 'Most people on public assistance, the boyfriend gets his cut, no ifs and ands. One thing my father always taught us, no man lives with us, that's making him weak. The thing to do with a man is to strengthen him, give him confidence in himself.' Vera Yarborough A few weeks earlier Vera Yarborough had noticed that her husband was acting strangely. He would come home from his job, working with computers at a major corporation, and he would not eat. But he said nothing was wrong. She said she was totally unprepared, then, when one night he simply told her he was leaving her and the children after 13 years of marriage. It was 1979 and she was five months pregnant with their third child. He quit his job at the company about a month later. He was unemployed for a year, Mrs. Yarborough said, worked at 'three or four little jobs' and only began working steadily again this year. His new job is with the Postal Service. Children Do Not Behave Mrs. Yarborough, who has worked at the same job as a clerk in a Watts pharmacy for 17 years, now makes stops at three schools to drop off her children before she goes to work. She said the girls, Raquel, 14, Nyree, 7, and Autumn, 3, are faring well emotionally after their father's departure, except that they do not behave very well. 'A father has kind of a dominating image,' she said. 'I think kids need two parents.' The four of them now live on her take-home pay of $880 a month, half of which goes to cover the mortgage payment on their tidy house in the city of Compton. Mrs. Yarborough said the worst period was right after Autumn was born, when they were forced to live on disability payments, which were half her salary. 'Black men, if things don't happen right financially and they don't have what they think they should, things just fall apart,' she said. 'There was no way I was going to lose my mind. I tell people I did all right because of the kids. You kind of hold yourself together because of the kids.' Zelia Irving Zelia Irving's life was put back on track by the cook's job she was able to get at the day-care center in Watts where her sons, now teen-agers, were once enrolled. A Brazilian by birth, she was recruited to Philadelphia on contract as a maid, she said. After her contract was over, she migrated to Los Angeles. The man she married there worked as a maintenance man at a supermarket, a job he had held for years. He made very little money, Mrs. Irving said, 'but he didn't want me to work - he was jealous.' They had two sons, Charles, now 15, and Alexander, 14, and as the boys grew their father began to drink more and more heavily. 'One night he stayed there at the market,' Mrs. Irving said. 'He was supposed to open the doors in the morning but he was too drunk. When they found him they fired him. He's been working there 18 years and they fired him after just one time.' Lacking any means of support, Mrs. Irving said she wanted to apply for welfare, but she said her husband 'was too proud.' She eventually applied for aid without him. 'I didn't want my children to go without,' she said. 'The social worker came the same day and saw we were really in need. The same day she told us to come and pick up a check.' Unable to get her husband to go with her to a marriage counselor, Mrs. Irving decided to leave him. Her husband moved in with his mother. Nobody, she said, 'was ever able to talk sense to him.' 'When I take my boys to their grandmother's house, he never wants to see them,' Mrs. Irving said. 'I'm thinking he's ashamed.' Peggy and Earline Corsby Tashienda, at the age of 3, has about her the air of a much-loved child, something about the toss of her head and the fastidious way she adjusts the grown-up's belt she added as her own personal touch to the outfit her mother had so carefully matched. Her mother, Peggy Crosby, has lived virtually all her 25 years in the Jordan Downs housing project in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. The project, like most public housing in California, is a lowrise affair. Peggy's mother, Earline Crosby, 51, raised all her six children there, without help from any of their fathers. Peggy drives a school bus and believes she earns an adequate living for herself and her child. But she says she wishes Tashienda's father, another young school-bus driver who entered her life when she spotted him on the project's basketball courts, 'would come around more, because I was raised without my father and I didn't want her to be raised without hers.' When Peggy Crosby thinks of a family, she thinks of 'a mother, father, two kids, picnicking, camping, traveling. There's a lot of good things I think of.' No Contraception or Abortion But she said that the notion of marrying Tashienda's father 'didn't come up at the time - if we had planned to have a child, it might have come up later.' She knew little about birth control, she said, and she did not seek an abortion because her mother objected to it as being against church teachings. Peggy graduated from high school in 1976, four years before Tashienda was born. The birth caused little, if any, disruption in her youthful life. The future was something Peggy had a hazy notion of, having once played with and then put away ideas of becoming a model or a secretary.'I don't think she changed anything, because I wasn't really off into doing much of anything, anyway,' she said. Earline Crosby has heard her daughter struggle with the future. Without prompting, she explained: 'My children are just like me. We just haven't had too much experience in doing anything.' 20 Years of Welfare She is on welfare and has been, off and on, for more than 20 years, ever since shortly after she moved to Los Angeles from Jackson, Miss. Earline Crosby, speaking gently and patiently, said she regretted not being able to teach her children more about life, about what to aspire to and how to reach it. No one had taught her. She recounted how she and a brother were raised 'hand to mouth' 40 and more years ago in Mississippi after their aunt died. Her own mother had traveled from state to state looking for work before she became a seamstress in Los Angeles. 'Something was happening in the South,' she said. 'Something was happening to jobs, and people wasn't working in the fields too much. I wasn't too much aware of what was going on, but I knew something was happening with the jobs; there wasn't too much work.' She was part of the displacement of millions of black people from Southern farms and a traditional rural way of life, replaced by the invention of mechanical harvesters. From 1940 to 1965, three million people shifted from farm labor into cities and industries, most of them without suitable skills or preparation. No Chance to Be a Pianist Earline Crosby said she remembered it as a time when large numbers of blacks women, not men, were leaving the South, bound for Northern cities on bus tickets sent by whites seeking domestic workers. She said she left Mississippi in 1956 to work as a maid for three months in New York and later for six months in Chicago, returning south out of homesickness in between, before she finally moved in December 1960 to California. Earline Crosby said she bore six children because nobody taught her about birth control. She worked two years in hotels as a maid and doing piecework in dry cleaners, but she was absent from work so much because of her children that finally her last employer advised her to stop and go on public assistance. The absence of parents 'and a fair education' determined for the worse the course of her life, she said. 'I feel like I missed out on a lot of things I could have been. I remember things I'd like to be: a nurse, or a pianist, or an interior decorator. And here I end up being nothing. I never intended to be just nothing. I just didn't make it.' Marian Johnson Marian Johnson thought she was leaving her biggest troubles behind four years ago when she took her five daughters and ran away from her husband. But she said he keeps finding her, threatening her and disappearing. 'Do I have a neon sign on my head that blinks 'trouble' or 'stupid'? 'she asked, packing up her Milwaukee apartment to move one more time, because of problems with her landlord. Her share of trouble included a pregnancy and a miscarriage as a high school senior and dropping out of school. At 19 she became pregnant with her oldest daughter. Two weeks before she was to marry the father, he was killed, and she found out he had been dealing in drugs. Last summer, she was raped at knifepoint. The police never found the man. But the most consistent source of problems has been her marriage. Mrs.Johnson met her husband after her oldest daughter, Kameshia, was born. He was a teacher at a vocational center, earnings $700 a month, and she was earning $550 a month in an office. Over several years they had two children. He married her when she was 26, and shortly after that things changed. Mrs. Johnson said he started abusing her. 'He seemed jealous I was out working and not at home,' she said. They had two more children. Later, he started abusing the children, in a cycle of violent threats and beatings that was to send Mrs. Johnson fleeing to a shelter for battered women. At one point, she said, he quit his job so he could watch her and keep her from running away with the children. She called it 'imprisonment.' She and the children have been surviving on public assistance, $745 a month for the six of them. With the youngest child now 5 years old, Mrs. Johnson has been going on interviews again for a secretarial job. 'Women are finding out they don't have to put up with that stuff,' she said of her marital problems. 'Women are stepping out and taking care of themselves and learning they don't have to depend on a spouse or having a man around the house.' Denise Washington Denise Washington had everything going for her as a girl growing up in a modest black neighborhood in Los Angeles. She was a joiner, a doer: a Bluebird and Campfire Girl, a fraternal lodge princess, a queen in a contest promoted by a gospel singing star, a debutante in the local cotillion. She was studying at a community college, working at a part-timed job and had signed a deal for a new car when, at 19, she became pregnant. 'I thought I fell in love,' said Mrs. Washington, now 23, as her 2-year-old daughter, Shameka, clambered toward her lap. 'I was tired of going to school. It probably all hit me at the same time.' Mrs. Washington one of the youngest of 12 brothers and sisters, was reared from infancy by her sister and brother-in-law, Leatrice and John Scribner, to whom she refers as her mother and father. The Scribners come from a Southern tradition of close family involvement. When Denise's future husband started seeing her frequently, they said, they invited him 'for a family interrogation.' She Married Despite Family 'We didn't like him,' Mrs. Scribner said. 'She wasn't 18 yet and he wanted her to take care of him.' Mrs. Washington said she was not using contraception when she got pregnant the first time. 'My mother had brought me up that you didn't have sex until you got married, so I didn't know much about it,' she said, adding the she declined to use birth control pills because 'most of people I knew who were taking them were having problems with them.' Despite the Scribner's objections, Mrs. Washington married after the birth of her first child, John, now 4, and she and her husband got a place of their own. Mrs. Washington was working full time for the telephone company, things were going fine, and they moved into a larger apartment. A month later, her husband was laid off. That, she said, was the beginning of a string of conflicts over money that led to the end of their marriage. Her husband had gotten in trouble with alcohol before they married and had a record of drunken-driving offenses. While they were struggling to find a stable financial footing, he was in and out of jail for drunken driving. Finally, fed up, she packed up the children and went home to the Scribners. 'He didn't want to do to anything,' she said, summing up the reasons for the split. He Sought Work and Schooling They were together for two years. Troubled as that period was, however, Mrs. Washington said her husband was not a man who refused to try. She said he worked for a while with his father doing maintenance work at a supermarket and was laid off. He went to a trade school program in automobile mechanics, but it took him two months after it ended to find work. He talked of wanting to go to school to be adraftsman, but about that time Mrs. Washington, with a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old infant, went back home. Still, he completed his high school education, she said, after their second child was born. In contrast, Mrs. Washington said it has never taken her more than two weeks to land a good job. At the phone company, where she sees a bright future for herself, she now earns almost $400 a week as a report clerk. 'There were a lot of things I wanted, but by my husband not being able to be a good provider, we couldn't afford it,' she said. 'That was the biggest conflict. I don't think we would have had any serious problems if that had been okay.' Adrene King As a child growing up in Brooklyn, the daughter of an apartment superintendent and his wife in the affluent Midwood section, 34-year-old Adrene King said, the impression she acquired of marriage from her own family and the families around her was that it was an unhappy situation in which to be. So when she found out she was pregnant, although it was unplanned, 'I had made a conscious decision that I would probably have a child outside of marriage, because my parents' marriage was so unhappy.' She said she did not consider abortion. 'Once I was pregnant,' she said, 'I felt it was something I wanted to experience.' It was a decision that appears to have worked not only for Miss King but also for her 17-year-old son, Maurice, and 11-year-old daughter. Ashaki, who are doing well at a private high school and a good public intermediated school on Manhattan's West Side. 'My mom's the best single parent in New York,' says Maurice proudly. Miss King is now a well-paid account executive at a large communication company. She got there after starting out on welfare and effectively using her own hard work and the social programs that were products of the 1960's. Low-Paying Jobs at First After the birth of her son, Miss King said she did not want to raise him in her parents' home, so she applied for welfare. After proving that her parents could not afford to support her and a child, she was awarded public assistance and moved into an apartment with another single mother. When the baby was a year old she went back to work. but the low-paid clerical jobs she was able to get with a high school education, she said, 'raised my career consciousness.' While she was working a full-time job making $6,000 a year at the New York City Health Department, she enrolled in college, also on a full-time basis. Through an arrangement made possibly by her union, she enrolled in a night sutdy program specially designed for working adults at the College of New Rochelle. Under the program, she paid only half the usual fees, and she financed the rest through education loans. She paid for two babysitters a day. 'I worked 9 to 5, went to class 6 to 9, got home at 10, studied until 12, and back up to go to work,' Miss King said. 'Saturdays I'd take the children to the library; Sunday it was the cleaning and the laundry.' In four years, she had a bachelor's degree in business. In that time she had a serious relationship with Ashaki's father. After three years they decided to end it because his commitment to pursuing a career in show business did not afford the kind of economic stability they felt the children needed, Miss King said. He has remained an active part of the children's life. Miss King said she did not rule out marrying someday and would like to have 'one of those high-powered, two-career families.' But, she added: 'There are so many obstacles put out there for black men. An assertive black male is very threatening, and to survive in the corporate situation you have to be assertive, no doubt about that.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONSERVATIVE STUDY GIVES REAGAN A MIXED RATING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/25/us/conservative-study-gives-reagan-a-mixed-rating.html,"As President Reagan approaches the end of his third year in office, many conservatives remain divided over his record. To some, he has sounded an uncertain trumpet, missed golden opportunities, compromised too often and drifted from his conservative moorings. To others, he has changed the direction of Government in a way that Democrats will be hard-pressed to reverse. To still others, he has had a mixed bag of successes and failures. Such are the findings of the Heritage Foundation, a Washington policy group that has been both an occasional critic of and an intellectual resource for the Reagan Administration. In an effort to explore the depth of conservative discontent as well as satisfaction with the President, it recently asked a number of prominent conservative activists, intellectuals, politicians and writers to rate how he was doing. The foundation, which periodically runs such surveys, plans to publish its findings shortly. But foundation sources have provided a preview of what is to come. What they were unable to provide was what effect, if any, the division in conservative ranks might have on Mr. Reagan's re-election chances. For a number of the doubters, provided the dissatisfaction is not too deep, Mr. Reagan could still be the only acceptable candidate. Not Enough 'Reaganauts' There was general agreement among the respondents that Mr. Reagan deserved credit for cutting taxes, increasing military spending and sticking to his positions on social issues. On the other hand, some of the respondents criticized the President for not asking for more domestic spending cuts, for allowing Democrats to regain control of the political agenda after his first year, for ignoring military waste and for not infusing his Administration with more conservative hard-liners. Richard V. Allen, the President's former national security adviser, wrote that, on the basis of his White House experience, ''The first year of the Reagan Administration set a new tone in U.S. foreign policy, correcting a sense of drift and bringing a clear halt to the notion of American slippage.'' Mr. Allen's main criticism was that Mr. Reagan did not bring enough ''Reaganauts'' to power. ''In the first six months of the Administration,'' said Mr. Allen, ''the President should have spent an hour each day assessing the qualifications of personnel down to the level of deputy assistant secretary.'' Senator William L. Armstrong, Republican of Colorado, said that if the Administration went down in history as mediocre, ''it will be because the President was not bold enough at the outset.'' Contending that Mr. Reagan could have got about anything he wanted from Congress in his first six months in office, he complained that the President instead managed to polarize the country over budget cuts. ''He cut the budget enough to make special interest groups and the press mad,'' the Senator wrote, ''but not enough to solve the problem.'' 'I Expected More' John T. Dolan, chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, contended that the tax cut would be the only real historic achievement of Mr. Reagan's Presidency. ''I expected more to happen,'' said this disappointed conservative activist. ''There has been no major defense buildup beyond what Carter would have done. There has been no spending cut. There has been no turnover of control to the states. There has been no effort to dismantle the Washing bureaucratic elitist establishment.'' M. Stanton Evans, a newspaper columnist, is no less disappointed. ''This has been essentially another Ford Administration,'' he said in his critique. ''It has been business as usual, not much different from any other Republican administration of our lifetime. It has been an Administration populated by corporate executive types.'' Everyone knows, he added, that ''people used to the decorum of the boardroom back off from controversy.'' Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, saw Mr. Reagan as ''the only coherent revolutionary in an Administration of accommodationist advisers.'' His chief criticism: ''The Administration has had no capacity to launch strategic offenses on behalf of Reagan's vision.'' After Mr. Reagan won his tax and budget cuts in the spring of 1981, Mr. Gingrich added, someone in the White House should have been asking, ''What do we do to keep up momentum?'' Instead, he said, Mr. Reagan returned from California in August to a ''vacuum of activity'' and a new political agenda that had been set by Democrats. ''Political debate was once again totally enmeshed in the rhetoric and values of the liberal welfare state,'' Mr. Gingrich said. Waste in Spending Cited Howard Phillips, national director of the Conservative Caucus and one of Mr. Reagan's earliest and sharpest critics, asserted: ''Reagan is just the sort of nice fellow I'd like to have as a neighbor, but he defers too quickly to anyone in a three-piece suit.'' Richard Rahn, vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, differed with those who contend that Mr. Reagan's agenda has been too modest. ''Reagan may have been too successful too fast,'' said Mr. Rahn, an economist. ''He was elected before there were enough people ideologically committed to his program who also had the necessary technical skills to run the Government.'' He said there was a widespread belief in the business community that there was ''tremendous'' waste in military spending, adding that ''a public war'' on Pentagon fat would have provided Mr. Reagan with the psychological advantage for building support for spending cuts across the board. Cal Thomas, vice president of communications for Moral Majority, credited the President for transforming public thinking on Government spending, but faulted him for his leadership on the abortion issue. ''If we balance the budget and we still keep murdering a million and a half babies every year, there's no way we can say we're better off than we were four years ago,'' said Mr. Thomas. Paul M. Weyrich, executive director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, said Mr. Reagan's eagerness to avoid political confrontations with Congress robbed him of victories that he might have had. Sadly, Mr. Weyrich wrote, ''The radical surgery that was required in Washington was not performed. Ronald Reagan made a pledge not to touch entitlement programs, and that's one of the few pledges he has kept absolutely.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IOWA DEMOCRATS SY ONLY MONDALE'S MARGIN OF VICTORY IN DOUBT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/25/us/iowa-democrats-sy-only-mondale-s-margin-of-victory-in-doubt.html,"Leading Iowa Democrats say they are taking it for granted that Walter F. Mondale is well ahead in the nation's first battle for Presidential nominating delegates. The critical question, they say, is whether Mr. Mondale's winning margin in the Iowa Democratic caucuses next February will be modest or impressive. ''I think he's got to have 50 percent of the vote,'' said Lieut. Gov. Robert Anderson, who heads the Iowa campaign for Senator John Glenn of Ohio. ''If he comes out with 35 percent, he's lost. After all, this is Mondale territory. He grew up next door in Minnesota, just a few miles across the state line. He's been coming to Iowa for years.'' ''He's got a tremendous edge,'' said John Law, Iowa campaign coordinator for Senator Alan Cranston of California. ''You have to give him 20 points for home court advantage. Plus, he's got endorsements from the organizational people - the state labor federation, the Iowa teachers, traditional party activists, a majority of state legislators. Right now, he's probably got 60 percent of the Democrats who have made up their minds.'' Fear of Too Great Expectations Privately, members of the Mondale camp said they would welcome fashioning a steamroller image in Iowa, but they are fearful of being set up by exaggerated expectations. In 1972, for example, Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, then the front-runner, came in first in Iowa, but narrowly. Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota, a candidate once again this year, scored a psychological victory by finishing a surprisingly close second. ''There's no question Mondale's out front, said Ed Campbell, the former state party chairman who is co-chairman of the Mondale campaign. ''How much is not clear. He could take half the vote. I hope he'll be in the 40 percent range.'' A survey done by The Des Moines Register in early October showed Mr. Mondale preferred by 46 percent of Iowa Democrats; Senator Glenn by 27 percent; Mr. McGovern, 8 percent; Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, 4 percent; Senator Cranston and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 2 percent each; former Gov. Reuben Askew of Florida, 1 percent, and Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, less than 1 percent. Feeling pressure from Mr. Mondale, the others have stepped up their campaign efforts here in the past six weeks. Senator Glenn, sensing the need for at least a strong second-place showing here, has committed more time and energy to Iowa and reinforced a weak campaign organization with more staff and an experienced coordinator, Jerry Vento, who worked here in 1976 and 1980 for Jimmy Carter. Democratic leaders expect from 90,000 to 120,000 Democrats to turn out for the approximately 2,500 precinct caucuses Feb. 20. The balloting at the precinct caucuses will select delegates to the party's county conventions. The county conventions will then select delegates to the Congressional district and state conventions, which in turn will select Iowa's 58 delegates to the national party convention in San Francisco. Candidates Step Up Efforts On Nov. 12, Senator Cranston opened a one-month, $80,000 television and radio campaign to increase his visibility. Last Sunday, his campaign underscored his support of a freeze on nuclear weapons with two dozen group viewings of the television movie, ''The Day After.'' Senator Hart recently revived what was widely seen as a moribund campaign effort with his third set of organizers, with an ambitious door-to-door canvassing effort that contacted about 12,000 households, and with more appearances in the state and more vigorous stumping in rural areas. Mr. McGovern, who stirred excitement with his plain-spoken 10-point program at the party's Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner here on Oct. 8, has set up a headquarters, recruited Judy Wilson, the Democratic chairman of Polk County, and begun a push on Iowa campuses. Mr. Askew has quietly put together a 140-member state steering committee, gathering what his aides say are several thousand supporters in the business community and among anti-abortion Democrats frustrated that other contenders do not oppose abortion. ''Askew may surprise some people,'' said Tom Tully, a former Mayor of Dubuque, a strongly Catholic city, who is a backer of Senator Glenn. ''With his stand on abortion, he is attracting Catholic Democrats. He's a greater threat to Glenn than either Cranston or Mondale.'' Glenn's Task Is Defined For Senator Glenn, the test in Iowa is to persuade the public and politicians across the country that he is in a tight two-man race with Mr. Mondale. ''He's got to be within 10 percentage points of Mondale here in Iowa,'' said Lieutenant Governor Anderson, his chairman. The immediate task of the Glenn organization, his supporters and rivals agree, is to convert the large crowds and curiosity the former astronaut generates with his personal appearances into dedicated supporters who will brave the Iowa winter and the intricacies of party politics next Feb. 20.''He's For Senator Cranston and the others, the primary task is to break out of a pack of ''also-rans'' to compete with Mr. Mondale and Senator Glenn. They are all hampered by the hesitancy of pragmatic Democrats who do not see them as strong enough competitors to the two front-runners. The Cranston camp is banking heavily on using the strong organizing capabilities of Mr. Law and Karen Kapler, former state party officials, to turn the peace issue and concern about nuclear war into a rallying point. 'Cranston Lost His Monopoly' Senator Cranston initally took the lead among Iowa peace groups, but now others, like Mr. McGovern, Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale, are reported getting support from those groups, too. ''Cranston lost his monopoly on that issue'' at a Peace Forum last August, according to Peter B. Slone, Mr. Mondale's Iowa manager, because several other candidates endorsed a nuclear freeze. These shifting currents underscore the potential fluidity of support among Iowans who are, in Mr. Campbell's words, ''still stand-offish at this stage.'' Other Democrats in all camps comment that no one, not even Mr. Mondale, has ''taken fire yet'' or ''lit a spark'' among Iowa Democrats. ''There's a lot of purposeful organization work but no magic,'' said David Schoenbaum, a University of Iowa professor and follower of the caucus process. ''At this stage of the game, everybody's support is soft,'' said Jim Riordan, a former candidate for agriculture commissioner who is uncommitted in the Presidential race. ''People say now they're for Mondale, but when they go to the caucus they may not go that way. There's not that spark that has solidified support.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JACKSON HONES HIS POSITION ON ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/26/us/jackson-hones-his-position-on-issues.html,"In nearly 16 years as a civil rights leader, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has amassed a voluminous record of positions on traditional civil rights concerns, ranging from busing for school integration to affirmative action. He has also touched on issues such as economic development, education philosophy and financing of domestic programs, and even some foreign policy issues. But Mr. Jackson's entry into the race for the Democratic nomination for President has required both a refining of his past positions and a broadening of the range of issues with which he must deal. Coordinating the Jackson campaign's issues and research effort is Robert Bates, an oil company executive who is a former executive assistant to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. When Mr. Jackson is in his Washington campaign headquarters Mr. Bates, with the help of experts in a number of areas, has been conducting a series of early morning seminars. The immediate goal, Mr. Bates said, is to come up with detailed public position papers or internal briefing papers that will establish in writing the facts and figures behind particular positions. 'Gut Reactions' Defined In these seminars, Mr. Bates said, Mr. Jackson's ''gut reactions'' to many issues are predictable, given his background in the civil rights movement and as a Baptist minister. As an example he cited the candidate's belief that while more Federal financing for public education was necessary to provide greater educational opportunity as well as instruction aimed at available jobs, money alone could not instill the sense of ''responsibility and accountability'' in students, teachers and parents that is also required to improve public education. In the past Mr. Jackson has coupled his views on education with condemnations of teachers' unions and school administrators, whose drive for job security and higher wages appeared to him to conflict with their job of educating children. Mr. Jackson does not have well-defined positions on a number of domestic and foreign policy issues. But Mr. Bates said that over the next few months detailed positions would be taken on such matters as fiscal policy aimed at eliminating the Federal budget deficit, health care, the economy and welfare reform, capital punishment and criminal justice, social policy and job training, nuclear disarmament, foreign policy and trade, broadening business development opportunities through urban revitalization programs, agriculture and immigration. Missing as well from the list of the candidate's public pronouncements are detailed views on such things as the environment and energy issues. Focus on Voting Rights Act Perhaps the most developed position of the campaign so far is Mr. Jackson's criticism of what he says is the Federal Government's failure to enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its prohibition against racially discriminatory election laws. His position, he has said, evolved over the months he traveled around the country attempting to spur greater voter registration among blacks. He concluded that it was not simply apathy that kept many blacks from registering but the continued existence of barriers to participation in the process. Enforcement efforts have failed to focus aggressively on the ''new forms of denial,'' he has said, which take the form of dual registration schemes, runoff primaries, at-large voting in municipal elections, gerrymandering and annexation schemes. These practices, he said, have cropped up to replace the illegal poll taxes and literacy tests of the past. All are results of local legislative actions that he said had the effect of diluting the voting strength of blacks and other minorities. Equal Rights Amendment Mr. Jackson has said he supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, and last week he criticized the House for not giving it the necessary two-thirds support needed to send it to the states for ratification. He has viewed it as ''essentially an economic rights amendment'' of particular importance to black and Hispanic women, who, he said, on average earn 47 cents for every dollar earned by men. In speeches he frequently says that assuring enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in the South will lead to the enfranchisement of large numbers of black women who are the sole support of their families. Because many of these families live in poverty, he says, they would support measures that insure women equal pay for their work. Chides Women's Movement Mr. Jackson rarely mentions the proposed amendment and the women's movement without connecting it with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and emphasizing the economic impact of the amendment. As early as 1977, in a newspaper column, he wrote that racism and not sexism was the more serious problem in the nation and criticized the women's movement, saying it was led by a narrow constituency of ''upper middle class white females.'' He also chided black women for their involvement in the women's movement, which, he said, talked mainly to the problems of white, middle-class women and sought to compete for their loyalty with the civil rights movement. Supports 'Verifiable Freeze' On nuclear disarmament, Mr. Jackson has said he supports ''a bilateral, verifiable arms freeze'' as well as what he terms an ''adequate defense.'' He has opposed the deployment of United States missiles in Europe and castigated the Reagan Administration for pursuing this policy while showing, he said, no real commitment to ongoing arms limitation talks in Geneva. The issue of abortion has been a troublesome one for Mr. Jackson, whose personal opposition to it has often been viewed as support for anti-abortion legislation. He said recently that while he would not advise a woman to seek an abortion, he would oppose any Government attempt to limit the legal right to an abortion or cut off Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women. But Mr. Jackson's comments always include an emphasis on taking responsibility for and living with the consequences of choosing abortion. In a 1977 newspaper article deploring phonograph records, movies and television shows that he said encouraged irresponsible attitudes about sex among teen-agers, Mr. Jackson criticized the ''enlightened proponents of abortion'' for focusing on the ''consequences of decadence and not on causes.'' Mr. Jackson has supported a strong Government stand in favor of affirmative action programs, maintaining that such efforts, along with goals and quotas when appropriate, were necessary to ''eradicate 200 years of overwhelming institutionalized discrimination'' against blacks and other minority groups. Urges Anti-Apartheid Sanctions In the area of foreign policy, Mr. Jackson has stressed the need to pressure South Africa to end its segregationist apartheid policy. He favors the use of trade sanctions such as those employed against Poland because of that Government's suppression of the Solidarity movement. He said the United States decision to make South Africa a favored trading partner undermines the nation's ''moral authority'' as a defender of human rights. Mr. Jackson has long supported the creation of a Palestinian state in the Middle East, while also supporting Israel's right to exist with ''secure borders.'' He has called on the United States to initiate talks between Israel and other Arab countries along the lines of the Carter Administration's Camp David talks. He has said he believes that United States marines in the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon should be withdrawn and replaced with troops from a nation not perceived as a supporter of Israel and the Maronite Christians who rule the country. He has criticized the invasion of Grenada as an overreaction and a misuse of United States military strength in violation of the treaties with Caribbean and Latin American nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/books/nonfiction-in-brief-071519.html,"THE RIGHT TO LIFERS Who They Are, How They Operate, Where They Get Their Money. By Connie Paige. 286 pp. New York: Summit Books. $14.95. Almost every line of ''The Right to Lifers,'' from the acknowledgments to the appendixes, testifies to Connie Paige's pro-choice convictions, and she works through her evidence with an unflagging singlemindedness. But while the coalition - or even the insinuated collusion - of right-to-lifers and anti-busing groups, some Catholics, the conservative business community, anti-environmentalists, the New Right, the Moral Majority, the Republican Party and Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church may be unsettling, is it really shocking? Only victims of excessive right- to-life rhetoric (or a lengthy news blackout) could have missed the existence of this alliance - holy or unholy, as one's perspective dictates. Anti-abortionists make up, as Miss Paige points out, ''one of the quintessentially American populist movements of our time,'' and their quirky fervor makes for good copy. I like knowing that brewery money (from the Miller and Coors foundations) has helped pay for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the American Family Institute, a right-to-life organization operating out of Senator Jesse Helms's office. But Miss Paige succeeds most when reminding us that the right-to-life movement is powerful, serious and often self-righteous. Even then, however, her enthusiasm for hunting down her anti-abortion foes occasionally backfires. It's not that her characterizations aren't apt, but rather that they would have had more power if she had made them after we had all the evidence before us. Further, even the already converted may wonder if some of her accusations couldn't fit pro-choicers as well. Are we really to believe that right-to-lifers are the only ones who get themselves appointed to more than one executive board? Pro- choice forces are admittedly not Miss Paige's subject, but by painting them as the victimized pure, if only by omission of their frailties, she weakens her argument.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/books/nonfiction-in-brief-071520.html,"THE LAW GIVETH Legal Aspects of the Abortion Controversy. By Barbara Milbauer in collaboration with Bert N. Obrentz. 363 pp. New York: Atheneum. $21.95. In ''The Law Giveth,'' Barbara Milbauer has compiled a valuable chronology of the abortion controversy and a catalogue of the ways in which foes of legalized abortion have attempted to hack away at the Supreme Court's decision, in Roe v. Wade, to legalize abortion. Unfortunately, she not only examines the substance of the abortion debate but incorporates in her book all of its heat, venom and oversimplification as well. By the author's own count, a total of 144 statutes and regulations have been passed to inhibit the right to an abortion during the last 10 years - either by prohibiting it outright or placing restrictions on how it can be performed. The most important of these, known as the ''Hyde amendments,'' barred the use of Federal Medicaid funds to pay for nontherapeutic abortions. Miss Milbauer argues that the Hyde amendments, which the Supreme Court upheld in the 1980 case of Harris v. McRae, rendered Roe v. Wade academic. She argues that the alternatives for poor and pregnant women remain what they were prior to 1973 - childbirth and further impoverishment or the illegal abortionist. But she offers surprisingly little proof that during the past decade the Supreme Court has taken away the right to an abortion. Indeed, she claims at one point that the overwhelming majority of those deprived of Federal funds nonetheless manage to obtain safe, legal abortions. Much of this book consists of Miss Milbauer's efforts to explain court decisions to the layman - a tricky business, and one that she accomplishes quite nicely. Regrettably, her editorial intrusions do not end here, and readers are subjected to some high decibel emotions, ranging from sarcasm to exasperation to indignation to condescension.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHILDBIRTH AFTER 35: DISPELLING MYTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/style/childbirth-after-35-dispelling-myths.html,"A paper on older mothers, presented at the national conference of the National Association of Social Workers here last week, concludes that some of the stereotypes and misconceptions about being parents after the age of 35 are unfounded. The study, entitled ''No Better Time: The Choice of Parenting After 35,'' takes a look at what has been identified by one obstetrician as constituting ''a second normal curve,'' a comparison with the traditional preponderance of childbirths in the 20's age group. Although women have always had children throughout their reproductive years, modern birth-control techniques and access to abortion have made the decision of when to have children far more a matter of choice. For the first time in history, the study reports, large numbers of women are ''choosing'' to have children after the age of 35. In 1981, 53 percent of all births to white women in Washington were to women over the age of 30. ''The study came about as a result of my own experience,'' said Dr. Iris Kern, who teaches research at the University of the District of Columbia here. ''I had my first child at the age of 27 and in a second marriage had another child at the age of 42. I was fully aware that the experience of parenting 15 years later was a vastly different experience than it had been in my 20's. And I wondered whether my experience was true for other people but could find no research that had been done in the area.'' ''The data for this study was collected starting in September 1981,'' said Dr. Kern, ''and the overwhelming single finding was that for the vast majority the experience was more positive than they had dared to imagine. The women interviewed pointed to multiple advantages. Those who had children for the first time said they felt they were in far better economic and psychological shape - their careers were established, they felt they were more mature, more patient. And almost all said that although they had less physical energy at age 40, it was compensated for by more psychological energy.'' Dr. Kern's study of 83 babies born to 75 older mothers in the Washington metropolitan area who ranged in age from 38 to 49 found that contrary to expectations, 80 percent of the mothers were able to deliver vaginally and 58 percent delivered without any kind of medication. Only 15 percent experienced forceps delivery in contrast to approximately 60 percent of mothers of all ages. ''We did find a prejudice on the part of some physicans against older mothers,'' said Dr. Kern, ''but older mothers are more familiar with their bodies, they aren't intimidated and won't always listen to a physician who automatically suggests Caesarean section.'' ''Women are in better shape at 35 today than their mothers, they get more exercise, they are into aerobic dancing, they are eating better,'' observed Dr. Cecil Jacobson, a Washington-area geneticist. While risks such as decreased fertility in the mother and increase in Down's syndrome in the child are real, the study concludes, ''they do not represent anything like the risk imagined.'' Two-thirds of the women in the study believed that access to amniocentesis - a medical procedure by which the presence of serious medical problems in the fetus can be determined - helped them to make their decision. One-third of the women elected not to use amniocentesis. One-third of the women interviewed were first-time mothers. Roughly another third were women who had a history of problems with fertility and who had accepted the fact that they were not going to be parents. And the remaining third were in second marriages and raising second families. Seventeen percent of those interviewed had Ph.D.s, 9 percent had master's degrees and 5 percent were lawyers. Sixty-four of those interviewed were white, 13 black and 5 of ''mixed'' racial background.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BUSINESS FORUM;
BLOCK MODELS AND SELF-DEFENSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/business/business-forum-block-models-and-selfdefense.html,"SUPPOSE you're an official of the Indianapolis chapter of a prominent national conservation group. Your organization's activities, along with those of 70 other diverse concerns, are being studied by a new computer programming technique called block modeling. This sophisticated technology studies your cash transactions, communications patterns and other recorded financial and social interactions. Unexpectedly, the computer says that your organization's financial and social profile is like that of the Ku Klux Klan; the John Birch Society; another environmental group; an emergency assistance association, and the American Legion. You're all in the same ''bloc,'' the computer says, the study is publicly available and the guilt-by-association consequences are all too obvious. This example is real - part of a study recently reported in a scholarly book whose findings are impeccably qualified. It graphically illustrates possible problems created by block modeling - a powerful new information technology for classifying individuals and organizations based on large amounts of seemingly mundane data on transactions and relationships. While the craft of block modeling is inaccessible to all but a new information ''elite,'' its powers have not been lost on highly placed individuals in foreign and domestic corporations, as well as nonprofit organizations and government agencies. Those who use block models exploit them as an efficient way to sort the good from the bad from the indifferent - whether people, programs, divisions or rival groups. Applications of block modeling and sister technologies already number in the hundreds. Block modeling is coming of age and possible applications include management (separating fast-track from slow-track employees), banking (studying electronic funds transfers and other cash flow patterns), professional sports (figuring out the pro draft), law enforcement (investigating conspiracies) among others. But despite the versatility and broad appeal, genuine problems can arise. Computer-generated classifications have a strong mystique. And it can be hard indeed to fight a computer classification whose hallmark is naming names through a computer analysis of ordinary activities. The classification problems truly come to the fore in the national political arena. For example, a study of Washington special interest groups has been using a kindred method to probe similiarities among more than 70 organizations on the basis of shared ''issue interests'' in health-related areas like Medicare and abortion. The resulting computer diagram lumps the Environmental Defense Fund with the American College of Cardiology and Merck & Company in a location far removed from major labor organizations like the United Auto Workers and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. One need not be a lobbyist or P.A.C. specialist to sense some of the political electricity of this placement, or possible action implications. BUT what defense does an organization or employee have against the possible misuse of block modeling or sister methods. One should not look to Congress to pass a law. Waiting for legislation is like waiting for Godot. One should also not expect easy recourse through the traditional civil lawsuit. In fact, the law has yet to define limits to the block modeling enterprise and little legal fault can currently be found with most of the means of gathering the needed information for its use. Still, protective rules need to be fashioned, even if they must sometimes fit in the nooks and crannies of legal categories - a new clause in a union contract, for example. In most situations, an employee should at least be notified if he is the subject of something like a block model analysis by his employer. If you are an unsuspecting victim, there is no way to defend yourself. Then, focusing on rules for employee protection, a range of unique problems must be dealt with. For example, the thrust of early computer-oriented privacy legislation from the 70's was giving people the right to examine information in their own ''files.'' The privacy gains were genuine, but from a standpoint of block modeling, they are largely irrelevant. That is because block modeling classifies people on the basis of where they fit in a far larger web of relationships. Therefore, one has to be concerned with many more ''files'' than just one's own - some belonging to people one has no direct connections with. One is thus vulnerable to all the problems of these third parties, including inaccuracies in their files. But if the third parties' privacy rights are to be respected, much of this relevant information must remain inviolate. Thus, individuals being classified through a block model or similar method need to be given a carefully calibrated set of rights to information in order to interpret their assigned positions and respond accordingly. This information should at least include some basic knowledge about the data base, including the scope of the population being modeled as well as what specific types of data have been, or will be, included. Such data gives a crucial basis for understanding one's recourse. For example, if the block model put you in an unfavorable category, and used such data as whom you bowled with or went to parties with, this use of non-job related information could be attacked as gratuitous. One might contemplate giving an employee access to the full data base stripped of personal identifying information except his own location in it. However, the wide availability of precisely such tools as block modeling makes recovery of identities from even such apparently ''stripped'' files a real privacy risk.  Still, one may disclose the structural role of the different blocs without dipping down to a level of individual identities. This last type of information, combined with a specific right to know your individual bloc location, can be enough to give a respectable road map for defense against the worst implications of guilt by association. Very importantly, effective ways also need to be developed to permit members of the same block to get together to mount a common defense. In contrast to abuses like ''redlining'' or race, sex, or age discrimination, the new technologies frequently pick out less than obvious groups whose members may easily fail to recognize they are being targeted in common. Currently, technical progress in block modeling is making it possible to conduct an aggressive defense by showing that in some cases there is an equally good block model leading to very different classifications. In other words, there's more than one way to structure the given data - so that one block model might, for example, stress conflicting factions while a second identifies options for negotiation or cooperation. Thus, responsible users of block modeling methods should also be prepared to disclose major alternative ways of organizing the data. In the meantime, possibly the most important 1984 New Year's resolution is to remember that each time you pick up the telephone or send electronic mail in your office, you may be adding to somebody's computer data base - and computers never forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN STUDY ART OF POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/28/style/women-study-art-of-politics.html,"The Republicans call theirs leadership forums. The Democrats call theirs ''Impact '84.'' Whatever the name, both are conferences for female party activists that are being held in cities throughout the nation. These meetings, which generally draw about 200 invited women, have two major purposes: to inform the women of the party's policies, and to urge them to run for office in 1984. Betty G. Heitman, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, explained it this way during a recent leadership forum here: ''I feel we have not done as good a job as we could to arm our women leaders with as much information as they need at the grass-roots level. We hope these meetings will help them gear up for the 1984 campaign.'' Mrs. Heitman said this was the first year the Republicans had sponsored such meetings. Similar forums have also been held in Indianapolis and San Diego, she said, with a fourth one planned for early next year in Atlanta. 'They're Not a First' The Democrats held their ''Impact '84'' meeting in September in Washington, and three or four meetings are planned for next year. ''They're not a first, but they're the first in a long time,'' said Lynn G. Cutler, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and director of its women's division. ''We had similar conferences during the Johnson years.'' Leaders of both parties agreed that a major reason for the conferences was the so-called gender gap, the pattern emerging from polling data showing that women vote for Democrats more than men do. What goes on at these meetings? The recent Republican Women's Leadership Forum in the Franklin Plaza Hotel here included everything from speeches by top party officials to workshops on how to dress and act in a campaign. There was a simulated television talk show, in which women pretended they were candidates. The weekend meeting drew 200 party activists and elected officials from 10 Northeastern states and the District of Columbia. Much of the first day, a Saturday, was devoted to ''break-out sessions,'' in which Reagan Administration policies were described to the women. These sessions were conducted by officials from the Departments of Defense, Labor, Justice and Education, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ''People might ask you, 'Why are we spending so much for defense?' '' said Lawrence J. Korb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, in a session on arms negotiations. ''I admit, $250 billion a year is a lot of money. But we need to spend it because defense was underfunded for two decades while the Soviets were spending a lot, and because we don't want nuclear war. The money helps us to have strong conventional forces, as well as to maintain a nuclear balance.'' Dr. Lenora Cole Alexander, director of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, told the women in a session called ''Fairness Under the Law'' that there had been a slight decrease in 1982 in the pay gap between men and women. Women now earn 62 cents for every dollar earned by men, she said. ''So throw away those buttons that say 59 cents,'' she said. ''They're outmoded.'' As the officials spoke, many women took notes in notebooks that had been given to them along with a thick briefing book that included what were called ''this Administration's accomplishments'' and ''samples of speeches that you may wish to use in part or in whole when delivering speeches around your state.'' Several Republican activists who may be delivering those speeches next year said in interviews that they were having trouble back home answering questions about such women's issues as the equal rights amendment and abortion, both of which have failed to win support in party platforms. ''It's damn difficult to be a Republican and a feminist these days,'' said Mary Mather, a Republican committee member from Philadelphia. ''By not backing the E.R.A., we lost a lot of viability with a lot of women. I think the party has finally become aware that we may have a problem with a lot of people.'' ''We're all very conscious of the gender gap,'' added Diane Haslett Rudiano of Brooklyn, N.Y., vice president of the New York State Federation of Republican Women. ''That's why we're here - to learn how to spread the message that will help change people's minds.'' Some of their best ammunition came from Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the Secretary of Transportation, whose keynote speech was devoted almost entirely to what she said President Reagan has done for women. Among his accomplishments, she said, were helping to change Social Security laws to equalize benefits for widows and widowers; helping eliminate the estate tax; helping increase child care tax credits and reducing the so-called marriage tax. Mrs. Dole also noted the President's appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court and of three women to Cabinet-level positions: Jeane J. Kirkpatrick as chief United States representative at the United Nations, Margaret M. Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and herself. ''The President, and all Republicans, have a lot to offer the women of this country,'' she said to loud applause. ''But our message is not getting out.'' Several women at the conference asked how they could deal with members of the press, who, they said, often write negatively about Republican candidates. Lyn Nofziger, a former assistant to President Reagan, told the women they should ''try to make friends with the press.'' And Mary Jo Jacobi, Special Assistant to the President for Public Liaison, urged the participants to buy advertisements or print flyers if the press ignores or writes negatively about Republicans.''If we have to spend money to get our message across, then we should spend money,'' she said. Audience-Participation Sessions The Republican women seemed to enjoy the second day of the forum most. It included audience-participation sessions on skills they would need in running for office - fund-raising, public speaking, talk-show appearances and image development. ''The most powerful outfit a woman can wear is a suit,'' Nancy Thompson, an image consultant from Washington, told the women during a workshop called ''Candidate Image Development.'' ''And a suit jacket is just about the most powerful item you can have,'' she added, fingering the lapels of her own tweed jacket. ''And, ladies, leave it on!'' Although most of the Republican women were already wearing suits, Miss Thompson's lively presentation seemed to be one of their favorite sessions. She recommended that the women's suits be in dark blues and grays, and made of fabrics that look real. ''If you walk outside and your suit goes 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star,' then it has too much polyester in it,'' she said. A female candidate's handshake should be firm, she added, her eye contact direct and her jewelry small, ''because small looks real.'' And her name tag should always be worn on the same side she shakes hands with, she said, ''so the voters will be sure to see it.'' A woman in the audience asked how she could keep male acquaintances from trying to kiss her while she was on the campaign trail. ''That's easy,'' Miss Thompson replied. Thrusting her right arm out in front of her like a football player straight-arming an opponent, she said, ''Just extend your arm for a shake so he can't kiss you.'' The audience erupted in laughter. Then the Republican women headed for home, perhaps to put their shoulders to the wheel, as Mr. Nofziger had urged. ''Forget your differences with the President and close ranks,'' he said. ''The Democrats don't intend to lose again.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN'S ENDORSEMENT SEEMS A 2-WAY RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/02/us/women-s-endorsement-seems-a-2-way-race.html,"Like eager suitors, the Democratic Presidential candidates have been courting the National Organization for Women in the hope of gaining the endorsement next week of the country's largest feminist group. The late entry of the Rev. Jesse Jackson into the Presidential race has stirred not only uneasiness among his rivals but also turmoil within the women's organization. Although NOW officials say privately that former Vice President Walter F. Mondale remains the leading contender for the group's first Presidential endorsement, Mr. Jackson has emerged as a formidable rival for two reasons. The first is that Mr. Jackson is the only candidate to have pledged to name a woman as his Vice-Presidential choice, a pledge that Judy Goldsmith, the president of NOW, termed ''very significant because it's important to have the choice.'' ''It has simply not been a possibility before,'' said Mrs. Goldsmith. ''The door has been closed. We've been cheating our country.'' Group's Image Is at Issue By all accounts the second reason is far more delicate. Mr. Jackson, who is black, will appeal to minority voters. NOW, whose 250,000 members are mostly white women, has sought hard but not too successfully to appeal to minority women. The organization's officials said they fear that an endorsement of Mr. Mondale or any of the other candidates will perpetuate the view, expressed earlier by Mr. Jackson, that NOW is a white, middle-class organization. ''It's a problem, it's something we're trying to correct,'' said one official of the organization. ''But no one is saying that this should be the sole determining factor. We do have a history of working for civil rights issues and a lot of feminists began their political activity in the civil rights movement.'' Aides to Mr. Mondale had privately expressed concern that the group was planning to delay its endorsement to allow Mr. Jackson a full hearing, but Mrs. Goldsmith said the announcement would be made here on Dec. 10 or 11, as scheduled, after a closed meeting of the 35-member executive board. Special Significance Cited The group's endorsement is especially significant because of its size, its national network of women, and because, in the words of one Mondale aide, ''Their support says the candidate is good on the issues.'' The Mondale campaign, and to some extent the organizations of such contenders as Senators John Glenn, Alan Cranston and Gary Hart, have lobbied for the endorsement, stressing their support for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, the right of women to seek abortions, and issues relating to child care and equitable pay, insurance and pension rights. ''At this point I am hopeful but far from confident,'' said Nikki Heiderpriem, a Washington lawyer who is director of Mr. Mondale's women's issues staff. ''Jackson's working hard for it.'' Eric Easter, a aide to Mr. Jackson, said: ''His views on women's issues are very, very dear to him. Women are another group that has been traditionally ignored in the political process.'' Supporters Extend Effort Mr. Mondale and some of his key supporters have spoken with Mrs. Goldsmith and other members of the executive board. Mr. Jackson has met with Mrs. Goldsmith twice, and lobbying efforts in his behalf have been undertaken by such supporters as Maxine Waters, majority whip of the California State Assembly. Although Mr. Jackson's statements on women's issues have hardly pleased the group's officials - he has criticized the women's movement for being led by a narrow constituency of ''upper middle-class white females'' and has indicated he was personally opposed to abortion - the candidate has muted and blurred some of those beliefs that many feminists found objectionable. ''We are taking Jackson's candidacy very seriously,'' Mrs. Goldsmith said. ''It addresses very specifically and very powerfully the needs of the minority community. But we cannot ignore all the factors upon which we are evaluating all the candidates.'' These criteria include the status of women on the candidate's staff - ''whether they're making policy or making coffee,'' said one official of the group. Other factors are the importance of women's issues in a candidate's platform, whether or not the candidate is considering a woman as vice president, and ''electability,'' or the candidate's potential to defeat President Reagan. It is the ''electability'' issue that may untimately give Mr. Mondale the edge in picking up the endorsement. Senator Glenn has quietly sought to gain the endorsement, but one of his key feminist supporters, Roxanne Conlin, a Des Moines lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Iowa in 1982, said: ''I'm not hopeful Glenn will get the endorsement. I'm being realistic.'' ''Like most feminists, I want Ronald Reagan out of the White House,'' said Mrs. Conlin, who is head of the Glenn campaign's national policy council and a member of the NOW legal defense and education board. ''That's what's important. And I think it is John Glenn who can beat Reagan.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN PUBLISHES SET OF GUIDELINES ON SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/02/world/vatican-publishes-set-of-guidelines-on-sex-education.html,"Excerpts from document, page A6. ROME, Dec. 1 - The Vatican issued a set of guidelines for sexual education today. The document was viewed in church circles as largely a stern restatement of the Roman Catholic Church's traditional attitudes. The 36-page declaration, ''Educational Guidance in Human Love,'' termed extramarital sexual relations ''a grave disorder'' and masturbation ''a grave moral disorder.'' The document emphasized throughout that marriage was designed for procreation but recognized that it also served the purpose of ''the realization of the couple.'' Homosexuality was described as ''a disorder'' and a ''social maladaptation.'' While priests were urged to treat homosexuals with understanding, they were warned not to ''accord them a moral justification.'' Governments Urged to Act The document said it was the task of governments to safeguard citizens ''against injustices and moral disorders, such as the abuse of minors and every form of sexual violence, degrading dress, permissiveness and pornography.'' It also strongly urged governmental regulation of outlets of information and entertainment, ''especially with regard to magazines, films, radio and television programs, exhibitions, shows and publicity.'' ''By their intrusiveness and suggestion,'' the statement said, communication outlets ''display to youth and the very young - also and above all in the field of sex education - a continuous and conditioning stream of information and training, which is very much more trenchant than that of one's own family.'' The document was viewed by many church officials here as likely to widen the gap between the stern orthodoxy represented by Pope John Paul II and Roman Catholics favoring more liberal interpretations attuned to the worldwide relaxation of sexual mores. Demands for Guidance The document was prepared by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, whose prefect is an American, William Cardinal Baum. A member of the congregation said today that the preparation of the document had been inspired by demands for guidance from parents and bishops and was a result of years of consultations with national conferences of bishops. He described the document as a consensus fully mindful of the church's traditional teachings. The guidelines said sexual education should prepare future spouses to ''have knowledge of the natural methods of regulating their fertility.'' Saying that artificial contraception was ''insistently propagated today,'' the document urged that the Roman Catholic prohibition of such methods be taught ''at an appropriate age'' to prepare the young ''for responsible marriage.'' It also stated the church's opposition to abortion by stressing that sexual education must include ''respect for life in the womb.'' Some Concessions Made While maintaining the church's traditional restrictions against all practices that it deems impermissible, the guidelines made some concessions in prescribing attitudes that parents, educators and priests should adopt toward offenders. For example, in discussing masturbation, the document attributed the practice to immaturity and advised that, instead of punishment, its underlying cause be sought. ''From an educative point of view,'' it said, ''it is necessary to consider masturbation and other forms of auto- eroticism as symptoms of problems much more profound, which provoke sexual tension which the individual seeks to resolve by recourse to such behavior. Pedagogic action, therefore, should be directed more to the causes than to direct repression of the phenomenon.'' Teachers were instructed to help affected adolescents ''to feel accepted in a communion of charity,'' to ''undramatize'' the practice and to ''not reduce his or her esteem and benevolence for the pupil.'' Suggests Help for Homosexuals Similarly, the section on homosexuality, while denouncing it morally and speaking of it in terms of a grave disorder, counseled a comprehending attitude and refrained from suggesting punishment. Instead, it told teachers and families to offer help - ''welcoming with understanding, creating a climate of hope, encouraging the emancipation of the individual and his or her growth in self-control.'' As possible causes of homosexuality, the Sacred Congregation listed ''lack of affection, immaturity, obsessive impulses, seduction, social isolation and other types of frustration, depravation in dress, license in shows and publications.'' Such a consideration of possible deep psychological causes is considered an advance from the earlier church attitude, which categorically condemned homosexuality as mortal sin devoid of extenuating circumstances. The statement, which has already been distributed to all bishops, strongly opposed ''devaluation'' of sex by reducing it ''to genital experience alone.'' It stressed that sexual education is education in love and should never be separated from the morality of the Roman Catholic faith. It also emphasized the predominant role of the family in such teaching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEVERAL REPBUBLICAN WOMEN IN LEGISLATURES URGE PARTY TO SHIFT ON RIGHTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/us/several-repbublican-women-in-legislatures-urge-party-to-shift-on-rights.html,"In an angry eruption of frustration, a group of Republican women who serve in state legislatures are demanding that their party and President Reagan come out more strongly in favor of women's rights. They are in town this week for a bipartisan meeting of more than 350 women who are state legislators. A Republican caucus Friday night quickly turned into a forum for the airing of grievances about the Reagan Administration's position on women's issues, particularly its opposition to abortion and to the proposed Constitutional amendment on equal rights. ''There's an unawareness in this Administration of how strongly Republican women feel about women's issues,'' said State Representative Julie Belaga of Westport, Conn. ''We are fed up with people saying 'Where are you?' on women's issues.'' White House Action Sought The legislators told party leaders here, including Betty Heitman, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a member of the House of Representatives, to communicate their sentiments to the White House. The complaints appeared to have the support of a clear majority of nearly 100 women at the caucus, many of whom wore buttons saying ''G.O.P. for E.R.A.'' The turnout for the caucus represented most of the Republicans at the meeting, a national conference sponsored by the Center for the American Woman and Politics of Rutgers University. It was the second time this year that high-ranking Republican women publicly criticized the Administration at a major political meeting for what they said is a lack of responsiveness on issues of concern to women. The other was at a meeting this summer of the National Women's Political Caucus. Convention Action Cited Representative Snowe told the group she was already ''working with the Administration on some of these key issues,'' citing pay equity as an example. But she added: ''It's unfortunate the Republican Party has gotten on the defensive on women's issues. We should be on the offensive.'' She cited the Republican Party's ''traditional'' support of equal rights, a position that was reversed when its endorsement of the equal rights amendment was dropped from the platform at its 1980 national convention. Mrs. Heitman admitted she was surprised at the depth of the legislators' discontent. She told them that top party leaders had been lax in listening and commended the legislators for being ''better at communicating with us.'' Sharing of Experiences More than 600 women, including government officials and political activists, have been meeting since Thursday in what has been billed as the largest turnout ever of women serving in state legislatures. About a third of the total of 993 are here. This conference was designed to give the growing number of women who are legislators, both Republicans and Democrats, an opportunity to share experiences, according to the director of the center, Ruth Mandel. But as it turned out, some of Democratic participants seized the opportunity to needle their Republican colleagues because opinion polls consistently show that women are less enthusiastic than men about Mr. Reagan. And in a clear sign that Mr. Reagan is worried about this ''gender gap,'' Vice President Bush, before addressing the group tonight, said the President ''is concerned about it'' and had consulted pollsters to explain it. Their advice was that ''the major part of the misunderstanding relates to economics,'' Mr. Bush said in a session with reporters. ''Therefore, the President believes that as the economy rises there will be a diminution'' of the difference in support. At the conference dinner, where his speech concerned not women's or states' issues but the arms reductions talks, Mr. Bush unexpectedly agreed to the question-and-answer session he had earlier declined. He acknowledged receipt of petitions from the conferees urging him, like two Democratic Presidential candidates set to speak Sunday, Senators Gary Hart and Alan Cranston, to submit to questions. ''I don't think its fair to let Hart and Cranston take all the questions,'' he said, prompting an outburst of cheers. The Vice President was asked if the Administration supported the equal rights amendment. ''Nope,'' he replied. ''The President took his case to the American people in 1980. To ask the President to change his position in an election year - he's not going to do that.'' Some Defend Reagan Mr. Reagan was defended by legislators like State Senator Ann Rydalch of Idaho, who called herself part of ''a silent majority.'' ''The President has had success as far as the economy,'' she said. ''This so-called gender gap is the only thing they have to try and drag him down. It's a Democratic ploy.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teen-Age Sex and Tattletales,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/06/opinion/teen-age-sex-and-tattletales.html,"Terriers are hailed for the persistence with which they worry the bone. By dropping the bone that is the so-called ''squeal rule,'' the Reagan Administration is finally behaving wisely. For two years the Department of Health and Human Services has pressed for a new rule to require federally funded family planning clinics to notify the parents of patients under 18 who seek prescription contraceptives. Parents should be informed, the Department contended, about presciptions that might affect their children's health. That contention overlooked something central. If clinics were required to squeal on young patients, the young people would be discouraged from becoming patients in the first place. But limiting access to contraceptives would not have limited teen-age sexual activity: 25 percent of the adolescents polled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute said they would stop asking for help if their parents had to be notified. Besides which, there is no contraceptive that affects an adolescent's health as adversely as does pregnancy. The proposed regulation prompted comments from 120,000 individuals and organizations, the majority negative. Four different Federal judges found that the regulation would contradict the intent of Congress. Last week Solicitor General Rex Lee decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court. The squeal rule, hence, has gone away, but the problem has not. America's teen-age birth rate is one of the highest in the developed countries. In 1980, 460,000 adolescents in the United States had abortions. According to one study, 4 of every 10 American teen-agers have sexual relations. Facing the facts of adolescent sexual life is difficult for parents. But to ignore those facts invites tragedy. Those children were born into a society where sex sells everything from cars to jeans. Often, they are the victims of a revolution they didn't make. What they need is education in birth control through schools, community groups and advertising. They need easy access to contraceptives. Above all, what they need from adults is not tattletales but honest counseling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the worst terrorist attack there since 1979, when 3 people were killed and 50 wounded by explosives packed in a bicycle frame. (Page A1, Col. 6.) Data about Syrian antiaircraft sites in Lebanon was inadequate and American pilots met more intense fire than they expected during Sunday's bombing raid, a senior admiral said. He spoke at a Navy briefing in defense of the raid, in which two planes were lost, one airman was killed and one was captured by the Syrians. The performance of the airmen has been criticized by military specialists at home at abroad, including two former commanders of the Israeli Air Force. (A1:5-6.) Two Israeli pilotless drones were shot down as they flew over Syrian positions in eastern Lebanon and southwest Syria, Damascus reported. An Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv confirmed the loss of one pilotless craft. (A18:1.) Britain does not plan to withdraw its 100 or more soldiers from Beirut, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher affirmed. Opposition Labor spokesman and some Conservatives have demanded that the British force be brought home. (A18:5-6.) An arrest in a $38 million gold theft was made by the authorities in London. They charged a guard employed by the company that had three tons of bullion taken from its warehouse at Heathrow Airport 10 days ago. Five other men were being held for questioning. There were no indications that the police had recovered any of the 6,800 bars of gold. (A1:5.) Common Market leaders are at odds over proposed cuts in farm spending and a British demand for a $1 billion budget refund. A summit meeting of the 10-nation European Economic Community ended in deadlock over the two issues. Officials said the disagreements left the Common Market on the brink of bankruptcy and facing the deepest political crisis of its 26- year history. (A1:2.) A Romanesque gospel book, described by scholars and collectors as one of the greatest medieval masterpieces remaining in private hands, was sold in London to a West German consortium and will be returned to the region in Lower Saxony where it was created and sumptuously illustrated eight centuries ago. The Germans paid more than $11.7 million for the work of art after two minutes of bidding. (C32:4-6.) National The sanctity of life was extolled by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago, as he urged Roman Catholics to join in a broad campaign against nuclear weapons, abortion and capital punishment. In an address at Fordham University, Cardinal Bernardin expressed opposition to the death penalty ''because we do not think its use cultivates an attitude of respect for life.'' (A1:3-4.) Religious opposition to the death penalty has forged an alliance that promises to strengthen with the prospect of a rising number of executions. On this issue, the Roman Catholic Church is allied with most mainstream Protestant denominations and most Jewish theologians. Fundamentalist Christians and some Jewish thinkers endorse the death penalty. (A1:2-4.) Three more civil rights panelists were appointed by President Reagan. In naming the three to the restructured United States Commission on Civil Rights, Mr. Reagan declined to reappoint a prominent Republican who has criticized the Administration's civil rights policies. (A1:1.) A Nobel Prize-winning theory about the physiology of the inner ear was shaken in a test conducted by Spacelab scientists aboard the space shuttle Columbia. The theory now disputed was an explanation for the effectiveness of a common test used in diagnosing the dizziness caused by a malfunctioning inner ear. The theory was hypothesized by Robert Barany of Sweden in 1906. (A13:1.) A link to Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative disorders of the brain is the prion, the smallest infectious agent known, according to researchers at the University of California.

RELIGIOUS ALLIANCE AGAINST EXECUTIONS GROWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/us/religious-alliance-against-executions-grows.html,"The unsuccessful plea last week by Pope John Paul II to the Governor of Florida to halt the execution of a convicted murderer was the latest demonstration of a religious alliance against capital punishment that promises to grow stronger with the prospect of more executions. On this issue, the Roman Catholic Church is allied with most mainstream Protestant denominations and most Jewish theologians. Fundamentalist Christians and some other Jewish thinkers endorse the death penalty. The most definitive statement on capital punishment by the Catholic bishops of the United States came in November 1980. By a vote of 145 to 31 with 14 abstentions, they resolved that the penalty should be done away with as ''a manifestation of our belief in the unique worth and dignity of each person from the moment of conception, a creature made in the image and likeness of God.'' In January this year, the Pope called for ''clemency, or pardon, for those condemned to death.'' The position is a relatively new one for the church hierarchy. St. Thomas Aquinas, foremost of medieval philosophers, made a classic defense of the penalty: ''If a man be dangerous and infectious to the community, on account of some sin, it is praiseworthy and advantageous that he be killed in order to safeguard the common good.'' Today's bishops rest their stand against the penalty partly on pragmatic arguments, such as the possibility of error in condemning a person to death. But deeper objections are drawn from their faith. In the 1980 statement they held that abolition of capital punishment ''is most consistent with the example of Jesus, who both taught and practiced the forgiveness of injustice and who came to 'give His life as a ransom for many.' '' Bishop Renee Gracida of Corpus Christi, Tex., who initiated the resolution on capital punishment at the 1980 conference, recalled in an interview that he had been troubled by the idea of execution since, as a boy in Texas, he was taken to see an electric chair. The Bishop, now 60 years old, played a prominent role in the debate that preceded the execution in Florida in May 1979 of John Spenkelink. Bishop Gracida, then Bishop of Tallahassee, wrote a pastoral letter opposing that execution, the first to be carried out in Florida after a decade-long moratorium while the United States Supreme Court grappled with the issue. Bishop Gracida offered two principles for today's opposition. First, ''capital punishment in our time is not morally permissible because the system of justice is flawed; it cannot be administered equably, justly, without discrimination.'' The second principle owes more to contemporary Catholic thought. As he formulated it, this principle holds: ''Our society is experiencing an attack on human life - euthanasia, the idea of 'death with dignity,' which is a euphemism for euthanasia, abortion, the violence and threat to life everywhere in the world. Capital punishment is another form of attack on the sanctity of human life.'' Odd Alliances Cited He observed that the bishops' belief that the defense of life can be strengthened by eliminating the state's power to take it away made for odd alliances, saying: ''Some of my friends in the Right to Life movement are very strong for capital punishment, and some of my friends who oppose capital punishment are very strong for abortion. Both groups are inconsistent. We must be consistent.'' The bishops' firmest allies on abortion and firmest adversaries on the death penalty outside their own church are to be found among Protestant fundamentalist groups. They admit to no inconsistency. In an interview, Richard Cizik, research director of the National Association of Evangelicals, defended the position that ''the sanctity of human life calls for justice.'' He said: ''We are not recommending the death penalty in any specific case, but if no crime, however atrocious, is considered serious enough to warrant capital punishment, then the respect for the sacredness of life itself is eroded. That would diminish the value of life.'' The view of the evangelicals is not generally subscribed to by the mainstream Protestant denominations, such as Episcopalians, Methodists and Presbyterians. Several of them were ahead of the Catholic bishops in opposing capital punishment, declaring their position in the 1950's. Concern Over Social Conditions For these groups, Scripture alone does not offer sufficient guidance on capital punishment. Their opposition is tied to a wider concern over existing social conditions. The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., for example, emphasized in a 1977 resolution against capital punishment that almost half of the prisoners on death row come from minority groups. That, on its face, the Baptist group declared, ''is immoral and unjust.'' Such concerns are shared by groups not known for devotion to religion, such as the American Civil Liberties Union. But there is also a specifically Christian source of opposition that springs from faith in the possibility of redemption. As the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) declared in 1957, ''Christian justification of punishment is always found in the hope of rehabiliation of the offender; since dead people cannot be rehabiliated we can in no way defend capital punishment on Christian grounds.'' Differences of opinion or of emphasis remain. Whereas since 1966 the Lutheran Church in America has urged abolition on the ground that the death penalty falls on the weakest groups in society, makes irrevocable any miscarriage of justice and ends the possibility of restoring the convicted person to effective citizenship, the more conservative American Lutheran Church in 1972 affirmed ''our theological heritage, which accords to the state the right to impose the death penalty.'' A Lutheran can accept Luther's words that ''God has delegated his authority for punishing evildoers to civil magistrates,'' yet find that under existing conditions using that power to execute people is wrong. Thus, believers in identical doctrines continue to reach conflicting conclusions. Views of Human Nature The Rev. Virginia Mackey, a consultant for the National Interreligious Task Force on Criminal Justice, which is associated with the National Council of Churches, attributes the division among the devout to contrasting views of human nature. She said in an interview: ''There are those, like myself, who believe that the message of religion is restoration. People of faith seek conversion to the will of a loving God who wants people to relate to each other.'' The opposing view, as she interprets it, ''is that people respond best to force, so one must speak to the worst aspects of human nature.'' Christians who oppose the death penalty must confront not only the darker side of human nature but also the tough rules of the Old Testament, which mandated death not only for murder but also for such crimes as profaning the Sabbath and committing adultery with a married woman. In particular, they must deal with the legal retaliation called for in the Book of Exodus: ''Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.'' Liberal theologians like Miss Mackey urge that this strong language be read in historical perspective. ''The Torah was setting limits on the blood vengeance that prevailed among tribes and cults as monotheism was being developed,'' he said. ''It expressed an effort by the people of Israel to move away from tribal worship and vengeance. The words seem punitive today, but they actually set forth in legal language restraints on punishments.'' New Testament Messages However one interprets the Old Testament, Christians can find gentler messages in the New Testament, which, as Miss Mackey sees it, ''moved beyond restraint and mercy to forgiveness; that's what Jesus's stories are about.'' Wolfe Kelman, a Conservative rabbi and executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly, emphasized in an interview that the Old Testament's rule that a life must be taken for certain crimes was virtually eliminated by Talmudic scholars 2,000 years ago. The rabbi drew attention to the fact that in Israel the death penalty is not applied even to terrorists. The single exception was made in the case of Adolf Eichmann, who was hanged in 1962 for crimes against the Jewish people and humanity. Most Jewish groups that have addressed the issue, secular as well as religious, have come down against capital punishment, although Orthodox Jews do not find such opposition written into the guiding rules of their faith. Rabbi David Bleich, professor of Jewish law and ethics at the Benjamin Cardozo Law School of Yeshiva University, pointed out in an interview that ''the Biblical commandment 'thou shalt not kill' was meant to apply to homicides, not for taking the life of a criminal by the state.'' Rabbi Bleich himself is against capital punishment on ''evidentiary grounds.'' He finds that ''convictions are usually obtained on circumsantial evidence, and that is not satisfactory.'' Nevertheless, most spokesmen for religious bodies are in a minority. Polls have consistently found that two out of three Americans, whether Protestant, Catholic or Jewish, favor the death penalty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BERNARDIN ASKS CATHOLICS TO FIGHT BOTH NUCLEAR ARMS AND ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/us/bernardin-asks-catholics-to-fight-both-nuclear-arms-and-abortion.html,"Excerpts from speech, page B8. Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago, called on Roman Catholics yesterday to open a broad attack on a cluster of issues related to the ''sanctity of life,'' among them nuclear arms, abortion and capital punishment. ''We intend our opposition to abortion and our opposition to nuclear war to be seen as specific applications of this broader attitude,'' Cardinal Bernardin declared in a speech at the Bronx campus of Fordham University. ''We have also opposed the death penalty because we do not think its use cultivates an attitude of respect for life in society.'' Delivering the annual Gannon Lecture, the Cardinal said the various issues made a ''seamless garment'' that deserved the utmost attention of the American Catholic church. He said Catholics should build a ''constituency'' to press all of the church's ''pro-life'' moral positions rather than treat them as separate causes. Many church leaders have noted tensions and isolation between foes of abortion, on the one hand, and critics of nuclear arms on the other. While stressing the need for moral ''consistency,'' the Cardinal conceded that sharp divisions existed over these issues among Catholics. He also said concern for the unborn fetus must be accompanied by a concern for people living in poverty. Cardinal Bernardin has played an exceptionally prominent role in the church's stance against both nuclear war and abortion. He was chairman of the bishops' committee that produced a pastoral letter condemning nuclear war and was recently named chairman of the Bishops' Pro-Life Committee to fill the vacancy left by the death of Terence Cardinal Cooke on Oct. 7. The Cardinal's speech outlined a rationale for a major campaign by the American bishops. Though the hierarchy has taken positions on each of these concerns, church officials say the issues have remained separated in church programs and in the minds of millions of American Catholics. As the nation's bishops have become more outspoken on these matters, several prelates have spoken of the need for greater coordination among advocates of the various issues and a more vigorous effort to convince Catholics that the issues belong together. At their annual meeting last year, Archbishop John R. Roach of Minneapolis, then head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, applied similar thinking in his presidential address, calling for a common fight against nuclear war, poverty and abortion. Central American Policy Cardinal Bernardin included these concerns in stressing the urgency of developing a ''consistent ethic of life in our culture'' and extended this reasoning to voice opposition to the Reagan Administration's policy toward Central America. He said Administration policy ''relies predominantly on the threat and the use of force, which is increasingly distancing itself from a concern for human rights in El Salvador and which fails to grasp the opportunity of a diplomatic solution to the Central American conflict.'' The Cardinal said the entire list of concerns fell within the scope of the Pro-life Committee, which in the past has publicly dealt almost exclusively with abortion. Asserting that modern technology posed new and grave threats to life, Cardinal Bernardin said society faced ''a qualitatively new range of moral problems.'' He said the crucial question had become: ''In a time when we can do anything technologically, how do we decide morally what we never should do?'' He said the church had a responsibility to make its moral positions known. ''Such a defense of life will draw upon the Catholic moral position and the public place the church presently holds in the American civil debate,'' he said. The pastoral letter - ''The Challenge of Peace'' - he continued, ''links the questions of abortion and nuclear war.'' ''The letter does not argue the case for linkage; that is one of my purposes today,'' he said. ''It is important to note that the way these two issues are joined in the pastoral places the American bishops in a unique position in the public policy discourse of the nation. No other major institution presently holds these two positions in the way the Catholic bishops have joined them.'' ''There should always be a presumption against taking human life,'' the Cardinal said, ''but in a limited world marked by the effects of sin there are some narrowly defined exceptions where life can be taken.'' He underscored the bishops' ''conditional'' acceptance of a nuclear deterrent as a step toward disarmament and said that thinking about capital punishment had shifted in recent decades. While the church still upholds the belief of St. Thomas Aquinas that a state has the right to invoke capital punishment, Cardinal Bernardin said, the Pope and the bishops have increasingly disapproved of the practice on the basis that ''more humane methods of defending the society exist and should be used.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM CARDINAL BERNARDIN'S APPEAL FOR A 'CONSISTENT EHTIC OF LIFE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/nyregion/excerpts-from-cardinal-bernardin-s-appeal-for-a-consistent-ehtic-of-life.html,"Following are excerpts from the address yesterday by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago at Fordham University in the Bronx: Today I will discuss the pastoral letter in terms of the relationship of our Catholic moral vision and American culture. Specifically, I wish to use the letter as a starting point for shaping a consistent ethic of life in our culture. In keeping with the spirit of a university, I have cast the lecture in the style of an inquiry, an examination of the need for a consistent ethic of life and a probing of the problems and possibilities which exist within the church and the wider society for developing such an ethic. I do not underestimate the intrinsic intellectual difficulties of this exercise nor the delicacy of the question - ecclesially, ecumenically and politically. But I believe the Catholic moral tradition has something valuable to say in the face of the multiple threats to the sacredness of life today, and I am convinced that the church is in a position to make a significant defense of life in a comprehensive and consistent manner. The fundamental contribution of ''The Challenge of Peace,'' I believe, is that we have been part of a few central forces which have created the ''new moment.'' We have helped to shape the debate; now we face the question of whether we can help to frame a new consensus concerning nuclear policy. The ''new moment'' is filled with potential; it is also filled with danger. The dynamic of the nuclear relationship between the superpowers is not a stable one. It is urgent that a consensus be shaped which will move us beyond our present posture. Precisely because life is sacred, the taking of even one human life is a momentous event. Indeed, the sense that every human life has transcendent value has led a whole stream of the Christian tradition to argue that life may never be taken. That position is held by an increasing number of Catholics and is reflected in the pastoral letter, but it has not been the dominant view in Catholic teaching and it is not the principal moral position found in the pastoral letter. What is found in the letter is the traditional Catholic teaching that there should always be a presumption against taking human life, but in a limited world marked by the effects of sin there are some narrowly defined exceptions where life can be taken. This is the moral logic which produced the ''just war'' ethic in Catholic theology. The dominant cultural fact, present in both modern warfare and modern medicine, which induces a sharper awareness of the fragility of human life is our technology. To live as we do in an age of careening development of technology is to face a qualitatively new range of moral problems. The essential question in the technological challenge is this: In an age when we can do almost anything, how do we decide what we ought to do? The even more demanding question is: In a time when we can do anything technologically, how do we decide morally what we never should do? I would, however, highlight a basic issue: the need for an attitude or atmosphere in society which is the pre- condition for sustaining a consistent ethic of life. The development of such an atmosphere has been the primary concern of the ''respect life'' program of the American bishops. We intend our opposition to abortion and our opposition to nuclear war to be seen as specific applications of this broader attitude. We have also opposed the death penalty because we do not think its use cultivates an attitude of respect for life in society. The purpose of proposing a consistent ethic of life is to argue that success on any one of the issues threatening life requires a concern for the broader attitude in society about respect for human life. The first is contained in ''The Challenge of Peace'' in the connection drawn between Catholic teaching on war and Catholic teaching on abortion. Both, of course, must be seen in light of an attitude of respect for life. The more explicit connection is based on the principle which prohibits the directly intended taking of innocent human life. The principle is at the heart of Catholic teaching on abortion; it is because the fetus is judged to be both human and not an aggressor that Catholic teaching concludes that direct attack on fetal life is always wrong. This is also why we insist that legal protection be given to the unborn. The same principle yields the most stringent, binding and radical conclusion of the pastoral letter: that directly intended attacks on civilian centers is always wrong. The bishops seek to highlight the power of this conclusion by specifying its implications in two ways: first, such attacks would be wrong even if our cities had been hit first; second, anyone asked to execute such attacks should refuse orders. The use of this principle exemplifies the meaning of a consistent ethic of life. The principle which structures both cases, war and abortion, needs to be upheld in both places. It cannot be successfully sustained on one count and simultaneously eroded in a similar situation. Those who defend the right to life of the weakest among us, must be equally visible in support of the quality of life of the powerless among us: the old and the young, the hungry and the homeless, the undocumented immigrant and the unemployed worker. Consistency means we cannot have it both ways: We cannot urge a compassionate society and vigorous public policy to protect the rights of the unborn and then argue that compassion and significant public programs on behalf of the needy undermine the moral fiber of the society or are beyond the proper scope of governmental responsibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TWO RIGHT HANDS FOR THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/us/two-right-hands-for-the-president.html,"Some of the nicknames muttered within the conspiratorial eddies of the White House are plainly unkind: ''The Gnome,'' ''Baby Bigot'' and worse. But the incumbent conservatives so cruelly labeled, the working right- wing Reaganites within a long corridor's reach of their champion in the Oval Office, profess to shake off the slings and arrows of some smirking moderates and to be consumed by an agenda aimed well beyond this Administration and its personalities. ''I think we're just seeing the beginning of it,'' said T. Kenneth Cribb, the 35-year-old assistant counselor to the President, whose tells of conservative roots going back to the seventh grade. He is most often mentioned by other conservatives as an intellectual point man and quiet talent scout in the White House. ''All these talented people who are in their mid-30's now will come back again in the future in more elevated positions,'' Mr. Cribb said, speaking of numerous conservatives cutting their Government teeth in this Administration. 'Most Important Achievement' He and other key conservatives feel that just as the executive talent of the Roosevelt era was recycled well beyond the 1930's, so the conservatives will inherit a large, permanent part of the Washington turf. The Reagan Administration, they say, is their time for being ''credentialed'' in the capital Establishment. ''In my view,'' said Morton C. Blackwell, another conservative in the West Wing, ''the most important achievement of this Administration is the literally hundreds and hundreds of appointees who share the President's philosophy who have been credentialed in Government. For conservatives, this is the great watershed.'' Both Mr. Cribb and Mr. Blackwell, 44, who is a Presidential assistant for liaison with conservative, religious and civic organizations, speak with the feeling of two enduring pilgrims. They say they were first stirred back in the earliest days of reading Russell Kirk's warnings, hearing William F. Buckley Jr.'s prescriptions and acting on Barry Goldwater's breakthrough to the national hustings. They exemplify the two taproots of Administration conservatives. Mr. Cribb is from the movement's intellectual sphere nurtured by such organizations as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which he directed in recent years. Mr. Blackwell, who was the youngest Goldwater delegate at the 1964 convention, took a more muscular approach, organizing student conservatives and eventually becoming director of the College Republican National Committee. The working conservatives of the White House are largely unknown to the public, but very familiar to the one-time cottage industry of conservative polemicists, fund raisers, lobbyists and intellectuals now booming in Washington. Regeneration is quietly unfolding far beyond such front- row conservatives as Edwin Meese 3d, the counselor to the President, or David A. Stockman, the theorist-become-implementer as budget director. They include a busy coterie of a few dozen relatively young officials at or just beyond the White House West Wing, plus the hundreds more that they, in turn, have recruited farther down the hierarchy. ''The first rule is that people are policy,'' said Edwin J. Fuelner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, the movement's prosperous think tank. ''They're all over town,'' he says happily of his colleagues. ''There's no instant gratification; they're here for long haul.'' Privately, members within this group complain about some ''wheel spinners'' and ''goofies'' among the faithful who have landed Administration jobs. But Mr. Blackwell is credited for his hard-politics past with more than zealotry. ''The Perfect is the enemy of the Good,'' is a political maxim attributed to him by another conservative who says, ''Blackwell is into reality.'' Bare-Knuckled Talent Mr. Cribb likewise is credited with a certain bare-knuckled talent within what seems the perpetual moderate- conservative struggle of the Reagan White House. As an adviser to Mr. Meese, he keeps the conservative agenda alive and kicking at the White House, day after day, meeting after meeting, according to his supporters. Some moderates privately groan about him and his relentless concern for parochial school tax credits, public school prayer, abortion controls and other conservative priorities, complaining that they must negotiate compromises and ''escape hatches'' for the President up in the more realistic world of Capitol Hill. Conservatives counter that, whatever the separate squabbles, they have already won on the two dominant issues of large-scale military budgets and deemphasized Federal social spending. Beyond that, they claim a rich and widely dispersed contribution in ''intellectual capital'' to the Federal bureauracy, appointees beyond the stereotype conservative. The latter lately is jokingly summarized by some conservatives critical of their brethren, in the rallying cry: ''Let Reagan Be Viguerie.'' This is a reference to Richard Viguerie, the conservative fund raiser who regularly complains that the Administration gives short shrift to its truest conservative principles. They cite upper-level officials such as Michael J. Horowitz, the neoconservative who is counsel to Mr. Stockman; John S. Herrington, the Reagan loyalist from California whose arrival as White House personnel director soothed conservatives; William J. Bennett, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities; William F. Baxter, assistant Attorney General for antitrust; and John A. Svahn, assistant to the President for policy development, and a dozen others. Mr. Cribb, who said he once knew each one of ''the 200 original'' conservative activists in the country, is pleased to say he cannot keep up with the movement's growth. He waxed nostalgic in describing a recent tableau in which he was escorting his lifelong hero, Russell Kirk, from the White House and they suddenly saw William F. Buckley Jr. arriving at the South Gate, bearing luggage for a quiet weekend stay with the Reagans. ''What better index is there of the change of times?'' Mr. Cribb said he asked Mr. Kirk. ''And there the two of them were,'' said Mr. Cribb, ''greeting each other as fellow confidantes of the President of the United States.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FRAYNAND FARCE GO HAND IN HAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/arts/fraynand-farce-go-hand-in-hand.html,"LONDON  Sometime in the middle of the 1960's, Michael Frayn wrote an article in the British Sunday newspaper The Observer entitled ''Business Worries.'' The business in question was show business, and the worries were those of the audience. Or rather they were those of the actors that communicated themselves to the audience. The key sentence in the essay is, ''All the time one is waiting aghast for some embarrassing disaster to occur.'' Among the disasters itemized by Mr. Frayn are the supposed corpse that can hardly avoid taking visible breaths after perishing in a strenuous sword fight, the pause that may turn out to be pregnant with a forgotten line, and the vital prop that gets lost. Mr. Frayn was not a playwright when he wrote that piece, but he is now. And in ''Business Worries'' may be discerned the promise of ''Noises Off,'' the backstage farce that is currently exhausting its third set of actors in London and that opens tonight on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson. Before being a playwright Mr. Frayn was a novelist and before being a novelist he was a journalist. Before being a journalist he was very young. Born in 1933, he was a student at Cambridge University in the mid- 1950's: a good time for aspiring writers and theater people. His Cambridge days were prefaced by what were then the statutory two years in the army. A linguist, he found himself assigned to a military Russian course, during which he appeared in a production of Gogol's ''The Inspector General.'' He recalls one night on which he attempted to make his prescribed exit: ''I pulled a door which I should have pushed, and stood there while stagehands on the other side fought with crowbars to open it. It broke my nerve.'' He has never appeared on a stage since. But in those moments were sown the earliest seeds of ''Noises Off,'' which is about a production of a play in which everything goes wrong. It concerns a group of actors on tour with a sex-farce called ''Nothing On.'' In Act One we watch a dress rehearsal, even more than usually fraught, of the opening scene. In Act Two we are backstage while the same scene is performed to a matinee audience; we watch the actors rush silently on and off (or off and on), and we glimpse them in silhouette going through the motions of what we have already seen. In Act Three the tour, the play and the actors are on their last legs; all is chaos. The usual theatrical hazards are reinforced by sexual jealousy, drunkenness and lost contact lenses among the cast, and friction between the director and the stage management. Writing it was ''extremely hard work,'' Mr. Frayn said recently. ''I thought my brain would fall out. Long before I'd finished I thought I'd walk off a cliff.'' The director Michael Blakemore, one of the shrewdest craftsmen in the English theater, said frankly that when rehearsals began he didn't know whether it would work or not; it was pretty unprecedented to ask actors to spend a third of their time acting with their backs to the audience. '' 'Noises Off,' '' said Mr. Frayn, ''is about the necessity for keeping a performance going - which is what we all do, though not many people have recognized the play as having a general application.'' Since ''Noises Off'' is a play about people at work, rather than the neat artificial mechanism that usually constitutes farce, there has always been a problem about winding it up. Mr. Frayn says he has lost count of the number of endings he has written. (The original London cast finally rebelled and refused to try any more.) For the pre-Broadway tryout in Washington, and for the new cast in London, he wrote what he describes as ''a quite workable ending.'' Most British critics found the original ending unsatisfying but had laughed so much during the first two acts that they didn't care. Americans who have seen the play in London have had varied reactions. One lady stormed out after the first act, having mistaken a parody of British sex- farce for the thing itself. On the Washington evidence, though, Mr Frayn does not feel that British and American reactions have differed much. Indeed, he said, ''In Washington they laughed more, if possible, than in London. We've only changed one or two words, though we have just discovered that the title (which refers to offstage sound effects) is meaningless in America. They think it's a political slogan, like 'Tories out.' '' The atmosphere of the play is so authentic that one would assume Mr. Frayn to have been soaked in the theater all his life. Actually, he came late to it. Traumatized by the Russian experience, he kept away from plays at Cambridge, though he did develop an interest in revues. ''The first thing I did at Cambridge,'' he recalled with a blush, ''was to buy a dinner jacket'' - dinner jackets being de rigueur for members of the university revue club, the Footlights. He wrote one of their annual shows single-handedly, but after that, he said, ''I turned my back on the theater, except for making fun of it.'' He did this to great effect in many of his columns as a professional journalist. Journalism had been his main extracurricular pursuit as a student, though he had ''distant hopes of being a novelist.'' (As he wrote self-mockingly in another article, ''Is there any other honorable career for an arts graduate?'') In the meantime, he thought of himself as a reporter and got a six-month trial on The Guardian, the national daily newspaper based in the north of England. His six months in the north expanded to two years; The Guardian then moved him to London as a columnist. He had written what he calls ''funny leading articles''; comedy now became his profession. He pursued it thrice weekly on The Guardian from 1960 to 1962, and then, on The Observer, every Sunday from 1962 to 1968. The change was made partly in order to buy time to write books. The Frayn columns have become classics. They were regularly collected into book form in the 60's, and a new retrospective selection has just been published, with an editorial introduction describing the author as ''the funniest journalist of our time'' and one from whom all his British successors have stolen. The essays stand in fact in a very recognizable tradition of English (and American) humor. They deal with social and domestic mishaps and embarrassments; from trying to help your wife cook from impenetrable recipes to pretending you have caught someone's name at a party. What Mr. Frayn added was a gift for characterization. The 1960's were Britain's most fashion-conscious years, and he created the ultimate trendy couple, Christopher and Lavinia Crumble, childless themselves but always willing to pass on to the author the most advanced ideas on how to raise his own brood. The Crumbles, we are given to understand, live in streamlined comfort while the Frayns make do with companionable squalor. And beneath them are their other friends, Horace and Doris Morris, who live in uncompanionable squalor. Times have changed but the types remain recognizable. And Mr. Frayn fused them into a comic system. At Cambridge, he passed from studying languages to Moral Sciences, a subject known in most other places as philosophy. His humor has a wide frame of intellectual reference, from the outlandish to the everyday. He considers the complications of abortion as exemplified by the unborn 16th-century genius Ivan Kudovbin (''He Kudovbin but he wasn't.''). He furnishes a guide to parent care for progressive children (''Parents are just large human beings. They aren't as fragile as they look.''). He writes a long poem, ''The Rime of the Wedding Guest'' (''My intention is that it should be recited, or murmured, simultaneously with the recitation of 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,' as a sort of accompanying ostinato.''). The style is always gentle, always lethal.  Besides, farcical things happen to him. He bears a passing physical resemblance to another British playwright, Peter Nichols, and once sat at a dinner graciously accepting condolences on the closing of a play which Mr. Nichols had written. What made it worse was that his interlocutor was an official of the National Theater, which was staging one of Mr. Frayn's Chekhov translations at the time. I myself remember sitting with him in a noisy restaurant, and saying that my favorite among all his novels was ''Toward the End of the Morning.'' He said that he was interested to hear that, but he could not agree; his own favorite was ''Toward the End of the Morning.'' That novel, which we both enjoyed so much and on whch we were so signally unable to communicate, dealt - very much from Mr. Frayn's own experiences - with life on a quality newspaper. Its characters are a few effortless high-flyers and (in the majority) effortful trudgers, impatient with their wives and doomed never to appear on television. They are, mutatis mutandis, the same kind of people who appear in his journalism and his plays. He is not one of Britain's playwrights of social unhpeaval; he belongs with Alan Ayckbourn, Tom Stoppard and Mr. Nichols: the middle-class ironists. His theatrical career got started in 1970. ''Having come to mock, I stayed to pray,'' he said. The Broadway producer Alexander H. Cohen was then operating in London, and commissioned a two-character sketch from him as part of a program to be called ''Mixed Doubles.'' The sketch was eventually turned down on grounds of taste; it required a baby's diaper to be changed on stage. Mr. Frayn was ''so riled that I determined to write three more short plays to go with it.'' All were duologues, and the four were staged under the title ''The Two of Us.'' The last was a miniature but fully plotted farce in which two actors play all the roles. Mr. Frayn noted that ''the hectic activity looked funnier from behind,'' and this too was stored up for ''Noises Off.'' ''The Two of Us'' got terrible notices but ran nonetheless. Since then Mr. Frayn has had critical and popular success with ''Alphabetical Order'' (set on a local newspaper), ''Clouds'' (set in Cuba), and ''Make and Break'' (set at a sales conference). None of these plays, though, are about their settings. They are about people colliding, competing, seeing things differently: the stuff of philosophy - or of farce. The hero of ''Make and Break,'' a manic worker, is, according to his author, ''an extreme version of someone who needs to consume the world around him - someone like myself. Not only inert material but human beings get consumed.'' But this is not a despairing vision, he insisted: ''It's not bad to be made use of. One of the strengths of life is to feel that one could be of use.'' Just as ''Make and Break'' is not a denunciation but an exploration,'' so ''Noises Off'' is not based, as some critics have suggested, on ''hatred of actors'' but, as Mr. Frayn puts it, on ''admiration for their courage.'' Many writers lose their comic sense as they grow older. Mr Frayn at 50, and in a menacing world, is as funny as ever. But then he has never sold comedy short. ''Comedy is about the grimness of the world,'' he said. ''It's one way of looking at pain and difficulty.''

FAMILY LIFE BELIES ITS BEGINNINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/nyregion/family-life-belies-its-beginnings.html,"The following article is based on reporting by Sandra Gardner, Andrea Lichota, Fredda Sacharow, Carlo M. Sardella and Patricia Squires, and was written by Mrs. Gardner. DESPITE the hue and cry that heralded it, Family Life - or sex education - has settled into New Jersey classrooms with barely a whisper. Although no figures are available, state education officials believe that the program has been or is being implemented in every school district, despite a lack of materials for younger children, despite a lack of training for teachers and despite the reluctance of some teachers and school boards. Pockets of opposition remain, but they are nothing like the organized efforts that preceded adoption of the program. In many classrooms, an initial uneasiness soon dissipated, as it did for the students of Linda Chermark, health and Family Life instructor at Garfield High School in Bergen County. The question-and-answer box in her classroom was full of notes for the first few classes, she said, but ''after the first few weeks, we became very comfortable with each other, trusted each other and they were able to ask these questions in class.'' A major reason for the relative smoothness of the program's start was the nature of the educational mandate itself. ''Mandate'' is a fighting word to New Jersey's home rule advocates. But what the Family Life mandate required was the participation of the community; it left to each school district the course content, the materials to be used and the amount of time to be devoted. In addition, before any Family Life class was taught, parents were to have a copy of the curriculum outline and an excusal form to let them remove their child from those portions of a class they found objectionable. ''One of the nice things about this,'' said Mary Guess Flamer, educational program specialist for the state's Department of Education, ''is that this is the first time parents have been mandated to be included in curriculum development.'' New Jersey is the third jurisdiction in the country to require sex education (the others are Maryland and the District of Columbia). All of the state's 611 districts were directed, starting this year, to teach their own programs in four broad areas: - Emotional, psychological and physical aspects of interpersonal relationships. - Human reproduction and sexuality. - Development of responsible personal behavior. - Establishment of a strong family. Before the administrative code was made final in 1980, only 40 percent of New Jersey's school districts had sex-education programs, according to the State Board of Education. Some of these consisted of little more than a film on menstruation for fifth-grade girls and a high school anatomy class. It was a controversy involving a school that did have a sex-education program that was one of the factors leading to the statewide mandate. Dumont, in Bergen County, had had such a program for 12th-graders since 1970. In 1977, one family sought to have its daughter excused from the birth-control part of the course. However, the local school board refused and the parents took the case to the state board and the Commissioner of Education, then Dr. Fred G. Burke. As a result, state education officials began reviewing sex-education policy, which had last been set in 1967, and decided to call for a statewide mandate. The Dumont case next went to the Appellate Division of Superior Court, which in 1979 dismissed it as moot, since the Family Life mandate was by then in the works, with provisions for community involvement and parental excusal. The Catholic Church, which had filed an amicus curiae brief on the side of the parents, threw its support heavily behind the mandate because of the provisions for parental participation. The bishops in the state issued a pastoral letter in 1981 supporting the mandate and directing parochial schools to implement Family Life education. (On Dec. 1, the Vatican issued a lengthy declaration on sex education that said the schools' role ''should be that of assisting and completing the work of parents, furnishing children and adolescents with an evaluation of sexuality . . .'') Although the Catholic Church in the state supports the mandate, conservative parent and religious groups have opposed it. In May 1982, a suit filed by the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents reached the State Supreme Court, which found 7 to 0 for the state school board. The following November, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the coalition's appeal. Most of the opposition has involved teaching about contraception, abortion, sexual abuse, incest, homosexuality and masturbation. For example, Joseph Remoll, a health instuctor who teaches the Family Life course in Passaic Township, Morris County, said that such topics had ''no lesson plans or teaching techniques and are difficult to teach without morality.'' Morality and the teaching of ethical values are what most worry parents, teachers and school board members. In his new book, ''Raising a Child Conservatively in a Sexually Permissive World,'' Dr. Sol Gordon, director of the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University, says: ''There is, in teaching, a vast difference between being moral and being moralistic. Moral education encourages people to strive toward the accepted ideals of a society and presents facts which facili tate responsible decision-making. This is an important part of any sexuality education curriculum.'' One of the leaders of the opposition, John Tomicki of Ringwood, associate director of the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents, said that the Family Life mandate ''tramples on parental rights'' and that sex education belonged in the home. Mary S. Calderone, an adjunct professor in the human sexuality program in New York University's Department of Health Education, agrees that ''sex education can never take the place of what parents are obligated to do,'' but adds that schools ''have to teach it'' because ''parents haven't been doing a good job.'' ''The facts show it,'' she says. ''Kids say, 'I wish I could talk to my mother and father about this,' but they can't. It's important that it be taught skilfully and well.'' And Nicholas Burke, director of curriculum for the Trenton schools, said that ''a bad introduction (to students) is worse than none at all.'' This - the teachers' ability - may be one of the problems, says Dr. Charity E. Runden, director of the Runden Institute of Marital Counseling and Sex Therapy in Upper Montclair and a consultant to many districts in the implementation of the mandate. ''The teachers want help,'' she said. ''They wish they knew more, and had more training.'' Joan Dreyfuss, coordinator of Family Life education in Dumont, said: ''I don't think our staff - or our parents - are prepared.'' Daniel Watter, an instructor in the Department of Health Science at William Paterson College in Wayne, thinks that the problem lies not so much with teachers as with the intrusion of the community and its censorship. In his course, Family Life and Sex Education: Methods and Curriculum, a graduate-level class, he has instructed about 75 teachers to date. ''Teachers are very much concerned about parental reactions,'' Mr. Watter said. ''They've said: 'I'm afraid if I say something that's objectionable to somebody, I'm going to lose my job.' ''Many teachers say that kids are asking about topics not included in the curriculum because the community didn't think they were appropriate for class discussion. The way they're choosing curriculum is based on the (local curriculum) committee's level of comfort with these topics, and is not necessarily a reflection of what those students want and need to know.'' ''If parents could only realize that kids hunger for information,'' says Madeline Trevor, a teacher at Matawan Regional High School, which serves students from Matawan and Aberdeen. Matawan was one of the districts that had the most opposition to the Family Life program, even though since 1979 it had a sex-education course that included abortion, rape, incest and sex-role conflicts, such as homosexuality, transvestites and transsexuals. ''There were no real problems until 1980, when the mandate came out,'' Mrs. Trevor said. ''Then those parents that had fears came out of the woodwork and said, 'You're teaching sex ed.' '' Like those in many other districts, Matawan educators held meetings with community groups that went on far into the night. The Board of Education, faced with a suit by a parents' organization, twice lifted the curriculum. Finally, Mrs. Trevor recalled, ''the Citizens' Committee went over the curriculum - word by word - until agreement was reached.'' ''They were afraid,'' she said, ''that we were going to say, 'Everyone should have an abortion' or that we were going to make their child into a homosexual.'' In Sayreville, the Family Life Committee came up with two sets of recommendations: a majority and a minority report. The majority wanted contraception, abortion, homosexuality and masturbation included in the curriculum; the minority did not. The school board opted for the minority view, and these topics are excluded from the secondary school curriculum. ''I can certainly understand the board's position,'' said Robert Decker, Sayreville Junior High School vice principal and chairman of the Family Life Committee, ''because when those topics came up, I had the same reaction.'' However, in most school districts - whether or not they had had a sex- education program before one was required - there was not much sustained opposition. Many teachers and other personnel in local districts have been besieging organizations like the New Jersey Network on Family Life - a Rutgers- based resource organization developed by Susan Wilson and Estelle Robinson - and Planned Parenthood for help with materials and speakers. (Mrs. Wilson is a former vice president of the state Board of Education and head of its Family Life Curriculum Committee.) One particularly scarce resource, according to educators, is printed material for young children. In Newark, Planned Parenthood of Essex County staff members say that they cannot keep up with the demands of the high schools for help. Newark has had a 10-year agreement with Planned Parenthood for assistance in school programs. ''As a result of the mandate, we have been overwhelmed with requests from the schools to conduct sessions for teachers and supervisors,'' said Tina Braswell, education director of Planned Parenthood of Essex County. In addition to speaking with teachers, representatives of Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state - as well as chapters of New Jersey Right to Life - are often asked to address students on both sides of the abortion issue. Parents, too, seem eager for information. One group that has been teaching parents - the Bridgewater- based Parent Connection - recently had to turn parents away from a course in East Windsor on ''Helping Your Child Adjust to Puberty.'' And the state's Congress of Parents and Teachers has been holding parent and teacher seminars, teaching them how to talk to youngsters about sex. Glenna W. Gundell of Piscataway, immediate past president of the state P.T.A., said that, to date, the organization had trained parents and teachers in Middlesex, Morris, Union, Bergen, Hudson, Atlantic and Cape May Counties and hoped to cover the state within the year. Although there are still two bills in the Assembly and one in the State Senate seeking to rescind the mandate, it is unlikely that any will reach the floor. Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of Sayreville and Speaker of the Assembly, said last June, when opposition was still strong, that ''after consulting with dozens of experts and interested parties in education, I am satisfied that the Family Life curriculum in our schools is worth continuing.'' ''I have decided not to post a bill that would thwart the Family Life education program,'' he said. So far, there has been no monitoring by the state. ''What administrators and teachers say is going on does not always give an accurate picture of what's being taught and how the curriculum is being implemented,'' Dr. Runden said. ''For instance, someone can say they have a fourth-grade program in Family Life education when all that they're actually doing is showing a film during a one-hour class once a year. That's going on over and over again - definitely - in many school systems.'' Monitoring by the state's Department of Education will take place by the end of the school year, but only up to a point, according to Dr. Walter J. McCarroll, the department's assistant commissioner for county and regional services. ''The monitoring process will establish whether or not a program exists,'' he said. ''We won't be issuing a 'report card' as to whether it's good, bad or indifferent.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN AND THE CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/magazine/l-women-and-the-church-100591.html,"-- I am not surprised to read of indifference among younger women as a result of the church's inherent sexism. This attitude of the church toward its female members is just another obstacle young Catholic women face along with the basic problem of simply reconciling modern life with traditional beliefs. To be a ''1980's'' woman - aggressive and self-promoting - is clearly at odds with the revered Christian qualities of humility and self-denial. Issues now accepted as commonplace - indeed, as necessary and desirable - such as birth control, abortion, divorce - are still grave moral dilemmas for Catholic women, and a lot of us have chosen to ignore the teachings of the church in order to pursue our lives as we see fit. Yet it's hard, painful, to turn away from a faith that is perhaps as inextricably a part of one as family or ethnic ties. It seems to me that the church offers little sympathy or comfort for the spiritual struggles of its younger, female members.

"NOW, IN FIRST ENDORSEMENT, BACKS MONDALE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/us/now-in-first-endorsement-backs-mondale.html,"Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale today won the endorsement of the National Organization for Women, the nation's largest feminist group. It was the first Presidential endorsement in the group's 17-year history. Officials of the 250,000-member organization said the endorsement followed intense lobbying by supporters of Mr. Mondale, a Minnesota Democrat, as well as those of three other Democrats seeking the Presidential nomination, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, Senator Alan Cranston of California and the Rev. Jesse Jackson of Chicago, the civil rights activist. In its final endorsement, the organization's 37-member board voted 32 to 5 to endorse Mr. Mondale, Meanwhile, in Mobile, Ala., the state's largest black Democratic organization voted to endorse Mr. Mondale for President and backed Mr. Jackson as his running mate. Some of Mr. Jackson's supporters denounced the action. (Page 38.) The results of the NOW vote were announced by Judy Goldsmith, the group's president, at a news conference after the board met. Officials said Mr. Cranston was the runner-up. Mrs. Goldsmith said, ''This is absolutely not a rejection of Jesse Jackson's campaign or any other campaign. We had several good candidates. Reverend Jackson is one of those. ''But,'' she added, ''we also felt it essential to make the strongest possible statement for the one candidate we felt could, indeed, do the best for women and defeat Ronald Reagan.'' Reacting to the endorsement Betty Friedan, a founder of NOW and its first president, said: ''This is enormously important, because NOW is the flagship of the women's movement.'' Mrs. Friedan, who endorsed Mr. Mondale last month, said, ''This is a signal that women must mobilize to beat Reagan.'' Donna Brazile, a key aide to Mr. Jackson, said: ''It is not a defeat. We have been in the race for about two minutes.'' She said she believed that although Mr. Jackson had considerable private support, he failed to get board votes because he was not deemed ''electable.'' ''They believe that Mondale is electable,'' she said. ''We believe Jesse's just as electable as Mondale.'' The group's support added to a string of endorsements picked up in recent months by Mr. Mondale. He has been backed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the National Education Assocation and a wide range of prominent Democratic politicians. Mrs. Goldsmith's announcement followed a closed meeting at the Washington Hilton Hotel of NOW's board, most of whose members are elected regionally. During the meeting, reporters at times overheard arguments in favor of Mr. Cranston and Mr. Jackson. A nonbinding vote earlier today by the board was 23 for Mr. Mondale and 11 for Mr. Cranston, with three abstentions. In recent days the tensions within the organization have intensified as supporters of Mr. Jackson, the only black Presidential candidate, argued that an endorsement of Mr. Mondale would provoke a major split between black and feminist interests. Mr. Jackson has promised to select a woman to run for Vice President on his ticket. The group's first Presidential endorsement underscores polling data showing that women who are registered to vote are increasingly preferring Democrats over Republicans. The pattern has become more pronounced during President Reagan's incumbency and has stirred concern among Republicans. Beyond this, organization officials and aides to Mr. Mondale say the organization's endorsement holds symbolic as well as practical value for a candidate seeking to take advantage of the gap between the sexes in political preferences. Leaders say that as the largest feminist organization in the nation, NOW has gained credibility and leverage among numerous women who are not necessarily members but adhere to its aims of economic and social equality. The group has played a central role in spurring legislation and lobbying state legislatures and Congress in behalf of various measures, including the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution, the right of women to seek abortions, child care, food programs for needy families, vocational and educational training for women, and measures to strengthen legislation against job and pay discrimination. After a 10-year fight for ratification, the proposed equal rights amendment, which Mr. Reagan opposes, remains stalled in Congress. Mrs. Goldsmith said before the board meeting that the group had decided to break a tradition, that of staying out of partisan politics, so it could seek the defeat of Mr. Reagan. ''If Ronald Reagan were not in the White House - if it were, say, Gerald Ford - we would not be endorsing a candidate,'' said Mrs. Goldsmith. ''Our priority for '84 is to beat Reagan.'' She said the Reagan Administration had ''damaged women through erosion of legislation that has protected us against discrimination'' in jobs and education. Mrs. Goldsmith also cited the Administration's budget cuts involving vocational training, nutritional programs, school lunches and other measures. She said the organization's endorsement would mean a full-fledged volunteer effort of ''thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people'' working to defeat Mr. Reagan, if he runs for re-election. ''We won our campaign stripes on the E.R.A. battlefield,'' she added. ''In the process we have become very good organizers.'' Nikki Heiderpriem, a Washington lawyer who handles women's issues for Mr. Mondale, said after today's vote, ''We think NOW support will be enormously important in defeating Ronald Reagan.'' In making its choice, the executive board took into account not only each candidate's views on the proposed amendment, abortion and other issues, but also the status of women on the candidate's staff and the candidate's ''electability.'' The electability argument was pressed hard by Mondale supporters Of Mr. Mondale's five deputy campaign managers, two are women: Maxine Isaacs, his press secretary, and Rebecca McGowan, the candidate's executive assistant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ROMAN CATHOLIC CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING AGAINST NUCLEAR ARMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/16/nyregion/roman-catholic-consciousness-raising-against-nuclear-arms.html,"In the rectory of St. Paul's Church in East Harlem yesterday, Sister Joan Hart took another step toward bringing the Roman Catholic bishops' recent pastoral letter against nuclear arms to the attention of priests working in the field. Sister Hart, who has carried out similar missions in dozens of parishes in the archdiocese since late fall, talked about the letter to nine priests from parishes in the area. Then she asked what she could do, as the head of the archdiocesan office of justice and peace, to help them raise the issue with their parishioners. The priests said the task was difficult in East Harlem because the agonies of daily life often made cosmic issues such as war and peace seem irrelevant. 'Living in the Ruins' ''The bomb has already gone off,'' said the Rev. Ray Byrne, the host pastor. ''Money has been drained away from the poor to build nuclear missiles. We're living in the ruins.'' The Rev. John Mellitt of Our Lady Queen of Angels said the goal was to ''use the issue of nuclear war to tie into the needs of the poor.'' Sister Hart, like scores of church leaders across the country, has joined in in a vigorous effort to educate Catholics on the contents of the 150- page letter, which rejects nuclear war, calls for a nuclear freeze and allows for nuclear deterrence only as a temporary measure along the road to disarmament. Since the letter was approved in May, church leaders say, it has spurred more interest, debate and discussion than any other statement issued by the bishops. More than a million copies have been distributed, and the church's publishing house in Washington is turning out the fifth printing of the letter. A Spanish translation is expected to be ready this week. The bishops have named a follow- up committee headed by Bishop George Fulcher of Columbus, Ohio. But the dioceses have largely been left free to develop their own programs to respond to local needs. Officials say some areas have done more than others, but all share a determination to keep the issue alive. The Rev. Brian McCollough, who directs a national clearinghouse that monitors those activities for the bishops, said the response to the document was even greater than church leaders had expected. As an example, he said, a daylong gathering on the letter last Saturday in Peoria, Ill., morning drew 600 people. An 'Unprecedented' Impact ''The impact has been unprecedented,'' Father McCollough said. ''The interest is coming from all areas of the church. It didn't get caught in one area, such as the college community. We're at the six-month point since the publication of the letter and things are still pretty intense.'' Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, who was chairman of the bishops' committee that wrote the document, told a Fordham University audience last week that the efforts were off to a good start because of the initiative taken by individual dioceses. He said the process of fully reaching parishes with a hierarchical statement usually took three years. In his address at Fordham, Cardinal Bernardin indicated how the bishops intended to capitalize on the unusual amount of attention stirred by the pastoral letter. The Cardinal proposed a wider campaign that would expand the ''respect for life'' theme of the letter to other issues such as capital punishment and abortion. As Catholics evaluate the letter, church leaders say, a variety of opinions have emerged on specific aspects of it. The most debated points, many church officials say, are the call for a nuclear freeze and the skeptical view of deterrence as a morally justifiable strategy. Misgivings in St. Louis ''Generally, we've had a good response,'' said Sister Kathleen Crowley, who is active on the issue in the St. Louis Archdiocese, where there has been considerable criticism. ''Some of the people who are questioning the letter are willing, I think, to concede that the church is a place where questions such as this should be asked.'' Enthusiasm for the letter has spawned activities and articles throughout the American church. Many dioceses, including New York, have urged priests to emphasize the letter in homilies and special services during the present season of Advent, when the theme of peace permeates the Christian celebration of the birth of Christ. Terence Cardinal Cooke took the lead in New York last spring by reviewing the document with his priests. Two months ago, the justice and peace office held a training session for 200 clergymen and lay people in ways of applying the pastoral letter to their own parishes. A Parley in New York By late November, the archdiocese had distributed a packet containing assorted material suitable for use during Advent, including outlines for homilies and suggestions on how the subject could become the focus of retreats and study groups. New York was also the site of a major national conference for 300 Catholic educators on means of integrating the document into school material. Some dioceses, such as Chicago, have been in the vanguard of efforts to provide curriculum guidelines. A growing supply of pamphlets books, tape recordings and films relating to the topic are being stocked by dioceses and parishes. The Washington clearinghouse has compiled a 12-page compendium of resources already available. Hundreds of leaders are being sought to educate Catholic parishioners and stimulate dialogue over the pastoral letter's conclusion. In January, a month in which many dioceses plan to underscore the issue of peace, the church has scheduled a national training conference to supplement similar programs at the local level. Other efforts are expected at the annual meeting of the National Catholic Educational Association in March, which will spotlight the pastoral letter. The current issue of the association magazine Momentum is completely given over to the subject. An Active Diocese Some dioceses have long been active on the peace issue. In Boston, for example, the archdiocese has formed Parish Education for Peace teams made up of lay people, clergymen, professors from the area and nuns. A typical two-hour visit to a parish by a ''Pep'' team would include a summary account of the letter, and a discussion of the effects of the arms race on business, the economy and the third world. As the message of the letter filters down, some leaders say it presents a formidable challenge. ''I don't know of anything more difficult to get across to our people,'' said Bishop William E. McMannus of the South Bend-Fort Wayne Diocese in Indiana. ''The reason it's so hard is that many people are very close to paranoid about the Soviet Union. And I can't blame them.'' A Common Problem A common problem, church officials say, is that some Catholics mistakenly believe that the pastoral letter calls for unilateral disarmament by the United States. For that reason, some material intended to help priests preach on the subject stresses the need to emphasize that the pastoral letter explicitly rejects that idea, and calls for a negotiated disarmament by both the United States and the Soviet Union. In Seattle, where Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen has been an outspoken opponent of the arms race, the topic of war and peace has been studied by the parishes for two years. ''People in Seattle are extremely aware that Christian values bear on the nuclear issue,'' said Don Hopps, director of the archdiocesan justice and peace center. Alluding to the large military industry in the area, he continued: ''The nuclear issue hits people in the pocketbook here. The issues have been debated here for some time, so the positions of lay people on the pastoral letter tend to be more polarized in Seattle than in many places.'' Many Catholics say the airing of differences is healthy for the church. ''People come down in their conclusions at all different spots,'' said Christine Doby, a member of the justice and peace office of the Archdiocese of Detroit, a center of much activity on the issue. ''But the Catholic Church is kind of used to that diversity. Especially since the Second Vatican Council, we've gotten very used to diversity.'' Although sheer numbers create difficulties in some dioceses, that has not been a problem for Bishop Michael H. Kenny of of Juneau. In his sprawling diocese in southeastern Alaska, there are 5,000 Catholics and 9 parishes. The Bishop, who personally rejects even limited nuclear deterrence, has delivered talks to his priests and informed others through the diocesan newsletter. The one complaint he has received, he says, is that the pastoral letter ''doesn't go far enough.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE PANEL'S STUDY OF SHOREHAM ATOM PLANT ENDS IN WIDE DISAGREEMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/19/nyregion/state-panel-s-study-of-shoreham-atom-plant-ends-in-wide-disagreement.html,"Exerpts from report, page B8. Members of Governor Cuomo's commission on the Shoreham nuclear power plant agree that it was a mistake to build the reactor, but after six months of hearings and deliberations, there appears to be agreement on very little else. The commission's 13 members now disagree even on what their chairman, Dr. John H. Marburger 3d, says they agreed to when they drafted their report to Mr. Cuomo - such things as whether the Long Island Lighting Company, the owner of the reactor, is prepared to run it and whether it would pay to open the plant. The 300-page report, formally released last Wednesday, provided no recommendations to the Governor. It gave no final assessment of the major issue: whether the nearly completed reactor should be abandoned or put into service. The Shoreham plant is now 1,000 percent over budget and 10 years behind schedule, and a dispute over whether the area around the plant could be evacuated in the event of a nuclear accident could prevent its opening. The plant's owner, Lilco, says such a plan is possible, and it is working on its own evacuation plan. The government of Suffolk County, in which the plant is situated, says such a plan is not feasible. Dr. Marburger said in a cover letter to the Governor that one of the group's findings was that ''no single policy can be derived unambiguously from the raw facts of the situation.'' The views of individual panel members - in separate ''clarifications'' in the report - provided a product that Dr. Marburger called ''rather inhomogeneous,'' a condition he described as ''characteristic of the public attitute toward nuclear power. These additional comments ranged from interpretations of economic trends to an essay on the role of nuclear power in a democracy. The report was broken into two parts. The first contained answers to nine questions asked by the Governor; the second was 10 ''general conclusions'' that Dr. Marburger and some members of the panel said represented a consensus. However, in addition to disagreements over whether the ''general conclusions'' actually expressed a majority view, six members of the commission, some favoring the plant and some opposed to it, concluded that the answers to the Governor's questions in the report were too weakly worded. They appended to the report their own answers, taking far stronger stands. Some members disagreed strongly on what was described as the consensus view. ''I feel betrayed by the way it came out,'' one panel member, Alfred E. Kahn, an economist and former chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission, said in an interview. Another member, Dr. Paul Alan Marks, president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said at a news conference at which the report was released: ''I don't feel my views were given an opportunity. I feel very, very badly to be placed in this position.'' At the same news conference, yet another member, Dr. William J. Ronan, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said, ''I don't think the Governor is well served by something that alleges to be a general conclusion of a majority, when it isn't.'' Dr. Marburger, however, said in an interview that a majority of those present at two key meetings at which the ''general conclusions'' were negotiated had agreed with all points. In addition, according to other members, some members were present for only a few hours of the full-day meetings. The makeup of the majority differed from conclusion to conclusion, Dr. Marburger said. ''It was gone over word for word for word,'' Marge Harrison, a panel member and an anti-Shoreham activist, said in an interview. ''There was no indication that this kind of divisiveness was going to take place.'' How ever, she added, some panel members who later objected were not present at the key meetings. ''There was not as consistent participation by those who repudiated'' the report she said. ''It indicates to me that they didn't realize how serious the situation was.'' For example, she said, at one of the two critical meetings at which ''general conclusions'' were negotiated, Mr. Kahn was absent and Dr. Ronan ''left midway, before lunch - he said he had to pick someone up at the airport.'' Mr. Kahn has a different view. ''There never was an opportunity to discover whether that really did represent the views of a consensus of the committee,'' he said. Mr. Kahn, who lives upstate, said he had made plans to attend all the meetings but was not able to go to the one critical meeting because it had been rescheduled on short notice. Most of the meetings were on Long Island. ''We never had an opportunity to discuss these things,'' he said, and he attributed that in part to ''the people who opposed the plant from the outset, evidently brought up on a very strong diet of Perry Mason, who blanketed the discussion.'' 'Issues Without Intersection' Another member, Karen Burstein, the former chairman of the State Consumer Protection Board and now head of the State Civil Service Commission, argued that achieving any kind of consensus was difficult, given the differing viewpoints that members started with. ''These are issues without intersection, like abortion or the death penalty,'' she said. ''A group of people finds nuclear power as absolutely unacceptable; another group finds it not only acceptable but preferable. Those two groups can't talk to each other.'' Following are the other members of the commission: Dr. David Axelrod, State Health Commissioner. Leon J. Campo, executive assistant for finance of the East Meadow, L.I., public schools. William J. Dircks, executive director for nuclear operations of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Dr. Herbert J. Kouts, chairman of the department of nuclear energy of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. David McLoughlin, deputy associate director in charge of state and local programs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. David J. Willmott, publisher of The Suffolk Life weekly newspaper.

"AT MIDPOINT IN HIS SENATE TERM, D'AMATO TAKES STOCK",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/nyregion/at-midpoint-in-his-senate-term-d-amato-takes-stock.html,"Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, has reached the midpoint of his first term. He has gained a reputation for dealing with such local issues as transit, housing and Federal grants to communities. His chief committee assignments are Appropriations and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The winner of a strenuous three-way race in 1980, Mr. D'Amato, who ran on the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life lines, was formerly Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead, L.I. During an interview recently at his office in Manhattan, Mr. D'Amato discussed his first three years in the Senate. He spoke of switching his vote to favor the production of nerve gas, causing a tie broken this year by Vice President Bush. and a measure he sponsored that cut off nonmilitary aid to Syria. He also said he opposed the Reagan Administration's intervention in the case of Baby Jane Doe, a Long Island infant with serious birth defects whose parents have ruled out corrective surgery. Q. This state has been hit hard by the Administration's domestic budget cuts. How do you think you have succeeded in preventing the worst of those, if indeed you have? A. I think I've been a moderating influence. I'm a moderate conservative. I'm not going to be straitjacketed by some kind of ideological philosophy which puts me in one camp or the other. I don't believe that's the role of a senator. I have been supportive of the President, more so than most Republicans in the Northeast. But guaranteed student loans - there is a perfect example. I fought against cutting off guaranteed student loans, because I think it would be a disaster to working middle-class families. But at the same token, let's make sure people pay back those loans. I think, 'Correct the abuse, don't kill the program.' I think it's a matter of fine tuning. Q. You supported President Reagan in 1981 81 percent of the time on key votes and in 1982 72 percent of the time. This is considerably higher support than say Senators Heinz or Specter from Pennsylvania or even Senator Goldwater. Will you continue to moderate your support? A. No, no. I look at the issues. Mass transportation means jobs. If people can't get to work, then we're going to lose the whole region. When it comes to a situation like that, I will fight for those needs. When I can give the President support, I will attempt to do that. I will give the benefit of the doubt. I think that has paid dividends. The fact we were able to get the Surface Action Group to come in here - the battleship Iowa and six other ships, I believe to a certain extent, has something to do with the relationship I have with the White House. If I were never to give the benefit of the doubt to the Administration and always too my own perspective, I would be a rather ineffective Senator. Q. You first voted against nerve gas and then changed your vote in favor of production in line with the Administration's position. Was this an example of giving benefit of the doubt? A. The nerve-gas vote was a deeply painful matter to me, because I don't like the idea of having to appropriate huge sums of money for that kind of instrument of death. But we are in the real world. If we had not had the nerve gas during World War II - had Churchill and F.D.R. not said to Hitler, 'If you use it, we will use it' - we would not have been able to keep the madman from doing it. I think we obviously have to have them as long as the Soviets do. The best position would be to call a conference and say, 'Let's destroy them.' Q. There have been instances - on such issues as Lebanon, former Secretary Watt and the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mrs. Burford, where where you have been early and sharp in criticizing the Adminstration. A. And I've almost always been right, too. Think about it. I said they should have let Israel finish the job in Lebanon. I criti- cized Weinberger for his policies. It's all borne me out right. I said we should have cut off aid to Syria. I'm not supposed to know anything about the international scene, but maybe sometimes a little down-home practicality is a little bit better than the dreaming of some of the planners in the State Department have engaged in. For them to really think because we were going to give the Syrians $242 million in taxpayers' money that we were going to get them to back off, I couldn't believe it. My point is, you don't make strategic allies based on these kinds of things. You don't bribe people. The Syrians must have said, 'Look at this, the United States is fearful of us.' Q. You did fairly poorly among Jewish voters in your 1980 election except, perhaps, on Long Island. A. No, terrible there. Q. You seem to have made great amends. You have spent a great deal of time going to the Jewish community to make clear who you are. A. No, I have not made amends. No, I have never changed. I think it's a question of perception. They know what I stand for. They know I don't pussyfoot about. By the way, I think some of the things Israel has done have been magnificent. Are they supposed to wait for the Iraqis to get the nuclear reactor going? I supported them because they did the right thing in knocking it out. Can you imagine having those crazy people over there with atomic weapons? It is in our interest to understand who are our allies, who our friends are and not work up some mythical alliances. Q. Do you agree with Reagan Administration's actions in the Baby Doe case? A. No. I think Judge Wexler was right - someone who I appointed - the President appointed him, but I recommended him. The judge was right. He looked at the file, he was satisified. I support Judge Wexler's position. Q. You were elected wtih the help of the Conservative and Right to Life Parties. How comfortable are you voting on abortion and school prayer in the Senate? A. School prayer - I've always been an advocate for that and still am. Abortion - I'm concerned for the right of the unborn. I understand there are those free-choice people who have a different feeling. I couldn't see myself using taxpayer dollars for elective abortion. But I'm not a champion for this cause. I don't think I'm elected just to carry the banner in that area. I do think the government has the obligation in assisting youngsters in preventing unwanted pregnancies and giving them educational opportunities to deal with that. Q. The Republican Senate Campaign Committee took a poll at your request in July. It showed that your popularity had risen and your negative ratings had fallen. Can you tell us more about what it said? A. Moving in the right direction. The ratio between the approval and disapproval has never been stronger; it's better than 4 to 1. It indicated that many of the doubts that people had have gone. You talk about the Jewish community, the business community. People have a right to say: 'Look, here is a person from a local government background. Will they be able to function in Washington? Will they be able to meet the challenges, whether it be banking, or the international, or the Middle East.' I think people, including my colleagues in government, in the Administration, had a different perception prior to my coming there. It has taken time, rightfully so. People have to know whether you are serious and conscientious. And you also have to be able to take defeats, too. Q. Your defeats? A. Some minor setbacks. I didn't get my prison bill through yet, where we said the Federal Government would reimburse the states for the illegal aliens we now incarcerate. The drug epidemic is the major priority that we have failed to address. In all the money I have fought to bring in for mass transportation - and I've done it and done it successfully - then if people are afraid to use those systems in the off-peak hours, that system is going to continue to deteriorate. Q. A recent Gallup poll shows the President is not in great shape in New York State. He is in worse shape here than in Ohio. You will be chairing his re-election campaign in New York. What are the odds of winning New York? A. I think it's going to be 50-50. It's going to be the same question that the President put to the people when he ran, 'Are you better off today than you were three years ago?' If the economy continues to improve, the President can carry New York. Recognize we have some deep- seated unemployment problems that go beyound any President or any Adminsitration. Q. Have you changed much since you went to Washington? A. Oh, yeah., Maybe the feeling of more confidence. You come into the banking areas, securities areas, whole new areas. Look at the area of housing. There is an area where I took on a different dimension. In a test-tube case, you say you're better off not to have any rent controls. But we're not in a test tube. So I come in to the Congress, and say, 'We'll have vacancy decontrol,' and a furor develops. So I look into it, and the Mayor calls me, and he says, 'You ought to look into this thing.' You learn. I made a mistake on that. Q. You have voted for every defense appropration bill. Why? A. Those are prudent votes. One of the things we did was to cut the defense increases on our subcommittee by 50 percent. It was Cap Weinberger asking for 10 percent increases. We reduced the expenditures to the levels that most of us campaigned on. I campaigned for a real growth of 5 percent. I have supported a real growth of 5 percent for modernization not only for strategic, but for conventional weapons and for communications. At the same time, I have been absolutely outspoken and worked to correct the abuses in terms of purchasings and awarding of contracts. It's money that could be used in other programs or to reduce the deficit, which is absolutely critical. And secondly, it defeats the consensus that came about to say we need a stronger military. Q. The Senate was a strange place to you when you got there. Is it easier to work there than you expected? A. I will say it was intimidating. I chose not to make great big speeches, because I didn't feel confident. I wanted to try and become more comfortable in my surroundings. I like the business of the Congress. I don't like the social aspects of Washington as such. I think they're kind of plastic. I'm more at home with my people and whatnot in New York. Q. Is there too much decorum in the Senate? A. I don't think so. We can get pretty feisty down there. You've heard me. I think I'm good for them; I think I give them a different perspective - a little more fire, when I get rolling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIRTH CONTROL: STERILIZING RELIED ON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/21/garden/birth-control-sterilizing-relied-on.html,"Voluntary sterilization is the most widely used method of birth control in the United States, according to a study released this week by Ms. magazine. The study was conducted by the Alan Guttmacher Institute and published in a pamphlet called ''Making Choices.'' The study indicates that one-third or 11.6 million of the 36.5 million fertile women in the country rely on sterilization to prevent pregnancy. The institute based its finding on a study of 6,790 women ages 18 to 44, Ms. said. The number of women who themselves are sterilized is 6.8 million, while the others rely on partners who are among the 4.9 million sterilized men. More than half of the women favoring sterilization are 35 years of age or older and have incomes under $6,000, the study showed. The second most widely used method of birth control is the pill, with 10 million users, the study says. It has a 2 percent failure rate. Eighty- two percent of the pill users are under 30, the study said, and its use is more prevalent among black women than white women. A partner's use of the condom is the method relied on by 4.5 million women, though its failure rate is 10 percent, the study shows. The IUD, the intrauterine device, is favored by 2.3 million women. It has a failure rate of 4 percent. The diaphragm is used by 1.9 million people, the study shows. It is preferred by women in the higher income brackets. Its failure rate is 13 percent. Foams and spermicides are the method of choice for 1.5 million women. These over-the-counter preparations have a failure rate of 15 percent. The report said 930,000 women use withdrawal and 553,000 rely on the rhythm method. Three million women, or 6 percent, do not use any form of birth control, according to the study. It is estimated that 18 percent of American women between the ages of 18 and 44 have had legal abortions since 1967.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MRS. FERRARO FOR VICE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/23/us/mrs-ferraro-for-vice-president.html,"Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro is having the political time of her life. Will the Democratic Presidential nominee choose the Queens Democrat as his running mate? There is some speculation he might. If the Democrats win back the Presidency, would Mrs. Ferraro end up in the Cabinet? Possibly, say some party leaders. Will she run for the Democratic nomination in New York for the United States Senate in 1986 in an attempt to defeat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican? She is receiving some encouragement to try it. Will the chairman of the Democratic National Committee select her as chairman of the party's platform committee for the 1984 convention, a key position? There's some talk along that line, and she has asked for the job. Mrs. Ferraro, a member of Congress since 1978, has achieved considerable prominence on Capitol Hill, resolutely working her way into the power structure. But lately there has been a good deal of talk about what role she might play in national and Democratic politics beyond the halls of the House. Pondering the Possibility Whenever the question of whether the Democrats should or would consider a woman for the Vice Presidential slot has come up recently, Mrs. Ferraro has been on just about every short list of possible candidates. Flying to St. Louis recently for a meeting called by Congressional Democrats to figure out what the party's general policies should be for next year, Mrs. Ferraro pondered the possibility. ''If one of the candidates were to say, 'I definitely need a woman now,' '' she mused, ''I would say, 'How do you know?' If they were to tell me, come July, 'I need a woman to win,' I would consider it. Yes, I think they're serious about a woman Vice President.'' Mrs. Ferraro says that a woman on the ticket would bring women to the polls and thus help the Democratic Party achieve victory. ''They could make the difference,'' she said. The 48-year-old Mrs. Ferraro, whose Italian heritage and image as an amiable, moderate politician are thought to make her an added asset for the Democrats, revels in the game of politics. The visibility she has attained from the talk of a Vice Presidential candidacy has also added to the speculation that she might take on Senator D'Amato. ''I have promises from around the country for money if I run,'' she said. A Meeting With the Chairman Or, says Ann F. Lewis, the political director of the Democratic National Committee, Mrs. Ferraro might instead end up as a Cabinet secretary if there is a Democratic White House after 1984. ''Geraldine has shown a combination of leadership, advocacy and political smarts that make her a likely contender for a major role in a Democratic administration,'' said Mrs. Lewis. As for a key role at the 1984 Democratic convention, Mrs. Ferraro met recently with the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Charles T. Manatt, to present her case that he should select her to head the party's platform committee. In preparation, she has read the minutes of the 1980 platform proceedings. Mrs. Ferraro, often contrasted with other women in Congress for her pragmatism and ability to seem ''nonthreatening'' to her male counterparts, arrived in the capital as an unknown political quantity. A former prosecutor in the Queens District Attorney's office, she won office in the traditionally Democratic, but fairly conservative seat long held by James J. Delaney. The district includes Astoria, Long Island City, Jackson Heights and the more affluent Forest Hills Gardens, where Mrs. Ferraro lives with her husband, John Zaccaro, who is in real estate, and their three children. It was made famous by the television series ''All in the Family.'' Archie Bunker lived there and voiced the prejudices of many of its voters. Eighty four percent of the district is white, many of them elderly first and second generation European immigrants. Mrs. Ferraro, who uses ''Mrs.'' with her maiden name,learned the politics of Capitol Hill quickly, although some of her detractors say she skims issues rather than treating them substantively. By 1980, she concluded that her positions on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the Public Works and Transportation Committee would not get her far within the hierarchy of the House. So she ran for and won the job of Secretary of the Democratic Caucus and also became a member of the Policy and Steering Committee, positions that have made her a member of the Democratic leadership. Focus on Economic Issues Her access and influence in the House has been bolstered by her friendship with Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. ''Tip is a person I confide in a lot,'' she said. ''We have a personal relationship. The men in my district are just like him.'' With the Speaker's help this year, she relinquished the less important Post Office Committee and won a seat on the Budget Committee. Legislatively, Mrs. Ferraro has concentrated most of her energies on economic issues that particularly affect women. She is a force behind the Economic Equity Act, a bipartisan package designed to address the economic problems of homemakers and women who work outside the home, and worked with the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues to draft two of the 12 bills in the act. As a woman and a devout Roman Catholic, she says, she has found abortion to be the most difficult public issue she has encountered. ''I don't believe in abortion,'' she said, ''but I can't impose my belief.'' On foreign affairs and military policy, she concedes that, so far, her knowledge is sparse. Should she move further into national politics, this shortcoming could hurt. In the meantime, she reports, the attention she has attracted from the talk of a possible Vice Presidential candidacy has only one drawback, the questions. ''One reporter, a woman, asked me how people would react to having a bleached blonde as Vice President,'' she said. ''I said there would be about as much discussion of it as the fact that Ronald Reagan dyes his hair.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
